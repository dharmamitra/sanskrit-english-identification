They wont dwell under the same roof with me Theyll dwell under a roof separate from me
They wontin line with senioritybow down to me stand up to greet me salute me with hands placed palmtopalm over the heart or perform forms of respect due to superiors to me From that cause there would be arguing quarreling clashes and disputes in the Saṅgha a split in the Saṅgha a crack in the Saṅgha a falling apart in the Saṅgha a separation in the Saṅgha A monk who sees the seriousness of a split should confess an offense even out of conviction in others
Then the Blessed One having explained the matter to the followers of the suspended monk got up from his seat and left
At that time the followers of the suspended monk were performing the Uposatha and Saṅgha transactions right there inside the territory
while the monks who suspended were performing the Uposatha and Saṅgha transactions having gone outside the territory
Then a certain one of the monks who had suspended went to the Blessed One bowed down and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord the followers of the suspended monk are performing the Uposatha and Saṅgha transactions right there inside the territory
while we monks who suspended are performing the Uposatha and Saṅgha transactions having gone outside the territory
If the followers of the suspended monk perform the Uposatha do a Saṅgha transaction in that very same territory in accordance with the motion and announcement formulated by me those transactions of theirs are in accordance with the Dhamma irreversible and fit to stand
If you the monks who suspended perform the Uposatha do a Saṅgha transaction in that very same territory in accordance with the motion and announcement formulated by me those transactions of yours are in accordance with the Dhamma irreversible and fit to stand
Why is that
Those monks belong to a separate affiliation from you and you belong to a separate affiliation from them
There are these two grounds for being of a separate affiliation Oneself makes oneself of a separate affiliation or a united Saṅgha suspends one for not seeing  for not making amends  or for not relinquishing 
These are the two grounds for being of a separate affiliation
There are these two grounds for being of common affiliation Oneself makes oneself of a common affiliation or a united Saṅgha restores one who has been suspended for not seeing  for not making amends  or for not relinquishing 
These are the two grounds for being of common affiliation
And at that time the monks were arguing quarreling and disputing in the mealhall and in the village They were showing inappropriate bodily and verbal actions toward each otherseizing one another with the hands
People criticized and complained and spread it about How can the Sakyan contemplatives argue quarrel and dispute in the mealhall and in the village and show inappropriate bodily and verbal actions toward each otherseizing one another with the hands
The monks heard the people criticizing complaining and spreading it about
Those monks who were modest  criticized and complained and spread it about How can the monks argue quarrel and dispute in the mealhall and in the village and show inappropriate bodily and verbal actions toward each otherseizing one another with the hands
Then the monks reported the matter to the Blessed One Is it true monks that you argue quarrel and dispute in the mealhall and in the village And show inappropriate bodily and verbal actions toward each otherseizing one another with the hands
Its true O Blessed One
The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked them  Having rebuked them he gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks When the Saṅgha is split and getting along in an uncourteous way not in accordance with the Dhamma then one should sit down in a seat to the extent that We wont exhibit any improper bodily action or verbal action to one another we wont seize one another with the hands
When the Saṅgha is split and getting along in a courteous way in accordance with the Dhamma one may sit down leaving the interval of a seat 
And at that time the monks were quarreling arguing and disputing in the midst of the Saṅgha wounding each other with verbal daggers
They couldnt resolve the issue
Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One bowed down and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord now the monks are quarreling arguing and disputing in the midst of the Saṅgha
wounding each other with verbal daggers
It would be good if the Blessed One could go to them out of sympathy
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then the Blessed One went to the monks and sat down on a seat made ready Having sat down he said to the monks Enough monks Dont quarrel Dont argue Dont make strife Dont dispute
When that was said a certain nonDhammadeclaring monk said to the Blessed One Wait Lord Blessed One May the Master of the Dhamma dwell at ease devoted to a pleasant abiding in the hereandnow Lord Blessed One
We will be the ones who deal with this argument quarrel strife and dispute
A second time the Blessed One said to the monks Enough monks Dont argue Dont quarrel Dont make strife Dont dispute
A second time the nonDhammadeclaring monk said to the Blessed One Wait Lord Blessed One
May the Master of the Dhamma dwell at ease devoted to a pleasant abiding in the hereandnow Lord Blessed Onex We will be the ones who deal with this argument quarrel strife and dispute
The Discussion of the Quarrel at Kosambī is finished
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Once monks in Bārāṇasī Brahmadatta was the king of Kāsīrich prosperous with many possessions many troops many vehicles many territories with fullystocked armories  granaries
Dīghīti was the king of Kosalapoor not very prosperous with few possessions few troops few vehicles few territories with poorlystocked armories  granaries
So Brahmadatta the king of Kāsī raising a fourfold army marched against Dīghīti the king of Kosala
Dīghīti the king of Kosala heard Brahmadatta the king of Kāsī they say has raised a fourfold army and is marching against me
Then the thought occurred to him King Brahmadatta is rich prosperous with fullystocked armories  granaries whereas I am poor with poorlystocked armories  granaries I am not competent to stand against even one attack by him
Why dont I slip out of the city beforehand
So taking his chief consort he slipped out of the city beforehand
Then King Brahmadatta conquering the troops vehicles lands armories  granaries of King Dīghīti lived in lordship over them
Meanwhile King Dīghīti had set out for Bārāṇasī together with his consort and
traveling by stages arrived there
There he lived with her on the outskirts of Bārāṇasī in a potters house disguised as a wanderer
Not long afterwards she became pregnant
She had a pregnancy wish of this sort She wanted to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords
She said to King Dīghīti Your majesty I am pregnant and I have a pregnancy wish of this sort
I want to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords
He said My queen where is there for usfallen on hard timesa fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground and water used for washing the swords If I dont get this your majesty I will die
Now at that time the brahman adviser to King Brahmadatta was a friend of King Dīghīti
So King Dīghīti went to him and on arrival said A lady friend of yours old friend is pregnant and she has a pregnancy wish of this sort
She wants to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords
In that case let me see her
So King Dīghītis consort went to King Brahmadattas brahman adviser
When he saw her coming from afar he rose from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder and with his hands raised in salutation to her exclaimed three times Surely the king of Kosala has come to your womb Surely the king of Kosala has come to your womb Surely the king of Kosala has come to your womb
Dont be worried my queen
You will get to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords
Then he went to King Brahmadatta and on arrival said to him Your majesty signs have appeared such that tomorrow at dawn a fourfold army armed  arrayed should stand on a parade ground and that the swords should be washed
So King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then Do as the brahman adviser says
Thus King Dīghītis chief consort got to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and got to drink the water used for washing the swords
Then with the maturing of the fetus she gave birth to a son
They named him Dīghāvu LongLife
Not long afterwards Prince Dīghāvu reached the age of discretion
The thought occurred to King Dīghīti This King Brahmadatta of Kāsī has done us great harm He has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries If he finds out about us he will have all three of us killed Why dont I send Prince Dīghāvu to live outside of the city
So King Dīghīti of Kosala had Prince Dīghāvu go and live outside of the city
Living there he in no long time learned all the crafts
Now at that time King Dīghītis barber had gone over to King Brahmadatta
He saw King Dīghīti together with his consort living on the outskirts of Bārāṇasī in a potters house disguised as a wanderer On seeing them he went to King Brahmadatta and on arrival said to him Your majesty King Dīghīti of Kosala together with his consort is living on the outskirts of Bārāṇasī in a potters house disguised as a wanderer
So King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then Go fetch King Dīghīti together with his consort
Responding As you say your majesty to the king they went and fetched King Dīghīti together with his consort
Then King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then Having bound King Dīghīti  his consort with a stout rope with their arms pinned tightly against their backs and having shaved them bald march them to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evict them out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut them into four pieces and bury them in holes placed in the four directions
Responding As you say your majesty to the king the kings people bound King Dīghīti  his consort with a stout rope pinning their arms tightly against their backs shaved them bald and marched them to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads
Then the thought occurred to Prince Dīghāvu Its been a long time since I saw my mother  father
What if I were to go see them
So he entered Bārāṇasī and saw his mother  father bound with a stout rope their arms pinned tightly against their backs their heads shaven bald being marched to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads and he went to them
King Dīghīti saw Prince Dīghāvu coming from afar and on seeing him said Dont my dear Dīghāvu be farsighted
Dont be nearsighted For vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance
When this was said the people said to him This King Dīghīti has gone crazy Hes talking nonsense
Who is Dīghāvu
Why is he saying Dont my dear Dīghāvu be farsighted Dont be nearsighted
xFor vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance
I say Im not crazy or talking nonsense He who knows will understand
Then a second time a third time he said Dont my dear Dīghāvu be farsighted Dont be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance
A third time the people said to him This King Dīghīti has gone crazy
Hes talking nonsense
Who is Dīghāvu Why is he saying Dont my dear Dīghāvu be farsighted Dont be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance
I say Im not crazy or talking nonsense He who knows will understand
Then the kings people having marched King Dīghīti together with his chief consort to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evicted them out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut them into four pieces buried them in holes placed in the four directions stationed guards and left
Then Prince Dīghāvu having entered Bārāṇasī brought out some liquor and got the guards to drink it
When they had fallen down drunk he collected sticks made a pyre raised the bodies of his mother  father onto the pyre set fire to it and then circumambulated it three times with his hands raised in salutation
Now at that time King Brahmadatta had gone up to the terrace on top of his palace
He saw Prince Dīghāvu circumambulating the pyre three times with his hands raised in salutation and on seeing him the thought occurred to him Doubtlessly this person is a relative or bloodkinsman of King Dīghīti Ah how unfortunate for me for there is no one who will tell me what this means
Then Prince Dīghāvu having gone into the wilderness and having cried  wept as much as he needed to dried his tears and entered Bārāṇasī Going to an elephant stable next to the kings palace he said to the chief elephant trainer Teacher I want to learn this craft
In that case young man you may learn it
Then rising in the last watch of the night Prince Dīghāvu sang in a sweet voice and played the lute in the elephant stable
King Brahmadatta rising in the last watch of the night heard the sweetvoiced singing  luteplaying in the elephant stable On hearing it he asked his people I say Who was that rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stable
Your majesty a young manthe student of suchandsuch an elephant trainer rising in the last watch of the night was singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stable
I say then Go fetch that young man
Responding As you say your majesty to the king they went and fetched Prince Dīghāvu
Then King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dīghāvu I say my young man Was that you rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stable
Yes your majesty
I say then my young man Sing and play the lute
Responding As you say your majesty to the king and seeking to win favor Prince Dīghāvu sang with a sweet voice and played the lute
Then King Brahmadatta said to him I say You my young man are to stay and attend to me
As you say your majesty Prince Dīghāvu responded to the king
Then he rose in the morning before King Brahmadatta went to bed in the evening after him did whatever the king ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to him
And it was not long before King Brahmadatta placed the prince close to him in a position of trust
Then one day King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dīghāvu I say then my young man Harness the chariot Im going hunting
Responding As you say your majesty to the king Prince Dīghāvu harnessed the chariot and then said to King Brahmadatta Your chariot is harnessed your majesty Now is the time for you to do as you see fit
Then King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot
and Prince Dīghāvu drove it
He drove it in such a way that the kings entourage went one way and the chariot another
Then after they had gone far King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dīghāvu I say then my young man Unharness the chariot Im tired Im going to lie down
Responding As you say your majesty to the king Prince Dīghāvu unharnessed the chariot and sat down crosslegged on the ground
Then King Brahmadatta lay down placing his head on Prince Dīghāvus lap
As he was tired he went to sleep right away
Then the thought occurred to Prince Dīghāvu This King Brahmadatta of Kāsī has done us great harm
He has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries
And it was because of him that my mother  father were killed
Now is my chance to wreak vengeance He drew his sword from his scabbard
But then he thought My father told me as he was about to die Dont my dear Dīghāvu be farsighted Dont be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance
It would not be proper for me to transgress my fathers words So he put his sword back in its scabbard
A second time A third time the thought occurred to Prince Dīghāvu This King Brahmadatta of Kāsī has done us great harm He has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries And it was because of him that my mother  father were killed Now is my chance to wreak vengeance He drew his sword from his scabbard

It would not be proper for me to transgress my fathers words

A third time he thought My father told me as he was about to die Dont my dear Dīghāvu be farsighted Dont be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance
It would not be proper for me to transgress my fathers words
So once again he put his sword back in its scabbard



Then King Brahmadatta suddenly got upfrightened agitated unnerved alarmed
Prince Dīghāvu said to him Your majesty why have you gotten up suddenlyfrightened agitated unnerved  alarmed
I say my young man Just now as I was dreaming Prince Dīghāvuson of Dīghīti king of Kosalastruck me down with a sword
Thats why I got up suddenlyfrightened agitated unnerved  alarmed
Then Prince Dīghāvu grabbing King Brahmadatta by the head with his left hand and drawing his sword from its scabbard with his right said I your majesty am that very Prince Dīghāvu son of Dīghīti king of Kāsī
You have done us great harm
You have seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries
And it was because of you that my mother  father were killed
Now is my chance to wreak vengeance
So King Brahmadatta dropping his head down to Prince Dīghāvus feet said Grant me my life my dear Dīghāvu
Grant me my life my dear Dīghāvu
Who am I that I would dare grant life to your majesty
It is your majesty who should grant life to me
In that case my dear Dīghāvu you grant me my life and I grant you your life
Then King Brahmadatta and Prince Dīghāvu granted one another their lives and taking one another by the hands swore an oath to do one another no harm
Then King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dīghāvu In that case my dear Dīghāvu harness the chariot We will go on
Responding As you say your majesty to the king Prince Dīghāvu harnessed the chariot and then said to King Brahmadatta Your chariot is harnessed your majesty Now is the time for you to do as you see fit
Then King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot
and Prince Dīghāvu drove it
He drove it in such a way that it was not long before they met up with the kings entourage
Then King Brahmadatta having entered Bārāṇasī had his ministers  councilors convened and said to them I say then If you were to see Prince Dīghāvu the son of Dīghīti the king of Kosala what would you do to him
Different ministers said We would cut off his hands your majesty
We would cut off his feet your majesty
We would cut off his hands  feet your majesty
We would cut off his ears your majesty
We would cut off his nose your majesty
We would cut off his ears  nose your majesty
We would cut off his head your majesty
Then the king said This I say is Prince Dīghāvu the son of Dīghīti the king of Kāsī
You are not allowed to do anything to him
It was by him that my life was granted to me and it was by me that his life was granted to him
Then King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dīghāvu What your father said to you as he was about to dieDont my dear Dīghāvu be farsighted Dont be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeancein reference to what did he say that
What my father said to me as he was about to dieDont be farsightedDont bear vengeance for a long time
is what he was saying to me as he was about to die
And what he said to me as he was about to dieDont be nearsightedDont be quick to break with a friend
is what he was saying to me as he was about to die
And what he said to me as he was about to dieFor vengeance is not settled through vengeance Vengeance is settled through nonvengeanceMy mother  father were killed by your majesty
If I were to deprive your majesty of life those who hope for your majestys wellbeing would deprive me of life And those who hope for my wellbeing would deprive them of life And in that way vengeance would not be settled by vengeance
But now I have been granted my life by your majesty and your majesty has been granted your life by me
And in this way vengeance has been settled by nonvengeance
That is what my father was saying to me as he was about to die
Then King Brahmadatta said Isnt it amazing
Isnt it astounding
How wise this Prince Dīghāvu is in that he can understand in full the meaning of what his father said in brief So he returned his fathers troops vehicles lands armories  granaries to him and gave him his daughter in marriage
Such monks is the forbearance  gentleness of kings who wield the scepter who wield the sword
So now let your light shine forth so that youwho have gone forth in such a welltaught Dhamma  Disciplinewill be their equal in forbearance  gentleness
A third time the Blessed One said to the monks Enough monks Dont quarrel Dont argue Dont make strife Dont dispute
A third time the nonDhammadeclaring monk said to the Blessed One Wait Lord Blessed One May the Master of the Dhamma dwell at ease devoted to a pleasant abiding in the hereandnow Lord Blessed One
We will be the ones who deal with this argument quarrel strife and dispute
Then the Blessed One These worthless men are hopelesstheyre not easy to convince got up from his seat and left
The first recitation section on Dīghāvu 
Then early in the morning the Blessed One put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robes went into Kosambī for alms
Having gone for alms in Kosambī after returning from the almsround after the meal having set his dwelling in order taking his robes  bowl standing in the midst of the Saṅgha he recited these verses
The sound of the crowd men on the same level Noone thinks himself a fool
Though the Saṅgha is splitting Noone can think of anything better
Totally forgotten the words of the wise declaring the right range of speech
They stretch out their mouths as far as they want Where it will lead they dont know
He insulted me hit me beat me robbed me
for those who brood on this hostility isnt stilled
He insulted me hit me beat me robbed me
for those who dont brood on this hostility is stilled
Hostilities arent stilled through hostility regardless
Hostilities are stilled through nonhostility this an unending truth
Unlike those who dont realize that were here on the verge of perishing
those who do their quarrels are stilled Dhp 
Bonebreakers killers robbers cattle and horse thieves
Those who plunder the land Even they have their fellowship
Why shouldnt you have yours
If you gain a mature companion
a fellow traveler rightliving enlightened
overcoming all dangers
go with him gratified mindful
If you dont gain a mature companion
a fellow traveler rightliving enlightened
go alone like a king renouncing his kingdom
like the elephant in the Mātaṅga wilds his herd
Going alone is better
theres no companionship with a fool
Go alone doing no evil at peace
like the elephant in the Mātaṅga wilds Dhp 
The Case of Dīghāvu is finished
Having recited these verses while standing in the midst of the Saṅgha the Blessed One went to Bālakaloṇakāraka Village
At that time Ven Bhāgu was living near Bālakaloṇakāraka Village
Ven Bhāgu saw the Blessed One coming from afar and on seeing him laid out a seat Having set out water for washing his feet a footstool and a footwashing block he went out to receive his robes  bowl
The Blessed One sat down on the seat laid out and washed his feet
Ven Bhagu having bowed to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it agreeable monk Are you getting by Are you tired from going for alms
Its tolerable Lord Im getting by And Im not tired from going for alms
Then the Blessed One having instructed urged roused  encouraged Ven Bhagu with a Dhamma talk got up from his seat and went to the Eastern Bamboo Park
The Discussion of Going to Bālakaloṇaka is finished
At that time Ven Anuruddha Ven Nandiya and Ven Kimbila were staying in the Eastern Bamboo Park
The park warden saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and on seeing him said to him Contemplative dont enter the park
There are three young men living there desiring their own 
Dont make them uncomfortable
Ven Anuruddha heard the park warden conversing with the Blessed One and on hearing them said to the park warden Friend park warden dont keep out the Blessed One
Our Teacher the Blessed One has arrived
Then Ven Anuruddha went to Ven Nandiya and Ven Kimbila and on arrival said to them Come out venerables Come out venerables Our Teacher the Blessed One has arrived
Then Ven Anuruddha Ven Nandiya and Ven Kimbila went out to greet the Blessed One One received his robe  bowl Another laid out a seat Another set out water for washing his feet a footstool and a footwashing block
The Blessed One sat down on the seat laid out and washed his feet
Having bowed down to the Blessed One they also sat to one side
As they were sitting there the Blessed One said to Ven Anuruddha Is it tolerable for you Anuruddha Are you getting by Are you tired from going for alms
Its tolerable Lord Were getting by And were not tired from going for alms
But Anuruddha are you living harmoniously cordially and without dispute blending like milk and water looking at one another with eyes of affection
Indeed Lord we are living harmoniously cordially and without dispute blending like milk and water looking at one another with eyes of affection
But Anuruddha how are you living harmoniously cordially and without dispute blending like milk and water looking at one another with eyes of affection
Here Lord the thought occurs to us Its a gain for me a great gain that I am living with companions of this sort in the holy life
We are set on bodily acts of good will with regard to these other two venerable ones to their faces  behind their backs We are set on verbal and mental acts of good will with regard to these other two venerable ones to their faces  behind their backs
The thought occurs to us Why dont I having put aside my own thoughts conduct myself in line with the thoughts of these venerable ones
And having put aside my own thoughts I do conduct myself in line with the thoughts of these venerable ones
Our bodies are separate Lord but we are as if one in mind
Ven Nandiya and Ven Kimbila said to the Blessed One Here Lord the thought occurs to us also Its a gain for me a great gain that I am living with companions of this sort in the holy life
We are set on bodily acts of good will with regard to these other two venerable ones to their faces  behind their backs We are set on verbal and mental acts of good will with regard to these other two venerable ones to their faces  behind their backs
The thought occurs to us Why dont I having put aside my own thoughts conduct myself in line with the thoughts of these venerable ones
And having put aside my own thoughts I do conduct myself in line with the thoughts of these venerable ones
Our bodies are separate Lord but we are one in mind as it were
This lord is how we are living harmoniously cordially and without dispute blending like milk and water looking at one another with eyes of affection
But Anuruddha do you remain heedful ardent and resolute
Indeed Lord we remain heedful ardent and resolute
But Anuruddha how do you remain heedful ardent and resolute
Here Lord whichever of us returns first from going to the village for alms arranges the seats sets out water for washing the feet a footstool and a footwashing block washes the refuse bucket and sets it out and sets out water for drinking and water for using
Whoever returns afterwards from going to the village for alms eats the leftoversif there are any and if he wants toand if not he throws them out in a place where there are no crops
or dumps them into water without living beings in it
He picks up the seats puts away the water for washing the feet footstool and footwashing block washes and puts away the refuse bucket puts away the water for drinking and water for using and sweeps the mealhall
Whoever sees that the drinkingwater pitcher usingwater pitcher or rinsingwater pitcher are low or empty refills it
If it occurs to him Its too much for me calling another by wavingusing hand signalswe refill it Thus Lord we dont for that reason break out into speech
And every five days we spend the whole night sitting together discussing the Dhamma
Thats how we remain heedful ardent and resolute
The Discussion of Going to the Eastern Bamboo Park is finished
Then the Blessed One having instructed urged roused  encouraged Ven Anuruddha Ven Nandiya and Ven Kimila with a Dhamma talk got up from his seat and set out on a wandering tour toward Pārileyyaka and
wandering by stages arrived at Pārileyyaka
There he stayed in Pārileyyaka in the protected forest grove at the root of the auspicious Sal tree
Then when the Blessed One was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness Before I was living unpleasantly hemmed in by those Kosambī monksquarrelsome makers of strife makers of disputes makers of rumors makers of issues in the Saṅgha
 Now Im alone without a second I live pleasantly and in ease away from those Kosambī monksquarrelsome makers of strife makers of disputes makers of rumors makers of issues in the Saṅgha
It so happened that a certain bull elephant was living hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants He fed off grass with cutoff tips They chewed up his stash of brokenoff branches He drank disturbed water And when he went down to his bathingplace cowelephants went along banging up against his body
The thought occurred to him I now live hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants I feed off grass with cutoff tips They chew up my stash of brokenoff branches I drink disturbed water And when I go down to my bathing place cowelephants go along banging up against my body
What if I were to live alone apart from the crowd
So the bull elephant leaving the herd went to Pārileyyaka to the protected forest grove and the root of the auspicious sal tree He went to the Blessed One and on arrival brought drinking water and washing water for the Blessed One with his trunk and kept the grass down
Then this train of thought arose in the awareness of the bull elephant Before I lived unpleasantlyhemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants I fed off grass with cutoff tips They chewed up my stash of brokenoff branches I drank disturbed water And when I went down to my bathing place cowelephants went along banging up against my body
But now Im alone without a second I live pleasantlynot hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants
Then the Blessed One realizing his own seclusion and knowing the train of thought in the bull elephants awareness on that occasion exclaimed
This harmonizes mind with mind the great ones with the great ones
the elephant with tusks like chariot poles that each finds joy alone in the forest
Then the Blessed One having stayed at Pārileyyaka as long as he liked set out on a wandering tour toward Sāvatthī and
wandering by stages arrived at Sāvatthī
There at Sāvatthī he stayed in Jetas grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then the thought occurred to the layfollowers of Kosambī These masters the Kosambī monks have done us a lot of harm
Annoyed by them the Blessed One left
Lets not bow down to them stand up to greet them salute them with hands placed palmtopalm over the heart honor them show them respect venerate them do homage to them or give them alms when they approach Thus not honored by us nor shown respect venerated nor done homage to being brushed off rudely will leave or disrobe or regain the confidence of the Blessed One
So the layfollowers of Kosambī didnt bow down to the Kosambī monks stand up to greet them salute them with hands placed palmtopalm over the heart honor them show them respect venerate them do homage to them or give them alms when they approached
And the thought occurred to the Kosambī monks as they were not being honored by the layfollowers of Kosambī nor shown respect venerated nor done homage to and being brushed off rudely Friends lets go to Sāvatthī and settle this issue in the Blessed Ones presence
The Discussion of Going to Pārileyyaka is finished
Then the Kosambī monks having set their lodgings in order taking their robes  bowls went to Sāvatthī
Ven Sāriputta heard that They say that the Kosambī monks quarrelsome makers of strife makers of disputes makers of rumors makers of issues in the Saṅgha are coming to Sāvatthī
Then Ven Sāriputta went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One They say that the Kosambī monks quarrelsome makers of strife makers of disputes makers of rumors makers of issues in the Saṅgha are coming to Sāvatthī
How am I to behave with regard to these monks
In that case Sāriputta take your stance in line with the Dhamma
And how should I know what is Dhamma and what is notDhamma
Sāriputta there are these eighteen grounds by which a speaker of notDhamma is to be known

The Discussion of Going to Pārileyyaka is finished
Then the thought occurred to the suspended monk as he was contemplating the Dhamma  Vinaya This is an offense not a nonoffense
I have fallen into an offense Its not the case that I havent fallen into an offense
I am suspended Its not the case that Im not suspended
I was suspended with a Dhamma transaction that is irreversible and fit to stand
So the suspended monk went to his followers and on arrival said to them Friends this is an offense not a nonoffense
I have fallen into an offense Its not the case that I havent fallen into an offense
I am suspended Its not the case that Im not suspended
I was suspended with a Dhamma transaction that is irreversible and fit to stand
Come venerable sirs restore me
Then the followers of the suspended monk taking him along went to the Blessed One On arrival they bowed down and sat to one side

I have fallen into an offense Its not the case that I havent fallen into an offense
I am suspended Its not the case that Im not suspended
I was suspended with a Dhamma transaction that is irreversible and fit to stand
Come venerable sirs restore me
What should be done
Monks that is an offense not a nonoffense
This monk has fallen into an offense Its not the case that he hasnt fallen into an offense
He is suspended Its not the case that hes not suspended
He was suspended with a Dhamma transaction that is irreversible and fit to stand
Because this monk fallen into an offense suspended sees the offense In this case monks restore him
The Allowance for Rehabilitation is finished
Then the followers of the suspended monk having restored him went to the monks who suspended him and on arrival said to them Regarding the matter about which there was arguing quarreling clashes and disputes in the Saṅgha a split in the Saṅgha a crack in the Saṅgha a falling apart in the Saṅgha a separation in the Saṅgha That monk did fall into an offense and was suspended but has seen his offense and been restored
Friends for the sake of settling this matter lets perform a Saṅghaunification
Then the monks who had suspended went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down and sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One Lord the followers of the suspended monk say Regarding the matter about which there was arguing quarreling clashes and disputes in the Saṅgha a split in the Saṅgha a crack in the Saṅgha a falling apart in the Saṅgha a separation in the Saṅgha That monk did fall into an offense and was suspended but has seen his offense and been restored
Friends for the sake of settling this matter lets perform a Saṅghaunification
What should be done
Because the monk fallen into an offense suspended has seen the offense and has been restored then in that case monks for the sake of settling this matter a Saṅghaunification should be performed
This is how it should be performed
One and all should gather together the ill and the notill
Consent is not to be conveyed for anyone
Having gathered them an experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
Regarding the matter about which there was arguing quarreling clashes and disputes in the Saṅgha a split in the Saṅgha a crack in the Saṅgha a falling apart in the Saṅgha a separation in the Saṅgha That monk who fell into an offense and was suspended has seen his offense and been restored
If the Saṅgha is ready it shouldas this matter has been settledperform a Saṅghaunification
This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
Regarding the matter about which there was arguing quarreling clashes and disputes in the Saṅgha a split in the Saṅgha a crack in the Saṅgha a falling apart in the Saṅgha a separation in the Saṅgha That monk who fell into an offense and was suspended has seen his offense and been restored
As this matter has been settled the Saṅgha is performing a Saṅghaunification
He to whomas this matter has been settledthe performing of the Saṅghaunification is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
As this matter has been settled the Saṅgha has performed a Saṅghaunification
The schism in the Saṅgha is settled the split in the Saṅgha is settled the falling apart in the Saṅgha is settled the separation in the Saṅgha is settled
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
Immediately the uposatha is to be done the Pāṭimokkha is to be recited
The Discussion of Saṅghaunification is finished
On that occasion Ven Upāli went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One If the Saṅghawithout having adjudicated the matter without having gotten to the roots for a dispute in the Saṅgha  a split in the Saṅgha a crack in the Saṅgha a falling apart in the Saṅgha a separation in the Saṅghaperforms a Saṅghaunification is that a Dhamma Saṅghaunification
Upāli when the Saṅghawithout having adjudicated the matter without having gotten to the roots for a dispute in the Saṅgha  a split in the Saṅgha a crack in the Saṅgha a falling apart in the Saṅgha a separation in the Saṅghaperforms a Saṅghaunification that is a nonDhamma Saṅghaunification
But if the Saṅghahaving adjudicated the matter having gotten to the roots for a dispute in the Saṅgha  a split in the Saṅgha a crack in the Saṅgha a falling apart in the Saṅgha a separation in the Saṅghaperforms a Saṅghaunification is that a Dhamma Saṅghaunification
Upāli when the Saṅghahaving adjudicated the matter having gotten to the roots for a dispute in the Saṅgha  a split in the Saṅgha a crack in the Saṅgha a falling apart in the Saṅgha a separation in the Saṅghaperforms a Saṅghaunification that is a Dhamma Saṅghaunification
Lord how many Saṅghaunifications are there
Upāli there are two Saṅghaunifications There is the Saṅghaunification devoid of meaning endowed with words and there is the Saṅghaunification endowed with meaning and endowed with words
And which is the Saṅghaunification devoid of meaning endowed with words
When the Saṅghawithout having adjudicated the matter without having gotten to the roots for a dispute in the Saṅgha  a split in the Saṅgha a crack in the Saṅgha a falling apart in the Saṅgha a separation in the Saṅghaperforms a Saṅghaunification that is called a Saṅghaunification devoid of meaning endowed with words
And which is the Saṅghaunification endowed with meaning and endowed with words
When the Saṅghahaving adjudicated the matter having gotten to the roots for a dispute in the Saṅgha  a split in the Saṅgha a crack in the Saṅgha a falling apart in the Saṅgha a separation in the Saṅghaperforms a Saṅghaunification that is called a Saṅghaunification endowed with meaning and endowed with words
These are the two Saṅghaunifications
Then Ven Upāli having gotten up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder and raised his hands over the heart to the Blessed One addressed him in verse
Regarding the duties of the Saṅgha
deliberations  arisen matters under consideration
In this case in what manner should a man doing great benefit act
How is a monk worthy in his efforts
The Buddha First of all for one faultless in virtue
wellconsidered in conduct with senses wellrestrained
his enemies insulting him cant criticize him with regard to a rule
for he has nothing by which they could criticize him
One such as this established in purity of virtue
hes fearless able to speak
goes intrepid into the assembly doesnt abandon the purpose
speaking to the point
Thus when asked a question in the assembly
hes neither burned nor abashed
Speaking at the proper time a worthy explanation
sensible he delights the assembly of those who know
Hes respectful of more senior monks
but confident in his own teachers teaching
able to investigate familiar with what should be spoken
clever with regard to the weak points of his opponents
by which his opponents meet with censure
and the people go along with the explanation
He doesnt give up his own position
that solves the problem without harm
Able to take up errands and whatever they tell him
with regard to the duties of the Saṅgha
he acts and speaks sent by the group of monks
without the thought Im acting
He is learned in both Vibhaṅgas
concerning the extent to which
one falls into a base 
and how one with an offense emerges from it
How one behaves such that he gets expelled
for one who has been expelled how he should behave
rehabilitation for one who has done his penance
Proficient in the Vibhaṅgas he knows this too
Hes respectful of the monks more senior than himself
new monks elders and those of middle seniority
Wise he practices here for the welfare of the many people
This sort of monk here is worthy in his efforts

The Kosambī Khandhaka is finished
The Mahāvagga is completed
There are some recluses and brahmins who having directly known the Dhamma for themselves among things not heard before claim to teach the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
This religious instruction was given by the Teacher at the gate of the city Saṅkassa with reference to many gods and men
But the story begins at Rājagaha
For once upon a time a treasurer of Rājagaha went to the river Ganges to sport in the water To avoid the risk of losing his jewels and clothing and to prevent them from slipping away while his mind was otherwise occupied he put them in an openwork wicker basket
Now a certain redsandalwood tree which grew on the bank of the Ganges above whose roots were washed by the waters of the Ganges fell into the Ganges was gradually broken up by the rocks in the river and went to pieces
A fragment of the tree about the size of a waterjar which had been ground by the rocks and washed by the waves until it was round and smooth and which had been carried along by the current and in the course of time had become wrapped round and round with Sevala plants finally drifted against the treasurers wicker basket and was caught therein
What is this said the treasurer A fragment of a tree replied his companions The treasurer ordered it brought to him What kind of wood is it thought the treasurer In order to find out for himself he proceeded to pare it with the blade of an adze
and immediately discovered that it was a block of red sandalwood of the color of red lac
Now the treasurer was neither orthodox nor heretical in his views but was impartial to both
He thought to himself I have a great quantity of red sandalwood in my house what shall I do with this
Then the following thought occurred to him There are many men living in the world who say We are Arahats we are Arahats For my part however I know not a single Arahat
I will have the lathe in my house started up and a bowl turned and this bowl I will suspend in the air by a cord from a series of bamboos sixty cubits from the ground Then I will make the following proclamation If any be an Arahat let him fly through the air and take the bowl
If any shall succeed in taking the bowl I will become his disciple and my son and my wife likewise
Accordingly he had a bowl turned suspended it from a series of bamboos and made the following proclamation If any in this world be an Arahat let him fly through the air and take this bowl
Six religious teachers said to him This bowl is just the thing for us give it to us
But the treasurer replied Fly through the air and take it
On the sixth day the naked ascetic Nāthaputta said to his disciples Go say to the treasurer This bowl is just the thing for our teacher Do not insist on our flying through the air for the sake of a mere trifle Give us the bowl
They went and delivered his message to the treasurer
Nāthaputta himself desired to go Accordingly he gave orders to his disciples I will lift up a single hand and a single foot and act as though I were about to fly up Then you must say to me Teacher what are you doing Do not reveal hidden powers of Arahatship to the multitude merely for the sake of a wooden bowl So saying you must grasp me by the hands and feet pull me down and throw me on the ground
Then Nāthaputta went and said to the treasurer Great treasurer this bowl is not at all the thing for others Do not insist on my flying through the air for the sake of a mere trifle Give me the bowl
Reverend Sir fly through the air and take it that is the only way
Then Nāthaputta said to his disciples Well then come away come away So saying he led them away Then he said I shall now fly up into the air So saying he lifted up a single hand and a single foot
Thereupon his disciples said to him Teacher teacher what is it you are doing All for the sake of a wretched miserable wooden bowl why need you reveal hidden powers to the multitude Forthwith they grasped him by the hands and feet and dragged him down and threw him on the ground
Then he said to the treasurer Great treasurer these my disciples will not permit me to fly up into the air pray give me the bowl
Fly up and take it Reverend Sir
Thus did the six heretics strive for six days but for all their striving they did not succeed in obtaining the bowl
On the seventh day the Venerable Elder Moggallāna the Great and the Venerable Elder Piṇḍolabhāradvāja set out to make an almspilgrimage in Rājagaha and taking their stand on a flat rock they proceeded to robe themselves Just at that moment some gamesters began the following conversation Friends six religious teachers used to go about pretending to be Arahats But when seven days ago the treasurer of Rājagaha suspended a bowl and said If any be an Arahat let him fly through the air and take the bowl not one of those who pretended to be Arahats could fly through the air
Today we know for certain that there are no Arahats in the world
Hearing this talk the Venerable Moggallāna the Great said to the Venerable Elder Piṇḍolabhāradvāja Brother you have heard the conversation of these men they talk as though they were challenging the Religion of the Buddha
Now you are possessed of great magical power you are possessed of great supernatural power go fly through the air and take this bowl
Brother Moggallāna you are known far and wide as Foremost of those that possess magical power you take this bowl if you take it I will take it
Moggallāna replied You go brother Accordingly the Venerable Elder Piṇḍolabhāradvāja entered into the trance of the Supernatural Faculties and arising from the trance he encircled the flat rock three leagues in extent with the tip of his foot and then raising it aloft as easily as if it were silkcotton he walked seven times about in a circle over the city of Rājagaha
Now the city of Rājagaha was exactly three leagues in extent and the rock appeared like a covering over the city
The residents of the city thought to themselves The rock will fall upon us and crush us and terrified with fear they placed winnowingbaskets on their heads and hid themselves here and there
The seventh time the Elder encircled the city he rent the flat rock asunder and showed himself plainly before the people
When the multitude saw the Elder they cried out Reverend Piṇḍolabhāradvāja take firm hold of the rock do not destroy us all
Thereupon the Elder kicked the rock away from him
And the Elder lighted on the top of the treasurers house
When the Elder saw him he prostrated himself on his breast and said Master pray descend When the Elder had descended the treasurer provided him with a seat caused him to lower his bowl filled it with the four sweet foods and returned it to the Elder
The Elder took his bowl and set out in the direction of the monastery
Thereupon all those who because of absence either in the forest or in the village had not seen that miracle
So the Elder repeated the miracle for them also and having so done continued his course to the monastery
The Teacher who was following the Elder heard the noise of the multitude as they roared out their applause and asked the Elder nanda nanda who is it they are applauding Reverend Sir replied the Elder nanda Piṇḍolabhāradvāja flew up into the air and took the bowl made of red sandalwood and the multitude are applauding him So the Teacher summoned Bhāradvāja and said to him Is the report true that you have done this Yes Reverend Sir it is true Bhāradvāja why did you do this Thereupon the Teacher rebuked the Elder caused him to break that bowl to pieces and directed him to give the fragments to the monks to grind into powder for sandalpaste And he laid down a precept forbidding the exercise of the supernatural powers for such purposes in the future
When the heretics heard that the monk Gotama had caused that bowl to be broken to pieces and that he had laid down a precept forbidding his disciples to perform miracles they said Even if their lives depend upon it the disciples of the monk Gotama will not disobey the precept which he has laid down Moreover the monk Gotama will also keep that precept
Now is our chance  So they went through the streets of the city proclaiming It is our wont to keep our own powers hidden and it was for this reason that on a recent occasion we refused to display our own powers for the sake of a wooden bowl But the disciples of the monk Gotama displayed their powers to the multitude all for the sake of a paltry bowl
The monk Gotama in his wisdom caused that bowl to be broken to pieces and laid down a precept forbidding his disciples to perform miracles Henceforth we will perform miracles only with him
King Bimbisāra heard their talk went to the Teacher and said Reverend Sir is the report true that you have forbidden your disciples to perform miracles
Yes great king
The heretics are saying We will perform miracles with you what do you intend to do about this
If they perform miracles I will do the same
Have you not laid down a precept forbidding the performance of miracles
Great king I have not laid down a precept for myself the precept was intended to apply only to my disciples
Do you mean that the precept which you laid down was intended to apply to everyone but yourself
Well great king I will answer that question by another Great king it is true is it not that you have a pleasuregarden in your kingdom
Yes Reverend Sir
Great king if the populace should eat the mangoes and other fruits in your garden what would you do to them
I should inflict punishment upon them Reverend Sir
But you would have the right to eat them yourself
Yes Reverend Sir I am not liable to punishment I should have the right to eat whatever belongs to me
Great king even as your authority extends throughout your kingdom thirty leagues in extent and you are not yourself liable to punishment for eating mangoes and other fruits in your own garden while others are liable to punishment for so doing even so my authority extends throughout hundreds of thousands of millions of worlds and while I may overstep the precepts which I have myself laid down others may not so do therefore great king I shall perform a miracle
When the heretics heard these words they said to each other Now we are lost the monk Gotama declares that the precept which he laid down was intended to apply to his disciples but not to himself
and he further declares that it is his intention to perform a miracle himself what are we to do And they took counsel together
The king asked the Teacher Reverend Sir when do you intend to perform this miracle
On the day of full moon of the month sāḷhi four months hence
Where will you perform it Reverend Sir
Near Sāvatthi great king
Now why did the Teacher appoint a place so far distant
Because Sāvatthi is the place where all the Buddhas have performed their great miracles it was likewise to permit the assemblage of a great multitude For these reasons the Teacher appointed a place far distant
The heretics hearing these words said to each other Four months hence the monk Gotama will perform a miracle at Sāvatthi Henceforth therefore we must pursue him unremittingly When the populace see us they will ask What does this mean
and we will reply You will remember that we said We will perform a miracle with the monk Gotama
When the Teacher had gone his round for alms in Rājagaha he came forth from the city
The heretics likewise came forth in his train Wherever he took his meal there they lodged for the night
wherever he lodged for the night there they took their breakfast
When the people asked them What does this mean they gave the same answer they had before agreed upon
We will see the miracle cried out the multitude and followed after
In due course the Teacher reached Sāvatthi
The heretics accompanied him thither On reaching the city they stirred up their retainers obtained for themselves a hundred thousand pieces of money caused a pavilion to be erected with pillars of acacia wood and caused it to be covered with blue lotus flowers Having so done they sat down and said Here we will perform a miracle
King Pasenadi Kosala approached the Teacher and said Reverend Sir the heretics have caused a pavilion to be erected shall I also erect a pavilion for you
There is no need of so doing great king I have a pavilionmaker
Reverend Sir who is there here besides me that can build a pavilion for you
Sakka king of the gods great king
Reverend Sir where will you perform the miracle
At the foot of the mangotree which is called Gaṇḍas great king
The heretics heard the words He will perform the miracle at the foot of the mangotree Straightway they tore up by the roots all of the mangotrees for a league around even those that had sprung up that very day and threw them all into the forest
On the day of full moon of the month sāḷhi the Teacher entered the city
On the same day Gaṇḍa the kings gardener seeing a large ripe mango in a basket of leaves made by red ants drove away the crows which had been attracted by its savor and flavor picked up the mango and set out with it intending to take it to the king But seeing the Teacher by the way he thought to himself If the king eats this mango he will possibly give me eight or sixteen pieces of money for it and that will not suffice to keep me alive during one state of existence
but if I give this to the Teacherit will avail to my salvation time without end
Accordingly he presented the ripe mango to the Teacher
The Teacher looked at the Elder nanda
The Elder removed the outer covering from the gift intended for the great king and placed the mango in the Teachers hands
The Teacher presented his bowl received the ripe mango and intimated that he desired to sit down right there
The Elder spread his robe and presented it
When the Teacher was seated the Elder strained water crushed the ripe mango made a sherbet and gave it to the Teacher
When the Teacher had drunk the mangosherbet he said to Gaṇḍa Dig up the earth right here and plant the seed of the mango
The gardener did as he was told
The Teacher washed his hands over the place where the mango had been planted
The very moment he washed his hands a mangotree sprang up with a stalk as thick as a plowhandle fifty cubits in height
Five great branches shot forth each fifty cubits in length four to the four cardinal points and one to the heavens above
Instantly the tree was covered with flowers and fruits indeed on one side it bore a cluster of ripe mangoes
Approaching from behind the monks picked the ripe mangoes ate them and then withdrew
When the king heard that a mangotree so wonderful had sprung up he gave orders that no one should cut it down and posted a guard
Because the tree had been planted by the gardener Gaṇḍa it became known as Gaṇḍas Mangotree
Men of the baser sort also ate the ripe mango fruits and cried out You rascally heretics when you heard that the monk Gotama would do a miracle at the foot of Gaṇḍas Mangotree you caused all the young mangoes for a league around even those that have sprung up this very day to be torn up by the roots yet here is Gaṇḍas mangotree So saying they took the seeds and cores of the mangofruits which remained and threw them at the heretics
Sakka ordered the deity Windcloud Uproot the pavilion of the heretics with your winds and throw it into the cesspool
Windcloud did so
Then Sakka ordered the Sundeity Check the course of the suns disk and scorch them
The Sundeity did so
Then Sakka again ordered Windcloud Windcloud set the chariot of the wind in motion and go forth
Windcloud did so Now the bodies of the heretics were streaming with sweat and Windcloud sprinkled them with a shower of dust
until they looked like red ants
Then Sakka again ordered Windcloud Cause countless great drops of rain to fall
Windcloud did so
Naked as they were they fled helterskelter
As they were running away a certain farmer who was a supporter of Pūraṇa Kassapa thought Tomorrow is the day when my noble teachers will perform their miracle I must go see the miracle So unyoking his cattle and taking with him a vessel of broth which he had brought with him early in the morning and a rope he set out to return home When he saw Pūraṇa running away in such wise he said to him Reverend Sir I set out with the thought in my mind I will go see my noble teachers perform their miracle Where are you going
Pūraṇa replied Why should you wish to see a miracle Give me your waterpot and rope
The farmer did so Pūraṇa took the waterpot and rope and going to the bank of the river tied the waterpot to his neck with the rope and threw himself into the stream There was a splash of waterbubbles and Pūraṇa died and was reborn in the Avīci Hell
The Teacher created a jeweled walk in the air
As the shadows of evening drew on there assembled a multitude thirtysix leagues in extent The Teacher thinking to himself This is the time for me to perform the miracle came forth from the Perfumed Chamber and stood on the terrace
At that moment a female lay disciple named Gharaṇī a woman possessed of magical power who had attained the Fruit of the Third Path approached the Teacher and said Reverend Sir so long as you have a daughter like me remaining alive you will have no occasion to weary yourself I will perform a miracle
Gharaṇī what miracle will you perform
Reverend Sir I will convert the great earth which lies inclosed within the circle of the world into water and then I will dive into the water like a waterbird and reappear at the eastern rim of the world Likewise will I reappear at the western rim and at the northern rim and at the southern rim of the world and at the centre
People will ask Who is that and other people will answer That is Gharaṇī If such is the supernatural power of a mere woman what must the supernatural power of a Buddha be like
Under such circumstances the heretics will flee away without so much as waiting to see you
The Teacher replied I know very well Gharaṇī that you are perfectly able to perform such a miracle as you describe but this basket of flowers was not prepared for you With these words he declined her offer
Gharaṇī said to herself The Teacher declines my offer doubtless there is some one else able to perform a greater miracle than that which I am able to perform So saying she stepped aside
Thought the Teacher to himself Thus will the merits of these persons also become manifest thus will they send up their shouts of applause in the midst of a company thirtysix leagues in extent And he asked yet others What manner of miracle will you perform
Thus and thus will we perform a miracle Reverend Sir they replied and standing before the Teacher they sent up shouts of applause
The story goes that among others Culla Anāthapiṇḍika thought to himself So long as the Teacher has a son like me alive a lay disciple who has attained the Fruit of the Third Path he will have no occasion to weary himself Accordingly he said to the Teacher Reverend Sir I will perform a miracle What manner of miracle will you perform asked the Teacher Reverend Sir I will assume a form like that of Mahā Brahmā twelve leagues in size and in the midst of this company with a sound like the roar of thunder that accompanies a heavy rainstorm I will shake the earth even as Mahā Brahmā shakes the earth
The multitude will ask What sound is that and the answer will be That is the sound of an earthquake produced by Culla Anāthapiṇḍika
The heretics will say If such is the supernatural power of a layman what must be the supernatural power of a Buddha And they will flee away without so much as waiting to see you
The Teacher repeated the answer he had given to Gharaṇī I know that you possess this power and declined his offer to perform the miracle
Now a certain sevenyearold girl a novice named Cīrā who had attained Fourfold Knowledge saluted the Teacher and said Reverend Sir I will perform a miracle
What miracle will you perform Cīrā
Reverend Sir I will fetch hither Mount Sineru and the range of mountains that encircles the earth and Himālaya likewise and I will set them up in a row and then I will soar like a wildgoose up and over the tops of these mountains without so much as touching them and return hither When the populace see me they will ask Who is that and the answer will be That is the female novice Cīrā
The heretics will say It is a mere sevenyearold novice who possesses this supernatural power what must the supernatural power of a Buddha be like So saying they will flee away without so much as waiting to see you
To her likewise did the Exalted One reply I know your supernatural power and declined her offer to perform the miracle
Now a certain novice named Cunda who although he had attained Fourfold Knowledge and Freedom from the Depravities yet was only seven years old saluted the Teacher and said Exalted One I will perform a miracle What miracle will you perform asked the Teacher Cunda replied Reverend Sir I will take upon my shoulder a great roseapple tree which is the emblem of the Land of the Roseapple and I will wave it back and forth and I will bring fragments of roseapple and give to this company to eat thereof and I will also bring flowers of the coral tree
Then the nun Uppalavaṇṇā saluted the Teacher and said Reverend Sir I will perform a miracle What miracle will you perform asked the Teacher Reverend Sir replied Uppalavaṇṇā Before the eyes of a multitude extended twelve leagues on all sides I will surround myself with a retinue thirtysix leagues round about and I will take the form of a Universal Monarch and will come to you and will pay obeisance to you
Said the Teacher I know your supernatural power and declined her offer to perform the miracle
Then the Elder Moggallāna the Great saluted the Exalted One and said Reverend Sir I will perform a miracle What miracle will you perform asked the Teacher Reverend Sir I will put Mount Sineru king of mountains between my teeth and crunch it like a kidneybean
What else will you do
I will roll up this earth like a mat and thrust it between my fingers
What else will you do
I will cause the earth to revolve like a potters wheel and I will give the multitude the essence of earth to eat
What else will you do
I will place the earth in my left hand and I will remove all these living beings to another continent
What else will you do
I will use Mount Sineru as an umbrellastick uplift the great earth place it thereon and taking it in one hand even as a monk carries an umbrella in his hand walk about in the air
Said the Teacher I know your supernatural power but declined to permit him to perform the miracles
Said Moggallāna Doubtless the Teacher knows of someone able to perform a miracle more wonderful than any that I am able to perform So saying he stepped aside
Then said the Teacher to him Moggallāna this basket of flowers was not prepared for you
The burden which I bear is like the burden of none other mine is a burden which none other is able to bear
Indeed it is not strange that there is now no one who can bear my burden
In previous states of existence also in which solely through my own volition I was born as an animal no one was able to bear my burden When the Teacher had thus spoken the Elder asked him When was this Reverend Sir and how was this
The Teacher then related in detail the Kaṇha Usabha Jātaka  Having related this Jātaka to make the matter clearer
he related in detail also the Nandi Visāla Jātaka 
Now when the Teacher had related these Jātakas he came down the jeweled walk His retinue extended twelve leagues before him to the east twelve leagues behind him twelve leagues on his left hand and twelve leagues on his right
And standing erect in the midst of this numerous company extending twentyfour leagues in all directions the Exalted One performed the Twin Miracle
According to the Sacred Text the facts are to be understood as follows What is known regarding the Twin Miracle performed by the Tathāgata
On this occasion the Tathāgata performed the Twin Miracle a miracle far more wonderful than any performed by his disciples From the upper part of his body proceeded flames of fire and from the lower part of his body a stream of water
From the lower part of his body proceeded flames of fire and from the upper part of his body a stream of water
From the front part of his body proceeded flames of fire and from the back part of his body a stream of water From the back part of his body proceeded flames of fire and from the front part of his body a stream of water Flames of fire and streams of water proceeded from his right and left eyes from his right and left ears from his right and left nostrils from his right and left shoulders from his right and left hands from his right and left sides from his right and left feet from the tips of his fingers and from the roots of his fingers
The Exalted One walked and a counterpart of him stood or sat or lay down  his counterpart lay down and the Exalted One walked or stood or sat
This is the tradition regarding the Twin Miracle performed by the Exalted One
This miracle therefore the Teacher performed as he walked up and down the jeweled walk
By means of a trance induced by meditation on the element of fire flames of fire proceeded from the upper part of his body and by means of a trance induced by meditation on the element of water a stream of water proceeded from the lower part of his body
The words From the lower part of his body and From the upper part of his body are used to show that from the same part of the body from which a stream of water proceeded from that part also flames of fire proceeded and that from the same part of the body from which flames of fire proceeded from that part also a stream of water also proceeded
The same principle of interpretation applies also to the following expressions
Now the flames of fire were not mingled with the stream of water nor was the stream of water mingled with the flames of fire
Both the flames of fire and the stream of water shot upwards as far as the World of Brahmā and streamed thence to the rim of the Cakkavāḷa
With reference to the six colors rays of six colors like molten gold running out of crucibles or like an ooze of kings yellow coming out of a tube shot upwards from the interior of one Cakkavāḷa to the World of Brahmā whence they streamed back to the rim of the Cakkavāḷa
Thus each Cakkavāḷa was arched with rays of light shaped like a Ashaped rafter and the House of Enlightenment was suffused with an even light
On that day the Teacher walked up and down performing his Twin Miracle and as he did so he preached the Law to the multitude from time to time
Thereupon the multitude sent up shouts of applause
Hearing the shouts of applause which proceeded from the multitude the Teacher straightway looked into the hearts of the great multitude and in sixteen ways perceived the disposition of mind of each one
So quick is the movement of the mind of the Buddhas
As he thus preached the Law and performed miracles a great multitude of living beings obtained clear comprehension of the Law
Since the Teacher saw in that vast throng none other than himself who understood his mind and could ask him questions he put forth his supernatural power and created a double
While the Exalted One walked up and down his double occupied himself otherwise while his double walked up and down the Exalted One occupied himself otherwise
As the Teacher performed his miracle he considered within himself Where have Buddhas of the past kept residence after performing this miracle Straightway he became aware of the following It has been their invariable custom to enter upon residence in the World of the Thirtythree and to expound the Abhidhamma Piṭaka to their mother Thereupon he lifted up his right foot and set it down on the summit of Yugandhara and then he lifted up his left foot and set it down on the summit of Sineru
and thus in three strides setting his foot on the earth but twice he spanned sixtyeight hundred thousand leagues
One must not conclude When the Teacher took those strides he lengthened his stride
Sakka saw the Teacher and thought to himself The Teacher will doubtless keep residence during the coming season of the rains on the Yellowstone Throne thus will he be of service to deities without number But if the Teacher enters upon residence here the other deities will not be able to lift even a hand
This Yellowstone Throne is sixty leagues long and fifty leagues broad and even if the Teacher seats himself therein it will appear as if empty
The Teacher perceiving the thought in his mind threw his own mantle over the stone throne completely covering it
Thought Sakka The robe he threw quite covers the throne to be sure but he himself will appear small indeed when he seats himself thereon
The Teacher perceiving the thought in his mind enfolded the Yellowstone Throne in a fold of his robe even as a big monk clad in refuseragrobes might cover a low stool with their skirts and when he had so done seated himself upon the Yellowstone Throne
At that moment the multitude looked for the Teacher but saw him not it was as though the moon had just set
Thereupon the multitude said
Has he gone to Cittakāṭa or to Kelāsa or to Yugandhara
We may not see the Supremely Enlightened One Prince of the World mightiest of men
As the multitude repeated this Stanza they wept and lamented
Others said to themselves The Teacher delights in solitude and embarrassed at having performed such a miracle before such a throng has departed to another kingdom or country Shall we not see him again henceforth And weeping and lamenting they pronounced the following Stanza
He that delights in solitude he that is steadfast will not come back again to this world
We may not see the Supremely Exalted the Prince of the World the mightiest of men
Thereupon they asked Moggallāna the Great Where has the Teacher gone Reverend Sir
Although Moggallāna the Great himself knew perfectly well where the Teacher had gone he thought to himself Of others also let the wondrous powers become known and therefore answered Ask the Elder Anuruddha
So they asked the Elder Anuruddha Reverend Sir where has the Teacher gone
The Elder Anuruddha replied He has entered upon residence in the World of the Thirtythree seated upon the Yellowstone Throne he went thither to expound the Abhidhamma Piṭaka to his mother
When will he return Reverend Sir
He will spend these three months expounding the Abhidhamma and he will return on the day of the Terminal Festival 
Thereupon the multitude exclaimed We will not go away until we see the Teacher So then and there they pitched camp
with the sky alone for their covering
Although the multitude was so great naught that issued from their bodies was noticeable on the ground for the earth opened and received all so that the surface of the earth was everywhere sweet and clean
Before the Teacher ascended he addressed Moggallāna the Great Moggallāna do you expound the Law to this company and Culla Anāthapiṇḍika will provide food
Accordingly during those three months Culla Anāthapiṇḍika provided that company with water and riceporridge and hard food and likewise with betel and garlands and perfumes and ornaments
Moggallāna the Great expounded the Law to them and answered the questions of all who had come to see a miracle
When the Teacher had entered upon residence in the World of the Thirtythree and had seated himself upon the Yellowstone Throne that he might expound the Abhidhamma to his mother the deities of ten thousand worlds surrounded him and waited upon him
Therefore is it said
In the World of the Thirtythree when the Buddha most exalted of beings
Dwelt at the foot of the Coraltree seated on the Yellowstone Throne
The deities of the Ten Worlds assembled together and waited upon
The Supremely Enlightened dwelling at the highest point of the heavens
In comparison with the Supremely Enlightened there was no deity who shone
The Supremely Enlightened alone shone surpassing all of the other deities
When those powerful deities assembled Aṅkura withdrew and sat down twelve leagues distant while Indaka sat down on the right hand of the Teacher
The Teacher surveyed them both and desiring to make known how great is the fruit that accrues in his dispensation to him who bestows offerings on those that are worthy of offerings said to Aṅkura After a long time although for ten thousand years you made a row of fireplaces twelve leagues in length and gave abundant offerings upon coming to my assembly you have sat down farthest removed of all twelve leagues distant What can be the cause of this
Moreover it is said
The Supremely Enlightened looked upon Aṅkura and Indaka
Declaring who is worthy of offerings he uttered these words
You gave abundant offerings Aṅkura Yet after a long interval
You sit afar offCome to me
The sound of these words reached the surface of the earth
and all that multitude heard it
When the Teacher had thus spoken
Roused by the Righteous Teacher Aṅkura spoke thus
What good have these gifts done me Is emptiness bestowed by him that is worthy of offerings
This Yakkha Indaka gave but slender gifts
Yet he outshines us even as the moon outshines the hosts of stars
Now when Aṅkura had thus spoken the Teacher addressed Indaka Indaka you sit on my right hand why do you sit there and depart not
Indaka replied Reverend Sir like a farmer who has sown a little seed in a good field I have received the blessing of him that is worthy of offerings And making clear who are worthy of offerings and who are not Indaka said
Even as seed however abundant sown on a barren soil
Does not produce much fruit and does not delight the farmer
So also alms however abundant bestowed upon evil men
Do not produce much fruit and do not delight the giver
But even as seed however little in amount sown in a good field
Produces fruit after a heavy shower and delights the farmer
So also when done for the virtuous and righteous and holy
A good deed however slight yields abundant fruit
But what was Indakas former deed
The story goes that on a certain occasion when the Elder Anuruddha entered the village to receive alms he gave him a spoonful of his own food
This was Indakas work of merit Although Aṅkura had for ten thousand years made a row of fireplaces twelve leagues long and had given abundant alms Indakas deed received the greater reward
Therefore spoke Indaka as he did
Thereupon the Teacher said Aṅkura one should use discrimination in giving alms In that way alms like seed sown on good soil yield abundant fruit
But you did not do so Hence your alms did not become fruitful To make the matter clearer he said
Alms should be given with discrimination so given it yields abundant fruit They that give alms with discrimination go to heaven
The giving of alms with discrimination is extolled by the Happy One
Alms given to living beings here in the world who are worthy of offerings
Yield abundant fruit
like seeds sown on good ground
Having thus spoken he expounded the Law further by pronouncing the following Stanzas
Weeds ruin a field lust ruins mankind
Therefore alms given to those that are free from lust yield abundant fruit
Weeds ruin a field hatred ruins mankind
Therefore alms given to those that are free from hatred yield abundant fruit
Weeds ruin a field delusion ruins mankind
Therefore alms given to those that are free from delusion yield abundant fruit
Weeds ruin a field inordinate desire ruins mankind
Therefore alms given to those that are free from inordinate desire yield abundant fruit
And thus for the space of three months without interruption he recited the Abhidhamma Piṭaka
Now when it was time for him to go on his round for alms he would create a double and say to him Preach the Law until I return Then he would himself go to the Himālaya and after chewing a betel toothstick and rinsing his mouth in the waters of Lake Anotatta he would bring alms from Uttarakuru and seating himself in the garden of a man of wealth he would eat his meal
The Elder Sāriputta went to the World of the Tusita gods and waited upon the Teacher
When the Teacher had finished his meal he said Sāriputta today I have recited the Law soandsofar therefore do you recite it to the five hundred monks who depend upon you and he taught it to the Elder
We are told that through faith in the Twin Miracle five hundred youths of respectable families became monks under the Elder
When he had thus spoken he returned to the World of the Gods and preached the Law in person beginning at the place where the counterpart of the Buddha had left off
The Elder returned to the world of men and preached the Law to those monks
We are told that in the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa they were little bats On a certain occasion as they hung over a mountaincave they overheard two monks reciting the Abhidhamma as they walked up and down their walk and straightway fell in love with their voices
As for the expressions These aggregates of being these elements of being they did not know what they meant but solely because they had fallen in love with their voices when they passed from that state of existence they were reborn in the World of the Gods There for the space of an interval between two Buddhas they enjoyed celestial glory afterwards they were reborn in Sāvatthi in the households of families of distinction
Receiving faith in the Twin Miracle they became monks under the Elder and were the first to obtain mastery over the Seven Books
The Teacher continued for the space of three months in the same way to recite the Abhidhamma Piṭaka
At the conclusion of his recitation of the Law eight hundred thousands of millions of deities obtained clear comprehension of the Law and Mahā Māyā was established in the Fruit of Conversion
That multitude thirtysix leagues in extent knowing that the Terminal Festival would occur seven days later approached the Elder Moggallāna the Great and said to him Reverend Sir is it not proper for us to know on what day the Teacher will descend We will not depart hence until we see the Teacher
Venerable Moggallāna the Great replied Very well brethren and diving into the earth right there he went to the foot of Mount Sineru Then he willed Let the multitude behold me as I climb Then he climbed the side of Mount Sineru his form appearing like the thread of a yellow blanket pulled through a jewel
The multitude watched him and cried out from time to time He has climbed one league He has climbed two leagues 
When the Elder had climbed the mountain he prostrated himself before the Teacher uplifting the Teachers feet with the crown of his head and spoke thus to him Reverend Sir the multitude desire to go where they can see you when will you descend
But Moggallāna where is your older brother Sāriputta
Reverend Sir he is keeping residence at the gate of the city Sakassa
Moggallāna seven days hence I will descend for the great Terminal Festival to the gate of the city Sakassa those who desire to see me must go there Now the distance from Sāvatthi to Sakassa was thirty leagues and no one could supply the multitude with provisions for so long a journey So the Teacher said Tell them to take upon themselves the vows of Fastday and to go forth as though they were going to a neighboring monastery to hear the Law
Very well Reverend Sir replied the Elder and returning to the multitude he told them what the Teacher had said
When the season of the rains had passed and the Terminal Festival had been celebrated the Teacher informed Sakka Great king it is my intention to return to the path of men
Thereupon Sakka created three ladders one of gold one of jewels and one of silver
The feet of these ladders rested against the gate of the city Sakassa and their tops against the summit of Mount Sineru
On the right side was the ladder of gold for the deities on the left side the ladder of silver for Mahā Brahmā and his train and in the middle the ladder of jewels for the Tathāgata
On the occasion of the Descent of the Gods the Teacher standing on the summit of Mount Sineru performed the Twin Miracle and looked up There was a clear view of the nine Worlds of Brahmā
As he looked down he had a clear view as far as the Avīci Hell
Then he looked forth to the four cardinal points and to the four intermediate points and there was a clear view of countless thousands of worlds
Gods looked upon men and men looked upon gods
The deities descended upon the ladder of gold Mahā Brahmā and his train descended upon the ladder of silver and the Supremely Enlightened One himself descended upon the ladder of jewels
Pañcasikha the celestial musician took his yellow lute of Vilva wood and descending on the Buddhas right rendered honor to the Teacher with the notes of his sweet celestial lute Mātali the charioteer descending on the Buddhas left rendered honor to the Teacher with celestial scents garlands and flowers Mahā Brahmā held a parasol Suyāma a yaks tail fan
With this retinue did the Teacher descend and set foot on earth at the gate of the city Sakassa
Elder Sāriputta approached the Teacher and paid obeisance to him And because he had never before seen the Teacher descend with such majesty the glorious majesty of a Buddha he spoke thus
Never have I seen nor has any one ever heard
The Teacher speaking so sweetly now returned from Tusita with his following
With this Stanza and with many others did Elder Sāriputta express his joy Having so done he said to the Teacher Reverend Sir today all gods and men hold you dear and seek after you
The Teacher replied Sāriputta with such virtues as these are the Buddhas endowed and therefore are they dear to gods and men alike So saying he expounded the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza
They that are devoted to meditation they that are steadfast They that delight in the tranquillity of retirement from the world
They that are enlightened and mindful they are beloved even of the gods
At the four cardinal points and at the four intermediate points stood gods and men to the World of Brahmā above and below Nāgas and Supaṇṇas stood on the ground in an attitude of reverent supplication Said they Reverend Sir there is no one here who can answer this question consider it no further
Said the Teacher Sāriputta is perplexed to hear this question adapted to the comprehension of a Buddha
Of all that have weighed the Law and attained Arahatship Of all that are yet under training of all that have not yet attained the Fruit of Conversion
As to their walk and conversation do thou who knowest Being asked tell me Venerable Sir
Thought the Teacher Although there is no doubt in Sāriputtas mind regarding the meaning of the question since he understands that I am asking a question relating to the walk and conversation of those who are yet under training and to those who have finished their training and attained Arahatship yet there is doubt in his mind regarding my purpose in asking the question and he is considering within himself Of the aggregates of being the elements of being and the organs and objects of sense by which one of these can I best grasp the intent of the Teacher Unless I give him a clue he will not be able to answer the question I will therefore give him a clue Therefore he said Sāriputta do you understand the expression This being
Then the following thought occurred to him So soon as Sāriputta grasps the thought that is in my mind he will answer the question in terms of the aggregates of being
No sooner had the Teacher given him a clue than the question became clear in a hundred ways and a thousand ways
with the assistance of the clue which the Teacher had given him the Elder straightway answered the question
We are told that with the sole exception of the Supremely Enlightened One there was no other able to answer the question which the Teacher asked the Elder Sāriputta
Therefore we are told the Elder took his stand before the Teacher and said with a shout of triumph Reverend Sir I can count the number of drops of rain that have fallen into the great ocean during all the rains which have fallen during an entire cycle of time and likewise the number of drops of rain that have fallen upon the ground and likewise the number of drops of rain which have fallen upon the mountains and I can set down an exact reckoning thereof
The Teacher replied Sāriputta I know your power of reckoning
Indeed there is nothing with which may be compared the learning of the Venerable Elder Sāriputta
That is why the Elder said
The sands along the Ganges waste away the waters in the ocean waste away
The particles of dust of the earth waste away the number thereof I can reckon by my knowledge
Thus did a monk so richly endowed although at first he saw neither the beginning nor the end of the question asked him which lay within the range of the Buddhas knowledge by taking advantage of the clue given him by the Teacher answer the question
When the monks heard of this they began the following discussion The Commander of the Faith the Elder Sāriputta answered all by himself a question which no one else in the whole world was able to answer
The Teacher hearing the discussion said This is not the first time that the Elder Sāriputta has answered a question which the whole world was unable to answer he did the same thing in a previous state of existence And when he had thus spoken he related a Story of the Past
Though a thousand and more should assemble together
who lack wisdom and prattle for a hundred years
Yet were a single man of wisdom superior
who replied He only shall have the bowl who can fly through the air and take it
whereupon the rock settled in the same place in which it had lain before
gathered together and began to follow the Elder saying to him Reverend Sir show us also the miracle
now he is running away from us but since we are not willing that he should get away from us we are pursuing him 
and the heretics looked like mottled cows
one end of which rested upon the eastern rim of the world and the other upon the western rim
from every pore of his body proceeded forth flames of fire and from every pore of his body proceeded forth a stream of water Sixcolored were they blue and yellow and red and white and pink and brilliant
not wearying them with uninterrupted discourse but giving them sufficient opportunity to refresh themselves from time to time
that in case any person took pleasure in any portion of the Law or in any miracle the Buddha preached the Law and performed a miracle in accordance with the temper and disposition of every such person
the double then asked him questions and the Teacher answered them
Seeing the Teacher perform his miracle thus and hearing him preach the Law two hundred millions of living beings in that vast throng obtained Comprehension of the Law
the true explanation is that when he lifted up his foot the mountains huddled under his feet and when he strode forward they rose again and stood in their proper places
As he sat there outshining with the splendor of his own body all the other deities his mother approached from the Palace of the Tusita gods and sat down on his right hand Aṅkura on his left hand
the deity Indaka likewise approached and sat down on his right hand and Aṅkura on his left hand
Then seated in the midst of the assembly of the gods for the sake of his mother the Teacher began the recitation of the Abhidhamma Piṭaka beginning with the words Those things which are good those things which are evil those things which are neither good nor evil
and that it was with reference to these youths that the Teacher thus spoke
while the Teacher yet remained in the World of the Gods they mastered Seven Books
in all that assembly thirtysix leagues in circuit not one looked upon the glory of the Buddha that day but desired for himself the estate of a Buddha
It is the invariable practice of all the Buddhas we are told after they have performed the Twin Miracle to spend the season of the rains in the World of the Gods and to descend to the world of men at the gate of the city Sakassa
And there marking the spot where they set their right foot on the ground there is a permanent shrine
There the Teacher took his stand and asked a question within the comprehension of those who had not yet attained the Fruit of Conversion Those who had not yet attained the Fruit of Conversion readily answered the question which was within their comprehension but were unable to answer the question adapted to the comprehension of those who had attained the Fruit of Conversion
In like manner those who had attained the Fruit of Conversion were unable to answer the question adapted to the comprehension of those who had attained the Fruit of the Second Path Similarly the rest of the Chief Disciples were unable to answer the question within the range of Moggallāna the Great Moggallāna the Great was unable to answer the question within the range of the Elder Sāriputta and the Elder Sāriputta was unable to answer the question within the range of the Buddha
The Teacher looked first to the east and then to each of the other cardinal points It was one great court
Now at that time a new reception hall named Ubbhataka had just been built by the Pāvā Mallans and it had not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative brahman or anyone at all in human form
the five bhikkhus were disgusted and left me thinking The recluse Gotama now lives luxuriously he has given up his striving and reverted to luxury
And he related this Jātaka in detail
if he understand that which another speaks
Because the load was heavy because the road was deep with mud
They harnessed Blackie and he straightway drew the load
One should always speak kindly under no circumstances should one speak harshly
For one who spoke kindly he drew a heavy load
And brought him wealth and all because he liked him
as happens in one who abides diligent ardent and resolute
The Pāvā Mallans heard The Blessed One they say wandering among the Mallans with a large Saṅgha of monksapproximately  monks in allhas arrived at Pāvā and is staying near Pāvā in Cunda the silversmiths mango grove
So the Pāvā Mallans went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to him Lord a new reception hall named Ubbhataka has just been built by the Pāvā Mallans and it has not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative brahman or anyone at all in human form
May the Blessed One be the first to use it When the Blessed One has used it first the Pāvā Mallans will use it afterwards
That will be for their longterm welfare  happiness
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Sensing his acquiescence the Pāvā Mallans got up from their seats bowed down to him circumambulated him and then went to the new reception hall On arrival they spread it all over with felt rugs arranged seats set out a water vessel and raised an oil lamp Then they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one side
As they were standing there they said to him Lord the reception hall has been covered all over with felt rugs seats have been arranged a water vessel has been set out and an oil lamp raised
It is now time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fit
So the Blessed Oneafter adjusting his under robe and carrying his bowl  outer robewent together with the Saṅgha of monks to the reception hall On arrival he washed his feet entered the hall and sat with his back to the central post facing east
The Saṅgha of monks washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the western wall facing east ranged around the Blessed One
The Pāvā Mallans washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the eastern wall facing west ranged around the Blessed One
Then the Blessed Onehaving spent most of the night instructing urging rousing  encouraging the Pāvā Mallans with a Dhamma talkdismissed them saying The night is far gone Vaseṭṭhas
Do what you think it is now time to do
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the Pāvā Mallans got up from their seats and bowing down to him  circumambulating him left
Then not long after the Pāvā Mallans had left the Blessed Onesurveying the silent Saṅgha of monksaddressed Ven Sāriputta Sāriputta the Saṅgha of monks is free of drowsiness
Let yourself be inspired by a Dhamma talk for them
My back aches
I will rest it
As you say lord Ven Sāriputta responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One having had his outer robe arranged folded in four lay down on his right side in the lions sleeping posture with one foot on top of the other mindful  alert having made a mental note to get up
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the Mallans with a large Saṅgha of monksapproximately  monks in alland arrived at Pāvā a city of the Mallans
There he stayed near Pāvā in Cunda the silversmiths mango grove
Now on that occasion Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta had recently died in Pāvā
On his death the Nigaṇṭhas had split into two factions They kept arguing quarreling  disputing stabbing one another with weapons of the mouth You dont understand this DhammaVinaya I understand this DhammaVinaya How could you understand this DhammaVinaya
You practice wrongly I practice rightly
Im consistent Youre inconsistent
What should be said first you said last What should be said last you said first
What you cogitated so long has been turned inside out Your position has been overthrown Youre trapped so go try to release your position or disentangle yourself if you can
Nothing but slaughter as it were was being committed among the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭasons
Even the lay disciples of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta dressed in white seemed disenchanted disgusted  repelled by the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭasons and at how that poorly proclaimed DhammaVinaya was poorly expounded not leading out not conducive to calming expounded by one who was not rightly selfawakened its foundation now broken without an arbiter
So Ven Sāriputta addressed the monks Friends Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta has recently died in Pāvā On his death the Nigaṇṭhas have split into two factions Even the lay disciples of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta dressed in white seem disenchanted disgusted  repelled by the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭasons and at how that poorly proclaimed DhammaVinaya was poorly expounded not leading out not conducive to calming expounded by one who was not rightly selfawakened its foundation now broken without an arbiter
Thats the way it is friends with a poorly proclaimed DhammaVinaya poorly expounded not leading out not conducive to calming expounded by one who is not rightly selfawakened
But our Dhamma of the Blessed One is well expounded leading out conducive to calming expounded by one who is rightly selfawakened
So it should all be recited together without dispute so that this holy life will endure  last a long time That will be for the benefit  happiness of many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of devas  human beings
And which is our Dhamma of the Blessed One that is well expounded leading out conducive to calming expounded by one who is rightly selfawakened that should all be recited together without dispute so that this holy life will endure  last a long time and that will be for the benefit  happiness of many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of devas  human beings
There is friends one dhamma that is rightly expounded by the Blessed Onethe one who knows the one who sees the Worthy One rightly selfawakened
That should all be recited together without dispute so that this holy life will endure  last a long time and that will be for the benefit  happiness of many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of devas  human beings
Which one dhamma
 All beings are maintained by nutriment
 All beings are maintained by fabrication
This friends is one dhamma that is rightly expounded by the Blessed Onethe one who knows the one who sees the Worthy One rightly selfawakened
That should all be recited together without dispute so that this holy life will endure  last a long time and that will be for the benefit  happiness of many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of devas  human beings
There are friends two dhammas that are rightly expounded by the Blessed Onethe one who knows the one who sees the Worthy One rightly selfawakened
Those should all be recited together without dispute so that this holy life will endure  last a long time and that will be for the benefit  happiness of many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of devas  human beings
Which two dhammas
 Name  form
 Ignorance  craving for becoming
 The view of becoming  the view of nonbecoming
 Lack of shame  lack of compunction
 Shame  compunction
 Being hard to instruct  evil friendship
 Being easy to instruct  admirable friendship

The thought occurs to him O thatwith the breakup of the body after deathI may be reborn among the Devas Who Wield Power Over the Creations of Others He fixes on that thought determines on that thought develops that thought
And that thought released on a low level and not developed to anything higher leads to rebirth right there
But I say this of a virtuous person not of an unvirtuous one
A virtuous persons act of directing awareness succeeds through purity
And further a certain person gives a gift to a contemplative or a brahmanfood drink cloth sandals garlands scents ointments beds dwellings lighting

He hears The Devas of Brahmās Retinue are longlived beautiful  replete with pleasure
The thought occurs to him O thatwith the breakup of the body after deathI may be reborn among the Devas of Brahmās Retinue
He fixes on that thought determines on that thought develops that thought And that thought released on a low level and not developed to anything higher leads to rebirth right there
But I say this of a virtuous person not of an unvirtuous one of one devoid of passion not of one with passion
A virtuous persons act of directing awareness succeeds through purity

Those should all be recited together without dispute so that this holy life will endure  last a long time and that will be for the benefit  happiness of many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of devas  human beings
Then the Blessed One having gotten up said to Ven Sāriputta Excellent Sāriputta Excellent Its excellent how you have spoken to the monks of the sequence for reciting together
That is what Ven Sāriputta said the Teacher approved and gratified
the monks delighted in Ven Sāriputtas words
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Icchanangala in the wood near Icchanangala
Now on that occasion a number of wellknown welltodo brahmins were staying at Icchanangala that is the brahmin Canki the brahmin Tarukkha the brahmin Pokkharasati the brahmin Janussoni the brahmin Todeyya and other wellknown welltodo brahmins
Then while the brahmin students Vasettha and Bharadvaja were walking and wandering for exercise this discussion arose between them How is one a brahmin
The brahmin student Bharadvaja said When one is wellborn on both sides of pure maternal and paternal descent seven generations back unassailable and impeccable in respect of birth then one is a brahmin
The brahmin student Vasettha said When one is virtuous and fulfils the observances then one is a brahmin
But the brahmin student Bharadvaja could not convince the brahmin student Vasettha nor could the brahmin student Vasettha convince the brahmin student Bharadvaja
Then the brahmin student Vasettha addressed the brahmin student Bharadvaja Sir the recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan is living at Icchanangala in the wood near Icchanangala
Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed
Come Bharadvaja let us go to the recluse Gotama and ask him about this matter
As he answers so we will remember it
 Yes sir the brahmin student Bharadvaja replied
Then the two brahmin students Vasettha and Bharadvaja went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished they sat down at one side
We have attained full mastery Over all that the Vedic experts teach
A dispute has arisen between us Gotama Concerning the question of birth and class
Since neither of us could convince the other Or make him see his point of view
As people turn with palms upraised Towards the moon when it reaches fullness
So now we ask of you Gotama The eye uprisen in the world
Explain to us who do not know How we should recognise a brahmin
Buddha  I will explain to you  Vasettha said the Blessed One
The generic divisions of living beings For many are the kinds of birth
Know first the grass and trees Though they lack selfawareness
Next come the moths and butterflies And so on through as far as ants
Then know the kinds of quadrupeds Of varied sorts both small and large
Know those whose bellies are their feet To wit the longbacked class of snakes
Know too the waterdwelling fish That pasture in the liquid world
Next know the birds that wing their way As they range in open skies
While in these births the differences Of birth make their distinctive mark
Nor in the hairs nor in the head Nor in the ears nor in the eyes
In human bodies in themselves Nothing distinctive can be found
Distinction among human beings Is purely verbal designation
Who makes his living among men By varied crafts you should know
Who makes his living among men By merchandise you should know
Who makes his living among men By serving others you should know
Who makes his living among men By stealing you should know
Who makes his living among men By archery you should know
Who makes his living among men By priestly craft you should know
Whoever governs among men The town and realm you should know
I call him not a brahmin Because of his origin and lineage
If impediments still lurk in him He is just one who says Sir
Who is unimpeded and clings no more He is the one I call a brahmin
Who has cut off all fetters And is no more by anguish shaken
Who has cut each strap and thong The reins and bridleband as well
Who endures without a trace of hate Abuse violence and bondage too
Who does not flare up with anger Dutiful virtuous and humble
Who like the rain on lotus leaves Or mustard seed on the point of an awl
Who knows right here within himself The destruction of all suffering
Who with deep understanding wise Can tell the path from the notpath
Aloof alike from householders And those gone into homelessness
Who has laid aside the rod Against all beings frail or bold
Who is unopposed among opponents Peaceful among those given to violence
Who has dropped all lust and hate Dropped conceit and contempt
Who utters speech free from harshness Full of meaning ever truthful
Who in the world will never take What is not given long or short
Who has no more inner yearnings Regarding this world and the next
Who has no more indulgences No more perplexity since he knows
Who by transcending all ties here About both merit and evil deeds
Who pure as the spotless moon Is clear and limpid and in whom
Who has passed beyond the swamp The mire samsara all delusion
Who has abandoned sensual pleasures And wanders here in homelessness
Who has abandoned craving too And wanders here in homelessness
Who leaves behind all human bonds And has cast off the bonds of heaven
Who leaves behind delight and discontent Who is cool and without attachment
Who knows how beings pass away To reappear in many a mode
Whose destination is unknown To gods to spirits and to men
Who has no impediments at all Before behind or in the middle
The herds leader perfected hero The great seer whose victory is won
Who knows his manifold past lives And sees the heavens and states of woe
For name and clan are assigned As mere designations in the world
For those who do not know this fact Wrong views have long underlain their hearts
One is not a brahmin by birth Nor by birth a nonbrahmin
By action is one a brahmin By action is one a nonbrahmin
For men are farmers by their acts And by their acts are craftsmen too
And men are robbers by their acts And by their acts are soldiers too
So that is how the truly wise See action as it really is
Living beings are bound by action Like the chariot wheel by the pin
When this was said the brahmin students Vasettha and Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama
From today let Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone to him for refuge for life
And I sat down thinking This will serve for striving
Now these three similes occurred to me spontaneously never heard before
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Bodhi treethe tree of awakeningnewly awakened
And on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of release
At the end of seven days he emerged from that concentration
Then a certain overbearing brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One To what extent Master Gotama is one a brahman And which are the qualities that make one a brahman
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Any brahman who has banished evil qualities
not overbearing not stained his mind controlled
gone to the end of wisdom the holy life completed
Rightly would that brahman speak the holy teaching
He has no swelling of pride anywhere in the world
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion Ven Sāriputta Ven Mahā Moggalāna Ven Mahā Kassapa Ven Mahā Kaccāna Ven Mahā Koṭṭhita Ven Mahā Kappina Ven Mahā Cunda Ven Anuruddha Ven Revata and Ven Nanda went to the Blessed One
The Blessed One saw them coming from afar and on seeing them addressed the monks Monks those are brahmans who are coming Monks those are brahmans who are coming
When this was said a certain monk who was a brahman by birth said to the Blessed One To what extent lord is one a brahman And which are the qualities that make one a brahman
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Having banished evil qualities those who go about ever mindful
awakened their fetters ended They in the world are truly brahmans
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
And on that occasion Ven Mahā Kassapa was staying at the Pipphali Cave afflicted in pain  seriously ill
Then at a later time he recovered from his illness
When he had recovered from the illness the thought occurred to him What if I were to go into Rājagaha for alms
Now on that occasion  devatās were in a state of eagerness for the chance to give alms to Ven Mahā Kassapa
But Ven Mahā Kassapa turning down those  devatās early in the morning adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent into Rājagaha for alms along the streets of the poor the streets of the indigent the streets of the weavers
The Blessed One saw that Ven Mahā Kassapa had gone into Rājagaha for alms along the streets of the poor the streets of the indigent the streets of the weavers
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Supporting no others unknown tamed established in what is essential
effluents ended anger disgorged Hes what I call a brahman
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Pāva at the Ajakalāpaka HerdofGoats shrine the dwelling of the Ajakalāpaka spirit
And on that occasion in the pitchblack darkness of the night the Blessed One was sitting in the open air and the rain was falling in scattered drops
Then the Ajakalāpaka spiritwanting to cause fear terror  horripilation in the Blessed Onewent to him and on arrival not far from him three times made a commotion  pandemonium Commotion  pandemonium Commotion  pandemonium Commotion  pandemoniumThats a goblin for you contemplative
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
When with regard to his own qualities a brahman is one who has gone beyond
he transcends this goblin and his pandemonium
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion Ven Saṅgāmaji had arrived in Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One
His former wife heard Master Saṅgāmaji they say has arrived in Sāvatthī
Taking her small child she went to Jetas Grove
On that occasion Ven Saṅgāmaji was sitting at the root of a tree for the days abiding
His former wife went to him and on arrival said to him Look after me contemplative with a little son
When this was said Ven Saṅgāmaji remained silent
A second time
When this was said Ven Saṅgāmaji remained silent
A third time his former wife said to him Look after me contemplative with a little son
A third time Ven Saṅgāmaji remained silent
Then his former wife taking the baby and leaving him in front of Ven Saṅgāmaji went away saying Thats your son contemplative Look after him
Then Ven Saṅgāmaji neither looked at the child nor spoke to him
His wife after going not far away was looking back and saw Ven Saṅgāmaji neither looking at the child nor speaking to him On seeing this the thought occurred to her The contemplative doesnt even care about his son
Returning from there and taking the child she left
The Blessed Onewith his divine eye purified and surpassing the humansaw Ven Saṅgāmajis former wife misbehaving in that way
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
At her coming he didnt delight at her leaving he didnt grieve
A victor in battle freed from the tie Hes what I call a brahman
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Gayā at Gayā Head
And on that occasion many asceticson the cold winter nights of the BetweentheEights when the snow was falling in Gayājumped up in the water jumped down in the water did a jumpingupdown in the water poured  and performed the fire sacrifice Through this there is purity
The Blessed One saw those many asceticson the cold winter nights of the BetweentheEights when the snow was falling in Gayājumping up in the water jumping down in the water doing a jumpingupdown in the water pouring  and performing the fire sacrifice Through this there is purity
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Not by water is one clean though many people are bathing here
Whoever has truth  rectitude Hes a clean one he a brahman
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Muccalinda tree newly awakened
And on that occasion he sat for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of release
And on that occasion a great outofseason stormcloud rose up with seven days of rainy weather cold winds  intense darkness
Then Muccalinda the nāga kingleaving his dwelling place and encircling the Blessed Ones body seven times with his coilsstood with his great hood spread over the Blessed One Dont let the Blessed One be disturbed by cold Dont let the Blessed One be disturbed by heat Dont let the Blessed One be disturbed by the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  creeping things
Then with the passing of seven days the Blessed One emerged from that concentration
Muccalinda the nāga king realizing that the sky had cleared and was free of clouds unraveled his coils from the body of the Blessed One dropped his own appearance and assuming the appearance of a young man stood in front of the Blessed One with hands before his heart paying homage
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Blissful is solitude for one whos content who has heard the Dhamma who sees
Blissful is nonaffliction with regard for the world restraint for living beings
Blissful is dispassion with regard for the world the overcoming of sensuality
But the subduing of the conceit I am That is truly the ultimate bliss
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion a large number of monks after the meal on returning from their alms round were sitting gathered together in the assembly hall when this discussion arose Friends which of these two kings has greater wealth greater possessions the greater treasury the larger realm the greater stock of riding animals the greater army greater power greater might King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha or King Pasenadi of Kosala
And this discussion came to no conclusion
Then the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the assembly hall and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out
Seated he addressed the monks For what topic are you sitting together here And what was the discussion that came to no conclusion
Just now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we were sitting gathered here at the assembly hall when this discussion arose Friends which of these two kings has greater wealth greater possessions the greater treasury the larger realm the greater stock of riding animals the greater army greater power greater might King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha or King Pasenadi of Kosala
This was the discussion that had come to no conclusion when the Blessed One arrived
It isnt proper monks that sons of good families on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should talk on such a topic
When you have gathered you have two duties either Dhammatalk or noble silence
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Any sensual bliss in the world any heavenly bliss
isnt worth one sixteenthsixteenth of the bliss of the ending of craving
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion a large number of boys on the road between Sāvatthī  Jetas Grove were hitting a snake with a stick
Then early in the morning the Blessed One adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent into Sāvatthī for alms
He saw the large number of boys on the road between Sāvatthī  Jetas Grove hitting the snake with a stick
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Whoever hits with a stick beings desiring ease
when he himself is looking for ease will meet with no ease after death
Whoever doesnt hit with a stick beings desiring ease
when he himself is looking for ease will meet with ease after death
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion a certain lay follower from Icchānaṅgalaka had arrived in Sāvatthī on some business affairs
Having settled his affairs in Sāvatthī he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him At long last you have managed to come here
For a long time lord have I wanted to come see the Blessed One but being involved in one business affair after another
I have not been able to do so
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
How blissful it is for one who has nothing
who has mastered the Dhamma is learned
See him suffering one who has something
a person bound in body with people
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion the Blessed One was worshipped revered honored venerated and given homagea recipient of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
The community of monks was also worshipped revered honored venerated and given homagea recipient of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
But the wanderers of other sects were not worshipped revered honored venerated or given homage nor were they recipients of robes alms food lodgings or medicinal requisites for the sick
So the wanderers of other sects unable to stand the veneration given to the Blessed One and the community of monks on seeing monks in village or wilderness would insult revile irritate  harass them with discourteous abusive language
Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to him At present the Blessed One is worshipped revered honored venerated and given homagea recipient of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
The community of monks is also worshipped revered honored venerated and given homagea recipient of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
But the wanderers of other sects are not worshipped revered honored venerated or given homage nor are they recipients of robes alms food lodgings or medicinal requisites for the sick
So the wanderers of other sects unable to stand the veneration given to the Blessed One and the community of monks on seeing monks in village or wilderness insult revile irritate  harass them with discourteous abusive language
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
When in contact with pleasure or pain in village or wilderness
dont take it as yours or as others
Contacts make contact dependent on a sense of acquisition
Where theres no sense of acquisition contacts would make contact with what
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion the young wife of a certain wanderer was pregnant and on the verge of delivery
So she said to the wanderer Go brahman get some oil for my delivery
When this was said the wanderer said to her But where can I get any oil
A second time she said to him Go brahman get some oil for my delivery
A second time he said to her But where can I get any oil
A third time she said to him Go brahman get some oil for my delivery
Now on that occasion at the storehouse of King Pasenadi Kosala contemplatives  brahmans were being given as much oil or ghee as they needed to drink but not to take away
So the thought occurred to the wanderer At present at the storehouse of King Pasenadi Kosala contemplatives  brahmans are being given as much oil or ghee as they need to drink but not to take away
Suppose having gone there I were to drink as much oil as I need and on returning home vomiting it up were to give it to use at this delivery
So having gone to the storehouse of King Pasenadi Kosala he drank as much oil as he needed but on returning home was unable to bring it up or pass it down
So he rolled back  forth suffering from fierce pains sharp  severe
Then early in the morning the Blessed One adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent into Sāvatthī for alms
He saw the wanderer rolling back  forth suffering from fierce pains sharp  severe
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
How blissful it is for one who has nothing
Attainersofwisdom are people with nothing
See him suffering one who has something
a person bound in mind with people
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion the dear and beloved only son of a certain lay follower had died
So a large number of lay followerstheir clothes wet their hair wetwent to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them Why have you come hereyour clothes wet your hair wetin the middle of the day
When this was said the lay follower said to the Blessed One My dear and beloved only son lord has died
This is why we have come hereour clothes wet our hair wetin the middle of the day
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Tied down by the allure of what seems dear
hosts of devas most human beings
worn out with misery
fall under the sway of the King of Death
But those who day  night
heedfully abandon what seems dear
dig up misery by the root
Deaths bait so hard to overcome
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Kuṇḍiya in the Kuṇḍiṭṭhāna forest
And on that occasion Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter had been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor
Shetouched by fierce sharp painsendured them with three thoughts How rightly selfawakened is the Blessed One who abandoning this sort of suffering teaches the Dhamma How wellpracticed is the community of the Blessed Ones disciples who practice abandoning this sort of suffering How truly blissful is unbinding where this sort of pain is not found
Then Suppavāsā said to her husband Come young master Go to the Blessed One and on arrival showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort saying Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort
And say this Suppavāsā has been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor
Shetouched by fierce sharp painsendures them with three thoughts How rightly selfawakened is the Blessed One who abandoning this sort of suffering teaches the Dhamma How wellpracticed is the community of the Blessed Ones disciples who practice abandoning this sort of suffering How truly blissful is unbinding where this sort of pain is not found
Responding Excellent to Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter the Koliyanson went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort And she says this Suppavāsā has been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor
Shetouched by fierce sharp painsendures them with three thoughts How rightly selfawakened is the Blessed One who abandoning this sort of suffering teaches the Dhamma How wellpracticed is the community of the Blessed Ones disciples who practice abandoning this sort of suffering How truly blissful is unbinding where this sort of pain is not found
The Blessed One said May Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter be well  free from disease And may she deliver a son free from disease
And at the same time as the Blessed Ones statement Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughterwell  free from diseasedelivered a son free from disease
Saying Very well lord the Koliyanson delighting in  approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One andcircling him to the rightreturned to his home
He saw that Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughterwell  free from diseasehad delivered a son free from disease
On seeing this the thought occurred to him How amazing How astoundingthe Tathāgatas great power great might in that at the same time as the Blessed Ones statement Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughterwell  free from diseasewould deliver a son free from disease
Gratified he was joyful rapturous  happy
Then Suppavāsā said to her husband Come young master Go to the Blessed One and on arrival showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name saying Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet And say this Suppavāsā who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor
has nowwell  free from diseasedelivered a son free from disease
She invites the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for seven days of meals
May the Blessed One acquiesce to Suppavāsās seven meals together with the community of monks
Responding Excellent to Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter the Koliyanson went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One
Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet And she says this Suppavāsā who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor
has nowwell  free from diseasedelivered a son free from disease
She invites the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for seven days of meals
May the Blessed One acquiesce to Suppavāsās seven meals together with the community of monks
Now at that time a certain lay follower had invited the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for the next days meal
That lay follower was a supporter of Ven Mahā Moggallāna
So the Blessed One addressed Ven Mahā Moggallāna Come Moggallāna Go to the lay follower and on arrival say to him Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor
has nowwell  free from diseasedelivered a son free from disease
She has invited the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for seven days of meals
Let Suppavāsā do seven meals Afterward you will do yours
Hes your supporter

She has invited the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for seven days of meals
Let Suppavāsā do seven meals afterward you will do yours
Venerable sir if Ven Moggallāna will be my guarantor for three things wealth life  faiththen let Suppavāsā do seven meals afterward I will do mine
For two things friend will I be your guarantor your wealth  life
Only you are the guarantor of your faith
Venerable sir if Ven Moggallāna will be my guarantor for two things wealth  lifethen let Suppavāsā do seven meals afterward I will do mine
Then Ven Moggallāna having conciliated the lay follower went to the Blessed One and on arrival said The lay follower lord has been conciliated Let Suppavāsā do seven meals afterward he will do his
So for seven days Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter with her own hand served  satisfied the community of monks with the Buddha at its head with exquisite staple  nonstaple food And she had the child show reverence to the Blessed One and the community of monks
Then Ven Sāriputta said to the child I trust child that things are bearable for you I trust that things are comfortable for you I trust that theres no pain
From where Ven Sāriputta would things be bearable for me
From where would they be comfortable for me living seven years in a belly of blood
Then Suppavāsā My son is conversing with the Dhamma Generalwas gratified joyful rapturous  happy
The Blessed One knowing that Suppavāsā was gratified joyful rapturous  happy said to her Suppavāsā would you like to have another son like this
Lord Blessed One I would like to have seven more sons like this
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
The disagreeable in the guise of the agreeable the unlovable in the guise of the lovable
pain in the guise of bliss overcome one who is heedless
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migāras mother
And on that occasion Visākhā Migāras mother had some dealings with King Pasenadi Kosala
that he did not settle as she had wished
So in the middle of the day she went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her Well now Visākhā where are you coming from in the middle of the day
Just now lord I had some dealings with King Pasenadi Kosala that he did not settle as I had wished
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
All subjection to others is painful All independence is bliss
What is held in common brings suffering for duties are hard to overcome
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Anupiyā in the Mango Grove
And on that occasion Ven Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son on going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling would repeatedly exclaim What bliss What bliss
A large number of monks heard Ven Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son on going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling repeatedly exclaim What bliss What bliss
and on hearing him the thought occurred to them Theres no doubt but that Ven Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son doesnt enjoy leading the holy life for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship so that now on recollecting that when going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling he is repeatedly exclaiming What bliss What bliss
So they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they told him Ven Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son lord on going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling repeatedly exclaims What bliss What bliss
Theres no doubt but that Ven Bhaddiya doesnt enjoy leading the holy life
for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship so that now on recollecting that when going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling he is repeatedly exclaiming What bliss What bliss
Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk In my name call Bhaddiya saying The Teacher calls you friend Bhaddiya
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monk went to Ven Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son and on arrival he said to him The Teacher calls you friend Bhaddiya
Responding As you say my friend to the monk Ven Bhaddiya Kāḷigodhās son went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him
Is it true Bhaddiya thaton going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwellingyou repeatedly exclaim What bliss What bliss
Yes lord
What compelling reason do you have in mind thatwhen going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwellingyou repeatedly exclaim What bliss What bliss
Before when I has a householder maintaining the bliss of kingship lord I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments within and without the city within and without the countryside
But even though I was thus guarded thus protected I dwelled in fearagitated distrustful  afraid
But now on going alone to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling I dwell without fear unagitated confident  unafraidunconcerned unruffled living on the gifts of others with my mind like a wild deer
This is the compelling reason I have in mind thatwhen going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwellingI repeatedly exclaim What bliss What bliss
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
From whose heart there is no provocation
 for whom becoming  nonbecoming are overcome
he beyond fear blissful with no grief
is one the devas cant see
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion Ven Nandathe Blessed Ones brother son of his maternal auntannounced to a large number of monks I dont enjoy leading the holy life my friends I cant keep up the holy life Giving up the training I will return to the common life
Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he told the Blessed One Lord Ven Nandathe Blessed Ones brother son of his maternal aunthas announced to a large number of monks I dont enjoy leading the holy life my friends I cant keep up the holy life Giving up the training I will return to the common life
Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk In my name call Nanda saying The Teacher calls you friend Nanda
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monk went to Ven Nanda on arrival he said The Teacher calls you friend Nanda
Responding As you say my friend to the monk Ven Nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him
Is it true Nanda that you have announced to a large number of monks I dont enjoy leading the holy life my friends I cant keep up the holy life Giving up the training I will return to the common life
Yes lord
But why Nanda dont you enjoy leading the holy life Why cant you keep up the holy life Why giving up the training will you return to the common life
Lord as I was leaving home a Sakyan girlthe envy of the countrysideglanced up at me with her hair halfcombed and said Hurry back master
Recollecting that I dont enjoy leading the holy life I cant keep up the holy life Giving up the training I will return to the common life
Then taking Ven Nanda by the armas a strong man might flex his extended arm or extend his flexed armthe Blessed One disappeared from Jetas Grove and reappeared among the devas of the heaven of the Thirtythree Tāvatisa
Now on that occasion about  dovefooted nymphs had come to wait upon Sakka the ruler of the devas
The Blessed One said to Ven Nanda Nanda do you see these  dovefooted nymphs
Yes lord
What do you think Nanda Which is lovelier better looking more charming the Sakyan girl the envy of the countryside or these  dovefooted nymphs
Lord compared to these  dovefooted nymphs the Sakyan girl the envy of the countryside is like a cauterized monkey with its ears  nose cut off She doesnt count Shes not even a small fraction Theres no comparison
The  dovefooted nymphs are lovelier better looking more charming
Then take joy Nanda Take joy
I am your guarantor for getting  dovefooted nymphs
If the Blessed One is my guarantor for getting  dovefooted nymphs I will enjoy leading the holy life under the Blessed One
Then taking Ven Nanda by the armas a strong man might flex his extended arm or extend his flexed armthe Blessed One disappeared from among the devas of the heaven of the Thirtythree and reappeared at Jetas Grove
The monks heard They say that Ven Nandathe Blessed Ones brother son of his maternal auntis leading the holy life for the sake of nymphs They say that the Blessed One is his guarantor for getting  dovefooted nymphs
Then the monks who were companions of Ven Nanda went around addressing him as they would a hired hand  a person who had been bought Venerable Nanda they say has been hired Venerable Nanda they say has been bought Hes leading the holy life for the sake of nymphs The Blessed One is his guarantor for getting  dovefooted nymphs
Then Ven Nandahumiliated ashamed  disgusted that the monks who were his companions were addressing him as they would a hired hand  a person who had been boughtwent to dwell alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute He in no long time entered  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself right in the herenow
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for the sake of this world
And thus Ven Nanda became another one of the arahants
Then a certain devatā in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove approached the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him she stood to one side
As she was standing there she said to the Blessed One Lord Ven Nandathe Blessed Ones brother son of his maternal auntthrough the ending of the effluents has entered  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease directly knowing  realizing them for himself right in the herenow
And within the Blessed One the knowledge arose Nanda through the ending of the effluents has entered  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease directly knowing  realizing them for himself right in the herenow
Then when the night had passed Ven Nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord about the Blessed Ones being my guarantor for getting  dovefooted nymphs I hereby release the Blessed One from that promise
Nanda having comprehended your awareness with my own awareness I realized that Nanda through the ending of the effluents has entered  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease directly knowing  realizing them for himself right in the herenow
And a devatā informed me that Ven Nanda through the ending of the effluents has entered  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease directly knowing  realizing them for himself right in the herenow
When your mind through lack of clinging was released from the effluents I was thereby released from that promise
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
In whom the mire of sensuality is crossed over
the thorn of sensuality crushed
the ending of delusion reached
He doesnt quiver from pleasures  pains  a monk
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion a certain monk was sitting not far from the Blessed One his legs crossed his body held erect enduring fierce pains sharp  severe that were the result of old kammamindful alert without suffering
The Blessed One saw him sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect enduring fierce pains sharp  severe that were the result of old kammamindful alert and not struck down by them
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
For the monk who has left all kamma behind
shaking off the dust of the past
steady unpossessive Such
Theres no point in telling anyone else
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion approximately  monks headed by Ven Yasoja had arrived in Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One
As these visiting monks were exchanging greetings with the resident monks setting their lodgings in order and putting away their robes  bowls they made a loud racket a great racket
Then the Blessed One said to Ven nanda nanda what is that loud racket that great racket like fishermen with a catch of fish
Lord those are approximately  monks headed by Ven Yasoja who have arrived in Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One
As these visiting monks are exchanging greetings with the resident monks setting their lodgings in order and putting away their robes  bowls they are making a loud racket a great racket
In that case nanda tell those monks in my name The Teacher calls you friends
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda went to the monks and said The Teacher calls you friends
Responding As you say friend to Ven nanda the monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them
Monks why were you making that loud racket that great racket like fishermen with a catch of fish
When this was said Ven Yasoja said to the Blessed One Lord these  monks have arrived in Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One
As they were exchanging greetings with the resident monks setting their lodgings in order and putting away their robes  bowls they made a loud racket a great racket
Go away monks I dismiss you You are not to stay in my vicinity
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monks got up from their seats bowed down to the Blessed One and left circling him to the right Setting their lodgings in order and taking their robes  bowls they went wandering among the Vajjians
After wandering by stages among the Vajjians they came to the River Vaggamudā There on the bank of the River Vaggamudā they made leafhuts and entered the Rains Retreat
Then Ven Yasoja addressed the monks as they entered the Rains Retreat Friends the Blessed One dismissed us wishing for our benefit seeking our wellbeing being sympathetic and acting out of sympathy
Lets live in such a way that the Blessed One will be gratified by our way of living
As you say friend the monks responded to Ven Yasoja
And so living secluded ardent  resolute every one of them realized the Three Knowledges remembrance of past lives knowledge of the arising  passing away of living beings and knowledge of the ending of mental effluents in the course of that very Rains Retreat
Then the Blessed One having stayed as long as he liked in Sāvatthī went wandering in the direction of Vesālī
After wandering by stages he arrived in Vesālī
and stayed there in the Peaked Roof Pavilion in the Great Wood
Then encompassing with his awareness the awareness of the monks staying on the bank of the River Vaggamudā he said to Ven nanda This direction seems bright to me nanda This direction seems dazzling to me Its not at all repugnant for me
to go  pay attention to where the monks on the bank of the River Vaggamudā are staying
Send a messenger into their presence to say The Teacher calls you friends The Teacher wants to see you
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda went to a certain monk and said Come now friend Go to the monks on the bank of the River Vaggamudā and say to them The Teacher calls you friends The Teacher wants to see you
Responding As you say friend to Ven nanda the monkjust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from the Peaked Roof Pavilion in the Great Wood and appeared in front of the monks on the bank of the River Vaggamudā
Then he said to them The Teacher calls you friends The Teacher wants to see you
Responding As you say friend to the monk the monks set their lodgings in order and taking their robes  bowls disappeared from the bank of the River Vaggamudājust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armand appeared in the presence of the Blessed One in the Peaked Roof Pavilion in the Great Wood
Now at that time the Blessed One was sitting in imperturbable concentration either in the fourth jhāna the dimension of the infinitude of space or the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
The thought occurred to the monks Now in which mental dwelling is the Blessed One now residing
Then they realized He is residing in the imperturbable dwelling
So they all sat in imperturbable concentration
Then Ven nandawhen the night was far advanced at the end of the first watchgot up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him The night lord is far advanced The first watch has ended The visiting monks have been sitting here a long time May the Blessed One greet them
When this was said the Blessed One remained silent
Then a second time when the night was far advanced at the end of the middle watch Ven nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage to him with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him The night lord is far advanced The middle watch has ended The visiting monks have been sitting here a long time May the Blessed One greet them
When this was said the Blessed One remained silent
Then a third time when the night was far advanced at the end of the last watch as dawn was approaching and the face of the night was beaming Ven nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage to him with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him The night lord is far advanced The last watch has ended Dawn is approaching and the face of the night is beaming The visiting monks have been sitting here a long time May the Blessed One greet them
Then the Blessed One emerging from his imperturbable concentration said to Ven nanda nanda if you had known not even that much would have occurred to you 
I along with all  of these monks have been sitting in imperturbable concentration
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
In whom theyre defeated the thorn of sensuality
insult assault  imprisonment
Like a mountain standing unperturbed
he doesnt quiver from pleasures  pains  a monk
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion Ven Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Blessed One his legs crossed his body held erect having set mindfulness to the fore
The Blessed One saw Ven Sāriputta sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect having set mindfulness to the fore
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
As a mountain of rock is unwavering wellsettled
so a monk whose delusion is ended doesnt quiver just like a mountain
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion Ven Mahā Moggallāna was sitting not far from the Blessed One his legs crossed his body held erect having mindfulness immersed in the body wellestablished within
The Blessed One saw Ven Mahā Moggallāna sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect having mindfulness immersed in the body wellestablished within
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
With mindfulness immersed in the body
wellestablished restrained with regard to the six contactmedia
continually centered a monk
can know unbinding for himself
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels refuge
Now at on that occasion Ven Pilindavaccha went around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes
So a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to him Lord Ven Pilindavaccha goes around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes
Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk In my name call Pilindavaccha saying The Teacher calls you friend Vaccha
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monk went to Ven Pilindavaccha and on arrival said to him The Teacher calls you friend Vaccha
Responding As you say my friend to the monk Ven Pilindavaccha went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Pilindavaccha that you go around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes
Yes lord
Then the Blessed One having directed attention to Ven Pilindavacchas previous lives said to the monks Dont take offense at the monk Vaccha
Its not out of inner hatred that he goes around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes
For  consecutive lifetimes the monk Vaccha has been born in brahman families
For a long time he has been accustomed to addressing people as outcastes
Thats why he goes around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
In whom theres no deceit or conceit
his greed ended unpossessive free from longing
his anger dispelled his mind unbound
Hes a contemplative Hes a brahman  a monk
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
And on that occasion Ven Mahā Kassapa was staying at the Pipphali Cave sitting for seven days in a single session having attained a certain level of concentration
Then with the passing of seven days he emerged from that concentration
To him emerging from that concentration the thought occurred What if I were to go into Rājagaha for alms
Now on that occasion  devatās were in a state of eagerness for the chance to give alms to Ven Mahā Kassapa
But Ven Mahā Kassapa turning down those  devatās early in the morning adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent into Rājagaha for alms
Now on that occasion Sakka the devaking wanted to give alms to Ven Mahā Kassapa
So assuming the appearance of a weaver he was working a loom
while Sujātā an asuramaiden filled the shuttle
Then as Ven Mahā Kassapa was going on an almsround that bypassed no donors in Rājagaha he arrived at Sakkas home
Sakka saw him coming from afar and on seeing him came out of house to meet him
Taking the bowl from his hand entered the house took cooked rice from the pot filled the bowl and gave it back to Ven Mahā Kassapa
And that gift of alms included many kinds of curry many kinds of sauces
The thought occurred to Ven Mahā Kassapa Now who is this being with such power  might as this
Then the thought occurred to him This is Sakka the devaking isnt it
On realizing this he said to Sakka Is this your doing Kosiya Dont ever do anything like this again
We too need merit Ven Kassapa We too have use for merit
Then bowing down to Ven Mahā Kassapa and circling him to the right Sakka rose up into the air and while up in the sky exclaimed three times O the alms the foremost alms wellestablished in Kassapa
O the alms the foremost alms wellestablished in Kassapa
O the alms the foremost alms wellestablished in Kassapa
The Blessed Onewith his divine hearingproperty surpassing that of the humanheard Sakka the devaking while up in the sky exclaiming three times O the alms the foremost alms wellestablished in Kassapa
O the alms the foremost alms wellestablished in Kassapa
O the alms the foremost alms wellestablished in Kassapa
On realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
The monk going for alms
supporting himself and no other
The devas adore one who is Such
calmed  ever mindful
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion a large number of monks after the meal on returning from their alms round were sitting gathered together at the kareritree pavilion when this discussion arose
Friends an almscollecting monk while going for alms periodically sees agreeable sights via the eye He periodically hears agreeable sounds via the ear smells agreeable aromas via the nose tastes agreeable flavors via the tongue touches agreeable tactile sensations via the body
An almscollecting monk while going for alms is honored respected revered venerated and given homage
So friends lets become almscollecting monks
Then we too while going for alms will periodically get to see agreeable sights via the eye to hear agreeable sounds via the ear to smell agreeable aromas via the nose to taste agreeable flavors via the tongue to touch agreeable tactile sensations via the body We too while going for alms will be honored respected revered venerated and given homage
And this discussion came to no conclusion
Then the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the kareritree pavilion and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out
Seated he addressed the monks For what topic are you sitting together here And what was the discussion that came to no conclusion
Just now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we were sitting gathered together here at the kareritree pavilion when this discussion arose They repeat what had been said





It isnt proper monks that sons of good families on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should talk on such a topic
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed

When you have gathered you have two duties either Dhammatalk or noble silence
The monk going for alms
supporting himself and no other
The devas adore one who is Such
if hes not intent on fame  praise
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time a large number of monks after the meal on returning from their alms round were sitting gathered together at a pavilion when this discussion arose Who friends knows a craft
Whos studying which craft
Which is the supreme among crafts
With regard to that some said The elephantcraft is the supreme craft among crafts
Some said The horsecraft is the supreme craft among crafts 
The chariotcraft 
Archery 
Swordsmanship 
Signaling 
Calculating 
Accounting 
Writing 
Literary composition 
Cosmology
Some said Geomancy is the supreme craft among crafts
And this discussion came to no conclusion
Then the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the pavilion and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out
As he was sitting there he addressed the monks For what topic are you sitting together here And what was the discussion that came to no conclusion
Just now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we were sitting gathered together here at the pavilion when this discussion arose They repeat what had been said





It isnt proper monks that sons of good families on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should talk on such a topic
When you have gathered you have two duties either Dhammatalk or noble silence
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Supporting himself without a craft light desiring the goal
his faculties controlled released everywhere
living in no home unpossessive free from longing
having slain Māra going alone  a monk
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Bodhi treethe tree of awakeningnewly awakened
And on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of release
Then with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration he surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened One
As he did so he saw living beings burning with the many fevers and aflame with the many fires born of passion aversion  delusion
Then on realizing the significance of that he on that occasion exclaimed
This world is burning
Afflicted by contact it calls disease a self
By whatever means it supposes anything
it becomes otherwise than that
Becoming otherwise the world is attached to becoming
afflicted by becoming and yet delights in that very becoming
Where theres delight there is fear
What one fears is stressful
This holy life is lived for the abandoning of becoming
Whatever contemplatives or brahmans say that liberation from becoming is by means of becoming all of them are not released from becoming I say
And whatever contemplatives or brahmans say that escape from becoming is by means of nonbecoming all of them have not escaped from becoming I say
For this stress comes into play in dependence on every acquisition With the ending of every clingingsustenance theres no stress coming into play
Look at this world Beings afflicted with thick ignorance are unreleased from passion for what has come to be All levels of becoming anywhere in any way are inconstant stressful subject to change
Seeing thisas its come to be
with right discernment one abandons craving for becoming and doesnt delight in nonbecoming
From the total ending of craving
comes fading  cessation without remainder unbinding
For the monk unbound
through lack of clingingsustenance theres no further becoming
He has conquered Māra won the battle
having gone beyond becomings  Such
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Cālikans at Cālikā Mountain
And on that occasion Ven Meghiya was his attendant
Then Ven Meghiya went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One I would like to go into Jantu Village for alms
Then do Meghiya what you think it is now time to do
Then in the early morning Ven Meghiya adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent into Jantu Village for alms
Having gone for alms in Jantu Village after the meal returning from his alms round he went to the bank of the Kimikālā River As he was walking up  down along the bank of the river to exercise his legs he saw a pleasing charming mango grove
Seeing it the thought occurred to him How pleasing  charming this mango grove
Its enough for a young man of good family intent on exertion to exert himself in meditation
If the Blessed One gives me permission I would like to exert myself in meditation in this mango grove
So Ven Meghiya went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One
Just now in the early morning I adjusted my under robe andcarrying my bowl  robeswent into Jantu Village for alms
Having gone for alms in Jantu Village after the meal returning from my alms round I went to the bank of the Kimikālā River
As I was walking up  down along the bank of the river to exercise my legs I saw a pleasing charming mango grove
Seeing it the thought occurred to me How pleasing  charming this mango grove
Its enough for a young man of good family intent on exertion to exert himself in meditation
If the Blessed One gives me permission I would like to exert myself in meditation in this mango grove
If the Blessed One gives me permission I would like to go to the mango grove to exert myself in meditation
When this was said the Blessed One responded to Ven Meghiya As long as I am still alone stay here until another monk comes
A second time Ven Meghiya said to the Blessed One Lord the Blessed One has nothing further to do and nothing further to add to what he has done
I however have something further to do and something further to add to what I have done
If the Blessed One gives me permission I would like to go to the mango grove to exert myself in meditation
A second time the Blessed One responded to Ven Meghiya As long as I am still alone stay here until another monk comes
A third time Ven Meghiya said to the Blessed One Lord the Blessed One has nothing further to do and nothing further to add to what he has done
I however have something further to do and something further to add to what I have done
If the Blessed One gives me permission I would like to go to the mango grove to exert myself in meditation
As you are talking about exertion Meghiya what can we say
Do what you think it is now time to do
Then Ven Meghiya rising from his seat bowing down to the Blessed One and circling him to the right went to the mango grove On arrival having gone deep into the grove he sat down at the root of a certain tree for the days abiding
Now while Ven Meghiya was staying in the mango grove he was for the most part assailed by three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harm
The thought occurred to him How amazing How astounding
Even though it was through faith that I went forth from home to the homeless life
still I am overpowered by these three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harm
Emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now while I was staying in the mango grove I was for the most part assailed by three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harm
The thought occurred to me How amazing How astounding
Even though it was through faith that I went forth from home to the homeless life
still I am overpowered by these three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harm
Meghiya in one whose awarenessrelease is still immature five qualities bring it to maturity
Which five
There is the case where a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues
In one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the first quality that brings it to maturity
Furthermore the monk is virtuous He dwells restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha consummate in his behavior  range of activity He trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults
In one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the second quality that brings it to maturity
Furthermore he gets to hear at will easily and without difficulty talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of awareness ie talk on modesty contentment seclusion nonentanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge  vision of release
In one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the third quality that brings it to maturity
Furthermore he keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and for taking on skillful qualities He is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities
In one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the fourth quality that brings it to maturity
Furthermore he is discerning endowed with the discernment related to arising  passing awaynoble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress
In one whose awarenessrelease is still immature this is the fifth quality that brings it to maturity
Meghiya in one whose awarenessrelease is still immature these are the five qualities that bring it to maturity
Meghiya when a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues it is to be expected that he will be virtuous will dwell restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha consummate in his behavior  range of activity and will train himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults
When a monk has admirable people as friends  colleagues it is to be expected that he will get to hear at will easily and without difficulty talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of awareness ie talk on modesty contentment seclusion nonentanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge  vision of release
When a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues it is to be expected that he will keep his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful qualities and for taking on skillful qualitiessteadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities
When a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues it is to be expected that he will be discerning endowed with the discernment relating to arising  passing awaynoble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress
And furthermore when the monk is established in these five qualities there are four additional qualities he should develop He should develop contemplation of the unattractive so as to abandon passion He should develop good will so as to abandon ill will He should develop mindfulness of inout breathing so as to cut off thinking He should develop the perception of inconstancy so as to uproot the conceit I am For a monk perceiving inconstancy the perception of notself is made steady
One perceiving notself attains the uprooting of the conceit I amunbinding right in the herenow
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Little thoughts subtle thoughts
when followed stir up the heart
Not comprehending the thoughts of the heart
one runs here  there the mind out of control
But comprehending the thoughts of the heart
one who is ardent mindful restrains them
When followed they stir up the heart
one awakened lets them go without trace
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Upavattana the Mallan sal grove near Kusinarā
And on that occasion not far from the Blessed One many monks were staying in wilderness huts highstrung rowdy unruly talkative of loose words  muddled mindfulness unalert unconcentrated their minds scattered their faculties left wide open
The Blessed One saw those many monks staying in wilderness huts highstrung rowdy unruly talkative of loose words  muddled mindfulness unalert unconcentrated their minds scattered their faculties left wide open
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
By leaving your body unprotected being immersed in wrong view
conquered by sloth  torpor you go under Māras sway
Therefore with protected mind ranging in right resolve
honoring right view knowing risefall
conquering sloth  torpor a monk leaves all bad destinations behind
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the Kosalans with a large community of monks
Then coming down from the road he went to a certain tree and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out
A certain cowherd then went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged him with Dhammatalk
The cowherdinstructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed Ones talk on Dhammasaid to him Lord may the Blessed One together with the community of monks acquiesce to my offer of tomorrows meal
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then the cowherd understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and left circling him to the right
Then after the night had passed the cowherdhaving prepared in his own home a great deal of thick milkrice porridge  fresh gheeannounced the time of the meal to the Blessed One Its time lord The meal is ready
So the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent together with the community of monks to the cowherds home On arrival he sat down on a seat laid out
The cowherd with his own hand served  satisfied the community of monks headed by the Blessed One with thick milkrice porridge  fresh ghee
Then when the Blessed One had eaten and had rinsed his bowl  hands the cowherd taking a lower seat sat down to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged him with Dhammatalk then got up from his seat  left
Now not long after the Blessed Ones departure the cowherd was killed by a certain man between the boundaries of two villages
A large number of monks then went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they told him The cowherd who today served  satisfied the community of monks headed by the Blessed One with thick milkrice porridge  fresh ghee has been killed it is said by a certain man between the boundaries of two villages
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Whatever an enemy might do to an enemy or a foe to a foe
the illdirected mind can do to you even worse
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
And on that occasion Ven Sāriputta and Ven Mahā Moggallāna were staying in Pigeon Cave
Then on a moonlit night Ven Sāriputtahis head newly shavenwas sitting in the open air having attained a certain level of concentration
And on that occasion two yakkhas who were companions were flying from north to south on some business or other
They saw Ven Sāriputtahis head newly shavensitting in the open air
Seeing him the first yakkha said to the second Im inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head
When this was said the second yakkha said to the first Enough of that my good friend Dont lay a hand on the contemplative
Hes an outstanding contemplative of great power  great might
A second time the first yakkha said to the second Im inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head
A second time the second yakkha said to the first Enough of that my good friend Dont lay a hand on the contemplative
Hes an outstanding contemplative of great power  great might
A third time the first yakkha said to the second Im inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head
A third time the second yakkha said to the first Enough of that my good friend Dont lay a hand on the contemplative
Hes an outstanding contemplative of great power  great might
Then the first yakkha ignoring the second yakkha gave Ven Sāriputta a blow on the head
And with that blow he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall or split a great rocky crag
But right there the yakkhayelling Im burningfell into the Great Hell
Now Ven Moggallānawith his divine eye pure and surpassing the humansaw the yakkha give Ven Sāriputta a blow on the head
Seeing this he went to Ven Sāriputta and on arrival said to him I hope you are well friend Sāriputta I hope you are comfortable I hope you are feeling no pain
I am well friend Moggallāna I am comfortable But I do have a slight headache
How amazing friend Sāriputta How astounding
How great your power  might
Just now a yakkha gave you a blow on the head
So great was that blow that he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall or split a great rocky crag But all you say is this I am well friend Moggallāna I am comfortable But I do have a slight headache
How amazing friend Moggallāna How astounding
How great your power  might Where you saw a yakkha just now
I didnt even see a dust devil
The Blessed Onewith the divine earproperty pure and surpassing the humanheard those two great beings conversing in this way
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Whose mind standing like rock doesnt shake
dispassionate for things that spark passion unprovoked by things that spark provocation
When ones mind is developed like this from where can there come to him suffering  stress
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Kosambī at Kositas monastery
And on that occasion the Blessed One lived hemmed in with monks nuns male  female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciples
Hemmed in he lived unpleasantly and not in ease
The thought occurred to him I now live hemmed in by monks nuns male  female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciples
Hemmed in I live unpleasantly and not in ease
What if I were to live alone apart from the crowd
So early in the morning the Blessed One adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent into Kosambī for alms
Then having gone for alms in Kosambī after the meal returning from his alms round he set his own lodgings in order and carrying his bowl  robes without telling his attendant without informing the community of monksalone  without a companionleft on a wandering tour toward Palileyyaka
After wandering by stages he reached Palileyyaka
There he stayed in Palileyyaka in the protected forest grove at the root of the auspicious sal tree
It so happened that a certain bull elephant was living hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants
He fed off grass with cutoff tips They chewed up his stash of brokenoff branches He drank disturbed water And when he came up from his bathingplace cowelephants went along banging up against his body
Hemmed in he lived unpleasantly and not in ease
The thought occurred to him I now live hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants I feed off grass with cutoff tips They chew up my stash of brokenoff branches I drink disturbed water And when I come up from my bathing place cowelephants go along banging up against my body Hemmed in I live unpleasantly and not in ease
What if I were to live alone apart from the crowd
So the bull elephant leaving the herd went to Palileyyaka to the protected forest grove and the root of the auspicious sal treeto where the Blessed One was staying
There he kept the grass down in the area where the Blessed One was staying and brought drinking water and washing water for the Blessed One with his trunk
Then when the Blessed One was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to his awareness Before I lived hemmed in by monks nuns male  female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciples Hemmed in I lived unpleasantly and not in ease
But now I live not hemmed in by monks nuns male  female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciples Not hemmed in I live pleasantly and in ease
And this train of thought appeared to the awareness of the bull elephant Before I lived hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants I fed off grass with cutoff tips They chewed up my stash of brokenoff branches I drank disturbed water And when I came up from my bathing place cowelephants went along banging up against my body Hemmed in I lived unpleasantly and not in ease
But now I live not hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants I feed off grass with uncut tips They dont chew up my stash of brokenoff branches I drink undisturbed water When I come up from my bathing place cowelephants dont go along banging up against my body Not hemmed in I live pleasantly and in ease
Then the Blessed One realizing his own seclusion and knowing the train of thought in the bull elephants awareness on that occasion exclaimed
the elephant with tusks like chariot poles that each finds joy alone in the forest
This harmonizes mind with mind the great ones with the great ones
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion Ven Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja was sitting not far from the Blessed One his legs crossed his body held erecta wilderness dweller an almsgoer a ragrobe wearer an owner of only one set of three robes modest content solitary unentangled his persistence aroused an advocate of the ascetic practices devoted to the heightened mind
The Blessed One saw Ven Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erecta wilderness dweller an almsgoer a ragrobe wearer an owner of only one set of three robes modest content solitary unentangled his persistence aroused an advocate of the ascetic practices devoted to the heightened mind
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Not disparaging not injuring restraint in line with the Pāṭimokkha
moderation in food dwelling in seclusion
commitment to the heightened mind this is the teaching of the Awakened
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion Ven Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Blessed Onehis legs crossed his body held erectmodest content solitary unentangled his persistence aroused devoted to the heightened mind
The Blessed One saw Ven Sāriputta sitting not far awayhis legs crossed his body held erectmodest content solitary unentangled his persistence aroused devoted to the heightened mind
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Of heightened awareness  heedful
the sage trained in sagacitys way
He has no sorrows one who is Such
calmed  ever mindful
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time the Blessed One was worshipped revered honored venerated and given homagea recipient of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
The community of monks was also worshipped revered honored venerated and given homagea recipient of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
But the wanderers of other sects were not worshipped revered honored venerated or given homage nor were they recipients of robes alms food lodgings or medicinal requisites for the sick
So the wanderers of other sectsunable to stand the veneration given to the Blessed One and the community of monkswent to Sundarī the female wanderer and on arrival said to her Sundarī would you dare to do something for the benefit of your kinsmen
What shall I do masters
What can I not do
I have given up even my life for the benefit of my kinsmen
In that case sister go often to Jetas Grove
Responding As you say masters to those wanderers of other sects Sundarī the female wanderer went often to Jetas Grove
When the wanderers of other sects knew that many people had seen Sundarī the female wanderer going often to Jetas Grove
thenhaving murdered her and buried her right there in the moatditch surrounding Jetas Grovethey went to King Pasenadi Kosala and on arrival said to him Great king we cant find Sundarī the female wanderer
But where do you suspect she is
At Jetas Grove great king
Then in that case search Jetas Grove
Then those wanderers of other sects having searched Jetas Grove having dug up what they had buried in the surrounding moatditch having mounted it on a litter took it into Sāvatthī and went from street to street crossroad to crossroad stirring up peoples indignation
See masters the handiwork of the Sakyanson contemplatives
Theyre shameless these Sakyanson contemplatives unvirtuous evilnatured liars unholy
though they claim to be practicing the Dhamma practicing what is harmonious practicing the holy life speakers of the truth virtuous finenatured
They have no quality of a contemplative no holy quality
Destroyed is their quality of a contemplative Destroyed is their holy quality
From where is their quality of a contemplative From where their holy quality
Gone are they from any quality of a contemplative Gone from any holy quality
How can a man having done a mans business with a woman take her life
So on that occasion people seeing monks in Sāvatthī would insult revile irritate  harass them with discourteous abusive language
Theyre shameless these Sakyanson contemplatives unvirtuous evilnatured liars unholy
though they claim to be practicing the Dhamma practicing what is harmonious practicing the holy life speakers of the truth virtuous finenatured
They have no quality of a contemplative no holy quality
Destroyed is their quality of a contemplative Destroyed is their holy quality
From where is their quality of a contemplative From where their holy quality
Gone are they from any quality of a contemplative Gone from any holy quality
How can a man having done a mans business with a woman take her life
Then early in the morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes andcarrying their bowls  robeswent into Sāvatthī for alms
Then having gone for alms in Sāvatthī after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One
At present lord people seeing monks in Sāvatthī insult revile irritate  harass them with discourteous abusive language Theyre shameless these Sakyanson contemplatives unvirtuous evilnatured liars unholy





How can a man having done a mans business with a woman take her life
Monks this noise will not last long It will last only seven days
With the passing of seven days it will disappear
So in that case when those people on seeing monks insult revile irritate  harass them with discourteous abusive language counter their accusation with this verse
He goes to hell the one who asserts what didnt take place
as does the one who having done says I didnt
Bothlowacting people there become equal
after death in the world beyond
So having learned this verse in the Blessed Ones presence the monkswhenever people on seeing monks in Sāvatthī insulted reviled irritated  harassed them with discourteous abusive languagecountered the accusation with this verse
He goes to hell the one who asserts what didnt take place
as does the one who having done says I didnt
Bothlowacting people there become equal
after death in the world beyond
The thought occurred to those people Theyre innocent these Sakyanson contemplatives
It wasnt done by them
Theyre taking an oath these Sakyanson contemplatives
And so that noise didnt last long
It lasted only seven days
With the passing of seven days it disappeared
Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to him
Its amazing lord Its astounding
how wellsaid that was by the Blessed One Monks this noise will not last long
It will last only seven days
With the passing of seven days it will disappear
Lord that noise has disappeared
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
They stab with their words people unrestrained
as they do with arrows a tusker gone into battle
Hearing abusive words spoken
one should endure them a monk with unbothered mind
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
And on that occasion when Ven Upasena Vaṅgantaputta was alone in seclusion this line of thinking appeared to his awareness What a gain what a true gain it is for me that my teacher is the Blessed One worthy and fully selfawakened that I have gone forth from home to the homeless life in a welltaught Dhamma  Vinaya that my companions in the holy life are virtuous and endowed with admirable qualities that I have achieved culmination in terms of the precepts that my mind is unified and wellconcentrated that I am an arahant with effluents ended that I have great power  great might
Fortunate has been my life fortunate will be my death
Then the Blessed One comprehending with his awareness the line of thinking that had appeared to Ven Upasena Vaṅgantaputtas awareness on that occasion exclaimed
He doesnt regret what life has been doesnt grieve at death
ifenlightened he has seen that state He doesnt grieve in the midst of grief
For one who has crushed craving for becoming the monk of peaceful mind
birth  the wandering on are totally ended He has no further becoming
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion Ven Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Blessed Onehis legs crossed his body held erectreflecting on the peace within himself
The Blessed One saw Ven Sāriputta sitting not far awayhis legs crossed his body held erectreflecting on the peace within himself
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
For the monk whose mind is peaceful at peace whose cord is cut
birth  the wandering on are totally ended Freed is he from Māras bonds
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion King Pasenadi Kosala had gone with Queen Mallikā to the upper palace
Then he said to her Mallikā is there anyone dearer to you than yourself
No great king There is no one dearer to me than myself
And what about you great king Is there anyone dearer to you than yourself
No Mallikā There is no one dearer to me than myself
Then the king descending from the palace went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One
Just now lord when I had gone with Queen Mallikā to the upper palace I said to her Mallikā is there anyone dearer to you than yourself
When this was said she said to me No great king There is no one dearer to me than myself
And what about you great king Is there anyone dearer to you than yourself
When this was said I said to her No Mallikā There is no one dearer to me than myself
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Searching all directions with your awareness
you find no one dearer than yourself
In the same way others are thickly dear to themselves
So you shouldnt hurt others if you love yourself
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then Ven nanda emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Its amazing sir Its astounding
how shortlived the Blessed Ones mother was Seven days after the Blessed Ones birth she died and reappeared among the Contented Tusita group
Thats the way it is nanda Thats the way it is for the mothers of bodhisattas are shortlived
Seven days after the bodhisattas birth the bodhisattas mothers pass away and reappear among the Contented group
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Those who have come to be those who will be
All will go leaving the body behind
The skillful person realizing the loss of all
should live the holy life ardently
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
And on that occasion in Rājagaha there was a leper named Suppabuddha a poor pitiful wretch of a person
And on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting surrounded by a large assembly teaching the Dhamma
Suppabuddha the leper saw the large gathering of people from afar
and thought to himself Without a doubt someone must be distributing staple or nonstaple food there
Why dont I go over to that large group of people
and maybe there Ill get some staple or nonstaple food
So he went over to the large group of people
Then he saw the Blessed One sitting surrounded by a large assembly teaching the Dhamma
On seeing this he realized Theres no one distributing staple or nonstaple food there
Thats Gotama the contemplative surrounded teaching the Dhamma
Why dont I listen to the Dhamma
So he sat down to one side right there thinking I too will listen to the Dhamma
Then the Blessed One having encompassed the awareness of the entire assembly with his awareness asked himself Now who here is capable of understanding the Dhamma
He saw Suppabuddha the leper sitting in the assembly
and on seeing him the thought occurred to him This person here is capable of understanding the Dhamma
So aiming at Suppabuddha the leper he gave a stepbystep talk ie he proclaimed a talk on generosity on virtue on heaven he declared the drawbacks degradation  corruption of sensuality and the rewards of renunciation
Then when the Blessed One knew that Suppabuddha the lepers mind was ready malleable free from hindrances elevated  clear he then gave the Dhammatalk peculiar to Awakened Ones ie stress origination cessation  path
And just as a clean cloth free of stains would properly absorb a dye in the same way as Suppabuddha the leper was sitting in that very seat the dustless stainless Dhamma eye arose within him Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
Having seen the Dhamma reached the Dhamma known the Dhamma gained a foothold in the Dhamma having crossed over  beyond doubt having had no more perplexity having gained fearlessness  independence from others with regard to the Teachers message he got up from his seat and went to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One
Magnificent lord Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed Onethrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
Then Suppabuddha the leper having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed Ones Dhamma talk delighting in  approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and left circling him to the right
Not long after his departure he was attacked  killed by a cow with a young calf
Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One Lord the leper named Suppabuddha whom the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged with a Dhamma talk has died
What is his destination What is his future state
Monks Suppabuddha the leper was wise He practiced the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the Dhamma
With the destruction of the first three fetters he is a streamwinner not subject to states of deprivation headed for selfawakening for sure
When this was said one of the monks said to the Blessed One Lord what was the cause what was the reason why Suppabuddha the leper was such a poor pitiful wretch of a person
Once monks in this very Rājagaha Suppabuddha the leper was the son of a rich moneylender
While being escorted to a pleasure park he saw Tagarasikhin the Private Buddha going for alms in the city
On seeing him the thought occurred to him Who is this leper prowling about
Spitting and disrespectfully turning his left side to Tagarasikhin the Private Buddha he left
As a result of that deed he boiled in hell for many years many hundreds of years many thousands of years many hundreds of thousands of years
And then as a remainder of the result of that deed he became a poor pitiful wretch of a person in this very Rājagaha
But on encountering the Dhamma  Vinaya made known by the Tathāgata he acquired conviction virtue learning relinquishment  discernment
Having acquired conviction virtue learning relinquishment  discernment on encountering the Dhamma  Vinaya made known by the Tathāgata nowon the breakup of the body after deathhe has reappeared in a good destination a heavenly world in company with the devas of the heaven of the Thirtythree
There he outshines the other devas both in beauty  in rank
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
As one with eyes  having energy would treacherous uneven places
so a wise one in the world of life should avoid evil deeds
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion a large number of boys on the road between Sāvatthī  Jetas Grove were catching fish
Then early in the morning the Blessed One adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent into Sāvatthī for alms
He saw the large number of boys on the road between Sāvatthī  Jetas Grove catching little fish
Seeing them he went up to them and on arrival said to them Boys do you fear pain Do you dislike pain
Yes lord we fear pain We dislike pain
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
If you fear pain if you dislike pain
dont anywhere do an evil deed in open or in secret
If youre doing or will do an evil deed
you wont escape pain catching up as you run away
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion Ven Mahā Kaccāna was living among the people of Avantī on Pavatta Mountain near the Osprey Habitat
And at that time the lay follower Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa was Ven Mahā Kaccānas supporter
Then as Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to his awareness According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell
What if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness
So he went to Ven Mahā Kaccāna and on arrival having bowed down to Ven Mahā Kaccāna sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven Mahā Kaccāna
Just now venerable sir as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to my awareness According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell
What if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness
Give me the goingforth Master Mahā Kaccāna
When this was said Ven Mahā Kaccāna said to Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa Its hard Soṇa the lifelong onemealaday sleepingalone holy life
Please right there as you are a householder devote yourself to the message of the Awakened Ones and to the propertime ie uposatha day onemealaday sleepingalone holy life
And so Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇas idea of goingforth subsided
Then a second time as Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to his awareness According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell What if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness So he went to Ven Mahā Kaccāna and on arrival having bowed down to Ven Mahā Kaccāna sat to one side As he was sitting there he said to Ven Mahā Kaccāna Just now venerable sir as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to my awareness According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell What if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness Give me the goingforth Master Mahā Kaccāna When this was said Ven Mahā Kaccāna said to Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa Its hard Soṇa the lifelong onemealaday sleepingalone holy life
Please right there as you are a householder devote yourself to the message of the Awakened Ones and to the propertime onemealaday sleepingalone holy life
And so Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇas idea of goingforth subsided a second time
Then a third time as Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to his awareness According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell
What if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness
So he went to Ven Mahā Kaccāna and on arrival having bowed down to Ven Mahā Kaccāna sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven Mahā Kaccāna
Just now venerable sir as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to my awareness According to the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell
What if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness
Give me the goingforth Master Mahā Kaccāna
So Ven Mahā Kaccāna gave Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa the goingforth
Now at that time the southern country of Avantī was short of monks
So only after three yearshaving gathered from here  there with hardship  difficulty a quorumoften community of monksdid Ven Mahā Kaccāna give full admission to Ven Soṇa
Then after having completed the Rains retreat as he was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to Ven Soṇas awareness I havent seen the Blessed One facetoface Ive simply heard that he is like this and like this
If my preceptor would give me permission I would go to see the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened
So leaving seclusion in the late afternoon he went to Ven Mahā Kaccāna and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven Mahā Kaccāna
Just now venerable sir as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to my awareness I havent seen the Blessed One facetoface Ive simply heard that he is like this and like this
If my preceptor would give me permission I would go to see the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened
Good Soṇa Very good Go Soṇa to see the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened
You will see the Blessed One who is serene  inspires serene confidence his senses at peace his mind at peace one who has attained the utmost tranquility  poise tamed guarded his senses restrained a Great One 
On seeing him showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort saying My preceptor lord shows reverence with his head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort
Saying As you say venerable sir Ven Soṇadelighting in  approving of Ven Mahā Kaccānas wordsgot up from his seat bowed down to Ven Mahā Kaccāna circled him to the right set his lodging in order andtaking his bowl  robesset off wandering toward Sāvatthī
Wandering by stages he arrived at Sāvatthī Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery He went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord my preceptor Ven Mahā Kaccāna shows reverence with his head to the Blessed Ones feet and asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort
Are you well monk Are you in good health Have you come along the road with only a little fatigue And are you not tired of almsfood
I am well Blessed One I am in good health Blessed One I have come along the road lord with only a little fatigue and I am not tired of almsfood
Then the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda saying nanda prepare bedding for this visiting monk
Then the thought occurred to Ven nanda When the Blessed One orders me nanda prepare bedding for this visiting monk he wants to stay in the same dwelling with that monk The Blessed One wants to stay in the same dwelling with Ven Soṇa
So he prepared bedding for Ven Soṇa in the dwelling in which the Blessed One was staying
Then the Blessed One having spent much of the night sitting in the open air washed his feet and entered the dwelling
Likewise Ven Soṇa having spent much of the night sitting in the open air washed his feet and entered the dwelling
Then getting up toward the end of the night the Blessed One invited Ven Mahā Soṇa saying Monk I would like you to recite the Dhamma
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven Soṇa chanted all sixteen parts of the Aṭṭhaka Vagga
The Blessed One at the conclusion of Ven Soṇas intonation expressed high approval Good monk Very good You have learned the Aṭṭhaka Vagga verses well have considered them well have borne them well in mind You have a fine delivery clear  faultless that makes the meaning intelligible
How many Rains in the monkhood do you have
I have one Rains Blessed One
But why did you take so long to ordain
For a long time lord I have seen the drawbacks in sensuality but the household life is confining with many duties many things to be done
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Seeing the drawbacks of the world knowing the state without acquisitions
a noble one doesnt find joy in evil in evil a clean one doesnt find joy
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion Ven Revata the Doubter was sitting not far from the Blessed One his legs crossed his body held erect reflecting on his purification through the overcoming of doubt
The Blessed One saw Ven Revata the Doubter sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect reflecting on his purification through the overcoming of doubt
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Any doubts about here or the world beyond
about what is experienced bybecause of others bybecause of oneself
are abandonedall by the person in jhāna
ardent living the holy life
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels refuge
And on that occasion early in the morning of the uposatha Ven nanda adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent into Rājagaha for alms
Devadatta saw Ven nanda going for alms in Rājagaha and on seeing him went to him
On arrival he said to him From this day forward friend nanda I will conduct the uposatha  community transactions apart from the Blessed One apart from the community of monks
Then Ven nandahaving gone for alms in Rājagaha after the meal returning from his alms roundwent to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One
Just now lord after adjusting my under robe early in the morning and carrying my bowl  robes I went into Rājagaha for alms
Devadatta saw me going for alms in Rājagaha and on seeing me went up to me
On arrival he said to me From this day forward friend nanda I will conduct the uposatha  community transactions apart from the Blessed One apart from the community of monks Lord today Devadatta will split the community
He will conduct the uposatha  community transactions apart from the community
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
The good for the good is easy to do The good for the evil is hard to do
Evil for the evil is easy to do Evil for the noble ones is hard to do
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the Kosalans with a large community of monks
And on that occasion a large number of youths passed by as if jeering not far from the Blessed One
The Blessed One saw the large number of youths passing by as if jeering not far away
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
False pundits totally muddled speaking in the range of mere words
babbling as much as they like led on by what they dont know
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion Ven Cūḷa Panthaka was sitting not far from the Blessed One his legs crossed his body held erect with mindfulness established to the fore
The Blessed One saw Ven Cūḷa Panthaka sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect with mindfulness established to the fore
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
With steady body steady awareness
whether standing sitting or lying down
a monk determined on mindfulness
gains one distinction after another
Having gained one distinction after another
he goes where the King of Death cant see
and the brahmin student Vasettha addressed the Blessed One in stanzas thus
 Vasettha  We are both acknowledged to possess The knowledge we claim of the Triple Veda
For I am Pokkharasatis pupil And he a pupil of Tarukkha
Skilled in philology and grammar We match our teachers in discussion
Bharadvaja says one is a brahmin by birth
While I hold one is a brahmin by action Know this O Seer as our debate
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesālī at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest
Then early in the morning he adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent into Vesālī for alms
Then having gone for alms in Vesālī after the meal returning from his alms round he addressed Ven nanda Get a sitting cloth nanda
We will go to the Pāvāla shrine for the days abiding
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda followed along behind the Blessed One carrying the sitting cloth
Then the Blessed One went to the Pāvāla shrine and on arrival sat down on the seat laid out
Seated the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda
Vesālī is refreshing nanda Refreshing too are the Udena shrine the Gotamaka shrine the Sattamba shrine the ManySon shrine the Sāranda shrine the Pāvāla shrine
Anyone nanda in whom the four bases of power are developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated and wellundertaken couldif he wantedremain for an eon or the remainder of an eon
In the Tathāgata nanda the four bases of power are developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated and wellundertaken
He couldif he wantedremain for an eon or the remainder of an eon
But Ven nandaeven when the Blessed One had given such a blatant sign such a blatant hintwasnt able to understand his meaning He didnt request of him Lord may the Blessed One remain for an eon May the OneWellGone remain for an eonfor the benefit of the many for the happiness of the many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human and divine beings It was as if his mind was possessed by Māra
A second time A third time the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda
Vesālī is refreshing nanda Refreshing too are the Udena shrine the Gotamaka shrine the Sattamba shrine the ManySon shrine the Sāranda shrine the Pāvāla shrine
Anyone nanda in whom the four bases of power are developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated and wellundertaken couldif he wantedremain for an eon or the remainder of an eon
In the Tathāgata nanda the four bases of power are developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated and wellundertaken

Then the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda Go nanda Do what you think it is now time to do
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One andafter circling him to the rightwent to sit under a tree not far from the Blessed One
Then not long after Ven nanda had left Māra the Evil One went to the Blessed One and on arrival stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One
May the Blessed One totally unbind now lord May the OneWellGone totally unbind now lord Now is the time for the Blessed Ones total unbinding lord
After all these words were said by the Blessed One Evil One I will not totally unbind as long as my monk disciples are not yet experienced trained attained to confidence desiring rest from the yoke learned maintaining the Dhamma practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with the Dhamma declaring the Dhammaafter having learned it from their own teachersteaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain wellrefuting in line with the Dhamma any opposing teachings that have arisen teaching the Dhamma with its marvels

But now lord the Blessed Ones holy life is powerful prosperous widelyspread disseminated among many people wellexpounded as far as there are devas  human beings
May the Blessed One totally unbind now lord May the OneWellGone totally unbind now lord Now is the time for the Blessed Ones total unbinding lord
When this was said the Blessed One said to Māra the Most Evil One Relax Evil One
It wont be long until the Tathāgatas total unbinding
In three months time from now the Tathāgata will totally unbind
Thus at the Pāvāla shrinemindful  alertthe Blessed One relinquished the fabrications of life
And as the Blessed One relinquished the fabrications of life there was a great earthquake frightening  hairraising along with cracks of thunder
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Comparing the incomparable with comingintobeing
the sage relinquished the fabrication of becoming
Inwardly joyful centered
he split his own comingintobeing like a coat of mail
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion the Blessed One sat reflecting on the various evil unskillful qualities that had been abandoned in him and on the various skillful qualities that had gone to the culmination of their development
Then as he realized the various evil unskillful qualities that had been abandoned in him and the various skillful qualities that had gone to the culmination of their development he on that occasion exclaimed
Before it was then it wasnt Before it wasnt then it was
It wasnt wont be  now isnt to be found
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion there were many contemplatives brahmans  wanderers of various sects living around Sāvatthī with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views
Some of the contemplatives  brahmans held this doctrine this view The self  the cosmos are eternal Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
Some of the contemplatives  brahmans held this doctrine this view The self  the cosmos are not eternal 
The self  the cosmos are both eternal and not eternal 
The self  the cosmos are neither eternal nor not eternal 
The self  the cosmos are selfmade 
The self  the cosmos are othermade 
The self  the cosmos are both selfmade  othermade 
The self  the cosmoswithout selfmaking without othermakingare spontaneously arisen 
Pleasure  pain the self  the cosmos are eternal

both selfmade  othermade 
Pleasure  pain the self  the cosmoswithout selfmaking without othermakingare spontaneously arisen Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
And they kept on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like that The Dhammas not like that its like this
Then in the early morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes andcarrying their bowls  robeswent into Sāvatthī for alms
Having gone for alms in Sāvatthī after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One
Lord there are many contemplatives brahmans  wanderers of various sects living around Sāvatthī with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views
And they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like that The Dhammas not like that its like this
Monks the wanderers of other sects are blind  eyeless They dont know what is beneficial and what is harmful They dont know what is the Dhamma and what is nonDhamma
Not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is Dhamma and what is nonDhamma they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like that The Dhammas not like that its like this
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
With regard to these things theyre attached some contemplatives  brahmans
Not reaching the footing they sink in midstream
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery

Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
People are intent on the idea of Imaking and attached to the idea of othermaking
Some dont realize this nor do they see it as an arrow
But to one who having extracted this arrow sees
the thought I am doing doesnt occur
Another is doing doesnt occur
This human race is possessed by conceit bound by conceit tied down by conceit
Speaking hurtfully because of their views they dont go beyond the wanderingon
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And on that occasion Ven Subhūti was sitting not far from the Blessed One his legs crossed his body held erect having attained a concentration free from directed thought
The Blessed One saw Ven Subhūti sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect having attained a concentration free from directed thought
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Whose thoughts are vaporized
welldealtwith within without trace
going beyond that tie perceiving the formless
overcoming four yokes one doesnt go to birth
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
And on that occasion two factions in Rājagaha were infatuated with a certain courtesan their minds enthralled Arguing quarreling  disputing they attacked one another with fists attacked one another with clods of dirt attacked one another with sticks attacked one another with knives
so that they fell into death or deathlike pain
Then in the early morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes andcarrying their bowls  robeswent into Sāvatthī for alms
Having gone for alms in Sāvatthī after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One
At present two factions in Rājagaha are infatuated with a certain courtesan their minds enthralled Arguing quarreling  disputing they attack one another with fists attack one another with clods of dirt attack one another with sticks attack one another with knives
so that they fall into death or deathlike pain
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Whats been attained whats to be attained are both strewn with dust by one who trains in line with the afflicted
Any precept  practice life whose essence is training and the holy life whose essence is service This is one extreme
Any who say Theres no harm in sensual desires This the second extreme
Both of these extremes cause the growth of cemeteries and cemeteries cause views to grow
Not directly knowing these two extremes some fall short some run too far
But those who directly knowing them didnt exist there didnt construe by means of them For them theres no whirling through the cycle to be described
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now on that occasion in the pitchblack darkness of the night the Blessed One was sitting in the open air while oil lamps were burning
And on that occasion many flying insects flying into  around those lamps were meeting their downfall meeting their misfortune meeting their downfall  misfortune in those oil lamps
The Blessed One saw those flying insects flying into  around those lamps meeting their downfall meeting their misfortune meeting their downfall  misfortune in those oil lamps
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Rushing headlong missing whats essential
bringing on one new bond after another
they fall like insects into a flame
those intent on things seen things heard
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then Ven nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One
Lord as long as Tathāgatasworthy  rightly selfawakeneddo not appear in the world thats when the wanderers of other sects are worshipped revered honored venerated and given homagerecipients of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick

I have heard that on one occasion while the Blessed One was wandering among the Mallans with a large community of monks he arrived at Pāvā
There he stayed near Pāvā in the mango grove of Cunda the silversmith
Cunda the silversmith heard The Blessed One they say while wandering among the Mallans with a large community of monks and reaching Pāvā is staying near Pāvā in my mango grove

Then in the Blessed One after he had eaten Cundas meal there arose a severe illness
accompanied with blood with intense pains  deadly
But the Blessed One endured itmindful alert  not struck down by it
Then he addressed Ven nanda nanda we will go to Kusinarā
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
I have heard that on eating Cunda the silversmiths meal
the enlightened one was touched by illness fierce deadly
After he had eaten the pigdelicacy a fierce sickness arose in the Teacher
After being purged of it the Blessed One said To the city of Kusinarā I will go
Then the Blessed One going down from the road went to a certain tree and on arrival said to Ven nanda nanda please arrange my outer robe folded in four I am tired I will sit down
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda arranged the outer robe folded in four
The Blessed One sat down on the seat laid out
Seated he said to Ven nanda nanda please fetch me some water I am thirsty I will drink
When this was said Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Lord just now  carts have passed through

The awakened one having gone to the little Kukuṭa river
with its pristine pleasing water clear
the Teacher seeming very tired
the Tathāgata unequalled in the world
went down bathed drank  came out
Honored surrounded in the midst of the group of monks
the Blessed One Teacher proceeding here in the Dhamma

He addressed the monk named Cundaka
Spread it out folded in four for me to lie down
Ordered by the One of developed mind
Cundaka quickly set it out folded in four
The Teacher lay down seeming very tired
and Cundaka sat down there before him
Then the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda nanda if anyone tries to incite remorse in Cunda the silversmith saying Its no gain for you friend Cunda its illdone by you that the Tathāgata having eaten your last alms was totally unbound
then Cundas remorse should be allayed 
Its a gain for you friend Cunda its welldone by you that the Tathāgata having eaten your last alms was totally unbound
Face to face with the Blessed One have I heard it face to face have I learned it These two alms are equal to each other in fruit equal to each other in result of much greater fruit  reward than any other alms
Which two
The alms that after having eaten it the Tathāgata awakens to the unexcelled right selfawakening And the alms that after having eaten it the Tathāgata is unbound by means of the unbinding property with no fuel remaining
These are the two alms that are equal to each other in fruit equal to each other in result of much greater fruit  reward than any other alms
Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to long life Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to beauty Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to happiness Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to heaven Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to rank Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to sovereignty

I have heard that on one occasion while the Blessed One was wandering among the Magadhans with a large community of monks he arrived at Pāṭali Village

So they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to him Lord may the Blessed One acquiesce to the resthouse hall
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Sensing his acquiescence the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seats bowed down to him circled him to the right and then went to the resthouse hall On arrival they spread it all over with felt rugs arranged seats set out a water vessel and raised an oil lamp Then they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down stood to one side
As they were standing there they said to him Lord the resthouse hall has been covered all over with felt rugs seats have been arranged a water vessel has been set out and an oil lamp raised
May the Blessed One do what you think it is now time to do
So the Blessed One adjusting his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent together with a community of monks to the resthouse hall On arrival he washed his feet entered the hall and sat with his back to the central post facing east
The community of monks washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the western wall facing east ranged around the Blessed One
The lay followers of Pāṭali Village washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the eastern wall facing west ranged around the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One addressed the lay followers of Pāṭali Village

Then the Blessed Onehaving instructed urged roused  encouraged the lay followers of Pāṭali Village for a large part of the night with Dhammatalkdismissed them saying The night is far gone householders Do what you think it is now time to do So the lay followers of Pāṭali Village delighting in  approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from their seats bowed down to him and left circling him to the right
Then the Blessed One not long after they had left entered an empty building
Now on that occasion Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha were building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians
And on that occasion many devas by the thousands were occupying sites in Pāṭali Village
In the area where devas of great influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of great influence were inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of middling influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of middling influence were inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of low influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of low influence were inclined to build their homes
The Blessed One with the divine eyepurified and surpassing the humansaw many devas by the thousands occupying sites in Pāṭali Village
In the area where devas of great influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of great influence were inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of middling influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of middling influence were inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of low influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of low influence were inclined to build their homes
Then getting up in the last watch of the night the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda
nanda who is building a city at Pāṭali Village
Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha lord are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians
nanda its as if they had consulted the devas of the Thirtythree Thats how Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians
Just now nandawith the divine eyepurified and surpassing the humanI saw many devas by the thousands occupying sites in Pāṭali Village
In the area where devas of great influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of great influence are inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of middling influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of middling influence are inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of low influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of low influence are inclined to build their homes
nanda as far as the sphere of the Ariyans extends as far as merchants roads extend this will be the supreme city Pāṭaliputta where the seedpods of the Pāṭali plant break open
There will be three dangers for Pāṭaliputta from fire from water and from the breaking of alliances
Then Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they stood to one side
As they were standing there they said to him May Master Gotama acquiesce to our meal today together with the community of monks
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence went to their resthouse On arrival after having exquisite staple  nonstaple food prepared in their resthouse they announced the time to the Blessed One Its time Master Gotama The meal is ready
Then the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  robeswent together with the community of monks to the resthouse of Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha On arrival he sat down on the seat laid out
Sunīdha  Vassakāra with their own hands served  satisfied the community of monks with the Buddha at its head with exquisite staple  nonstaple food
Then when the Blessed One had finished his meal and rinsed his bowl  hands Sunīdha  Vassakāra taking a low seat sat to one side
As they were sitting there the Blessed One gave his approval with these verses
In whatever place a wise person makes his dwelling
there providing food for the virtuous the restrained leaders of the holy life
he should dedicate that offering to the devas there
They receiving honor will honor him being respected will show him respect
As a result they will feel sympathy for him like that of a mother for her child her son
A person with whom the devas sympathize always meets with auspicious things
Then the Blessed One having given his approval to Sunīdha  Vassakāra with these verses got up from his seat and left
And on that occasion Sunīdha  Vassakāra followed right after the Blessed One By whichever gate Gotama the contemplative departs today that will be called the Gotama Gate
And by whichever ford he crosses over the Ganges River that will be called the Gotama Ford
So the gate by which the Blessed One departed was called the Gotama Gate
Then he went to the Ganges River
Now on that occasion the Ganges River was full up to the banks so that a crow could drink from it
Some people were searching for boats some were searching for floats some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the other
So the Blessed Onejust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from the near bank of the Ganges River and reappeared on the far bank together with the community of monks
He saw that some people were searching for boats some were searching for floats some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the other
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Those who cross the foaming flood
having made a bridge avoiding the swamps
while people are binding rafts
have already crossed  the wise
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was journeying along a road in the Kosalan country with Ven Nāgasamāla as his junior companion
Ven Nāgasamāla while going along the road saw a fork in the path
On seeing it he said to the Blessed One That lord Blessed One is the route We go that way
When this was said the Blessed One said This Nāgasamāla is the route We go this way
A second time A third time Ven Nāgasamāla said to the Blessed One That lord Blessed One is the route We go that way
And for a third time the Blessed One said This Nāgasamāla is the route We go this way
Then Ven Nāgasamāla placing the Blessed Ones bowl  robes right there on the ground left saying This lord Blessed One is the bowl  robes
Then as Ven Nāgasamāla was going along that route thievesjumping out in the middle of the roadpummeled him with their fists  feet broke his bowl and ripped his outer robe to shreds
So Ven Nāgasamālawith his bowl broken his outer robe ripped to shredswent to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord as I was going along that route thieves jumped out in the middle of the road pummeled me with their fists  feet broke my bowl and ripped my outer robe to shreds
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
When traveling together mixed together
with a person who doesnt know an attainerofwisdom
on realizing that the person is evil abandons him
as a milkfeeding heron a bog
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migāras mother
And on that occasion a dear and beloved grandson of Visākhā Migāras mother had died
So Visākhā Migāras motherher clothes wet her hair wetwent to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her
Why have you come here Visākhāyour clothes wet your hair wetin the middle of the day
When this was said she said to the Blessed One My dear and beloved grandson has died
This is why I have come heremy clothes wet my hair wetin the middle of the day
Visākhā would you like to have as many children  grandchildren as there are people in Sāvatthī
Yes lord I would like to have as many children  grandchildren as there are people in Sāvatthī
But how many people in Sāvatthī die in the course of a day
Sometimes ten people die in Sāvatthī in the course of a day sometimes nine eight seven six five four three two Sometimes one person dies in Sāvatthī in the course of a day
Sāvatthī is never free from people dying
So what do you think Visākhā
Would you ever be free of wet clothes  wet hair
No lord
Enough of my having so many children  grandchildren
 Visākhā those who have a hundred dear ones have a hundred sufferings Those who have ninety dear ones have ninety sufferings Those who have eighty seventy sixty fifty forty thirty twenty ten nine eight seven six five four three two Those who have one dear one have one suffering  Those who have no dear ones have no sufferings  They are free from sorrow free from stain free from lamentation I tell you

the many kinds of suffering in the world
exist dependent on something dear

And thus blissful  sorrowless
are those for whom nothing in the world is anywhere dear

shouldnt make anything dear in the world anywhere

Then do Dabba what you think it is now time to do
Then Ven Dabba Mallaputta rising from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and circling him on the right rose up into the air and sat crosslegged in the sky in space Entering  emerging from the fire property he was totally unbound
Now when Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and sitting crosslegged in the sky in space entered  emerged from the fire property and was totally unbound his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discerned
Just as when ghee or oil is burned and consumed neither ashes nor soot can be discerned in the same way when Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and sitting crosslegged in the sky in space entered  emerged from the fire property and was totally unbound his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discerned

This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said
So with regard to this it was said
Intelligent you should guard your virtue aspiring to three forms of bliss
praise the obtaining of wealth and after death rejoicing in heaven
Even if you do no evil but seek out one who does
youre suspected of evil Your bad reputation grows
The sort of person you make a friend the sort you seek out
thats the sort you yourself become for your living together is of that sort
The one associated with the one who associates the one whos touched the one who touches another
like an arrow smeared with poison contaminates the quiver
So fearing contamination the enlightened should not be comrades with evil people
A man who wraps rotting fish in a blade of kusa grass
makes the grass smelly so it is if you seek out fools
But a man who wraps powdered incense in the leaf of a tree
makes the leaf fragrant so it is if you seek out the enlightened
So knowing your own outcome as like the leafwrappers
you shouldnt seek out those who arent good The wise would associate with those who are
Those who arent good lead you to hell The good help you reach a good destination

And then another man with good eyesight standing on the bank on seeing him would say My good man even though you are being carried along by the flow of a river lovely  alluring further down from here is a pool with waves  whirlpools with seizers  demons On reaching that pool you will suffer death or deathlike pain
Then the first man on hearing the words of the second man would make an effort with his hands  feet to go against the flow
I have given you this simile to illustrate a meaning
The meaning is this the flow of the river stands for craving
Lovely  alluring stands for the six internal sensemedia
The pool further down stands for the five lower fetters
The waves stand for anger  distress
The whirlpools stand for the five strings of sensuality
The seizers  demons stand for the opposite sex
Against the flow stands for renunciation

THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
Now on that occasion the venerable Sariputta was wandering in the Southern Hills with a large Sangha of bhikkhus
Then a certain bhikkhu who had spent the Rains at Rajagaha went to the venerable Sariputta in the Southern Hills and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
The Blessed One is well and strong friend
Is the Sangha of bhikkhus well and strong friend
The Sangha of bhikkhus too is well and strong friend
Friend there is a brahmin named Dhananjani living in Rajagaha at the Tandulapala Gate
Is that brahmin Dhananjani well and strong
That brahmin Dhananjani too is well and strong friend
Is he diligent friend
How could he be diligent friend
He plunders brahmin householders in the name of the king and he plunders the king in the name of the brahmin householders
His wife who had faith and came from a clan with faith has died and he has taken another wife a woman without faith who comes from a clan without faith
This is bad news that we hear friend It is bad news indeed to hear that the brahmin Dhananjani has become negligent
Perhaps sometime or other we might meet the brahmin Dhananjani and have some conversation with him
Then having stayed in the Southern Hills as long as he chose the venerable Sariputta set out to wander towards Rajagaha
Wandering by stages he eventually arrived at Rajagaha
Then when it was morning the venerable Sariputta dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Rajagaha for alms
So when the venerable Sariputta had wandered for alms in Rajagaha and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to the brahmin Dhananjani
The brahmin Dhananjani saw the venerable Sariputta coming in the distance
and he went to him and said Drink some of this fresh milk Master Sariputta until it is time for the meal
I shall be at the root of that tree for the days abiding
You may come there
Yes sir he replied
And then after he had eaten his morning meal the brahmin Dhananjani went to the venerable Sariputta and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
How can we be diligent Master Sariputta when we have to support our parents our wife and children and our slaves servants and workers when we have to do our duty towards our friends and companions towards our kinsmen and relatives towards our guests towards our departed ancestors towards the deities and towards the king and when this body must also be refreshed and nourished
What do you think Dhananjani Suppose someone here were to behave contrary to the Dhamma to behave unrighteously for the sake of his parents and then because of such behaviour the wardens of hell were to drag him off to hell
Would he be able to free himself by pleading thus It was for the sake of my parents that I behaved contrary to the Dhamma that I behaved unrighteously so let not the wardens of hell drag me off to hell Or would his parents be able to free him by pleading thus It was for our sake that he behaved contrary to the Dhamma that he behaved unrighteously so let not the wardens of hell drag him off to hell
No Master Sariputta
Even while he was crying out the wardens of hell would fling him into hell
What do you think Dhananjani Suppose someone here were to behave contrary to the Dhamma to behave unrighteously for the sake of his wife and children
No Master Sariputta
Even while he was crying out the wardens of hell would fling him into hell
What do you think Dhananjani Who is the better one who for the sake of his parents behaves contrary to the Dhamma behaves unrighteously or one who for the sake of his parents behaves according to the Dhamma behaves righteously
Master Sariputta the one who for the sake of his parents behaves contrary to the Dhamma behaves unrighteously is not the better
Dhananjani there are other kinds of work profitable and in accordance with the Dhamma by means of which one can support ones parents and at the same time both avoid doing evil and practise merit
What do you think Dhananjani Who is the better one who for the sake of his wife and children
Master Sariputta the one who for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body behaves contrary to the Dhamma behaves unrighteously is not the better
Dhananjani there are other kinds of work profitable and in accordance with the Dhamma by means of which one can refresh and nourish this body and at the same time both avoid doing evil and practise merit
Then the brahmin Dhananjani having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Sariputtas words rose from his seat and departed
On a later occasion the brahmin Dhananjani became afflicted suffering and gravely ill
Then he told a man Come good man go to the Blessed One pay homage in my name with your head at his feet and say Venerable sir the brahmin Dhananjani is afflicted suffering and gravely ill
Then go to the venerable Sariputta pay homage in my name with your head at his feet and say Venerable sir the brahmin Dhananjani is afflicted suffering and gravely ill
Then say thus It would be good venerable sir if the venerable Sariputta would come to the house of the brahmin Dhananjani out of compassion
Yes venerable sir the man replied and he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to the Blessed One he sat down at one side
Then he went to the venerable Sariputta and after paying homage to the venerable Sariputta
The venerable Sariputta consented in silence
I hope your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing
Master Sariputta I am not getting well I am not comfortable
My painful feelings are increasing not subsiding
Just as if a strong man were splitting my head open with a sharp sword so too violent winds cut through my head
I am not getting well
I am not getting well
I am not getting well
I am not getting well I am not comfortable
My painful feelings are increasing not subsiding
What do you think Dhananjani Which is better  hell or the animal malm
 The animal realm Master Sariputta
 Which is better  the animal realm or the realm of ghosts
 The realm of ghosts Master Sariputta
 Which is better  the realm of ghosts or the realm of human beings
 Human beings Master Sariputta
Which is better  human beings or the gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings
 The gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings Master Sariputta
 Which is better  the gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings or the gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree
 The gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree Master Sariputta
 Which is better  the gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree or the Yama gods
 The Yama gods Master Sariputta
 Which is better  the Yama gods or the gods of the Tusita heaven
 The gods of the Tusita heaven Master Sariputta
 Which is better  the gods of the Tusita heaven or the gods who delight in creating
 The gods who delight in creating Master Sariputta
 Which is better  the gods who delight in creating or the gods who wield power over others creations
 The gods who wield power over others creations Master Sariputta
What do you think Dhananjani Which is better  the gods who wield power over others creations or the Brahmaworld
 Master Sariputta said the Brahmaworld Master Sariputta said the Brahmaworld
Then the venerable Sariputta thought These brahmins are devoted to the Brahmaworld
Suppose I show the brahmin Dhananjani the path to the company of Brahma
And he said Dhananjani I shall show you the path to the company of Brahma Listen and attend closely to what I shall say
 Yes sir he replied
The venerable Sariputta said this  What is the path to the company of Brahma
Here Dhananjani a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
This is the path to the company of Brahma
Again Dhananjani a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassionwith a mind imbued with appreciative joywith a mind imbued with equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with equanimity abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
This too is the path to the company of Brahma
Then Master Sariputta pay homage in my name with your head at the Blessed Ones feet and say Venerable sir the brahmin Dhananjani is afflicted suffering and gravely ill
Then the venerable Sariputta having established the brahmin Dhananjani in the inferior Brahmaworld rose from his seat and departed while there was still more to be done
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Sariputta having established the brahmin Dhananjani in the inferior Brahmaworld rose from his seat and departed while there was still more to be done
Then the venerable Sariputta went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side and said Venerable sir the brahmin Dhananjani is afflicted suffering and gravely ill he pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feet
Sariputta having established the brahmin Dhananjani in the inferior Brahmaworld why did you rise from your seat and leave while there was still more to be done
Venerable sir I thought thus These brahmins are devoted to the Brahmaworld Suppose I show the brahmin Dhananjani the path to the company of Brahma
Sariputta the brahmin Dhananjani has died and has reappeared in the Brahmaworld
and the venerable Sariputta asked him Is the Blessed One well and strong friend
and there he lived in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
Now at that time the brahmin Dhananjani was having his cows milked in a cowshed outside the city
Monks these two slander the Tathagata
Which two
He who explains a discourse whose meaning needs to be inferred as one whose meaning has already been fully drawn out And he who explains a discourse whose meaning has already been fully drawn out as one whose meaning needs to be inferred
These are two who slander the Tathagata
Bhikkhus these two things pertain to true knowledge
What two
Serenity and insight
When serenity is developed what benefit does one experience
The mind is developed
When the mind is developed what benefit does one experience
Lust is abandoned
When insight is developed what benefit does one experience
Wisdom is developed
When wisdom is developed what benefit does one experience
Ignorance is abandoned
A mind defiled by lust is not liberated and wisdom defiled by ignorance is not developed
Thus bhikkhus through the fading away of lust there is liberation of mind and through the fading away of ignorance there is liberation by wisdom
Monks I will teach you the level of a person of no integrity and the level of a person of integrity
Listen  pay close attention

As you say lord the monks responded

Now what is the level of a person of no integrity
A person of no integrity is ungrateful  unthankful
This ingratitude this lack of thankfulness is advocated by rude people
It is entirely on the level of people of no integrity
A person of integrity is grateful  thankful
This gratitude this thankfulness is advocated by civil people
It is entirely on the level of people of integrity 
I tell you monks there are two people who are not easy to repay
Which two
Your mother  father
Even if you were to carry your mother on one shoulder  your father on the other shoulder for  years and were to look after them by anointing massaging bathing  rubbing their limbs
and they were to defecate  urinate right there on your shoulders
you would not in that way pay or repay your parents
If you were to establish your mother  father in absolute sovereignty over this great earth abounding in the seven treasures you would not in that way pay or repay your parents
Why is that
Mother  father do much for their children They care for them they nourish them they introduce them to this world
But anyone who rouses his unbelieving mother  father settles  establishes them in conviction rouses his unvirtuous mother  father settles  establishes them in virtue rouses his stingy mother  father settles  establishes them in generosity rouses his foolish mother  father settles  establishes them in discernment To this extent one pays  repays ones mother  father
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Venerable Mahakaccana was dwelling at Varana on a bank of the Kaddama Lake
Then the brahmin Aramadanda approached the Venerable Mahakaccana and exchanged greetings with him
When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one side
and said to him  Why is it Master Kaccana that  khattiyas fight with khattiyas brahmins with brahmins and householders with householders
It is brahmin because of adherence to lust for sensual pleasures bondage to it fixation on it obsession by it holding firmly to itthat khattiyas fight with khattiyas brahmins with brahmins and householders with householders
Why is it Master Kaccana that ascetics fight with ascetics
It is brahmin because of adherence to lust for views bondage to it fixation on it obsession by it holding firmly to it that ascetics fight with ascetics
Is there then anyone in the world who has overcome this adherence to lust for sensual pleasures holding firmly to itand this adherence to lust for views holding firmly to it
And who is that
There is brahmin a town to the east called Savatthi
There the Blessed One the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One is now dwelling
The Blessed One has overcome this adherence to lust for sensual pleasures bondage to it fixation on itobsession by it holding firmly to it and he has overcome this adherence to lust for views bondage to it fixation on it obsession by it holding firmly to it
When this was said the brahmin Aramadanda rose from his seat arranged his upper robe over one shoulder lowered his right knee to the ground  reverently saluted in the direction of the Blessed One and uttered this inspired utterance three times
Homage to the Blessed One the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One Homage to the Blessed One the Arahantthe Perfectly Enlightened One Homage to the Blessed One the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One
Indeed that Blessed One has overcome this adherence to lust for sensual pleasures bondage to it fixation on it obsession by it holding firmly to it and he has overcome this adherence to lust for views bondage to it fixation on it obsession by it holding firmly to it
Excellent Master Kaccana Excellent Master Kaccana
Master Kaccana has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning up right what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms
Master Kaccana I now go for refuge to Master Gotama to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
Let Master Kaccana consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life
The male and female householders saw the Blessed One sitting there
Enough brahmin
I have finished my meal for today
and the venerable Sariputta asked him Are you diligent Dhananjani
for the sake of his friends and companions
for the sake of his kinsmen and relatives
for the sake of his guests
for the sake of his departed ancestors
for the sake of the deities
for the sake of the king
Would he be able to free himself by pleading thus It was for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body that I behaved contrary to the Dhamma that I behaved unrighteously so let not the wardens of hell drag me off to hell Or would others be able to free him by pleading thus It was for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body that he behaved contrary to the Dhamma that he behaved unrighteously so let not the wardens of hell drag him off to hell
the one who for the sake of his parents behaves according to the Dhamma behaves righteously is the better
for the sake of his slaves servants and workers
for the sake of his kinsmen and relatives
for the sake of his friends and companions
for the sake of his guests
for the sake of his departed ancestors
for the sake of the deities
for the sake of the king
for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body behaves contrary to the Dhamma behaves unrighteously or one who for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body behaves according to the Dhamma behaves righteously
the one who for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body behaves according to the Dhamma behaves righteously is the better
he pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feet
he pays homage with his head at the venerable Sariputtas feet
and said to the brahmin Dhananjani I hope you are getting well brahmin I hope you are comfortable
and delivered his message
he delivered his message saying
It would be good venerable sir if the venerable Sariputta would come to the residence of the brahmin Dhananjani out of compassion
Then the venerable Sariputta dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went to the residence of the brahmin Dhananjani sat down on a seat made ready
and that their subsiding not their increase is apparent
their increase and not their subsiding is apparent
Just as if a strong man were tightening a tough leather strap around my head as a headband so too there are violent pains in my head
Just as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve up an oxs belly with a sharp butchers knife so too violent winds are carving up my belly
Just as if two strong men were to seize a weaker man by both arms and roast him over a pit of hot coals so too there is a violent burning in my body
their increase and not their subsiding is apparent
he pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feet
Soon after the venerable Sariputta had left the brahmin Dhananjani died and reappeared in the Brahmaworld
for the sake of his slaves servants and workers
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Then the brahmin Esukari went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
and said  Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe four levels of service They prescribe the level of service towards a brahmin the level of service towards a noble the level of service towards a merchant and the level of service towards a worker
Therein Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the level of service towards a brahmin a brahmin may serve a brahmin a noble may serve a brahmin a merchant may serve a brahmin and a worker may serve a brahmin
That is the level of service towards a brahmin that the brahmins prescribe
Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the level of service towards a noble a noble may serve a noble a merchant may serve a noble and a worker may serve a noble
That is the level of service towards a noble that the brahmins prescribe
Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the level of service towards a merchant a merchant may serve a merchant and a worker may serve a merchant
That is the level of service towards a merchant that the brahmins prescribe
Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the level of service towards a worker only a worker may serve a worker
That is the level of service towards a worker that the brahmins prescribe
What does Master Gotama say about this
Well brahmin has all the world authorised the brahmins to prescribe these four levels of service
  No  Master Gotama
 Suppose brahmin a poor penniless destitute man
I do not say brahmin that all are to be served nor do I say that none are to be served
For if when serving someone one becomes worse and not better because of that service then I say that he should not be served And if when serving someone one becomes better and not worse because of that service then I say that he should be served
If they were to ask a noble thus Which of these should you serve  one in whose service you become worse and not better when serving him or one in whose service you become better and not worse when serving him answering rightly a noble would answer thus I should not serve the one in whose service I become worse and not better when serving him I should serve the one in whose service I become better and not worse when serving him
If they were to ask a brahminto ask a merchantto ask a workeranswering rightly a worker would answer thus I should not serve the one in whose service I become worse and not better when serving him I should serve the one in whose service I become better and not worse when serving him
I do not say brahmin that one is better because one is from an aristocratic family not do I say that one is worse because one is from an aristocratic family I do not say that one is better because one is of great beauty nor do I say that one is worse because one is of great beauty I do not say that one is better because one is of great wealth nor do I say that one is worse because one is of great wealth
For here brahmin one from an aristocratic family may kill living beings take what is not given misconduct himself in sensual pleasures speak falsely speak maliciously speak harshly gossip be covetous have a mind of ill will and hold wrong view
Therefore I do not say that one is better because one is from an aristocratic family
But also brahmin one from an aristocratic family may abstain from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech from malicious speech from harsh speech and from gossip and he may be uncovetous have a mind without ill will and hold right view
Therefore I do not say that one is worse because one is from an aristocratic family
Here brahmin one of great beautyone of great wealth may kill living beingsand hold wrong view
Therefore I do not say that one is better because one is of great beautyof great wealth
But also brahmin one of great beautyof great wealth may abstain from killing living beingsand hold right view
Therefore I do not say that one is worse because one is of great beautyof great wealth
I do not say brahmin that all are to be served nor do I say that none are to be served
For if when serving someone ones faith virtue learning generosity and wisdom increase in his service then I say that he should be served
When this was said the brahmin Esukari said to the Blessed One Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe four types of wealth They prescribe the wealth of a brahmin the wealth of a noble the wealth of a merchant and the wealth of a worker
Therein Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a brahmin  wandering for alms a brahmin who spurns his own wealth wandering for alms abuses his duty like a guard who takes what has not been given
Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a noble  the bow and quiver a noble who spurns his own wealth the bow and quiver abuses his duty like a guard who takes what has not been given
Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a merchant  farming and cattlebreeding a merchant who spurns his own wealth farming and cattlebreeding abuses his duty like a guard who takes what has not been given
Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a worker  the sickle and carryingpole a worker who spurns his own wealth the sickle and carryingpole abuses his duty like a guard who takes what has not been given
What does Master Gotama say about this
Well brahmin has all the world authorised the brahmins to prescribe these four types of wealth
 No Master Gotama
 Suppose brahmin a poor penniless destitute man
I brahmin declare the noble supramundane Dhamma as a persons own wealth
Just as fire is reckoned by the particular condition dependent on which it burns 
But recollecting his ancient maternal and paternal lineage he is reckoned according to wherever he is reborn
If he is rebornin a clan of workers he is reckoned as a worker
If brahmin anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth from the home life into homelessness and after encountering the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata he abstains from killing living beings from taking what is not given from incelibacy from false speech from malicious speech from harsh speech and from gossip and is uncovetous has a mind without ill will and holds right view he is one who is accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesome
If brahmin anyone from a clan of brahmins goes forth
What do you think brahmin Is only a brahmin capable of developing a mind of lovingkindness towards a certain region without hostility and without ill will and not a noble or a merchant or a worker
No Master Gotama
Whether it be a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker  those of all four castes are capable of developing a mind of lovingkindness towards a certain region without hostility and without ill will
So too brahmin if anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth
What do you think brahmin Is only a brahmin capable of taking a loofah and bath powder going to the river and washing off dust and dirt and not a noble or a merchant or a worker
No Master Gotama
Whether it be a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker  those of all four castes are capable of taking a loofah and bath powder going to the river and washing off dust and dirt
So too brahmin if anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth 
What do you think brahmin Suppose a headanointed noble king were to assemble here a hundred men of different birth
So too brahmin if anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth
When this was said the brahmin Esukari said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body and because of such behaviour the wardens of hell were to drag him off to hell
for who else could serve a worker
they were to force a cut of meat upon and tell him Good man you must eat this meat and pay for it
so too without the consent of those other recluses and brahmins the brahmins nevertheless prescribe those four levels of service
That is the wealth of a brahmin which the brahmins prescribe
That is the wealth of a noble which the brahmins prescribe
That is the wealth of a merchant which the brahmins prescribe
That is the wealth of a worker which the brahmins prescribe
they were to force a cut of meat upon and tell him Good man you must eat this meat and pay for it
so too without the consent of those other recluses and brahmins the brahmins nevertheless prescribe these four types of wealth
But recollecting his ancient maternal and paternal family lineage he is reckoned according to wherever he is reborn
If he is reborn in a clan of nobles he is reckoned as a noble if he is reborn in a clan of brahmins he is reckoned as a brahmin if he is reborn in a clan of merchants he is reckoned as a merchant if he is reborn in a clan of workers he is reckoned as a worker
when fire burns dependent on logs it is reckoned as a log fire when fire burns dependent on faggots it is reckoned as a faggot fire when fire burns dependent on grass it is reckoned as a grass fire when fire burns dependent on cowdung it is reckoned as a cowdung fire 
so too brahmin I declare the noble supramundane Dhamma as a persons own wealth
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then a certain devatā in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove went to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him she stood to one side
As she was standing there she said to him Tell me dear sir how you crossed over the flood
I crossed over the flood without pushing forward without staying in place
But how dear sir did you cross over the flood without pushing forward without staying in place
When I pushed forward I was whirled about When I stayed in place I sank
And so I crossed over the flood without pushing forward without staying in place
At long last I see a brahman totally unbound
who without pushing forward without staying in place has crossed over the entanglements of the world
That is what the devatā said
The Teacher approved
Realizing that The Teacher has approved of me she bowed down to him circumambulated himkeeping him to her rightand then vanished right there
Near Sāvatthī
Then a certain devatā in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove went to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him she stood to one side
As she was standing there she said to him
Do you know dear sir freedom liberation seclusion for beings
Yes friend I know freedom liberation seclusion for beings
But how dear sir do you know freedom liberation seclusion for beings
The Buddha From the destruction of delight in becoming from the ending of perception  consciousness from the cessation stilling of feelings Thats how I know freedom liberation seclusion for beings
Near Sāvatthī
Standing to one side a devatā addressed the Blessed One with a verse
Those in whom phenomena are unpenetrated who may be led by the teachings of others
Asleep are they they havent awakened Its time for them to awaken
The Buddha Those in whom phenomena are wellpenetrated may not be led by the teachings of others
Awakened through right knowing they go among the discordant harmoniously
Near Sāvatthī
Standing to one side a devatā addressed the Blessed One with a verse
Here theres no taming for one fond of conceit
no sagacity for one unconcentrated
One dwelling alone in the wilderness heedlessly
wont cross over beyond Deaths realm
his mind wellconcentrated wellaware everywhere released
The Buddha Abandoning conceit
one dwelling alone in the wilderness heedfully
He will cross over beyond Deaths realm
Near Sāvatthī
Standing to one side a devatā addressed the Blessed One with a verse
Living in the wilderness staying peaceful remaining chaste
eating just one meal a day why are their faces so bright  serene
The Buddha They dont sorrow over the past dont long for the future
They survive on the present Thats why their faces are bright  serene
From longing for the future from sorrowing over the past
fools wither away like a green reed cut down
If anyone from a clan of merchants goes forth
If anyone from a clan of workers goes forth from the home life into homelessness and after encountering the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata he abstains from killing living beingsand holds right view he is one who is accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesome
he is one who is accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesome
he is one who is accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesome
For all fire has a flame a colour and a radiance and it is possible to use all fire for the purposes of fire
he is one who is accomplishing the true way the Dhamma that is wholesome
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the venerable Udena was living at Benares in the Khemiya Mango Grove
Now on that occasion the brahmin Ghotamukha had arrived in Benares for some business or other
As he was walking and wandering for exercise he came to the Khemiya Mango Grove
At the time the venerable Udena was walking up and down in the open
Then the brahmin Ghotamukha went up to the venerable Udena and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished still walking up and down with the venerable Udena he said this Worthy recluse there is no wanderers life that accords with the Dhamma so it seems to me here
When this was said the venerable Udena stepped down from the walk and went into his dwelling where he sat down on a seat made ready
Then the venerable Udena said to him There are seats brahmin
We did not sit down because we were waiting for Master Udena to speak
For how could one like myself presume to sit down on a seat without first being invited to do so
Then the brahmin Ghotamukha took a low seat sat down at one side
Brahmin if you think any statement of mine is to be agreed with then agree with it if you think any statement of mine is to be argued against then argue against it and if you do not understand the meaning of any statement of mine ask me to clarify it thus How is this Master Udena What is the meaning of this
In this way we can discuss this matter
Master Udena if I think any statement of Master Udenas is to be agreed with I shall agree with it if I think any statement of his is to be argued against I shall argue against it and if I do not understand the meaning of any statement of Master Udenas then I shall ask Master Udena to clarify it thus How is this Master Udena What is the meaning of this
In this way let us discuss this matter
Brahmin there are four kinds of persons to be found existing in the world
What four
Brahmin there are two kinds of assembly
What two
Here a certain assembly lusts after jewels and earrings and seeks wives and children men and women slaves fields and land gold and silver
But here a certain assembly does not lust after jewels and earrings but having abandoned wives and children men and women slaves fields and land gold and silver has gone forth from the home life into homelessness
Now there is this kind of person who does not torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others
In which of the two kinds of assembly do you usually see this person brahmin  in the assembly that lusts after jewels and earrings and seeks wives and children men and women slaves fields and land gold and silver or in the assembly that does not lust after jewels and earrings but having abandoned wives and childrenhas gone forth from the home life into homelessness
I usually see this kind of person Master Udena in the assembly that does not lust after jewels and earrings but having abandoned wives and childrenhas gone forth from the home life into homelessness
But only just now brahmin we understood you to say Worthy recluse there is no wanderers life that accords with the Dhamma so it seems to me here
Certainly Master Udena it was in order to learn that I spoke those words
There is a wanderers life that accords with the Dhamma so it seems to me here
It would be good if out of compassion Master Udena would expound to me in detail those four kinds of persons he mentioned in brief
Then brahmin listen and attend closely to what I shall say
 Yes sir the brahmin Ghotamukha replied
The venerable Udena said this 
Here a certain person goes naked
When this was said the brahmin Ghotamukha said to the venerable Udena Magnificent Master Udena Magnificent Master Udena
Master Udena has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
From today let Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
Do not go to me for refuge brahmin
Go for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge
Where is he living now that Master Gotama accomplished and fully enlightened Master Udena
That Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened has attained final Nibbana brahmin
If we heard that Master Gotama was within ten leagues we would go ten leagues in order to see that Master Gotama accomplished and fully enlightened
If we heard that Master Gotama was within twenty leaguesthirty leaguesforty leaguesfifty leagues
But since that Master Gotama has attained to final Nibbana we go to that Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
From today let Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Now Master Udena the king of Anga gives me a daily donation Let me give Master Udena a regular donation from that
What kind of regular donation does the king of Anga give you brahmin
Five hundred kahapanas Master Udena
It is not allowable for us to accept gold and silver brahmin
If it is not allowable for Master Udena I will have a monastery built for Master Udena
If you desire to have a monastery built for me brahmin have an assembly hall built for the Sangha at Pataliputta
I am still more satisfied and pleased that Master Udena suggests that I give a gift to the Sangha
So with this regular donation and another regular donation I shall have an assembly hall built for the Sangha at Pataliputta
Then with that regular donation which he offered to Master Udena and another regular donation added to it the brahmin Ghotamukha had an assembly hall built for the Sangha at Pataliputta
And that is now known as the Ghotamukhi
And Ghotamukha too stepped down from the walk and went into the dwelling where he stood at one side
sit down if you wish
and said to the venerable Udena Worthy recluse there is no wanderers life that accords with the Dhamma so it seems to me here
and that may be because I have not seen such venerable ones as yourself or because I have not seen the Dhamma here
 But Master Udena the kind of person who does not torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others who since he torments neither himself nor others is here and now hungerless extinguished and cooled and abides experiencing bliss having himself become holy  he does not torment and torture either himself or others both of whom desire pleasure and recoil from pain That is why this kind of person satisfies my mind
who since he torments neither himself nor others is here and now hungerless extinguished and cooled and abides experiencing bliss having himself become holy
and that may be because I have not seen such venerable ones as yourself or because I have not seen the Dhamma here
and may Master Udena remember me to have spoken thus
Brahmin what kind of person torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself
and abides experiencing bliss having himself become holy
I go to Master Udena for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
a hundred leagues we would go a hundred leagues in order to see that Master Gotama accomplished and fully enlightened
and that may be because I have not seen such venerable ones as yourself or because I have not seen the Dhamma here
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the country of the Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus and eventually he arrived at a town of the Anguttarapans named Apana
The mattedhair ascetic Keniya heard The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the country of the Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus and he has come to Apana
Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect
Then the mattedhair ascetic Keniya went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
The Blessed One instructed urged roused and encouraged him with a talk on the Dhamma
Then having been instructed urged roused and encouraged by the Blessed One with a talk on the Dhamma the mattedhair ascetic Keniya said to the Blessed One Let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from me
When this was said the Blessed One told him The Sangha of bhikkhus is large Keniya consisting of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus and you place full confidence in the brahmins
A second time the mattedhair ascetic Keniya said to the Blessed One Although the Sangha of bhikkhus is large Master Gotama consisting of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus and although I place full confidence in the brahmins still let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from me
A second time the Blessed One told him The Sangha of bhikkhus is large Keniya
The Blessed One consented in silence
Then knowing that the Blessed One had consented the mattedhair ascetic Keniya rose from his seat and went to his own hermitage where he addressed his friends and companions his kinsmen and relatives thus Hear me sirs my friends and companions my kinsmen and relatives The recluse Gotama has been invited by me for tomorrows meal together with the Sangha of bhikkhus
Make the necessary purchases and preparations for me
Yes sir they replied and some dug out ovens some chopped wood some washed dishes some set out water jugs some prepared seats
Now on that occasion the brahmin Sela was staying at Apana He was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology and etymology and the histories as a fifth skilled in philology and grammar he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man and was teaching the recitation of the hymns to three hundred brahmin students
At the time the mattedhair ascetic Keniya had placed full confidence in the brahmin Sela
Then the brahmin Sela while walking and wandering for exercise attended by his three hundred brahmin students came to the mattedhair ascetic Keniyas hermitage
There he saw some men digging out ovens some chopping wood some washing dishes some setting out water jugs some preparing seats while the mattedhair ascetic Keniya himself was setting up a pavilion
When he saw this he asked the mattedhair ascetic Keniya What is Master Keniya to hold a marriage or a giving in marriage Or is there some great sacrifice Or has King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha been invited with a large retinue for tomorrows meal
I will not be holding a marriage or a giving in marriage Master Sela nor has King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha been invited with a large retinue for tomorrows meal but I am planning a great sacrifice
The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the country of the Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus and has come to Apana
Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened buddha blessed
He has been invited by me for tomorrows meal together with the Sangha of bhikkhus
Did you say Buddha Keniya
I said Buddha Sela
Did you say Buddha Keniya
I said Buddha Sela
Then it occurred to the brahmin Sela Even this word Buddha is hard to come across in this world
Now the thirty two marks of a Great Man have been handed down in our hymns and the Great Man who is endowed with them has only two possible destinies no other
If he lives the home life he becomes a Wheelturning Monarch a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma master of the four quarters allvictorious who has stabilised his country and possesses the seven treasures
He has these seven treasures the wheeltreasure the elephant treasure the horsetreasure the jeweltreasure the woman treasure the stewardtreasure and the counsellortreasure as the seventh
His children who exceed a thousand are brave and heroic and crush the armies of others
But if he goes forth from the home life into homelessness he becomes an Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened One who draws aside the veil in the world
He said My good Keniya where is Master Gotama the Accomplished One the Fully Enlightened One now living
When this was said the mattedhair ascetic Keniya extended his right arm and said There where that green line of the grove is Master Sela
Then the brahmin Sela went with the three hundred brahmin students to the Blessed One
He addressed the brahmin students Come quietly sirs tread carefully for these Blessed Ones are difficult to approach they wander alone like lions
When I am speaking with the recluse Gotama do not break in and interrupt me
Then the brahmin Sela went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
He saw more or less the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Blessed Ones body except two
Then it occurred to the Blessed One This brahmin Sela sees the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on me except two
Then the Blessed One worked such a feat of supernormal power that the brahmin Sela saw that the Blessed Ones male organ was enclosed in a sheath
Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue and he repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils and he covered the whole of his forehead with his tongue
Then the brahmin Sela thought The recluse Gotama is endowed with the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man they are complete not incomplete But I do not know whether he is a Buddha or not
However I have heard from elder aged brahmins who speak according to the lineage of teachers that those who are the Accomplished Ones Fully Enlightened Ones reveal themselves as such when their praise is spoken
Suppose I extol the recluse Gotama to his face with fitting stanzas
Then he extolled the Blessed One to his face with fitting stanzas
The features are seen one and all That distinguish a man as well born
With eyes clear with countenance bright Majestic erect as a flame
A bhikkhu so lovely to look on With skin of so golden a sheen 
You are fit to be a king a lord of chariots A monarch who makes the wheel turn
Buddha I am already a king O Sela the Blessed One replied I am supreme king of the Dhamma
Sela You claim full enlightenment the brahmin Sela said I am supreme long of the Dhamma
Who is your general that disciple Who follows in the Masters own way
Who is it who helps you to turn The wheel set in motion by you
Buddha The wheel set in motion by me The Blessed One replied That same supreme Wheel of Dhamma
What must be known is directly known What must be developed has been developed
So let your doubts about me cease And let decision take their place
I am the one whose presence in the world Is very rarely come upon
I am the holy one beyond compare Who has crushed all Maras teeming hordes
Sela O sirs hear this hear what he says The man of vision
That he is the holy one beyond compare Who has crushed all Maras teeming hordes
Now let him follow me who wants And who wants not let him depart
For I will go forth under him This man of lofty wisdom
Pupils If O sir you now approve This teaching of the Enlightened One
Sela There are three hundred brahmins here Who with uplifted hands implore
Buddha The holy life is well proclaimed O Sela said the Blessed One To be seen here and not delayed
Then the brahmin Sela and his assembly received the going forth under the Blessed One and they received the full admission
Then when the night had ended the mattedhair ascetic Keniya had good food of various kinds prepared in his own hermitage and had the time announced to the Blessed One It is time Master Gotama the meal is ready
Then it being morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the hermitage of the mattedhair ascetic Keniya and sat down on the seat made ready
Then with his own hands the mattedhair ascetic Keniya served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with various kinds of good food
When the Blessed One had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl the mattedhair ascetic Keniya took a low seat and sat down on one side
Thereupon the Blessed One gave him his blessing with these stanzas
Then not long after their full admission dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Sela and his assembly by realising for themselves with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
They directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
And the venerable Sela together with his assembly became arahants
Then the venerable Sela together with his assembly went to the Blessed One Having arranged his upper robe on one shoulder extending his hands in reverential greeting towards the Blessed One he addressed him with these stanzas
In these seven nights O Blessed One We have been tamed in your teaching
You are the Buddha you are the Teacher You are the Sage the conqueror of Mara
Having cut off all evil tendencies You have crossed and guide humanity across
You have surmounted all attachments You have removed all the taints
You are a lion free from clinging You have abandoned fear and dread
Here these three hundred bhikkhus stand With hands held out in adoration
O Hero extend your feet And let these great beings worship the Teacher
Now it is good to see such arahants
and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
A third time the mattedhair ascetic Keniya said to the Blessed One Although the Sangha is large Master Gotamastill let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from me
while the mattedhair ascetic Keniya himself set up a pavilion
over this earth bounded by the ocean he rules without a rod without a weapon by means of the Dhamma
but wait until our talk is finished
and looked for the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Blessed Ones body
he was doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks and he could not decide and make up his mind about them about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue
he is doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks and he cannot decide and make up his mind about them about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue
Sela O perfect in body well favoured Well fashioned and lovely to behold
O Blessed One golden is your colour And white your teeth you are strong
They are all to be found on your body These marks that reveal a Great Man
With beauty so rare why should you Be content with the life of a recluse
With warriors and great princes All devoted to your service
O Gotama you should reign As ruler of men king above all kings
I make the Wheel of Dhamma revolve The wheel that none can stop
I make the Wheel of Dhamma revolve  You tell me O Gotama
Sariputta the Tathagatas son Helps me in turning this wheel
What must be abandoned has been abandoned Therefore brahmin I am a Buddha
For it is always hard to gain Sight of the Enlightened Ones
I am the Fully Enlightened One I O brahmin am the supreme physician
Having defeated all my enemies I rejoice free from fear
the physician The mighty hero who roars Like a lion in the forest
Who even though of outcast birth Would not believe him when he saw 
We too will go forth under him This man of lofty wisdom
O may we live the holy life Under you O Blessed One
One who trains with diligence Will find a fruitful going forth
Burnt offerings are the glory of fires Savitri the glory of Vedic hymns
Glory of human beings a king Glory of flowing rivers the sea
The moon is the glory of the stars The sun is the glory of all that shine
Merit is the glory of all who aspire The Sangha glory of those who give
When the Blessed One had given his blessing with these stanzas he rose from his seat and departed
Eight days have passed AllSeeing One Since we went to you for refuge
In the midst of this body of recluses You shine like the blazing sun
A victor in all the four quarters And lord of the Jambutree Grove
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with five hundred bhikkhus
Now on that occasion the brahmin Brahmayu was living at Mithila He was old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage he was in his hundred and twentieth year He was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology and etymology and the histories as a fifth skilled in philology and grammar he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man
Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect The Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed
He declares this world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas this generation with its recluses and brahmins with its princes and its people which he has himself realised with direct knowledge
He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing and he reveals a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure
Now it is good to see such arahants
Now at that time the brahmin Brahmayu had a young brahmin student named Uttara who was a master of the Three Vedasfully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man
He told his student My dear Uttara the recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with five hundred bhlkkhus
Come my dear Uttara go to the recluse Gotama and find out whether the report spread about him is true or not and whether Master Gotama is one such as this or not
Thus we shall know about Master Gotama through you
But how shall I find out sir whether the report spread about Master Gotama is true or not and whether Master Gotama is one such as this or not
My dear Uttara the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man have been handed down in our hymns and the Great Man who is endowed with them has only two possible destinies no other
He has these seven treasures the wheeltreasure the elephanttreasure the horsetreasure the jeweltreasure the womantreasure the stewardtreasure and the counsellortreasure as the seventh
But if he goes forth from the home life into homelessness he becomes an Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened One who draws aside the veil in the world
Yes sir he replied He rose from his seat and after paying homage to the brahmin Brahmayu keeping him on his right he left for the country of the Videhans where the Blessed One was wandering
Travelling by stages he came to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
He saw more or less the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Blessed Ones body except two
Then it occurred to the Blessed One This brahmin student Uttara sees more or less the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on me except two
Then the Blessed One worked such a feat of supernormal power that the brahmin student Uttara saw that the Blessed Ones male organ was enclosed in a sheath
Then the brahmin student Uttara thought The recluse Gotama is endowed with the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man
Suppose I were to follow the recluse Gotama and observe his behaviour
Then he followed the Blessed One for seven months like a shadow never leaving him
At the end of the seven months in the country of the Videhans he set out to journey to Mithila
where the brahmin Brahmayu was When he arrived he paid homage to him and sat down at one side
Thereupon the brahmin Brahmayu asked him Well my dear Uttara is the report that has been spread about Master Gotama true or not
And is Master Gotama one such as this or not
The report that has been spread about Master Gotama is true sir and not otherwise
and Master Gotama is one such as this and not otherwise He possesses the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man
Master Gotama sets his foot down squarely  this is a mark of a Great Man in Master Gotama
On the soles of his feet there are wheels with a thousand spokes and ribs and hubs all complete
He has legs like an antelopes
The tips of his bodyhairs turn up the upturned bodyhairs are blueblack the colour of collyrium curled and turned to the right
His neck and his shoulders are even
His taste is supremely acute
He is lionjawed
His teeth are without gaps
When he walks he steps out with the right foot first
He does not extend his foot too far or put it down too near He walks neither too quickly nor too slowly He walks without his knees knocking together He walks without his ankles knocking together
He walks without raising or lowering his thighs or bringing them together or keeping them apart
When he walks only the lower part of his body oscillates and he does not walk with bodily effort
When he turns to look he does so with his whole body He does not look straight up he does not look straight down He does not walk looking about He looks a ploughyokes length before him beyond that he has unhindered knowledge and vision
When he goes indoors he does not raise or lower his body or bend it forward or back He turns round neither too far from the seat nor too near it
He does not lean on the seat with his hand He does not throw his body onto the seat
When seated indoors he does not fidget with his hands He does not fidget with his feet He does not sit with his knees crossed He does not sit with his ankles crossed He does not sit with his hand holding his chin
When seated indoors he is not afraid he does not shiver and tremble he is not nervous
Being unafraid not shivering or trembling or nervous his hair does not stand up and he is intent on seclusion
When he receives the water for the bowl
he does not raise or lower the bowl or tip it forwards or backwards
He washes the bowl without making a splashing noise He washes the bowl without turning it round He does not put the bowl on the floor to wash his hands when his hands are washed the bowl is washed and when the bowl is washed his hands are washed
He pours the water for the bowl neither too far nor too near and he does not pour it about
When he receives rice he does not raise or lower the bowl or tip it forwards or backwards
He receives neither too little rice nor too much rice
He adds sauces in the right proportion he does not exceed the right amount of sauce in the mouthful
He turns the mouthful over two or three times in his mouth and then swallows it and no rice kernel enters his body unchewed and no rice kernel remains in his mouth then he takes another mouthful
He takes his food experiencing the taste though not experiencing greed for the taste
The food he takes has eight factors it is neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness but only for the endurance and continuance of his body for the ending of discomfort and for assisting the holy life he considers Thus I shall terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in comfort
When he has eaten and receives water for the bowl he does not raise or lower the bowl or tip it forwards or backwards
He receives neither too little nor too much water for the bowl
He washes the bowl without making a splashing noise He washes the bowl without turning it round He does not put the bowl on the floor to wash his hands when his hands are washed the bowl is washed and when the bowl is washed his hands are washed
He pours the water for the bowl neither too far nor too near and he does not pour it about
When he has eaten he puts the bowl on the floor neither too far nor too near and he is neither careless of the bowl nor oversolicitous about it
When he has eaten he sits in silence for a while but he does not let the time for the blessing go by
When he has eaten and gives the blessing he does not do so criticising the meal or expecting another meal he instructs urges rouses and encourages that audience with talk purely on the Dhamma
He walks neither too fast nor too slow and he does not go as one who wants to get away  His robe is worn neither too high nor too low on his body nor too tight against his body nor too loose on his body nor does the wind blow his robe away from his body Dust and dirt do not soil his body
When he has gone to the monastery he sits down on a seat made ready
Having sat down he washes his feet though he does not concern himself with grooming his feet
Having washed his feet he seats himself crosslegged sets his body erect and establishes mindfulness in front of him
He does not occupy his mind with selfaffliction or the affliction of others or the affliction of both he sits with his mind set on his own welfare on the welfare of others and on the welfare of both even on the welfare of the whole world
When he has gone to the monastery he teaches the Dhamma to an audience He neither flatters nor berates that audience he instructs urges rouses and encourages it with talk purely on the Dhamma
The speech that issues from his mouth has eight qualities it is distinct intelligible melodious audible ringing euphonious deep and sonorous
But while his voice is intelligible as far as the audience extends his speech does not issue out beyond the audience
When the people have been instructed urged roused and encouraged by him they rise from their seats and depart looking only at him and concerned with nothing else
We have seen Master Gotama walking sir we have seen him standing we have seen him entering indoors we have seen him indoors seated in silence after eating we have seen him giving the blessing after eating we have seen him going to the monastery in silence we have seen him in the monastery teaching the Dhamma to an audience
Such is the Master Gotama such he is and more than that
When this was said the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat and after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder he extended his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and uttered this exclamation three times
Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
Perhaps sometime or other we might meet Master Gotama
Then in the course of his wandering the Blessed One eventually arrived at Mithila
There the Blessed One lived in Makhadevas Mango Grove
The brahmin householders of Mithila heard The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with five hundred bhikkhus and he has now come to Mithila and is living in Makhadevas Mango Grove
Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect
Then the brahmin householders of Mithila went to the Blessed One Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side some exchanged greetings with him and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished sat down at one side some extended their hands in reverential salutation towards him and sat down at one side some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed Ones presence and sat down at one side some kept silent and sat down at one side
The brahmin Brahmayu heard The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from the Sakyan clan has arrived in Mithila and is living in Makhadevas Mango Grove in Mithila
Then the brahmin Brahmayu went to Makhadevas Mango Grove with a number of brahmin students
When he came to the Mango Grove he thought It is not proper that I should go to the recluse Gotama without first being announced
Then he addressed a certain brahmin student Come brahmin student go to the recluse Gotama and ask in my name whether the recluse Gotama is free from illness and affliction and is healthy strong and abiding in comfort saying Master Gotama the brahmin Brahmayu asks whether Master Gotama is free from illness abiding in comfort 
and say this The brahmin Brahmayu Master Gotama is old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage he is in his hundred and twentieth year He is a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology and etymology and the histories as a fifth skilled in philology and grammar he is fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man
Of all the brahmin householders who live in Mithila the brahmin Brahmayu is pronounced the foremost of them in wealth in knowledge of the hymns and in age and fame
He wants to see Master Gotama
Yes sir   the brahmin student replied He went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished
The Blessed One said Now is the time for the brahmin Brahmayu to do as he thinks fit
Then the brahmin student went to the brahmin Brahmayu and said Permission has been granted by the recluse Gotama
Now is the time sir to do as you think fit
So the brahmin Brahmayu went to the Blessed One
The assembly saw him coming in the distance
Then the brahmin Brahmayu said to the assembly Enough sirs
I shall sit here next to the recluse Gotama
Then he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
He saw more or less the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Blessed Ones body except two
Then the brahmin Brahmayu addressed the Blessed One in stanzas
Is what should be concealed by cloth Hid in a sheath greatest of men
Though called by a word of feminine gender Perhaps your tongue is a manly one
Perhaps your tongue is large as well According to what we have been taught
Please put it out a little bit And so O Seer cure our doubt
And now we crave for leave to ask Something that we aspire to know
Then it occurred to the Blessed One This brahmin Brahmayu sees more or less the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on me except two
Then the Blessed One worked such a feat of supernormal power that the brahmin Brahmayu saw that the Blessed Ones male organ was enclosed in a sheath
Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue and he repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils and he covered the whole of his forehead with his tongue
Then the Blessed One spoke these stanzas in reply to the brahmin Brahmayu
What must be known is directly known What must be developed has been developed
Then the brahmin Brahmayu thought Permission has been granted me by the recluse Gotama
Which should I ask him about good in this life or good in the lives to come
Then he thought I am skilled in the good of this life
Why shouldnt I ask him only about good in the lives to come
Then he addressed the Blessed One in stanzas
How has one the triple knowledge And how does one become a holy scholar
How does one become an arahant And how does one attain completeness
How is one a silent sage And how can one be called a Buddha
Then the Blessed One spoke these stanzas in reply
When this was said the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat and after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder he prostrated himself with his head at the Blessed Ones feet and he covered the Blessed Ones feet with kisses and caressed them with his hands pronouncing his name I am the brahmin Brahmayu Master Gotama I am the brahmin Brahmayu Master Gotama
Those in the assembly wondered and marvelled and they said It is wonderful sirs it is marvellous
Then the Blessed One said to the brahmin Brahmayu Enough brahmin arise sit down in your own seat since your mind has confidence in me
The brahmin Brahmayu then rose and sat down in his own seat
The Blessed One then gave him progressive instruction that is talk on giving talk on virtue talk on the heavens he explained the danger degradation and defilement in sensual pleasures and the blessing of renunciation
When he knew that the brahmin Brahmayus mind was ready receptive free from hindrances elated and confident he expounded to him the teaching special to the Buddhas suffering its origin its cessation and the path
Just as a clean cloth with all marks removed would take dye evenly so too while the brahmin Brahmayu sat there the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in him All that is subject to arising is subject to cessation
Then the brahmin Brahmayu saw the Dhamma attained the Dhamma understood the Dhamma fathomed the Dhamma he crossed beyond doubt did away with perplexity gained intrepidity and became independent of others in the Teachers Dispensation  Then he said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama
Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
Let the Blessed One together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from me
The Blessed One consented in silence
Then knowing that the Blessed One had consented the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he departed
Then when the night had ended the brahmin Brahmayu had good food of various kinds prepared in his residence and he had the time announced to the Blessed One It is time Master Gotama the meal is ready
Then it being morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the brahmin Brahmayus residence and sat down on the seat made ready
Then for a week with his own hands the brahmin Brahmayu served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with various kinds of good food
At the end of that week the Blessed One set out to wander in the country of the Videhans
Soon after he had gone the brahmin Brahmayu died
Then a number of bhikkhus went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one side
What is his destination What is his future course
Bhikkhus the brahmin Brahmayu was wise he entered into the way of the Dhamma and he did not trouble me in the interpretation of the Dhamma
With the destruction of the five lower fetters he has reappeared spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and will there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
The brahmin Brahmayu heard The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus with five hundred bhikkhus
Now it is good to see such arahants
If he lives the home life he becomes a Wheelturning Monarch a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma master of the four quarters allvictorious who has stabilised his country and possesses the seven treasures
His children who exceed a thousand are brave and heroic and crush the armies of others
over this earth bounded by the ocean he rules without a rod without a weapon by means of the Dhamma
But I my dear Uttara am the giver of the hymns you are the receiver of them
and looked for the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Blessed Ones body
he was doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks and he could not decide and make up his mind about them about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue
he is doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks and he cannot decide and make up his mind about them about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue
Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue and he repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils and he covered the whole of his forehead with his tongue
He has projecting heels
He has long fingers and toes
His hands and feet are soft and tender
He has netted hands and feet
His feet are arched
When he stands without stooping the palms of both his hands touch and rub against his knees
His male organ is enclosed in a sheath
He is the colour of gold his skin has a golden sheen
He is fineskinned
and because of the fineness of his skin dust and dirt do not stick on his body
His bodyhairs grow singly each bodyhair growing alone in a hair socket
He has the straight limbs of a Brahma
He has seven convexities
He has the torso of a lion
The furrow between his shoulders is filled in
He has the spread of a banyan tree the span of his arms equals the height of his body and the height of his body equals the span of his arms
He has forty teeth
His teeth are even
His teeth are quite white
He has a large tongue
He has a divine voice like the call of the Karavika bird
His eyes are deep blue
He has the eyelashes of an ox
He has hair growing in the space between his eyebrows which is white with the sheen of soft cotton
His head is shaped like a turban  this is a mark of a Great Man in Master Gotama
Master Gotama is endowed with these thirtytwo marks of a Great Man
He receives neither too little nor too much water for the bowl
When he has done so he rises from his seat and departs
Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
perhaps we might have some conversation with him
Now it is good to see such arahants
he stood at one side
and they at once made way for him as for one who was well known and famous
let each sit down in his own seat
and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down
at one side and looked for the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Blessed Ones body
he was doubtful about two of the marks and he could not decide and make up his mind about them about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue
The twoandthirty marks I learned That are the signs of a Great Man 
I still do not see two of these Upon your body Gotama
For welfare in this very life And happiness in lives to come
he is doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks and he cannot decide and make up his mind about them about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue
The twoandthirty marks you learned That are the signs of a Great Man 
All on my body can be found So brahmin doubt no more on that
Homage to the Fully Enlightened Ones who see the ultimate meaning 
There are two causes two conditions for the arising of a hearers right view  they are anothers utterance sequential upon truth and reasoned attention in oneself 
Herein what is anothers utterance
It is any teaching advice instruction talk about truth in conformity with truth from another
The Truths are four  they are Suffering Origin Cessation and the Path
Any teaching showing divulging analysing exhibiting displaying these four Truths is called anothers utterance in conformity with truth
Herein what is reasoned attention in oneself
What is called reasoned attention in oneself is any reasoned attention given to the True Idea as taught without adducing  any external object  this is called reasoned attention
That mood when reasoned is a door way a directive a means 
Just as a man is capable of arriving at kindling when on dry ground he rubs a dry  sapless log with a dry upper firestick
Because of his arriving at fire with reasoning
occurring spontaneously as the three similes in the MahaSaccaka Sutta occurred to the Bodhisatta not having been previously heard previously unheard by him
Herein anothers utterance and reasoned attention in oneself these are the two conditions
Understanding that arises owing to anothers utterance is called understanding consisting in what is heard 
And the two conditions mentioned first
Herein that one who does not cognize the meaning of anothers utterance when taught sequential upon truth will be one who experiences the meaning  no such instance is found
And that one who does not experience the meaning will give reasoned attention no such instance is found
But that one who cognizes the meaning of anothers utterance when taught sequential upon truth will be one who experiences the meaning  such an instance is found
And that one who experiences the meaning will give reasoned attention  such an instance is found
This is the cause this is the object this is the means for the hearers outlet there is no other
If this hearing is not conjoined with cognizing the Threads meaning  then by following only the sound of the utterance without cognizing the meaning of anothers utterance no one can arrive at any morethanhuman idea worthy of a Noble Ones knowing and seeing Therefore meanings must be sought by one desirous of attaining extinction of lust hate and delusion

These are the eighteen RootTerms
The nine terms MindfulnessFoundations And Quiet and Insight and the Roots Of Profit 
With nine RootTerms for each of these Both sides thus total eighteen terms
And accordingly the fruit of the Origin is Suffering while the fruit of the Way Leading to Cessation of Suffering is Cessation
These are the four noble Truths which were taught by the Blessed One at Benares
Herein while the letters the terms the phrases the moods the language and the demonstrations of the Noble Truth of Suffering are of ungauged measure  they are taught nevertheless by an explaining displaying divulging analysing exhibiting and describing of that very meaning And so of all the Truths
Accordingly each one of the Truths must be searched as to its letters terms phrases moods language and demonstrations of ungauged measure  the phrasing for variety of meaning and also the meaning for variety of phrasing
For 
Such are the Truths
And whatever Thread Song ProseExposition Verse Exclamation Saying BirthStory MarvellousIdea or QuestionandAnswer was uttered by the Blessed One between the night of his finding full enlightenment and the night of his attaining complete extinction is all the Wheel of the True Idea set rolling by him 
Nor is there anything whatever of the teaching of the Enlightened Ones the Blessed Ones that is outside the Wheel of the True Idea The whole of that Thread must be sought among the Noble Ideas
Herein in the discerning of the four Truths there is the pentad  ending with light These four Noble Truths in detail  are as follows

Herein the Threads are as follows
As verse example  Right from the first day a man Has been conceived inside a womb
and as prose example the Thread in the Ekuttarika namely  This is birth
Herein what is ageing
 Dh
and the Five Forewarning Signs of death among the gods  This is ageing
Herein what is sickness
And therefore whence o King thyself Dost even thou feel  This is ageing
o Warrior Noble tis fruit of action Because this world escapes not action  
and  This is sickness
Herein what is death
Just as the pots of clay the potter makes
Though they be small or big or baked or raw
All end in breakage  such is mortals life 
 See how they are stricken in the thing they love like fishes in the puddles of a failing stream
Seeing this let him wander without craving aught And countenance no longing for existences 
and the Udakappana Sutta  This is death
Herein what is sorrow
He sorrows and he mourns to see What he with his own acts defiled 
and the three kinds of misconduct  This is sorrow
Herein what is lamentation
 Those who in sensual desires have many a want Are roger rash and mean dwell in unrighreousness
With sufferings intrusion on them they lament   Whatever will become of us after we die 
and the three failures  This is lamentation
Herein what is pain
 
 
and the Thread in the SaccaSamyutta among the Samyuttas namely   This is pain
Herein what is grief
 At the mercy of his thoughts He meditates as does a miser 
When he hears how others blame him Such a man will be abashed   and
  This is grief
Herein what is despair
 
 
and the three fires  This is despair
Herein what is association with the loathed
 As the ruststain that grows out of the iron Devours the iron wherefrom it takes its growth
So are led habitual transgressors By their own acts to a bad destination  
and the Thread in the Twos of the Ekuttarika  This is association with the loathed
Herein what is dissociation from the loved
 Just as a man on waking sees no more Someone that he had met during a dream
So too no more the person loved he sees Who passes onward when his time is up  
and 
This is dissociation from the loved
Not to get ones wish and Maras three daughters 
 Desireborne and wilful
if his desires elude him He becomes as deformed as if pierced by a barb 
In short the five categories for assuming are suffering
 
 
and  This is suffering
b Characteristics Shared  What is ageinganddeath
 Short is this life indeed one dies Within a century of years 
Or even if life flows untroubled Still of old age one dies at last 
and the Pasenadi Samyutta Thread in the Samyutta  This is ageinganddeath
Herein what is deceaseandreappearance
 All creatures will most surely die Because the end of life is death

A The Noble Truth of Suffering can be demonstrated as shared and as unshared  knowing suffering as to its specific characteristics doing so by means of these Threads and by means of others contained in the ninefold Thread  that are similar to each  respectively
Verse should be assessed by verses proseexposition should be assessed by proseexpositions  This is Suffering 
B Herein what is the Origin of Suffering 
Clung to desires clung with sensual clinging Seeing nothing blameworthy in fetters 
Assuredly those clung with fetterclinging  Will never cross the vast abounding flood  
and a Thread dealing with the four taints  This is the Origin of Suffering

that  is C Extinction
Herein what is the Extinction Element Without Trace Left 
  Of one who has gone out there is no equal   That whereby one might word him there is not 
With all ideas obliteratedness Obliterated too are ways of wording  
and the Godhika Samyutta in the Samyutta
These are the unshared Threads 
Wherever the Truths are demonstrated there the meaning can by finding the way of entry  from the Truthcharacteristic be sought from the phrases of ungauged measure
doing so by means of phrasing that has parallel occurrence with the meaning and again by means of meaning that has parallel occurrence with the phrasing there while the phrasings of each Truth are of ungauged measure the four Noble Truths can nevertheless be demonstrated by Threads according as they are presented 
Verse should be assessed by verses included in the Five Collections  and proseexposition by proseexpositions 
These are the Unshared Threads
Here is a mnemonic verse for them 
These are the ten mnemonic verses for them
ii Miscellaneous TruthsShared   Herein there are also these shared Threads in which Threads Truths shared forwards and backwards and in mixed fashion are taught

These are two Truths
And 
The abandoning  is D the Path
and the ideas pertaining to self that are to be abandoned namely  form  down to  consciousness are A Suffering  This is Suffering and the Path
ABC Herein what is Suffering and Origin and Oessation
 Whatever sorrows lamentations pain Of many kinds are found here in the world 
That they exist is owed to something dear  With naught held dear they never come to be 
The  sorrows lamentations and pain of many kinds  owed to love are A Suffering
The love is B Origin
The outguiding of will and lust therefore and their nullification is C Cessation
These are three Truths
And  has recourse  to the two extremes namely that pleasure and pain are or 
what this inquiry is about is A Suffering
And the reply namely  this is A Suffering too and it is B Origin 
for the  consciousness nameandform six bases contact feeling being birth and ageinganddeath there are A Suffering
while the  ignorance determinations craving and assuming  there are B Origin 
so this is the  made by oneself that is being inquired about and so what in Dependent Arising is not  A Suffering is demonstrated as B Origin
 is C Cessation
These are the three Truths of Suffering Origin and Cessation
ABD Herein what is Suffering and Origin and Path
 How could a man to sensedesires stoop Who has seen pain and tliat wherefrom it sources
Who knows they make for needing in the world Should mindful train in guiding them away 
Who has seen pain this is A Suffering
That wherefrom it comes to be is B Origin

In so far as he is not a  pickerout of grubs   this is B Origin
The state of a  perceiver of form  the  picking out of grubs  the covering up of wounds the knowledge of the road  and the skill in pastures  these are D the Path
The remaining ideas are presencecauses presencecondition presencesupports since the state of a milker who leaves some for the calf and the extra offerings are ideas that are conditions for goodfriendship while the knowledge of the road as the eightfactored path is the cause for attaining extinction This is three Truths
ADC Herein what is Suffering and Path  and Cessation
Mindfulnessturnedtothebody being established A bhikkhu when restrained in the six bases For contact
and when always concentrated Can come to know extinction in himself 
Herein there is the mindfulness occupied with the body and the sixfold base wherein  All are A Suffering
The mindfulnessoccupiedwiththebody and the restraintconsistingin virtue and the concentration there whereon the mindfulness is established 
these are the understanding category  and that and the virtue category and the concentration category are D the Path
The extinction knowable by one who abides
thus is C Cessation This is three Truths
And 
Herein the ideas conascent with cognizance are A Suffering
The quiet and the insight are D the Path

 Whose being is rooted in unknowing  with what precedes it is B Origin
 To all that with its root I put an end  is C Cessation
This is two Truths
And It is through not diseovering not penetrating four ideas can be quoted in detail
with respect to the Noble Ones virtue concentration understanding and deliverance
Herein the nondiscovery nonpenetration of these four ideas is B Origin
The penetration of the guidetobeing is C Cessation
BD Herein what is Origin and Path
 Whatever streams are in the world
They are shut off by mindfulness 
Whatever streams  is B Origin
The understanding and the mindfulness as shutting off and sealing are D the Path
This is two Truths
And The Sancetaniya Sutta  Dalhanemi the wheel right demonstrated by the six months for making one pair of chariot wheels in 
Herein the bodily action with crookedness with flaws with faults the having crookedness having flaws having faults  are B Origin
and likewise with the verbal action and mental action  Then there is the uncrooked flawless faultless  the uncrookedness the flawlessness the faultlessness are D the Path
These are the two Truths of Origin and Path
BCD Herein what is Origin and Cessation and Path
 The supported is liable to dislodgement The unsupported is not liable to dislodgement When there is no liability to dislodgement there is tranquillity When there is tranquillity there is no bentfornaming When there is no bentfornaming there is nocomingandgoing When there is no comingandgoing there is no deceaseandreappearance When there is no deceaseandreappearance there is no here or beyond or inbetween
This is the end of suffering 
Herein the two kinds of  support  namely craving and ignorance are B Origin
The nosupport and nobentfornaming  are D the Path
The nocomingandgoing nodeceaseand reappearance and  this is the end of suffering  are C Cessation
These are three Truths
And is lacking  this is B Origin namely 
The eleven general supports for the deliverances with lack of stipulate
These are the three Truths
CD Herein what is Cessation and Path
 By the truth of his own making Gone of himself by that to extinction crossed beyond doubt
Knowing nonbeing in the world meanwhile With renewal of being exhausted such is a bhikkhu 
By the truth is D the Path
With renewal of being exhausted is C Cessation
These are two Truths
And  can be quoted in detail
  this D is the Path
The is C Cessation
So the rest of the five Bases for Deliverance in detail
These are the two Truths of Cessation and Path
These are the shared Threads
After finding the way of entry as to the penetration of them and as to the characteristic of each by means of these shared Threads according as they are presented in the Threads cited other Threads can be demonstrated provided one does not misapply them
Verse should be assessed by verses proseexposition by prose expositions 
And these shared Threads given above namely the  dyads and  triads  are ten of the possible twelve augmentations
This is the miscellaneous demonstration
make up the twelve Truthaugmentations
Up to this point however there has been actually no allinclusive Thread quoted
By one who is diligent that either proseexposition or  verse can after searching be demonstrated  without using the way of entry by these twelve augmentations
Here is a brief demonstration
A All Suffering meets together under seven terms
All Suffering can be demonstrated by the following terms  association with the loathed and dissociation from the loved 
It is also comprised by painfulness as pain painfulness in determinations and painfulness in change 
so this suffering is all comprised also by these three terms
B Herein all Origin is threefold without fourth without fifth
How threefold
Craving view and action
Herein while craving is the origin of being it is action
So any inferiority and superiority in the various kinds of being existence and destinations is  comprised by the three kinds of painfulness  and also the body with its consciousness belonging to one shut in by ignorance and fettered by craving for being  which body having been procured owing to the two roots craving and ignorance is comprised by the three painfulnesses too
Likewise view can be arrived at from perversion
That can be demonstrated as sevenfold 
Herein what is the single perverting
It is distorted apprehension way of entry by rejection of the fact such that it apprehends distortedly that there is permanence in the impermanent
While this perverting is one what is perverted is perception cognizance and view
What are the four objects of perversion
They are the body feeling cognizance and ideas
When someone goes by the perversions thus his unprofitable cognizance increases
Herein the perversion of perception increases the unprofitable root hate
Herein the fruit of the unprofitable root hate is the three wrongnesses namely wrong speech wrong action and wrong livelihood  the fruit of the unprofitable root greed is the three wrongnesses namely wrong intention wrong effort and wrong concentration  the fruit of the unprofitable root delusion is the two wrongnesses namely wrong view and wrong mindfulness
Thus this unprofitable cognizance has cause and has condition  the perversions are the condition and the unprofitable roots are the cause  And these same perversion and root in their opposite neither less nor more can be demonstrated as the two conditions 
in the case of C Cessation and in the case of D the Path but the conditions are four  as well by assuming perversion in the opposite
Here is a mnemonic verse 
By ignorance is the world shut in And fetters in the Citta Thread 
who have reached perfection in the qualities beginning with virtue
Why is that
so too when he gives attention  to this teaching of the undistorted True Idea of Suffering Origin Cessation and Path this is called reasoned attention
Now the first two of the three similes beginning Whoever is not without lust for sensual desires  must be treated as applying to unreasoned attention but in the last  it is well  stated for application to reasoned attention
understanding that arises owing to reasoned attention in oneself is called understanding consisting in cogitation 
these are the two kinds of understanding recognizable
these are the two causes two conditions for the arising of a hearers right view 
Sixteen Conveyings as a guide Five GuideLines for the Dispensations Search

Lions Play is the name they give To the third GuideLine
and they named The fourth of GuideLine formulas The Plotting of Directions
then The Hook is what they call the fifth  That is how all five GuideLines go
Here is a mnemonic verse 
The nine terms Craving Ignorance And Greed Hate and Delusion too
And with as well Perversions four Do constitute defilements plane
all this profit here Does constitute the faculties plane
All profit by nine terms construed And all unprofit too by nine 
Of these eighteen RootTerms the nine unprofitable terms are the Origin of Suffering while the profitable terms are the Way Leading to Cessation of Suffering
He cannot but go ever on Nor going can he once turn back 
they meditate As do old lapwings  that have quite used up The stock offishes living in their 
He sorrows here sorrows hereafter In both wise sorrows the evildoer 
With anger quenched extinguished in himself
 Ideas that draw their being from a cause Their cause a Perfect One has told
And their cessation too Such is tlie Great Monks doctrine 
D the Path  and that statement is also C Cessation And  Whoever they are that abide contemplating gratification in ideas provocative of fetters
any contemplation of in ideas provocative of fetters is D the Path
These are the four Truths
Right from the first day a man Eight reappearances by taking 
The five kinds of forewarning signs The fishes in their pond used up 
And therefore whence o King thyself There are three kinds of ailing gods
Just as the pots of clay the potter Just as the Nadikappana  Sutta 
He sorrows here sorrows hereafter And there are three kinds of misconduct 
Those who want many sensedesires And the three kinds of failure too
Stakes of steel even a hundred  And then the fever vast to cross 
And at the mercy of his thoughts And likewise those that cause regret 
Just as the goldsmiths furnace burns And the three fires that are displayed  
The ruststain that grows out of iron Misrepresenting Perfect Ones 
Gods are instructed in three ways And like a meeting in a dream
And maras daughters three as well Pierced by a barb he is deformed 
The eye the ear the nose besides Five categories are displayed 
Short is this life indeed one dies My lady Mallika  has died 
All creatures will  most surely die Which is deceaseandreappearance 
They muchly cling to sensedesires And then with the four taints as well 
In whom deceit dwells not at all And two sorts of deliverance 
This is the only path no other Enlightenment factors well taught 
Ideas whose being has a cause And those who fetters contemplate  
Of one gone out there is no equal Godhika has attained extinction 
Tis undisplayed through miswishing and neglect
And hankering smears it I say Suffering is its greatest fear 
These are the two Truths of Suffering and Origin
and the deliverance is C Cessation
The cognizance here is A Suffering
Fight Mara with the sword of understanding  While holding what is won be unattached 
The streams restraint I tell whereby They can be sealed is understanding 
of Origin Cessation and Path
and any deliverance is C Cessation
And then the provision of the stipulate namely then this stipulate is D the Path
Then there are also the one shared tetraddemonstration  and the one standing for an allinclusive demonstration  as one part representing any of the five mentioned above namely the  triads and  tetrad with the six dyads too
These two augmentations  and the previous ten
What seven
for that the two supports are the body and cognizance
hence it is called  and there is no suffering that is neither bodily nor mental  so all suffering can be demonstrated by the two terms bodily and mental
Accordingly this threefold suffering
and the twofold suffering as bodily and mental
and the twofold suffering as associationwiththeloathed and dissociationfromtheloved
make up the sevenfold suffering
that is the origin of the inferiority or superiority of one thus generated
the single perverting is demonstrated as occurring through the three Things perverted and having four objects of perversion 
and so with the rest of the four perversions
the perversion of cognizance increases the unprofitable root greed
and the perversion of view increases the unprofitable root delusion
His craving for being has been severed There are these two deliverances
The body as a fragile pot What is not yours should be abandoned
Whatever sorrows lamentations Timbaruka  and ones own making
Sight of suffering arisen Then the CowHerd Simile
With bodymindfulness he said And quiet and insight then as well
Hankering longing expectantrelish With nondiscovery of four
Whatever streams are in the world And Dalhanemi the wheelwright
Dislodgeable is one supported And when there is no nonremorse  
By the truth of his own making And bases for deliverance 
In the PitakaDisclosure pronounced by MahaKaccayana this is the first chapter called The Display of the Noble Truths
What must be abandoned has been abandoned Therefore brahmin I am a Buddha
For welfare in this very life And happiness in lives to come
Since leave is given you please ask Whatever you aspire to know
and others too ask me about good in this life
How does one become a brahmin And how does one attain to knowledge
Who knows about his former lives Sees heaven and states of deprivation
And has arrived at births destruction  A sage who knows by direct knowledge
Who knows his mind is purified Entirely freed from every lust
Who has abandoned birth and death Who is complete in the holy life
Who has transcended everything  One such as this is called a Buddha
what great power and great might the recluse Gotama has for the wellknown and famous brahmin Brahmayu to make such a display of humility
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
and said Venerable sir the brahmin Brahmayu has died
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Ujunna in the Kannakatthala Deer Park
Now on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Ujunna for some business or other
Then he told a man Come good man go to the Blessed One and pay homage in my name with your head at his feet and ask whether he is free from illness and affliction and is healthy strong and abiding in comfort saying Venerable sir King Pasenadi of Kosala pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feet and he asks whether the Blessed One is free from illnessand abiding in comfort
And say this Venerable sir today King Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see the Blessed One after he has had his breakfast
Yes sire the man replied and he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side
Then while the meal was being served the two sisters went to the king and said Sire pay homage in our name with your head at the Blessed Ones feet and ask whether he is free from illnessand abiding in comfort saying Venerable sir the sisters Soma and Sakula pay homage with their heads at the Blessed Ones feet and they ask whether he is free from illnessand abiding in comfort
Then when he had finished his breakfast King Pasenadi of Kosala went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side
and delivered the message of the sisters Soma and Sakula
Venerable sir the sisters Soma and Sakula heard Today King Pasenadi of Kosala will go to see the Blessed One after he has had his breakfast
Then while the meal was being servedthe sisters Soma and Sakula came to me and said Sire pay homage in our names with your head at the Blessed Ones feet and ask whether he is free from illnessand abiding in comfort
May the sisters Soma and Sakula be happy great king
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One Venerable sir I have heard this The recluse Gotama says There is no recluse or brahmin who is omniscient and allseeing who can claim to have complete knowledge and vision that is not possible
Venerable sir do those who speak thus say what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing that provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from their assertions
Great King those who speak thus do not say what has been said by me but misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to fact
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed General Vidudabha General who introduced this story into the palace
It was Sanjaya sire the brahmin of the Akasa clan
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala told a man Come good man in my name tell Sanjaya the brahmin of the Akasa clan Venerable sir King Pasenadi of Kosala calls you
Yes sire the man replied He went to Sanjaya the brahmin of the Akasa clan and told him Venerable sir King Pasenadi of Kosala calls you
Meanwhile King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One Venerable sir could something else have been said by the Blessed One referring to that and the person understood it wrongly
In what way does the Blessed One recall making that utterance
I recall having actually made the utterance in this way great king There is no recluse or brahmin who knows all who sees all simultaneously that is not possible
What the Blessed One has said appears reasonable what the Blessed One has said appears to be supported by reason There is no recluse or brahmin who knows all who sees all simultaneously that is not possible
There are these four castes venerable sir the nobles the brahmins the merchants and the workers
Is there any distinction or difference among them
There are these four castes great king the nobles the brahmins the merchants and the workers
Two of them that is the nobles and the brahmins are held to be superior since men pay homage to them rise up for them and accord them reverential salutation and polite services
Venerable sir I was not asking about this present life I was asking about the life to come
Is there any distinction or difference among them
Great king there are these five factors of striving
Here a bhikkhu has faith he places his faith in the Tathagatas enlightenment thus The Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed Then he is free from illness and affliction possessing a good digestion that is neither too cool nor too warm but medium and able to bear the strain of striving Then he is honest and sincere and shows himself as he actually is to his teacher and his companions in the holy life Then he is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in undertaking wholesome states steadfast launching his effort with firmness and persevering in cultivating wholesome states Then he is wise he possesses wisdom regarding rise and disappearance that is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering These are the five factors of striving
There are these four castes great king the nobles the brahmins the merchants and the workers
Now if they possessed these five factors of striving it would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time
Venerable sir there are these four castes the nobles the brahmins the merchants and the workers
Now if they possessed these five factors of striving would there be any difference among them here in that respect
Here great king I say that the difference among them would lie in the diversity of their striving
Suppose there were two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined and two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable oxen that were untamed and undisciplined
What do you think great king Would the two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined being tamed acquire the behaviour of the tamed would they arrive at the grade of the tamed
Yes venerable sir
And would the two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable oxen that were untamed and undisciplined being untamed acquire the behaviour of the tamed would they arrive at the grade of the tamed like the two elephants or horses or oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined
No venerable sir
So too great king it is not possible that what can be achieved by one who has faith who is free from illness who is honest and sincere who is energetic and who is wise can be achieved by one who has no faith who has much illness who is fraudulent and deceitful who is lazy and who is not wise
What the Blessed One has said appears reasonable what the Blessed One has said appears to be supported by reason
There are these four castes venerable sir the nobles the brahmins the merchants and the workers
Now if they possessed these five factors of striving and if their striving was right would there be any difference among them in that respect
Here great king in this respect I say that among them there is no difference that is between the deliverance of one and the deliverance of the others
Suppose a man took dry saka wood lit a fire and produced heat and then another man took dry sala wood lit a fire and produced heat and then another man took dry mango wood lit a fire and produced heat and then another man took dry fig wood lit a fire and produced heat
What do you think great king Would there be any difference among these fires lit with different kinds of wood that is between the flame of one and the flames of the others or between the colour of one and the colours of the others or between the radiance of one and the radiances of the others
No venerable sir
So too great king when a fire is kindled by energy lit by striving there is I say no difference that is between the deliverance of one and the deliverance of the others
What the Blessed One has said appears reasonable what the Blessed One has said appears to be supported by reason
But venerable sir how is it are there gods
Why do you ask that great king
Venerable sir I was asking whether those gods come back to this human state or whether they do not
Great king those gods who are still subject to affliction come back to this human state those gods who are no longer subject to affliction do not come back to this human state
When this was said General Vidudabha asked the Blessed One Venerable sir can those gods who are still subject to affliction and who come back to this human state topple or banish from that place those gods who are no longer subject to affliction and who do not come back to this human state
Then the venerable Ananda thought This General Vidudabha is the son of King Pasenadi of Kosala and I am the son of the Blessed One
This is the time for one son to talk with the other
He said to General Vidudabha General I shall ask you a question in return Answer it as you choose
General what do you think There is the whole extent of King Pasenadi of Kosalas realm where he exercises lordship and sovereignty now can King Pasenadi of Kosala topple or banish from that place any recluse or brahmin irrespective of whether that recluse or brahmin has merit or not and whether he leads the holy life or not
He can do so sir
What do you think general There is the whole extent that is not King Pasenadi of Kosalas realm where he does not exercise lordship and sovereignty now can King Pasenadi of Kosala topple or banish from that place any recluse or brahmin irrespective of whether that recluse or brahmin has merit or not and whether he leads the holy life or not
He cannot do so sir
General what do you think Have you heard of the gods of the Thirtythree
Yes sir
And King Pasenadi of Kosala has heard of them too
General what do you think Can King Pasenadi of Kosala topple the gods of the Thirtythree or banish them from that place
Sir King Pasenadi of Kosala cannot even see the gods of the Thirtythree so how could he topple them or banish them from that place
So too general those gods who are still subject to affliction and who come back to this human state cannot even see those gods who are no longer subject to affliction and who do not come back to this human state so how could they topple them or banish them from that place
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala asked the Blessed One Venerable sir what is this bhikkhus name
His name is Ananda great king
Ananda joy he is indeed venerable sir and Ananda he appears
What the venerable Ananda has said appears reasonable what he has said appears to be supported by reason
But venerable sir how is it are there Brahmas
Why do you ask that great king
Venerable sir I was asking whether those Brahmas come back to this human state or whether they do not
Great king any Brahma who is still subject to affliction comes back to this human state any Brahma who is no longer subject to affliction does not come back to this human state
Then a man announced to King Pasenadi of Kosala Great king Sanjaya the brahmin of the Akasa clan has come
King Pasenadi of Kosala asked Sanjaya the brahmin of the Akasa clan Brahmin who introduced this story to the palace
Sire it was General Vidudabha
General Vidudabha said Sire it was Sanjaya the brahmin of the Akasa clan
Then a man announced to King Pasenadi of Kosala Sire it is time to depart
King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One Venerable sir we have asked the Blessed One about omniscience and the Blessed One has answered about omniscience we approve of and accept that answer and so we are satisfied
We have asked the Blessed One about purification in the four castes and the Blessed One has answered about purification in the four castes we approve of and accept that answer and so we are satisfied
We have asked the Blessed One about the gods and the Blessed One has answered about the gods we approve of and accept that answer and so we are satisfied
We have asked the Blessed One about the Brahmas and the Blessed One has answered about the Brahmas we approve of and accept that answer and so we are satisfied
Whatever we asked the Blessed One that the Blessed One has answered we approve of and accept those answers and so we are satisfied
And now venerable sir we depart We are busy and have much to do
Now is the time great king to do as you think fit
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he departed
and delivered his message
The sisters Soma and Sakula heard Today King Pasenadi of Kosala will go to see the Blessed One after he has had his breakfast
But great king could the sisters Soma and Sakula find no other messenger
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghositas Park
Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one side
Ananda women are prone to anger women are envious women are miserly women are unwise This is why women do not sit in council engage in business or go to Kamboja
and said
Bhante why is it that women do not sit in council or engage in business or go to Kamboja
They do not sit in council in the judgment hall for the purpose of passing judgment
They do not engage in business  in major work such as agriculture trade and so forth
They do not go to Kamboja  they do not go to the Kamboja country for the purpose of carrying goods
This is the mere heading The sense is that they do not go to any remote country
There are these four castes venerable sir the nobles the brahmins the merchants and the workers
What five
I have heard of them
and delivered his message
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at a town of the Sakyans named Medalumpa
Now on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Nagaraka for some business or other
Then he addressed Digha Karayana Dear Karayana have the state carriages prepared Let us go to the pleasure garden to see a pleasing spot
Yes sire Digha Karayana replied When the state carriages were prepared he informed the king Sire the state carriages are ready for you
Now is the time to do as you think fit
Then King Pasenadi mounted a state carriage and accompanied by the other carriages he drove out from Nagaraka with the full pomp of royalty
He went thus as far as the road was passable for carriages and then dismounted from his carriage and entered the park on foot
As he walked and wandered in the park for exercise King Pasenadi saw roots of trees that were lovely and inspiring quiet and undisturbed by voices with an atmosphere of seclusion remote from people favourable for retreat
The sight of these reminded him of the Blessed One thus These roots of trees are lovely and inspiring quiet and undisturbed by voices with an atmosphere of seclusion remote from people favourable for retreat like the places where we used to pay respect to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
Then he told Digha Karayana what he had thought and asked
There is sire a town of the Sakyans named Medalumpa
How far is it from Nagaraka to Medalumpa
It is not far sire three leagues There is still daylight enough to go there
Then dear Karayana have the state carriages prepared Let us go and see the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
Yes sire he replied When the state carriages were prepared he informed the king Sire the state carriages are ready for you
Now is the time to do as you think fit
Then King Pasenadi mounted a state carriage and accompanied by the other carriages set out from Nagaraka towards the Sakyan town of Medalumpa
He arrived there while it was still daylight
He went thus as far as the road was passable for carriages and then he dismounted from his carriage and entered the park on foot
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were walking up and down in the open
Then King Pasenadi went to them and asked Venerable sirs where is he living now the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
We want to see the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
That is his dwelling great king with the closed door
Go up to it quietly without hurrying enter the porch clear your throat and tap on the panel
The Blessed One will open the door for you
King Pasenadi handed over his sword and turban to Digha Karayana then and there
Then Digha Karayana thought So the king is going into secret session now And I have to wait here alone now
Without hurrying King Pasenadi went quietly up to the dwelling with the closed door entered the porch cleared his throat and tapped on the panel
The Blessed One opened the door
Then King Pasenadi entered the dwelling Prostrating himself with his head at the Blessed Ones feet he covered the Blessed Ones feet with kisses and caressed them with his hands pronouncing his name I am King Pasenadi of Kosala venerable sir I am King Pasenadi of Kosala venerable sir
But great king what reason do you see for doing such supreme honour to this body and for showing such friendship
Venerable sir I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good way
Now venerable sir I see some recluses and brahmins leading a limited holy life for ten years twenty years thirty years or forty years
But here I see bhikkhus leading the perfect and pure holy life as long as life and breath last
Indeed I do not see any other holy life elsewhere as perfect and pure as this
This is why venerable sir I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good way
Again venerable sir kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brahmins with brahmins householders with householders mother quarrels with child child with mother father with child child with father brother quarrels with brother brother with sister sister with brother friend with friend
I do not see any other assembly elsewhere with such concord
This too venerable sir is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good way
Again venerable sir I have walked and wandered from park to park and from garden to garden
There I have seen some recluses and brahmins who are lean wretched unsightly jaundiced with veins standing out on their limbs such that people would not want to look at them again
I have thought Surely these venerable ones are leading the holy life in discontent or they have done some evil deed and are concealing it so lean and wretched are theysuch that people would not want to look at them again
I went up to them and asked Why are you venerable ones so lean and wretchedsuch that people would not want to look at you again
Their reply was It is our family sickness great king
But here I see bhikkhus smiling and cheerful sincerely joyful plainly delighting their faculties fresh living at ease unruffled subsisting on what others give abiding with mind as aloof as a wild deers
I have thought Surely these venerable ones perceive successive states of lofty distinction in the Blessed Ones Dispensation since they abide thus smiling and cheerfulwith mind as aloof as a wild deers
This too venerable sir is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good way
Again venerable sir being a headanointed noble king I am able to have executed those who should be executed to fine those who should be fined to exile those who should be exiled
Yet when I am sitting in council they break in and interrupt me
Though I say Gentlemen do not break in and interrupt me when I am sitting in council wait till the end of my speech
But here I see bhikkhus while the Blessed One is teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers and then there is not even the sound of a disciple of the Blessed One coughing or clearing his throat
Once the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers
Thereupon one of his companions in the holy life nudged him with his knee to indicate Be quiet venerable sir make no noise the Blessed One the Teacher is teaching us the Dhamma
I thought It is wonderful it is marvellous
Indeed I do not see any other assembly elsewhere so well disciplined
This too venerable sir is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good way
Again venerable sir I have seen here certain learned nobles who were clever knowledgeable about the doctrines of others as sharp as hairsplitting marksmen
When they hear The recluse Gotama will visit such and such a village or town
If he is asked like this he will answer like this and so we will refute his doctrine in this way and if he is asked like that he will answer like that and so we will refute his doctrine in that way
They hear The recluse Gotama has come to visit such and such a village or town
They go to the Blessed One
After they have been instructed urged roused and encouraged by the Blessed One with a talk on the Dhamma they do not so much as ask him the question so how should they refute his doctrine
In actual fact they become his disciples
This too venerable sir is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good way
Again venerable sir I have seen here certain learned brahmins  Again venerable sir I have seen here certain learned householders  Again venerable sir I have seen here certain learned recluses
In actual fact they ask the Blessed One to allow them to go forth from the home life into homelessness
Not long after they have thus gone forth dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute by realising for themselves with direct knowledge they here and now enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
They say thus We were very nearly lost we very nearly perished
But now we are recluses now we are brahmins now we are arahants
This too venerable sir is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good way
Again venerable sir Isidatta and Purana my two inspectors eat my food and use my carriages I provide them with a livelihood and bring them fame Yet in spite of this they are less respectful towards me than they are towards the Blessed One
Once when I had gone out leading an army and was testing these inspectors Isidatta and Purana I happened to put up in very cramped quarters
Then these two inspectors Isidatta and Purana after spending much of the night in talk on the Dhamma lay down with their heads in the direction where they had heard that the Blessed One was staying and with their feet towards me
I thought It is wonderful it is marvellous
These two inspectors Isidatta and Purana eat my food and use my carriages I provide them with a livelihood and bring them fame Yet in spite of this they are less respectful towards me than they are towards the Blessed One
Surely these good people perceive successive states of lofty distinction in the Blessed Ones Dispensation
This too venerable sir is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One The Blessed One is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good way
Again venerable sir the Blessed One is a noble and I am a noble the Blessed One is a Kosalan and I am a Kosalan the Blessed One is eighty years old and I am eighty years old
And now venerable sir we depart We are busy and have much to do
Now is the time great king to do as you think fit
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he departed
The monuments to the Dhamma are beneficial bhikkhus and they belong to the fundamentals of the holy life
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
and proceeded towards the park
Where is he living now the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
The Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened is now living there
and proceeded towards the park
Seven red fish etcThis story was told by the Master while living at Jetavana about a gift of all the Buddhist requisites
A certain landowner at Sāvatthi they say provided all the requisites for the Brotherhood with Buddha at its head and setting up a pavilion at his house door he invited all the company of priests with their chief Buddha seated them on elegant seats prepared for them and offered them a variety of choice and dainty food And saying Come again tomorrow he entertained them for a whole week and on the seventh day he presented Buddha and the five hundred priests under him with all the requisites
At the end of the feast the Master in returning thanks said Lay Brother you are right in giving pleasure and satisfaction by this charity For this is a tradition of wise men of old who sacrificed their lives for any beggars they met with and gave them even their own flesh to eat And at the request of his host he related this oldworld legend
Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares the Bodhisatta came to life as a young hare and lived in a wood
On one side of this wood was the foot of a mountain on another side a river and on the third side a bordervillage
The hare had three friendsa monkey a jackal and an otter
These four wise creatures lived together and each of them got his food on his own huntingground and in the evening they again came together
The hare in his wisdom by way of admonition preached the Truth to his three companions teaching that alms are to be given the moral law to be observed and holy days to be kept
They accepted his admonition and went each to his own part of the jungle and dwelt there
And so in the course of time the Bodhisatta one day observing the sky and looking at the moon knew that the next day would be a fastday and addressing his three companions he said Tomorrow is a fastday Let all three of you take upon you the moral precepts and observe the holy day To one that stands fast in moral practice almsgiving brings a great reward Therefore feed any beggars that come to you by giving them food from your own table
They readily assented and abode each in his own place of dwelling
On the morrow quite early in the morning the otter sallied forth to seek his prey and went down to the bank of the Ganges
Now it came to pass that a fisherman had landed seven red fish and stringing them together on a withe he had taken and buried them in the sand on the rivers bank And then he dropped down the stream catching more fish
The otter scenting the buried fish dug up the sand till he came upon them and pulling them out cried aloud thrice Does any one own these fish  And not seeing any owner he took hold of the withe with his teeth and laid the fish in the jungle where he dwelt intending to eat them at a fitting time And then he lay down thinking how virtuous he was
The jackal too sallied forth in quest of food and found in the hut of a fieldwatcher two spits a lizard and a pot of milkcurd And after thrice crying aloud To whom do these belong  and not finding an owner he put on his neck the rope for lifting the pot and grasping the spits and the lizard with his teeth he brought and laid them in his own lair thinking In due season I will devour them and so lay down reflecting how virtuous he had been
The monkey also entered the clump of trees and gathering a bunch of mangoes laid them up in his part of the jungle meaning to eat them in due season and then lay down thinking how virtuous he was
But the Bodhisatta in due time came out intending to browse on the kua grass and as he lay in the jungle the thought occurred to him It is impossible for me to offer grass to any beggars that may chance to appear and I have no oil or rice and such like If any beggar shall appeal to me I shall have to give him my own flesh to eat
At this splendid display of virtue Sakkas white marble throne manifested signs of heat
Sakka on reflection discovered the cause and resolved to put this royal hare to the test First of all he went and stood by the otters dwellingplace disguised as a brahmin
and being asked why he stood there he replied Wise Sir if I could get something to eat after keeping the fast I would perform all my priestly duties
The otter replied Very well I will give you some food and as he conversed with him he repeated the first stanza
Seven red fish I safely brought to land from Ganges flood
O brahmin eat thy fill I pray and stay within this wood
The brahmin said Let be till tomorrow I will see to it by and bye Next he went to the jackal
and when asked by him why he stood there he made the same answer
The jackal too readily promised him some food and in talking with him repeated the second stanza
the keepers evening meal I wrongfully did steal
A lizard and a jar of curds Two spits to roast the flesh withal
Such as I have I give to thee O brahmin eat I pray If thou shouldst deign within this wood a while with us to stay
Said the brahmin Let be till tomorrow I will see to it by and bye Then he went to the monkey
and when asked what he meant by standing there he answered just as before
The monkey readily offered him some food and in conversing with him gave utterance to the third stanza
An icy stream a mango ripe and pleasant greenwood shade
Tis thine to enjoy if thou canst dwell content in forest glade
Said the brahmin Let be till tomorrow I will see to it by and bye And he went to the wise hare
and on being asked by him why he stood there he made the same reply
The Bodhisatta on hearing what he wanted was highly delighted and said Brahmin you have done well in coming to me for food This day will I grant you a boon that I have never granted before
but you shall not break the moral law by taking animal life Go friend and when you have piled together logs of wood and kindled a fire come and let me know and I will sacrifice myself by falling into the midst of the flames
and when my body is roasted you shall eat my flesh and fulfil all your priestly duties And in thus addressing him the hare uttered the fourth stanza
Nor sesame nor beans nor rice have I as food to give
But roast with fire my flesh I yield if thou with us wouldst live
Sakka on hearing what he said by his miraculous power caused a heap of burning coals to appear and came and told the Bodhisatta
Rising from his bed of kua grass and coming to the place he thrice shook himself that if there were any insects within his coat they might escape death Then offering his whole body as a free gift he sprang up and like a royal swan alighting on a cluster of lotuses in an ecstasy of joy he fell on the heap of live coals
But the flame failed even to heat the pores of the hair on the body of the Bodhisatta and it was as if he had entered a region of frost
Then he addressed Sakka in these words Brahmin the fire you have kindled is icycold it fails to beat even the pores of the hair on my body What is the meaning of this
Wise sir he replied I am no brahmin I am Sakka and I have come to put your virtue to the test
The Bodhisatta said If not only thou Sakka but all the inhabitants of the world were to try me in this matter of almsgiving they would not find in me any unwillingness to give and with this the Bodhisatta uttered a cry of exultation like a lion roaring
Then said Sakka to the Bodhisatta O wise hare he thy virtue known throughout a whole won And squeezing the mountain with the essence thus extracted he daubed the sign of a hare on the orb of the moon And after depositing the hare on a bed of young kua grass in the same wooded part of the jungle Sakka returned to his own place in heaven
And these four wise creatures dwelt happily and harmoniously together fulfilling the moral law and observing holy days till they departed to fare according to their deeds
The Master when he had ended his lesson revealed the Truths and identified the BirthAt the conclusion of the Truths the householder who gave as a freegift all the Buddhist requisites attained fruition of the First Path
At that time nanda was the otter Moggallāna was the jackal Sāriputta the monkey and I myself was the wise hare
and then on a later occasion I see them well groomed and well anointed with trimmed hair and beards enjoying themselves provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure
But here I see bhikkhus living in concord with mutual appreciation without disputing blending like milk and water viewing each other with kindly eyes
still they break in and interrupt me
and there a disciple of his cleared his throat
how an assembly can be so well disciplined without force or weapon
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one side
And in the case of a disciple who was a person of the highest kind a supreme person one who had attained the supreme attainment when that disciple has passed away and died he also declares his rebirth thus That one was reborn there that one was reborn there
This Makkhali Gosala This Nigantha Nataputta  This Sanjaya Belathiputta  This Pakudha Kaccayana This Ajita Kesakambali 
And in the case of a disciple who was a person of the highest kind a supreme person one who had attained the supreme attainment when that disciple has passed away and died he also declares his rebirth thus That one was reborn there that one was reborn there
But in the case of a disciple who was a person of the highest kind a supreme person one who had attained the supreme attainment when that disciple has passed away and died he does not declare his rebirth thus That one was reborn there that one was reborn there
Rather he declares of him He cut off craving severed the fetter and by completely breaking through conceit he has made an end to suffering
 There was perplexity in me Master Gotama there was doubt How is the Dhamma of the ascetic Gotama to be understood
It is fitting for you to be perplexed Vaccha it is fitting for you to doubt
Doubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matter
I declare Vaccha rebirth for one with fuel not for one without fuel
Just as a fire burns with fuel but not without fuel so Vaccha I declare rebirth for one with fuel not for one without fuel
Master Gotama when a flame is flung by the wind and goes some distance what does Master Gotama declare to be its fuel on that occasion
When Vaccha a flame is flung by the wind and goes some distance I declare that it is fuelled by the wind
For on that occasion the wind is its fuel
And Master Gotama when a being has laid down this body but has not yet been reborn in another body what does Master Gotama declare to be its fuel on that occasion
When Vaccha a being has laid down this body but has not yet been reborn in another body I declare that it is fuelled by craving
and said to the Blessed One
In recent days Master Gotama a number of ascetics brahmins and wanderers of various sects had assembled in the debating hall and were sitting together when this conversation arose among them This Purana Kassapathe leader of an order the leader of a group the teacher of a group the well known and famous spiritual guide considered holy by many people
declares the rebirth of a disciple who has passed away and died thus That one was reborn there that one was reborn there
when that disciple has passed away and died he also declares his rebirth thus That one was reborn there that one was reborn there
declares the rebirth of a disciple who has passed away and died thus That one was reborn there that one was reborn there
This ascetic Gotamathe leader of an order the leader of a group the teacher of a group the well known and famous spiritual guide considered holy by many people
For on that occasion craving is its fuel
they wander about as it were demolishing the views of others with their sharp wits
they formulate a question thus We will go to the recluse Gotama and ask him this question
and the Blessed One instructs urges rouses and encourages them with a talk on the Dhamma
They do not so much as ask him the question so how should they refute his doctrine
and he gives them the going forth
for formerly we claimed that we were recluses though we were not really recluses we claimed that we were brahmins though we were not really brahmins we claimed that we were arahants though we were not really arahants
On one occasion the Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Mahakofthita were dwelling at Baranasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana
Then in the evening the Venerable Mahakotthita emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable Sariputta He exchanged greetings with the Venerable Sariputta and
and said to him How is it friend Sariputta is the eye the fetter of forms or are forms the fetter of the eye
Is the ear the fetter of sounds or are sounds the fetter of the ear  Is the mind the fetter of mental phenomena or are mental phenomena the fetter of the mind
Friend Kotthita the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye
but rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both that is the fetter there The ear is not the fetter of sounds nor are sounds the fetter of the ear
but rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both that is the fetter there  The mind is not the fetter of mental phenomena nor are mental phenomena the fetter of the mind
Suppose friend a black ox and a white ox were yoked together by a single harness or yoke
Would one be speaking rightly if one were to say The black ox is the fetter of the white ox the white ox is the fetter of the black ox
No friend
The black ox is not the fetter of the white ox nor is the white ox the fetter of the black ox
So too friend the eye is not the fetter of forms
nor are mental phenomena the fetter of the mind
If friend the eye were the fetter of forms or if forms were the fetter of the eye this living of the holy life could not be discerned for the complete destruction of suffering
friend the ear were the fetter of sounds or if sounds were the fetter of the ear 
There exists in the Blessed One the eye
There exists in the Blessed One the ear
the Blessed One smells an odour with the nose
There exists in the Blessed One the body
There exists in the Blessed One the mind
In this way friend it can be understood how the eye is not the fetter of forms nor forms the fetter of the eye but rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both is the fetter there
when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one side
but rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both that is the fetter there
but rather the single harness or yoke by which the two are yoked together that is the fetter there
but rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both that is the fetter there
But since the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye but rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both is the fetter therethe living of the holy life is discerned for the complete destruction of suffering
If the mind were the fetter of mental phenomena or if mental phenomena were the fetter of the mind this living of the holy life could not be discerned for the complete destruction of suffering
But since the mind is not the fetter of mental phenomena nor are mental phenomena the fetter of the mindbut rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both is the fetter therethe living of the holy life is discerned for the complete destruction of suffering
the Blessed One sees a form with the eye
yet there is no desire and lust in the Blessed One
the Blessed One is well liberated in mind
There exists in the Blessed One the nose
There exists in the Blessed One the tongue
the Blessed One savours a taste with the tongue
the Blessed One feels a tactile object with the body
the Blessed One cognizes a mental phenomenon with the mind
yet there is no desire and lust in the Blessed One
the Blessed One is well liberated in mind
how the ear is not the fetter of sounds nor sounds the fetter of the ear
how the mind is not the fetter of mental phenomena nor mental phenomena the fetter of the mind but rather the desire and lust that arise there in dependence on both is the fetter there
In this way too friend it may be understood how that is so
the Blessed One hears a sound with the ear 
Since that is so I think it proper to do such supreme honour to the Blessed One and to show such friendship
Then soon after he had left the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus before rising from his seat and departing this King Pasenadi uttered monuments to the Dhamma
Learn the monuments to the Dhamma bhikkhus master the monuments to the Dhamma remember the monuments to the Dhamma
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Then when it was morning the venerable Ananda dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Savatthi for alms
Now on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had mounted the elephant Ekapundarika and was riding out from Savatthi at midday
He saw the venerable Ananda coming in the distance
 Yes sire that is the venerable Ananda
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala told a man Come good man go to the venerable Ananda and pay homage in my name with your head at his feet saying Venerable sir King Pasenadi of Kosala pays homage with his head at the venerable Anandas feet
Then say this Venerable sir if the venerable Ananda has no urgent business perhaps the venerable Ananda would wait a moment out of compassion
Yes sire the man replied and he went to the venerable Ananda and after paying homage to him he stood at one side
The venerable Ananda consented in silence
Then King Pasenadi went by elephant as far as the elephant could go and then he dismounted and went to the venerable Ananda on foot
After paying homage to him he stood at one side and said to the venerable Ananda If venerable sir the venerable Ananda has no urgent business it would be good if he would go to the bank of the river Aciravati out of compassion
The venerable Ananda consented in silence
He went to the bank of the river Aciravati and sat down at the root of a tree on a seat made ready
Then King Pasenadi went by elephant as far as the elephant could go and then he dismounted and went to the venerable Ananda on foot After paying homage to him he stood at one side
and said to the venerable Ananda Here venerable sir is an elephant rug Let the venerable Ananda be seated on it
There is no need great king
Sit down I am sitting on my own mat
King Pasenadi of Kosala sat down on a seat made ready
No great king the Blessed One would not behave with the body in such a way that he could be censured by wise recluses and brahmins
Would the Blessed One venerable Ananda behave with speechbehave with the mind in such a way that he could be censured by wise recluses and brahmins
No great king the Blessed One would not behave with speechbehave with the mind in such a way that he could be censured by wise recluses and brahmins
It is wonderful venerable sir it is marvellous
For what we were unable to accomplish with a question has been accomplished by the venerable Ananda with the answer to the question
We do not recognise anything of value in the praise and blame of others spoken by foolish ignorant persons who speak without having investigated and evaluated but we recognise as valuable the praise and blame of others spoken by wise intelligent and sagacious persons who speak after having investigated and evaluated
Now venerable Ananda what kind of bodily behaviour is censured by wise recluses and brahmins
Any bodily behaviour that is unwholesome great king
Now venerable Ananda what kind of bodily behaviour is unwholesome
Any bodily behaviour that is blameworthy great king
Now venerable Ananda what kind of bodily behaviour is blameworthy
Any bodily behaviour that brings affliction great king
Now venerable Ananda what kind of bodily behaviour brings affliction
Any bodily behaviour that has painful results great king
Now venerable Ananda what kind of bodily behaviour has painful results
Any bodily behaviour great king that leads to ones own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both and on account of which unwholesome states increase and wholesome states diminish Such bodily behaviour is censured by wise recluses and brahmins great king
Now venerable Ananda what kind of verbal behaviour is censured by wise recluses and brahmins  Any verbal behaviour that is unwholesome  Now venerable Ananda what kind of mental behaviour is censured by wise recluses and brahmins
Any mental behaviour that is unwholesome 
The Tathagata great king has abandoned all unwholesome states and he possesses wholesome states
Now venerable Ananda what kind of bodily behaviour is uncensured by wise recluses and brahmins
Any bodily behaviour that is wholesome great king
Now venerable Ananda what kind of bodily behaviour is wholesome
Any bodily behaviour that is blameless great king
Now venerable Ananda what kind of bodily behaviour is blameless
Any bodily behaviour that does not bring affliction great king
Now venerable Ananda what kind of bodily behaviour does not bring affliction
Any bodily behaviour that has pleasant results great king
Now venerable Ananda what kind of bodily behaviour has pleasant results
Any bodily behaviour great king that does not lead to ones own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both and on account of which unwholesome states diminish and wholesome states increase Such bodily behaviour great king is uncensured by wise recluses and brahmins
Now venerable Ananda what kind of verbal behaviour is uncensured by wise recluses and brahmins  Any verbal behaviour that is wholesome   Now venerable Ananda what kind of mental behaviour is uncensured by wise recluses and brahmins
Any mental behaviour that is wholesome 
The Tathagata great king has abandoned all unwholesome states and possesses wholesome states
It is wonderful venerable sir it is marvellous
And we are satisfied and pleased by what has been so well expressed by him
Venerable sir we are so satisfied and pleased with what has been so well expressed by the venerable Ananda
But we know venerable sir that these are not allowable for the venerable Ananda
But there is this cloak of mine venerable sir which was sent to me packed in a royal umbrella case by King Ajatasattu of Magadha sixteen hands long and eight hands wide
Let the venerable Ananda accept it out of compassion
It is not necessary great king My triple robe is complete
Venerable sir this river Aciravati has been seen both by the venerable Ananda and by ourselves
In this way our offering will overflow
Venerable sir let the venerable Ananda accept the cloak
The venerable Ananda accepted the cloak
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala said And now venerable sir we depart We are busy and have much to do
Now is the time great king to do as you think fit
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Anandas words rose from his seat and after paying homage to the venerable Ananda keeping him on his right he departed
Then soon after he had left the venerable Ananda went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus It is a gain bhikkhus for King Pasenadi of Kosala it is a great gain for King Pasenadi of Kosala that he has had the opportunity of seeing and paying respect to Ananda
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
When he had wandered for alms in Savatthi and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to the Eastern Park to the Palace of Migaras Mother for the days abiding
and asked the minister Sirivaddha That is the venerable Ananda is it not
and said to the venerable Ananda Venerable sir King Pasenadi of Kosala pays homage with his head at the venerable Anandas feet and he says this Venerable sir if the venerable Ananda has no urgent business perhaps the venerable Ananda would wait a moment out of compassion
and said Venerable Ananda would the Blessed One behave with the body in such a way that he could be censured by wise recluses and brahmins
Now venerable Ananda does the Blessed One praise only the abandoning of all unwholesome states

Verse example This world is born to anguish and subject to painful contact It is sickness that it calls self 
For however it conceives it Tis ever otherwise than that
Maintaining its being other than that The world clings to being expectantly relishing only being
Now this divine life under the Blessed One  is lived in order to abandon being
Whoever  have declared escape from being to come about through love of nonbeing none of them I say escape from being
Whoever  have declared liberation from being to come about through love of some kind of being  none of them I say are liberated from being
It is by depending on the essentials of existence  that this suffering has actual being  with exhaustion of assuming in all ways suffering has no actual being See this wide world subjected to ignorance Which is which delights to be never freed from being 
Yet whatever the kinds of being that occur in any way anywhere All these are determinations impermanent painhaunted inseparable from the idea of change
So when a man thus sees With right understanding how it is
Craving for being is abandoned He no more expectantly relishes nonbeing
That is the utter exhaustion of all craving That is the remainderless fading cessation that is extinction
That bhikkhu being quenched through not assuming His being comes no more to a renewal
Now as to the words  This world is born to anguish  down to  And what it fears is pain is corruption by craving  
The passage Whoever have declared escape from being to come about through love of nonbeing none of them I say escapes from being
Whoever have declared liberation from being to come about through love of some kind of being none of them I say is liberated from being  is corruption by view 
That corruption by view and corruption by craving are both corruption
Then to go back again the words Now this divine life under the Blessed One is lived in order to abandon  being  down to  With exhaustion of assuming in all ways suffering has no actual being  are penetration
The words That bhikkhu being quenched  down to  One such as this outstrips  all modes of being  deal with the Adept
Prose example    One who goes with the stream  is corruption  One who goes against the stream are penetration
and  One who  stands of firm ground  is the Adept a plane
Herein what is the type of Thread Dealing with Morality and Dealing with Penetration
Merit will grow for one who gives No risk is stored for one restrained
Here Merit will grow for one who gives No risk is stored for one restrained is morality
One who is skilled abandons evil With exhaustion of lust hate delusion He attains complete extinction  is penetration
And Five rewards can be expected when ideas that have entered the ear are consolidated by word of mouth looked over by the mind and well penetrated by right view 
 Here someone has heard many ideas remembered and not forgotten them consolidated them by word of mouth looked over them with the mind penetrated them well by right view then when he devotes himself strives and makes efforts he reaches distinction here and now
 and if he reaches no distinction here and now he reaches it when ill
Herein he reaches  here and now is penetration
That he reaches Hermit Enlightenment in a future existence is morality
These are eight of the sixteen types of Thread  completely encompassing  all the Dispensation
And this ninefold Thread is for one with understanding not for one without understanding for one devoted not for one undevoted Discussion  Corruption kinds  Normally in the world corruption haunts even one who abides without action
That corruption is threefold as corruption by craving corruption by view and corruption by misconduct
Now when he comes to stand out above that lastnamed type of corruption then corruption establishes itself in the ideas that he heard and it establishes itself in ideas belonging to the worlds
since he is unskilled  as to what is seen there If he misapprehends that virtue owed to his climbing out of corruption by misconduct and that view then he has corruption by craving
But if it occurs to him thus  then he has wrong view and that is his corruption by wrong view
 Morality  But if he is established in virtue and his  virtueandduty  is not misapprehended then he being virtuous that virtueand duty of his being taken in a reasoned manner  generates  And that good conduct thus  conduces to his morality that is to his moral progress either here and now or on the occasion of his completing his time  or in other categories  in some future existence That is why this is called the type of Thread Dealing with Morality
 Penetration  Herein when being steadied in the virtues his cognizance is without hindrances then the Blessed One teaches him that True Idea for the abandoning of the embodimentview
finally he reaches the supreme goal  extinction he reaches the supreme extinction either with intervals between sessions or else in a single session he reaches all the six Acquaintanceships
Herein those persons who first reach extinction in the Noble Ones True Idea are of two kinds  the Follower by Faith and the Follower by Ideas 
Herein the Follower by Ideas is while the Follower by Faith is 
Herein one who gains knowledge from a condensed statement is of two kinds one may have keen faculties and another blunt faculties 
And herein one who is guidable is of two kinds one may have keen faculties and another blunt faculties
Herein the typegainingknowledgefromacondensedstate ment with blunt faculties and the guidabletype with keen faculties when classed as above under the two types are unequal  in their faculties
but when they are subtracted respectively from the typegainingknowledgefromacondensedstatement and from the guidabletype they being then regardable as equal in their faculties constitute a third type namely the 
These are thus the three persontypes
without fourth and without fifth   the typegainingknowledgefromacondensedstatement the typegainingknowledgefromanexpandedstatement and the guidabletype   Herein the person of the typegainingknowledgefroma condensedstatement whether the faculties he obtains are blunt or keen when being teadiedon the plane of seeing he reaches the fruit of StreamEntry he is a SingleSeed the first type of StreamEnterer 
Herein the person of the typegainingknowledgefroman expandedstatement whether the faculties he obtains are blunt or keen when being steadied on the plane of seeing he reaches the fruit of StreamEntry he is a ClantoClan the second type of StreamEnterer 
Herein the person of the guidabletype whether the faculties he obtains are blunt or keen when being steadied on the plane of seeing he reaches the fruit of StreamEntry he is a Seventimesat Most the third type of StreamEnterer 
Now these three types of persons are steadied in the fruit of StreamEntry with diversity in their faculties
This is the type of Thread Dealing with Penetration
  The Adept  Now it is if someone makes efforts additional to that that he reaches the supreme goal  extinction
Herein the keenfacultied person of the typegainigknowledge fromacondensedstatement becomes two persontypes on reaching the NonReturn Fruit there is hewhoattainsextinctionearly in hia next existence and hewhoattainsextinctionlate there
Herein the keenfacultied person of the typegainingknowledge fromanexpandedstatement becomes two persontypes on reaching the NonReturn Fruit there is hewhoattainsextinctionwithout promptingdeterminations and hewhoattainsextinctionwith promptingdeterminations
Herein the person of guidabletype on reaching the NonReturn Fruit is an UpStreamerBoundForTheNotJuniorGods   But by taking account of difference in their faculties in the cases of the typegainingknowledgefromacondensedstatement and the typegainingknowledgefromanexpandedstatement
So the five kinds of NonReturner the OnceReturner as sixth and the three kinds of StreamEnterer  make up nine kinds of Initiate
Herein the keenfacultied person of the typegainingknowledge fromacondensedstatement becomes two persontypes on reaching Arahantship the BothWaysLiberated and the LiberatedBy Understanding 
Herein the bluntfacultied person of the typegainingknowledge fromacondensedstatement becomes two persontypes on reaching Arahantship the AeonDelayer and the EssenceOf Penetration  Herein the keenfacultied person of the typegaining knowledgefromanexpandedstatement becomes two persontypes on reaching Arahantship the AbleByChoice and the AbleBy Guarding 
Herein the bluntfacultied person of the typegainingknowledge fromanexpandedstatement becomes two persontypes on reaching Arahantship the NoExtinctionAttainerIfHeChoosesExtinction
Herein the person of guidabletype who is not  devoted to the pursuit of development is OneLiableToFallAway  or else owing to his being OneCertainInAction  he becomes a LevelHead   These are nine types of Arahants  This is the fourfold Thread namely that Dealing with Corruption   that Dealing with the Adept
The  Powers of a Perfect One  Now a Perfect One has a tenfold Power  that occurs with regard to these persontypes
How tenfold
Here when the Enlightened Ones the Blessed Ones have not yet set rolling the Wheel of the True Idea  gods sons of great influence issue forth  to implore them thus 
And he  the newly Enlightened One on surveying the world with the unsurpassed Enlightened Ones eye sees three classes of creatures  the certainofrightness the certainofwrongness and the notcertain
  Knowledge of Instance and NonInstance  Herein that the certainofrightness class might enter into wrong mindfulness   no such instance is found That it might attain extinction  without a teacher  no such instance is found That it might enter upon an attainment of concentration  such an instance is found
Herein that the certainofwrongness class will practise noble right practice   no such instance is found That it will practise ignoble wrong practice  such an instance is found
Herein that the notcertain class when rightly practising will go to the certainofrightness class   such an instance is found That when wrongly practising it will go to the certainof rightness class   no such instance is found
That when rightly practising it will go to the certainofwrongness class  no such instance is found  That when wrongly practising it will go to the certainofwrongness class   such an instance is found
 That anyone will in accordance with a True Idea accuse me thus  You  a Fully Enlightened One who are surveying these three classes with the unsurpassed Enlightened Ones eye have not discovered these ideas   no such instance is found   That anyone will in accordance with a True Idea accuse me claiming as I do to be without lust of having taints still unexhausted  no such instance is found 
 That after the teaching of the True Idea to this notcertain class it will not be seen to conduce to the complete exhaustion of suffering in him who gives it effect   no such instance is found   That a hearer of mine belonging to the notcertain class being thus  advised will not verify any progressive distinction  no such instance is found
 That whoever of the many kinds of gods nagaserpents or spirits with their many languages  a Stilled One tames  in those languages will go to a further shore other than the further shore  stated  by the definition of ideas in the language of the texts  no such instance is found
The Discrimination of Ideas
 That a Stilled One should not master those languages uttered by creatures as their language  no such instance is found
The Discrimination of Meanings
That wherein  quieting  of these is therein  non quieting of these is no such instance is found
That wherein  destruction of these is not therein  destruction of these will be  no such instance is found
And as for Origin so for Cessation  The ten unprofitable and profitable courses of action
That womankind will be Mara or Sakka Ruler of Gods or a High Divinity or a Perfect One or a WheelTurner Monarch no such instance is found That a male may be a WheelTurner or Sakka Ruler of Gods  such an instance is found
So such power such knowledge as this is called the Knowledge of Instance and NoInstance the first Power of a Perfect One
That can be demonstrated by the three classes  the four Intrepidities  the four Discriminations  Dependent Arising in its occurrence and standstill 
and what happens in unprofitable and profitable ripening  and for the female and the male on reappearance  
 Knowleilge of the Way that Leads Anywhere  Now as to the certainofrightness class out of those three classes which were mentioned above  this is not  the Way that Leads Anywhere this is the way that leads only to extinction
Likewise also  the certainofwrongness class which is not the Way that Leads Anywhere this is only the way leading to origin of embodiment
It is this notcertain class which when steadied in a way going here or there goes  to extinction goes  to the state of unease and goes  to the divine and human states
or may go anywhere according to whatever way it may practise this is the Way that Leads Anywhere
Knowledge of how it is herein is called Knowledge of the Way that Leads Anywhere the second Power of a Perfect One
  Knowledge of Difference of Belief  Now this Way that Leads Anywhere is followed by those of differing beliefs some believe in sensual desires  and some in performance of difficult feats some are devoted to self torment  some rely on belief in purity through the roundabout of rebirths  some believe in ineffectuality  of action 
Knowledge of how creatures come to be bound down  by the habit of this or that kind of temperament understands how the worlds varied field of beliefs  comes to be
This is the third Power of a Perfect One
 Knowledge of the Different Elements  Herein when creatures are of such a belief  that belief of theirs they repeat keep in being and make much of
when they repeat it  thus believing in it
What is that  It is the sensualdesire element the renunciation element the illwill element the nonillwill element the cruelty element  and the noncruelty element that are believed in
Any other element beyond namely the undetermined element beyond the determined element  they do not see 
 obstinately misapprehending  and insisting upon that alone they assert Only this is the true the other is wrong  
as was said by the Blessed One to Sakka Ruler of Gods
Knowledge of how it is herein
is called the fourth Power of a Perfect One
 Knowledge of Ripening of Action  Herein whatever element  they believe best that they instigate through the body and through speech
The instigation is mental choice while the choiceasaction is is bodily and verbal  Because of the mentalness of the instigation  a Perfect One understands the actionsequence thus  By this creature who has such elements such action was done that being in the past period  with this as cause such ripening of it is ripening now or will ripen in the future period 
He understands the presently arisen period thus  This person who has such elements is doing this action
through craving and view with this as cause its ripening will be generated not only here and now but also either on the next reappearance or in some future state He understands the future period thus  This person will do such action  with this as cause such ripening of it will be generated There are  this kind of undertaking  of action has presently arisen pleasure and ripens as pleasure in the future   etc     So he understands this past future and presently arisen undertaking of action as to cause and as to instance and the variety in its ripening and the highness and lowness the inferiority and superiority of creatures This is called the Knowledge of Ripening of Action the fifth Power of a Perfect One
 Knowledge of Corruption etc in the cases of the Meditations etc  Herein whatever undertaking of action creatures are undertaking therein he understands thus When a person is a believer in efficacy of action and of lusting temperament his cognizance  comes to fulfilment by means of the renunciation element When he is occupied  with the field of lust his first meditation  is corrupted  but if he again makes further efforts then he is pursing the way dealing with distinction but doing so on the mental level whose field of cleansing is the first meditation for his meditation  is then still only of the kind dealing with loss
Once steadied in the first meditation then the second meditation comes to be his cleansing And then when he desires to enter upon the third meditation the joy faculty invades his cognizance and remains steady That happiness  of his remains steady indicating the third meditation but not as dealing with distinction
If he understands how the escape is in its case
then in the same way the fourth  meditation comes to be the cleansing too Now there are the ideas namely the factors of the third meditation that deal with the loss of the fourth meditation  and where these ideas are produced it is by the surmounting of them that the fourth meditation is indicated  as the cleansing
Similarly the Formless Attainments the four Concentrations   the three Gateways to Liberation and the eight Liberations Meditations  the four Meditations
 Liberations the eight liberations and the three Gateways to Liberation 
 Concentration the four kinds of concentration  namely concentration through will concentration through energy concentration through cognizance and concentration through inquiry 
 Attainments the four Formless Attainments So when a person is of lusting temperament such is the corruption of his meditations liberations concentrations and attainments
Likewise for one of hating temperament a
nd for one of deluded temperament
And when a person is of lusting temperament such is his cleansing  So knowledge of how it is herein which is not shared by disciples
 Knowledge of the Disposition of Creatures Faculties  Herein a Perfect One understands thus  Ideas belonging to worlds and ideas dissociated from worlds acquire the name  faculty  when dealing with keepinginbeing in dependence upon the plane of respective predominance
They acquire the name power in dependence upon the mindfaculty as confirmed mindfaculty 
they acquire the name  energy in dependence upon the element of instigation 
so such being his  knowledge he also made the teaching of the True Idea thus  These persons are possessed of these ideas
This is called Knowledge of Variety in the Faculties Powers and Energy of other creatures other persons the seventh Power of a Perfect One
 The Recollection of Past Life  The Heavenly Eye  Herein by means of two powers a Perfect One understands the destination in the planes and the worlds etc of those who have fetters and of those who are Initiates understanding it in the past roundabout by means of the Recollection of Past Life and understanding their decease and reappearance now in this presently arisen rondabout by means of the Heavenly Eye Thus these two powers are directed  to the Heavenly Eye
that which  was the Heavenly Eyes province in the past period becomes Mindfulnesss province now  So there is knowledge of his own past life in various ways and different aspects and of others in the present period by means of the Heavenly Eye These are two Powers of a Perfect One  Past Life the eighth and the Heavenly Eye the ninth
 Knowledge of Exhaustion of Taints  Again a Perfect One understands the meditation of noble persons to be a cleansing and dealing with penetration thus  This person having by means of this Path by means of this Way here and now verified and entered upon the heartdeliverance and understandingdeliverance that are taintless through exhaustion of taints abides therein Such is the knowledge about the exhaustion of his own taints and the appropriate fourplane knowledge of those coefficient with view  exhausted by the StreamEnterer down to that of those exhausted on the plane of the nine kinds of Arahants  the exhaustion of taints occurring limitedly  for Initiates and unlimitedly for Arahants
Herein heartdeliverance is taintless with respect to two taints namely the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being while understanding deliverance is taintless with respect to two taints namely the taint of views and the taint of ignorance  The knowledge of these two deliverances  how they come to be is called Knowledge of Exhaustion of Taints
the tenth Power of a Perfect One
The  Types of Thread as  Types  Steadied in these ten Powers a Perfect One teaches the Dispensation in five types of teaching thus that dealing with corruption that dealing with morality that dealing with seeing that dealing with keeping in being and that dealing with the Adept
  Corruption  Herein nongreed is the escape from corruption by craving 
Why
Because there are these three kinds of mental misconduct namely covetousness ill will and wrong view
Herein covetousness as mental misconduct assists the bodily action consisting in takingwhatisnotgiven and it aids all the speechaction anchored thereto namely false speechall speech that denies reality and what is all contempt and domineeringand it aids covetousness as a root of unprofit In the case of the corresponding good conduct the good conduct is the choice of abstention  from the false speech from the takingwhatisnotgiven and from the covetousness  Herein ill will as mental misconduct aids the bodily action consisting in killingbreathingthings and it aids all that verbal action consisting in refuting by dragging to and dragging fro and jolting up  and malicious speech and harsh speech  Wrong view as mental misconduct gives purpose to wrong view covetolsness and ill will and in one who has any wrong view at all his misconduct  whether born of lust or born of hate is all given being by wrong view It is for this reason that wrong view  aids misconduct in sensual desires The speechaction it aids is gossip
These are the three kinds of misconduct As to the unprofitable roots 
the covetousness is greed
the ill will is hate
These aid the eight Wrongnesses
It is when these three unprofitable roots are curbed that the tenfold profitable  comes to fulfilment From that threefold corruption by misconduct the type of Thread Dealing with Morality is the escape
Herein  this demonstration is based on the plurality  of covetousness ill will and wrong view  and it is in order for the greed hate and delusion also to correspond that greed has prominence here for that reason or else greed has it because it is normally so described among those three ideas considered as roots
 Morality  Herein the unprofitable root delusion is ignorance That has insisted on form in four ways  one who goes by ignorance 
Herein the first  term in each of the four conjectures in the embodimentview belongs  with annihilationism in the following ways  the noexistence of giving etc view  the fortuitous arising view  and the view that 
The last three terms of the selfconjectures  in the EmbodimentView belong with eternalism in the following way  and the nocausists fall under this head because of the likelihood that the doctrine of nooughttobedone will being suffering  and also the ineffectuality of actions  so  is included 
Herein the liveoutthesoulists  describe eightysix kinds of purification  through the roundabout misapprehending it thus 
Herein just as the embodimentview has four grounds in form  so it has twenty grounds in all the five categories
The soulisanotherists belong  with the eternalness of the embodiment view and belong with the holders of the eternalist doctrine They misapprehend virtue and duty thus  This is misapprehension of virtue and duty
Herein in the embodimentview  and he doubts is uncertain disbelieves is not confident about whether  in the future period and in the past period  this is imperfection in one steadied in matters only dealing with morality
a Seeing  Herein he abandons all uncertainty by means of the faith faculty He sees rise and subsidence by means of the understanding faculty He gives cognizance singleness by means of the concentration faculty He instigates by means of the energy faculty
By means of these five  faculties as a follower by Faith he arouses the straightresulting concentration  since he is certain  in the confidence that is due to undergoing 
and by means of these faculties when purified as a Follower by Ideas  he arouses the straightresulting concentration owed to independence of others  
 and so with the other three Truths  
This is the type of Thread Dealing with Seeing
b KeepinginBeing  Herein of the five hitherside fetters  three fetters are abandonable by Seeing  while the other two are altogether abandoned  when done by two persontypes
Herein the three roots of unprofit abandonable by Keeping inBeing discarded in the progressively higher stages still generate six kinds of being
Herein when among these three roots covetousness and ill will have been attenuated and six kinds of being have come to grips  with exhaustion while two kinds of being  still remain
When this covetousness and ill will are altogether exhausted
Now although here in the Arahant Path which is the last stage of the Initiate there are also the other four furtherside fetters besides conceit namely the defilements of lustforform lustforbeing ignorance and agitation since these are given their being by conceit as positionality all these seven kinds of Initiate have no power to stop the conceit I am and so one should instigate the abandoning of the conceit  I am 
But he whose taints are exhausted  by his reaching the Arahants Fruit is beyond this   The Adept  While the type of Thread Dealing with Seeing  has regard to five kinds of Initiate persons  and the type of Thread Dealing with KeepinginBeing has regard to three who are practising the way and two who stand in the fruit 
beyond these there is the type of Thread Dealing with the Adept which has regard to the plane of Him Who Has Done 
and this is the fifth type of Thread
The Ninefold Thread  General  This Thread  in general is taught of three types of persons of the ordinary man of the Initiate and of the Adept That Dealing with Corruption and that Dealing with Morality
are taught of the ordinary man that Dealing with Seeing
and that Dealing with KeepinginBeing of the five kinds of Initiates
Now  this Thread shown above as fivefold can be sought in the twentyseven moods 
Again with abbreviation  that Thread falls into fifty  moods which fifty moods demonstrated in the Dispensation when abbreviated fall into ten  moods which
into the four unshared and four shared which are the plane of the Modes of Conveying in Combined Treatment  These when abbreviated fall into the five types of Threads
into that Dealing with Corruption that Dealing with Morality that Dealing with Seeing  that Dealing with KeepinginBeing  and that Dealing with the Adept
These when abbreviated fall into the four types of Threads
into that Dealing with Corruption that Dealing with Morality that Dealing with Penetration and that Dealing with the Adept 
These when abbreviated fall into three types of Threads into that Dealing with the Ordinary Man that Dealing with the Initiate and that Dealing with the Adept 
These when abbreviated fall into two types of Threads into that Dealing with Penetration and that Dealing with Previous Devotion 
according as it was said by the Blessed One  
Herein bearing in mind the idiosyncrasies of ones own understanding  in regard to the eightfold Threadabbreviation the construing can be done here and there wherever one is able
No one can demonstrate how the Threads meaning is without having lent an ear 
 Now if thou art afraid  of pain And pain thou findest disagreeable
Then do no sort of evil act In public or in secrecy 
   Herein what is Fruit
 The True Ideal guards him that walks therein As does a big umbrella in time of rain 
The Ideals reward wlien walked in right is this Who walks therein has no bad destination  
This is Fruit
Herein what is Means
and the proseexposition in the Sevens namely 
This is Means
Herein what is Injunction and Fruit 
 Now if thou art afraid of pain And pain thou findest disagreeable
Then do no sort of evil act In public or in secrecy 
The Injunction is in the first verse and the Fruit in the second
And  The keeping of cognizance in being and the keeping of understanding in being are the Injunction and the  fading of lust is the Fruit
Herein what is Fruit and Means
 When a wise man established well in Virtue Keeps Cognizance in being and Understanding
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious He succeeds in disentangling this tangle 
The Means is the first halfverse and the Fruit is the second halfverse
And Nandiya  the Sakyan desirous of abiding in the town dwelt in for the Rains by the Seer   the Thread in the Elevens  from the start dow to in regard to the Six Ideas
and further in regard to the Five Ideas  That which is the task to be done is the Means
that  his cognizance is liberated from the taint of sensual desire
This is Fruit and Means
Herein what is Injunction and Fruit and Means
 Look upon the world as void Mogharaja constantly mindful
With selfview thus eliminated You may outstrip Mortality 
Look upon the world as void Mogharaja  is the Injunction
Constantly mindful is the Means
With selfview thus eliminated You may outstrip Mortality is the Fruit
And  Bhikkhus keep concentration in being Bhikkhus a bhikkhu when concentrated understands form as impermanent
Seeing thus a noble hearer is liberated from birth  etc  and despair   Here also the three
Herein what is Gratification
 
and 
This is Gratification
Herein what is Disappointment
  If his desires elude him He becomes as deformed as if pierced by a barb 
and the Simile of the Mountain in the Pasenadi Samyutta  This is Disappointment
Herein what is Escape
He that shuns desires as a snakes head with his foot
And is mindful evades this attachment to the world  
and the Thread in the Samyutta the Paricckattaka tree  with the bleached foliage with the spear  foliage  This is Escape
Herein what is Gratification and Disappointment
 
Herein what the evildoer experiences is Disappointment while what the doer of good experiences is  Gratification
while the gain fame praise and pleasure these are the Gratification
Herein what is Gratification and Escape
 Merits ripening is pleasant And brings success to ones intent
The  merits ripening  and the  success to ones intent  are the Gratification
while that one can  soon reach the peace supreme that is extinction  is the Escape
And  From If he lives on in the household life he becomes a Wheel Turning Monarch   down to   he lives on after con quering   is Gratification
If he goes forth from the household life into homelessness is the Escape from all gratification   This is Gratification and Escape
Herein what is Disappointment and Escape
 Knowing fear of that assuming  Which gives birth and death their being
He generates no more assuming  With births and deaths complete exhaustion 
In the first halfverse the actual being of birth and death is the Disappointment
That he  generates no more assuming With births and deaths complete exhaustion is the Escape
And  This world has surely happened upon woe since it is born and 
dies  down to  how will there be an end to this suffering or beyond Here the scrutiny is the Disappointment
From  he goes forth knowing wants  down to the  ancient city a royal capital is the Escape
This is Disappointment and Escape
Herein what is Gratification and Disappointment and Escape
For pleasing sensedesires many and varied In many a different way constrain the heart 
So I went forth to homelessness o King  Best is the Monks State Incontrovertible 
As to the words for pleasing sensedesires many and varied this is Gratification
As to in many a different way constrain the heart this is the Disappointment
As to So I went forth to homelessness  King  Best is the Monks State Incontro vertible  this is the Escape
And the Thread with the Simile of the SaltCrystal   according as  each action one does  is experienceable so is its ripening  experienceable Herein by action experienceable as pain he shows Disappointment with the words By one who has not kept the body in being down to pettyhearted   By action experienceable as pleasure he shows Gratification 
which is like the preceding clause
As to One who has kept cognizance in being kept the body in being and kept understanding in being is great in himself  not pettyhearted   this is Escape
rd Grouping   Herein what is the type of Thread Belonging to Worlds
 For evil action when performed Like new milk does not turn at once 
It follows like a lurking spark The fool burning him later on 
and the four  This is the type of Thread Belonging to Worlds 
Herein what is the type of Thread Dissociated From Worlds
 Whose faculties are well and truly quieted Like horses by a charioteer well trained
With all conceit in him abandoned taintless Then even to the gods he will be dear 
and  This is the type of Thread Dissociated From Worlds
Herein what is the type of Thread Belonging To Worlds and Dissociated From Worlds
As pierced by a downfalling spear As though he had his head on fire
As pierced by a downfalling spear As though he had his head on fire belongs to worlds
A mindful bhikkhu sets about Abandoning lust for sense desires  is dissociated from worlds
And 
belongs to worlds while is dissociated from worlds
Herein what is Action
Someone who kills a breathing thing Who spooks false speech
 
This is Action
Herein what is Ripening
  
and 
This is Ripening
Herein what is Action and Ripening
 As the ruststain that grows out of the iron Devours the iron wherefrom it takes its growth
Here from  As the ruststain that grows out of the iron  down to  by their own acts  is Action
 Aie led  to evil destinations  is Ripening
And   the practice of the way rightly is Action
while that thereby he reappears among gods is Ripening
This is Action and Ripening
Herein what is the Demonstrated type of Thread
 With faultless parts and a white awning The chariot turns on a single spoke 
and the meaning  thereof that the householder Citta demonstrated to the monks 
And the eleven terms in the CattleHerd Simile 
Herein what is an Undemonstrated meaning
Nonafflction is bliss in the world Restraint towards all breathing things
Fading of lust is bliss in the world Surmounting sensual desires
Outguiding the Conceit I am That indeed is the bliss supreme 
This is Undemonstrated
And the 
this is Undemonstrated
Herein what is Demonstrated and Undemonstrated
 With clear eyes with countenance bright Majestic erect as a flame In the
midst of this body of monks Thou shinest like unto the sun  
From With clear eyes down to Thou shinest like unto the sun  is Demonstrated
That he with the clear eyes is the Blessed One and how he has clear eyes how he has a fine face how he has a divine body how he is erect as a flame  and how he shines is Undemonstrated
And the proseexposition of the LumpofFroth Simile  By  as a lump of froth is so is form  as a bubble is so is feeling   down to  consciousness the five categories are Demonstrated with the five similes
But the reason why  form is similar to a lump of froth and whether it is all the kind that is cognizable by the eye only or also that cognizable by the other four bases namely ear nose tongue and body 
That is how it is Demonstrated and Undemonstrated
Herein what is Knowledge
 Best in the world is understanding The kind that deals with penetration 
The kind that rightly understaids The exhaustion of birth and death 
and  This is Knowledge
Herein what is the Knowable
 Clung to desires clung with sensual clinging Seeing nothing blameworthy in fetters
and 
Herein what is Knowledge and the Knowable
 And then besides notself are all ideas  And so when he sees thus with understanding
When he sees is Knowledge
When he establishes all ideas in the mood of notself this is the Knowable
And the  Herein three are the Knowable while as to the Path Truth the Virtue Category and Understanding Category are Knowledge
Herein what is Seeiing
This is the only path no other For the purification of seeing
So do you practise the way therein  This is bewilderment of Mara 
and 
This is Seeing
Herein what is KeepinginBeing
 
 
and 
This is KeepinginBeing
Herein what is Seeing and KeepinginBeing
Aspiring to the state that brings extinction Tis he can wander rightly in the world 
and the Blessed One said 
This is Seeing and KeepinginBeing
Herein what is Ideas Inseparable from the Idea of Ripening
 and
This is Ideas Inseparable from the Idea of Ripening
Herein what is Ideas Not Inseparable from the Idea of Ripening
 Form and the felt and then perception And consciousness and choice besides
 This is not I nor this my self When he sees thus his lust fades out  and
  This is Ideas Not Inseparable from the Idea of Ripening
Herein what is the Idea neither Inseparable from the Idea of Ripening nor Not Inseparable from the Idea of Ripening
So the right  practice and cessation are both the Ideaneither inseparablefromtheideaofripeningnornotinseparablefromthe ideaofripening
And  Here  the divine life is the Noble Eightfactored Path while the fruits of the divine life are the fruit of StreamEntry down to that of Arahantship
Herein what is Our Own Statement
 No doing any kind of evil Perfecting profitable skill
and  
This is Our Own Statement
Herein what is Someone Elses Statement
There is no loved one equal to ones child There are no riches equal to ones cattle
No radiance is equal to the sun The sea is sure the greatest of the waters 
and  with  can be quoted in detail
This is Someone Elses Statement
Herein what is Our Own Statement and Someone Elses Statement
 What is already reached and is still to be reached are both contaminated with dirt in him who trains as one still sick 
This is Someone Elses Statement
Then For those who do not approach either extreme there is no describing any round  or rebirth 
This is Our Own Statement
And  A man with children finds relish through his children And a propertyowner likewise through his property
Tliese essentials of existence are a mans relish  Who has them not will never relish find  which is Someone Elses Statement
while  A man with children finds sorrow through his children And a callleowner likewise through his cattle
These essentials of existence are a mans sorrow  Who has them not shall never sorrow find is Our Own Statement
This is Our Own Statement and Anothers Statement
Herein what is Expressed in Terms of Creatures
All beings there are and that will come to be Will travel on abandoning their bodies
A skilled man knowing all that loss Would lead the True Ideal Life Divine 
and  Bhikkhus tliere are three kinds of teachers an accomplished Perfect One an Initiate and one practising the way  
This is Expressed in Terms of Creatures
Herein what is Expressed in Terms of Ideas
 What sensual bliss is in the world Or what the bliss in heaven then
and 
Herein what is Expressed in Terms of Creatures and Expressed in Terms of Ideas
 
 Unbiassed Truth is hard to see Penetration hard for fools to see  is Expressed in Terms of Ideas

is free from lust for lustprovoking things Untroubled too by troubling things
Whose cognizance is kept in being like this How shall suffering come to him  
and Sariputta and the Blessed One how a certain elder said and Sariputtas exposition can be quoted namely
 
Herein  dark  and  with a dark supreme value  are corruption 
 bright  and  with a bright supreme value  are morality
 The steadfast will never call that a strong bond Made of iron or consisting of wood or of thongs 
But greed flushed with lusting for jewels and gems And concern for a wife and for children as well   
But what it relishes brings fear And what it fears is pain
Transcended is Deaths being the battle won One such as this outstrips all modes of being 
One who is skilled abandons evil With exhaustion of lust hate delusion He attains complete extinction 
 and if he reaches none when ill he reaches it on the occasion of his time of dying
 and if he reaches none on the occasion of his time of dying he reaches it when a god 
 and if he reaches none when a god then through lust for the True Idea he reaches Hermit Enlightenment

 That such language so used by him should not intimate that meaning to those hearers who delight in the path that is not uneven   no such instance is found 
The Discrimination of Language 
 That when influential gods sons approach and ask a Stilled One questions
the meaning might not be perspicuous  to him because of his being bodily or mentally oppressed or because of his being embarrassed through palsy of a hand or lameness of a foot   no such instance is found 
The Discrimination of Perspicuity
A Perfect One knows this Power thus
that element sustains them
is called the sixth Power of a Perfect One
according to the mood and according to the constituent of the leaning and inclination in the beliefs they possess 
nondelusion is the escape from corruption by view 
and the three profitable roots together are the escape from corruption by misconduct 
and the wrong view is delusion
and only one kind of being remains 
that being is generated by conceit
and that Dealing with the Adept demonstrated last  of all Arahants
its range being among those and not  beyond them
while remaining in the presentation of the Noble Truths fall into eight  moods that is
and after so construing the phrasing here and there the Threads meaning can then be demonstrated
nd Grouping   Herein what is Injunction
Here is a mnemonic verse for the first Threads 
Caught in the net of sensual murk And five inshutting hindrances 
Ideas are heralded by mind And then the Sakyan Mahanama 
Above below quite without lust What is the various virtues aim
Whose cognizance is like a rock The Upatissa Question
beginning Whose mindfulness of body is not  Covered dark darksupremevalue 
That is not strong and what is chosen  And  This world  and all the rest
And the four kinds of persons too  Merit will grow for one who gives
And ideas entered by the ear  These are their mnemonic verse
This is called Injunction
and   can be quoted in detail 
And then besides notself are all ideas And so when he sees thus with understanding
He then dispassion finds in suffering  This path it is that leads to purification  
For if thou doest  and wilt do  An evil act no matter what
Thou wilt no safety find from pain Even by flight to future states  
and from all taints in the good destinations  is the Fruit
 
And the proseexposition in the Octads on etc  Herein the nongain nonfame censure and pain there are the Disappointment
And so one soon can reach the peace Supreme that is extinction  
A mindful bhikkhu sets about Abandoning lust for sense desires  
who in the world Takes to himself what is not given Who goes too with anothers wife
Who has the habit to indulge In drinking spirituous liquor 
and 
So too are led habitual transgressors By their own acts to evil destinations 
See how it moves quite undisturbed  The stream is cleft there are no bonds Siv 
this is how the meaning of this verse was demonstrated
That is how a bhikkhu perceives form 
down to   how he makes extra offerings  
these eleven terms as stated are the meaning demonstrated of the simile
 Seclusion is bliss for one content And who has heard the truth who sees
and how feeling is similar to a bubble
and which kind of feeling it is whether pleasant painful or neither painfulnorpleasant
this is Undemonstrated
Assuredly those clung with fetterclinging Will never cross the vast abounding flood 
namely the Kapiya Thread in the Udana on the Incontrovertible Confidence This is the Knowable
He then dispassion finds in suffering This path it is that leads to purification 
He that opposes none in word or mind Or bodily act who knows the True Idea
 
 Those who shall practise in this way The guideline by the Buddha taught
Will make an end of suffering And carry out the Masters message 
And purifying ones own heart This is the Buddhas dispensation 
For those with such a doctrine  there is no harm in sensedesires  
All is not worth a sixteenth part Of bliss come with exhausted craving 
Leaving misconduct by the body Let him pursue good bodily conduct  
Like an umbrella in time of rain What purpose has the profitable   
And then notself are all ideas  It would not move a man possessing  
Thou wilt no safety find from pain  And also quiet and insight too 
Owing to lust for sensedesires He is devoured by his thoughts  
Enlightenment Factors kept in being He the tangle disentangles 
Then look upon the world as void  And keep in being concentration  
If his desires when desiring  Good destination from true conduct  
Deformed as if pierced by a barb   Crushing from all the four directions 
And also he that shuns desires  The Paricchattaka Simile
And merits ripening is pleasant  No third alternative exists 
Knowing the fear from that assming  That is it born and that it dies 
Sensedesires are many and varied The Simile of the SaltCrystal  
For evil actions when performed  And he that goes by the bad ways
Whose faculties are truly quieted  And the Noble concentration  
In the PitakaDisclosure the second chapter called the  Pattern of the Dispensation  is completed
Out guiding sensual bliss in the world   Seven enlightenment factors taught 
Full sixty thousand years gone by And difficult to find the moment  
And as the stain upon the iron  And in the four Right Practices 
With faultless parts and a white awning 
Seclusion bliss for the contented  And when the eight thoughts are well taught
The Simile of the Lump of Froth  With clear eyes and bright countenance 
Best in the world is understanding 
Such creatures clung to sensedesires  Uncontroverted confidence  
Besides notself are all ideas  The Noble Truth as it is taught 
This is the only path no other  Declares himself StreamEnterer
Whose faculties are kept in being And traces of the True Idea
Opposing none in words or mind Impermanent five categories 
Whatever actions a man does There are three kinds of conduct good 
Form and feeling and perception   Five categories are displayed 
He that shall practise in this way  And then the fruits of life divine 
No doing any kind of evil  Gateways to Liberation taught  
There is no loved one like ones child The gods and the asura demons
The already reached the not yet reached  Relish and sorrow everlasting 
Whatever beings are and will be  What kinds of teachers are displayed
The Eightfold is the best of paths  And then the three foremost described 
And good is bodily restraint  And what is to be done as taught 
There is no loved one like ones child  And what should not be done as taught
Let him do profit by the body  The Great Analysis of Action  
Unbiassed Truth is hard to see   The BalkofTimber Simile  
Those only godlike call This story was told by the Blessed One while at Jetavana about a wealthy Brother
Tradition tells us that on the death of his wife a squire of Sāvatthi joined the Brotherhood
When he was joining he caused to be built for himself a chamber to live in a room for the fire and a storeroom and not till he had stocked his storeroom with ghee rice and the like did he finally join
Even after he had become a brother he used to send for his servants and make them cook him what he liked to eat He was richly provided with the requisites having an entire change of clothing for night and another for day
and he dwelt aloof on the outskirts of the monastery
One day when he had taken out his cloths and bedding and had spread them out to dry in his chamber a number of Brethren from the country who were on a pilgrimage from monastery to monastery  came in their journeying to his cell and found all these belongings Whose are these  they asked
Mine sirs he replied
What sir  they cried this uppercloth and that as well this undercloth as well as that and that bedding too is it all yours
Yes nobodys but mine
Sir said they the Blessed One has only sanctioned three cloths and yet though the Buddha to whose doctrine you have devoted yourself is so simple in his wants you forsooth have amassed all this stock of requisites Come we must take you before the Lord of Wisdom And so saying they went off with him to the Master
Becoming aware of their presence the Master said Wherefore is it Brethren that you have brought the Brother against his will
Sir this Brother is welloff and has quite a stock of requisites
Is it true Brother as they say that you are so welloff
Yes Blessed One
But why Brother have you amassed these belongings
Do not I extol the virtues of wanting little contentment and so forth solitude and determined resolve 
Angered by the Masters words he criedThen Ill go about like this  And flinging off his outer clothing he stood in their midst clad only in his waistcloth
Then as a moral support to him the Master said Was it not you Brother who in bygone days were a seeker after the shamefacedness that fears to sin and even when you were a waterdemon lived for twelve years seeking after that shamefacedness How then comes it that after vowing to follow the weighty doctrine of the Buddha you have flung off your outer robes and stand here devoid of shame 
At the Masters word his sense of shame was restored he donned his robes again and saluting the Master seated himself at the side
The Brethren having asked the Blessed One to explain to them the matter he had mentioned the Blessed One made clear what had been concealed from them by rebirth
Once on a time Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares in Kāsi
The Bodhisatta having come to birth in those days as the kings son by the queen
By the time he could run about a second son was born to the king and the name they gave this child was Prince Moon
who was his joy and delight and their love was crowned with the birth of yet another prince whom they named Prince Sun
In his joy at the birth of the boy the king promised to grant her any boon she might ask on the childs behalf
But the queen treasured up the promise to be fulfilled at her own good time hereafter
Later when her son had grown up she said to the king Sire when my boy was born you granted me a boon to ask for him Let him be king
Nay said the king two sons have I radiant as flaming fires I cannot give the kingdom to your son But when he saw that undaunted by this refusal the queen kept plaguing him time after time to grant her request the king fearing lest the woman should plot evil against his sons sent for them and said My children when Prince Sun was born I granted a boon and now his mother wants the kingdom for him
I have no wish to give him the kingdom but women are naturally wicked and she will be plotting evil against you You had better retire to the forest to return at my death to rule in the city which belongs by right to our house So saying with tears and lamentations the king kissed his two sons on the head and sent them forth
As the princes were leaving the palace after their adieux to their father who should see them but Prince Sun himself who was playing in the courtyard And no sooner did he learn what was the matter than he made up his mind to go with his brothers So he too went off in their company
The three came to the region of the Himalayas
and here the Bodhisatta who had turned aside from the road and was sitting at the foot of a tree said to Prince Sun Run down to the pool yonder Sun dear drink and bathe there and then bring us too some water back in a lotusleaf
Now that pool had been delivered over to a certain watersprite by Vessavaṇa  who said to him With the exception of such as know what is truly godlike all that go down into this pool are yours to devour
Over those that do not enter the waters you have no power granted to you
And thenceforth the watersprite used to ask all who went down into the pool what was truly godlike devouring everyone who did not know
Now it was into this pool that Prince Sun went down quite unsuspiciously
O yes said he the sun and moon
You dont know said the monster and hauling the prince down into the depths of the water imprisoned him there in his own abode
Finding that his brother was a long time gone the Bodhisatta sent Prince Moon
He too was seized by the watersprite and asked whether he knew what was truly godlike
Oh yes I know said he the four quarters of heaven are
You dont know said the watersprite as he hauled this second victim off to the same prisonhouse
Finding that this second brother too tarried long the Bodhisatta felt sure that something had happened to them So away he went after them and tracked their footsteps down into the water Realising at once that the pool must be the domain of a watersprite he girded on his sword and took his bow in his hand and waited
Now when the demon found that the Bodhisatta had no intention of entering the water he assumed the shape of a forester and in this guise addressed the Bodhisatta thus Youre tired with your journey mate why dont you go in and have a bathe and a drink and deck yourself with lotuses You would travel on comfortably afterwards
Recognising him at once for a demon the Bodhisatta said It is you who have seized my brothers
Yes it was was the reply
Why
Because all who go down into this pool belong to me
What all
Not those who know what is truly godlike all save these are mine
And do you want to know the godlike
I do
If this be so I will tell you what is truly godlike
Do so and I will listen
I should like to begin said the Bodhisatta but I am travelstained with my journey
Then the watersprite bathed the Bodhisatta and gave him food to eat and water to drink decked him with flowers sprinkled him with scents and laid out a couch for him in the midst of a gorgeous pavilion
Seating himself on this couch and making the watersprite sit at his feet the Bodhisatta said Listen then and you shall hear what the truly godlike is And he repeated this stanza
who shrink from sin The whitesouled
And when the demon heard this he was pleased and said to the Bodhisatta Man of wisdom I am pleased with you and give you up one of your brothers Which shall I bring
The youngest
Man of wisdom though you know so well what the truly godlike is you dont act on your knowledge
How so
Why you take the younger in preference to the elder without regard to his seniority
Demon I not only know but practise the godlike
It was on this boys account that we sought refuge in the forest
With us came this boy nor ever thought of turning back again
Not a soul would believe me if I were to give out that he had been devoured by a demon in the forest and it is the fear of odium that impels me to demand him at your hands
Excellent excellent O man of wisdom cried the demon in approval you not only know but practise the godlike And in token of his pleasure and approval he brought forth the two brothers and gave them both to the Bodhisatta
Then said the latter to the watersprite Friend it is in consequence of your own evil deeds in times past that you have now been born a demon subsisting on the flesh and blood of other living creatures and in this present birth too you are continuing to do evil This evil conduct will for ever bar you from escaping rebirth in hell and the other evil states Wherefore from this time forth renounce evil and live virtuously
Having worked the demons conversion the Bodhisatta continued to dwell at that spot under his protection until one day he read in the stars that his father was dead Then taking the watersprite with him he returned to Benares and took possession of the kingdom making Prince Moon his viceroy and Prince Sun his generalissimo For the watersprite he made a home in a pleasant spot and took measures to ensure his being provided with the choicest garlands flowers and food
He himself ruled in righteousness until he passed away to fare according to his deeds
His lesson ended the Master preached the Truths at the close whereof that Brother won the Fruit of the First Path
And the Allknowing Buddha having told the two stories made the connexion linking the two together and identified the Birth by saying The welltodo Brother was the waterdemon of those days nanda was Prince Sun Sāriputta Prince Moon and I myself the eldest brother Prince Mahiṃsāsa
was duly named Prince Mahiṃsāsa
but by the time he could run about the Bodhisattas mother died Then the king took another queen
with the result that he was seized by the watersprite who said to him Do you know what is truly godlike
Those only godlike call tranquil votaries of Good
it was for him that his mother asked the kingdom from our father and our father refusing to fulfil her demand consented to our flight to the refuge of the forest

This is called the noble actuality of suffering 
Herein what is the noble actuality of the origin of suffering
It is craving which produces further being is accompanied by delight and greed delighting in this and that that is to say craving for sense desires craving for being craving for nonbeing   But wherein does that craving arise wherein does it dwell

When anyone develops concentration by mindfulness of breathing  with sixteen grounds over two hundred kinds of knowledge arise in him I eight kinds of knowledge of obstacles and eight kinds of knowledge of aids II eighteen kinds of knowledge of imperfections III thirteen kinds of knowledge of cleansing IV thirtytwo kinds of knowledge in mindful workers V twentyfour kinds of knowledge through concentration VI seventytwo kinds of knowledge through insight VII eight kinds of knowledge of dispassion VIII eight kinds of knowledge of what is in conformity with dispassion IX eight kinds of knowledge as tranquillization of dispassion X twentyone kinds of knowledge of pleasure of deliverance
What are the eight kinds of knowledge of obstacles and eight kinds of knowledge of aids
Zeal for sensualdesires is an obstacle to concentration renunciation is an aid to concentration
Illwill is an obstacle  nonillwill is an aid 
These are the eight kinds of knowledge of obstacles and eight kinds of knowledge of aids
Also all unprofitable ideas are an obstacle to concentration and all profitable ideas are an aid to concentration
Boredom is an obstacle  gladness is an aid 
Ignorance is an obstacle  knowledge is an aid 
Uncertainty is an obstacle  definitionofideas is an aid 
Agitation is an obstacle  nondistraction is an aid 
Stiffnessandtorpor is an obstacle  perception of light is an aid 
When cognizance is oriented well oriented in these sixteen aspects it establishes the unities and is purified from hindrances
What are these unities
Renunciation is unity nonillwill is unity perception of light is unity nondistraction is unity definitionofideas is unity knowledge is unity gladness is unity also all profitable ideas are unity
What are these hindrances
Zeal for sensualdesires is a hindrance illwill is a hindrance stiffness andtorpor is a hindrance agitation is a hindrance uncertainty is a hindrance ignorance is a hindrance boredom is a hindrance also all unprofitable ideas are a hindrance
Hindrance in what sense hindrance
They are hindrances in the sense of blocking the outlets
What are the outlets
Renunciation is an outlet for noble ones
Perceptionoflight
and noble ones are let out by renunciation
zeal for sensualdesires blocks that outlet
and because one is hindered by zeal for sensualdesires one does not understand the noble ones outlet consisting in renunciation
Nonillwill
illwill
stiffnessandtorpor
Nondistraction
agitation
Definitionofideas
uncertainty
Knowledge
ignorance
Gladness
boredom
Also all profitable ideas are an outlet for noble ones
and noble ones are let out by all profitable ideas
all unprofitable ideas block that outlet
and because one is hindered by all unprofitable ideas one does not understand the noble ones outlet consisting in all profitable ideas
When one whose cognizance is purified from these hindrances develops concentration by mindfulness of breathing with sixteen grounds the following eighteen imperfections arise in him in momentary combinations
What eighteen imperfections arise
When he goes in with mindfulness after the beginning middle and end of an inbreath his cognizance becomes distracted internally and that is an obstruction to concentration
When he goes out with mindfulness after the beginning middle and end of an outbreath his cognizance becomes distracted externally and that is an obstruction to concentration
Such behaviour of craving as hope for and attachment to inbreath is an obstruction to concentration
Such behaviour of craving as hope for and attachment to outbreath is an obstruction to concentration
Any longing for outbreath in him when he is fatigued by too long or too short inbreath is an obstruction to concentration
Any longing for inbreath in him when he is fatigued by outbreath is an obstruction to concentration
And those who know not liberation Perforce must trust in others words
Are such as will prevent release Of cognizance that they distract
These six defects in concentration Based upon mindfulness of breathing
The longing for inbreath in one Who is by outbreath much fatigued
The longing for outbreath in one Who is by inbreath much fatigued
Expecting distraction inwardly Loving distraction outwardly
Mindfulness running after inbreath And running after outbreath too
If when he adverts to the sign his cognizance is shakable by inbreath this is an obstacle to concentration
If when he adverts to inbreath his cognizance is shakable by the sign this is an obstacle to concentration
If when he adverts to the sign his cognizance is shakable by outbreath this is an obstacle to concentration
If when he adverts to outbreath his cognizance is shakable by the sign this is an obstruction to concentration
If when he adverts to inbreath his cognizance is shakable by outbreath this is an obstruction to concentration
If when he adverts to outbreath his cognizance is shakable by inbreath this is an obstruction to concentration
Adverting to the sign the while the mind Is still distracted by inbreath
Adverting to inbreath while cognizance Can still be shaken by the sign
Adverting to the sign the while the mind Is still distracted by outbreath
Adverting to outbreath while cognizance Can still be shaken by the sign
Adverting to inbreath the while the mind Is still distracted by outbreath
Adverting to outbreath while cognizance Can still be shaken by inbreath
These six defects in concentration Based upon mindfulness of breathing
Are such as will prevent release Of cognizance that they can shake
And those who know not liberation Perforce must trust in others words
Cognizance that runs after the past breaths is attacked by distraction and is an obstruction to concentration
Cognizance shaken by looking forward to the future breaths is an obstruction to concentration
Slack cognizance is attacked by indolence and is an obstruction to concentration
Overexerted cognizance is attacked by agitation and is an obstruction to concentration
Enticed cognizance is attacked by greed and is an obstruction to concentration
Repelled cognizance is attacked by illwill and is an obstruction to concentration
The cognizance that hunts the past That loves the future that is slack
These six defects in concentration Based upon mindfulness of breathing
When he goes in with mindfulness after the beginning middle and end of the inbreath his cognizance being distracted internally both his body and his cognizance are disquieted perturbed and excited
When he goes out with mindfulness after the beginning middle and end of the outbreath his cognizance being distracted externally both his body and his cognizance are disquieted perturbed and excited
With such behaviour of craving as hope for and attachment to inbreath both his body and his cognizance are disquieted perturbed and excited
With such behaviour of craving as hope for and attachment to out breath both his body 
Quits perturbation of his body And likewise of his cognizance
He is unexcited in his body And likewise in his cognizance
When one whose cognizance is purified from those hindrances mentioned in Section i develops concentration by mindfulness of breathing with sixteen grounds these eighteen imperfections arise in him in momentary combinations
Overexerted or enticed Or repelled is unconcentrated
Are such that when they stain his thought He knows not Higher Cognizance
One whose mindfulness of breathing Has been developed and perfected
He is then excited in his body And likewise in his cognizance
Finds perturbation of his body Likewise of his cognizance
One whose mindfulness of breathing Is undeveloped unperfected
Owing to longing for outbreath in him when he is fatigued by too long or too short inbreath both his body 
Owing to longing for inbreath in him when he is fatigued by out breath both his body
If when he adverts to the sign his cognizance is still shakable by inbreaths both his body 
If when he adverts to inbreath his cognizance is still shakable by the sign both his body 
If when he adverts to the sign his cognizance is still shakable by out breath both his body 
If when he adverts to outbreath his cognizance is still shakable by the sign both his body 
If when he adverts to inbreath his cognizance is still shakable by outbreath both his body 
If when he adverts to outbreath his cognizance is still shakable by inbreath both his body 
With cognizance running after the past and attacked by distraction both his body 
With cognizance shaken by looking forward to the future breaths both his body 
With cognizance slack and attacked by indolence both his body
With cognizance overexerted and attacked by agitation both his body 
With cognizance enticed and attacked by greed both his body 
With cognizance repelled and attacked by illwill both his body and his cognizance are disquieted perturbed and excited
What are the thirteen kinds of knowledge of cleansing
Cognizance that runs after the past breaths is attacked by distraction by avoiding that he concentrates it in one place thus cognizance does not become distracted
Cognizance that looks forward to the future breaths is shakable by avoiding that he composes it there thus also cognizance does not become distracted
Slack cognizance is attacked by indolence by exerting it he abandons indolence thus also cognizance does not become distracted
Overexerted cognizance is attacked by agitation by curbing it he abandons agitation thus also cognizance does not become distracted
Enticed cognizance is attacked by greed by being fully aware of that he abandons greed thus also cognizance does not become distracted
Repelled cognizance is attacked by illwill by being fully aware of that he abandons illwill thus also cognizance does not become distracted
In these six aspects cognizance becomes purified and bright and arrives at the unities
What are these unities
They are the unity consisting in establishing the willtorelinquish a gift in the act of giving the unity consisting in establishing the sign of serenity in concentration the unity consisting in establishing the characteristic of fall in insight the unity consisting in establishing cessation in the path
The unity consisting in establishing the willtorelinquish a gift belongs to those resolute on giving up The unity consisting in establishing the sign of serenity belongs to those devoted to the Higher Cognizance The unity consisting in establishing the characteristic of fall belongs to those practising insight The unity consisting in establishing cessation belongs to Noble Persons  In these four instances cognizance arrived at unity enters into purification of the way is intensified in equanimity is satisfied by knowledge
What is the beginning the middle and the end of the first jhana
Of the first jhana purification of the way is the beginning intensification of equanimity is the middle and encouragement is the end
Of the first jhana purification of the way is the beginning
The beginning has three characteristics
And in that cognizance is purified of obstructions and because it is purified cognizance makes way for the central state of equilibrium which is the sign of serenity and because it has made way cognizance enters into that state
These are the three characteristics of the beginning
Hence it is said that thefirst jhana is good in the beginning which possesses three characteristics
Of thefirst jhana intensification of equanimity is the middle
The middle has three characteristics
And in that he now looks on with equanimity at cognizance that is purified and looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity and looks on with equanimity at the establishment of unity that intensification of equanimity is the middle of thefirst jhana
These are the three characteristics of the middle
Hence it is said that thefirst jhana is good in the middle which possesses three characteristics
Of the first jhana encouragement is the end
 encouragement in the sense that there was nonexcess of the ideas arisen therein encouragement in the sense that the faculties had a single function  encouragement in the sense that the appropriate energy was effective encouragement in the sense of repetition
are the encouragement in the end of the first jhana
Hence it is said that the first jhana is good in the end which possesses four characteristics
Cognizance that has reached the triple cycle of beginning middle and end thus and is good in the three ways and possesses the ten characteristics also possesses the five jhana factors of appliedthought and sustainedthought and happiness and pleasure and steadiness as well as the five faculties and powers of faith and energy and mindfulness and concentration and understanding
What is the beginning the middle and the end of the second jhana
Of the second jhana purification of the way is the beginning intensification of equanimity is the middle and encouragement is the end  Of the second jhana purification of the way is the beginning how many characteristics has the beginning The beginning has three  repeat  to  substituting second jhana for first jhana
 What is the beginning the middle and the end of the third jhana  repeat  to 
 What is the beginning the middle and the end of the fourth jhana 
  repeat the same five  for each of the  Principal Insights 
How is it that these three ideas are not the supporting object of a single cognizance that they are nevertheless not unrecognized that cognizance does not become distracted that he manifests endeavour carries out a task and achieves a distinctive effect
and a man cut it with a saw
The mans mindfulness is established by the saws teeth where they touch the tree trunk without his giving attention to the saws teeth as they approach and recede
As the tree trunk placed on the level piece of ground
As the mans mindfulness established by the saws teeth where they touch the tree trunk without his giving attention to the saws teeth as they approach and recede though they are not unrecognized by him as they do so and so he manifests endeavour carries out a task and achieves a distinctive effect
What is the endeavour
The body and the cognizance of one who is energetic become wieldy this is the endeavour
What is the task
Imperfections come to be abandoned in one who is energetic and his appliedthoughts are stilled this is the task
What is the effect
Fetters come to be abandoned in one who is energetic and his underlying tendencies come to be done away with
So these three things are not the supporting object of a single cognizance and they are nevertheless not unrecognized and cognizance does not become distracted and he manifests endeavour carries out a task and achieves a distinctive effect
Whose mindfulness of breathing in And out is perfect well developed
When he breaths in it is established in him when he breathes out it is established in him
Perfect perfect in the sense of embracing jhana insight and path perfect in the sense of the mutual equipment of all ideas connected therewith perfect in the sense of perfection
Well developed There are four kinds of development development in the sense of nonexcess of ideas arisen therein  development in the sense of single function of the faculties  development in the sense of effectiveness of appropriate energy development in the sense of repetition
These four kinds of development in him are made the vehicle made the ground consolidated reinforced and brought to very sameness
Made the vehicle he has mastery power and assurance wherever he wishes
Hence made the vehicle was said
Made the ground his mindfulness is wellestablished on whatever basis his cognizance is well steadied on
His cognizance is well steadied on whatever ground his mindfulness is well established on
Hence made the ground was said
Consolidated his mindfulness has parallel turnover with whatever he guides his cognizance by
He guides his cognizance by whatever his mindfulness has parallel turnover with
Hence consolidated was said
Reinforced reinforced in the sense of embracing reinforced in the sense of equipment reinforced in the sense of perfection
When he embraces with mindfulness he conquers evil unprofitable ideas
Hence reinforced was said
Brought to very sameness  there are four kinds of bringing to very sameness bringing to very sameness in the sense of non excess of ideas arisen therein bringing to very sameness in the sense of single function of the faculties bringing to very sameness in the sense of effectiveness of appropriate energy bringing to very sameness owing to verisimilar abolition of defilements opposed thereto
Very sameness  there is sameness and very sameness

End of Treatise on Breathing
At Svatthi
Then a brahmin who was a cosmologist approached the Blessed One and said to him
How is it Master Gotama does all exist 
All exists this brahmin is the oldest cosmology
Then Master Gotama does all not exist 
All does not exist this brahmin is the second cosmology
How is it Master Gotama is all a unity
All is a unity this brahmin is the third cosmology
Then Master Gotama is all a plurality
All is a plurality this brahmin is the fourth cosmologY
Without veering towards either of these extremes the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle 
When this was said that brahmin said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Now venerable Ananda does the Blessed One praise only the undertaking of all wholesome states
how well that has been expressed by the venerable Ananda
that if the elephanttreasure were allowed to him we would give it to him
if the horsetreasure were allowed to him we would give it to him
if the boon of a village were allowed to him we would give it to him
when a great cloud has rained heavily on the mountains then this river Aciravati overflows both its banks So too venerable sir the venerable Ananda can make a triple robe for himself out of this cloak
and he can share out his old triple robe among his companions in the holy life
related to him his entire conversation with King Pasenadi of Kosala
and presented the cloak to the Blessed One
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Now on that occasion a certain householders dear and beloved only son had died
After his sons death he had no more desire to work or to eat
He kept going to the charnel ground and crying My only child where are you My only child where are you
Then that householder went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him sat down at one side
The Blessed One said to him Householder your faculties are not those of one in control of his own mind Your faculties are deranged
How could my faculties not be deranged venerable sir For my dear and beloved only son has died
Since he died I have no more desire to work or to eat
I keep going to the charnel ground and crying My only child where are you My only child where are you
So it is householder so it is
Sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
Venerable sir who would ever think that sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
Venerable sir happiness and joy are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
Then displeased with the Blessed Ones words disapproving of them the householder rose from his seat and left
Now on that occasion some gamblers were playing with dice not far from the Blessed One
Then the householder went to those gamblers and said Just now sirs I went to the recluse Gotama and after paying homage to him I sat down at one side
When I had done so the recluse Gotama said to me Householder your faculties are not those of one in control of his own mind
Then displeased with the recluse Gotamas words disapproving of them I rose from my seat and left
So it is householder so it is
Happiness and joy are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
Then the householder left thinking I agree with the gamblers
Eventually this story reached the kings palace
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala told Queen Mallika This is what has been said by the recluse Gotama Mallika Sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
If that has been said by the Blessed One sire then it is so
No matter what the recluse Gotama says Mallika applauds it thus
Just as a pupil applauds whatever his teacher says to him saying So it is teacher so it is 
Be off Mallika away with you
Then Queen Mallika addressed the brahmin Nalijangha Come brahmin go to the Blessed One andjpay homage in my name with your head at his feet and ask whether he is free from illness and affliction and is healthy strong and abiding in comfort saying Venerable sir Queen Mallika pays homage with her head at the Blessed Ones feet and asks whether the Blessed One is free from illnessand abiding in comfort
Then say this Venerable sir have these words been uttered by the Blessed One Sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are bom from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
Learn well what the Blessed One replies and report it to me
Yes madam he replied and he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
and said Master Gotama Queen Mallika pays homage with her head at Master Gotama  s feet and asks whether he is free from illnessand abiding in comfort And she says this Venerable sir have these words been spoken by the Blessed One Sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
So it is brahmin so it is
Sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
It can be understood from this brahmin how sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
Once in this same Savatthl there was a certain woman whose mother died
Owing to her mothers death she went mad lost her mind and wandered from street to street and from crossroad to crossroad saying Have you seen my mother Have you seen my mother
And it can also be understood from this how sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are bom from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
Once in this same Savatthi there was a certain woman whose father diedwhose brother diedwhose sister diedwhose son diedwhose daughter diedwhose husband died
Owing to her husbands death she went mad lost her mind and wandered from street to street and from crossroad to crossroad saying Have you seen my husband Have you seen my husband
And it can also be understood from this how sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
Once in this same Savatthi there was a certain man whose mother died
Owing to his wifes death he went mad lost his mind and wandered from street to street and from crossroad to crossroad saying Have you seen my wife Have you seen my wife
And it can also be understood from this how sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
Once in this same Savatthi there was a certain woman who went to live with her relatives family
Her relatives wanted to divorce her from her husband and give her to another
Then the woman said to her husband Lord these relatives of mine want to divorce me from you and give me to another
Then the man cut the woman in two and committed suicide thinking We shall be together in the afterlife
It can also be understood from this how sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
Then delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed Ones words the brahmin Nalijangha rose from his seat went to Queen Mallika and reported to her his entire conversation with the Blessed One
Then Queen Mallika went to King Pasenadi of Kosala and asked him What do you think sire Is Princess Vajiri dear to you
Yes Mallika Princess Vajiri is dear to me
What do you think sire If change and alteration took place in Princess Vajiri would sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair arise in you
Change and alteration in Princess Vajiri would mean an alteration in my life How could sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair not arise in me
It was with reference to this sire that the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened said Sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
What do you think sire Is the noble Queen Vasabha dear to you
Is General Vidudabha dear to you
Am I dear to you
Are Kasi and Kosala dear to you
Yes Mallika Kasi and Kosala are dear to me
We owe it to Kasi and Kosala that we use Kasi sandalwood and wear garlands scents and unguents
What do you think sire If change and alteration took place in Kasi and Kosala would sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair arise in you
Change and alteration in Kasi and Kosala would mean an alteration in my life How could sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair not arise in me
It was with reference to this sire that the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened said Sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear
It is wonderful Mallika it is marvellous
Come Mallika give me the ablution water
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala rose from his seat and arranging his upper robe on one shoulder he extended his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and uttered this exclamation three times Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened 
Venerable sir happiness and joy are born from those who are dear arise from those who are dear

It is lovingkindness since it treats kindly in these eight aspects namely by rejecting in the case of all breathing things  and so on as in  substituting breathing things for beings   in the case of all who are    in the case of all persons    in the case of all who have a personality    in the case of all women    in the case of all men    in the case of all Noble Ones    in the case of all who are not Noble Ones    in the case of all deities   in the case of all human beings   in the case of all in states of deprivation

Bhikkhus there are these four foundations of mindfulness
What four
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body as a body ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world
He dwells contemplating feelings as feelings He dwells contemplating cognizance as cognizance He dwells contemplating ideas as ideas ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world
These are the four foundations of mindfulness 
How does he dwell contemplating the body as a body
Here someone contemplates the earth body as impermanent not as permanent as painful not as pleasant as not self not as self he becomes dispassionate does not delight he causes greed to fade away does not inflame it he causes cessation not arising he relinquishes does not grasp
When he contemplates as impermanent he abandons perception of permanence when he contemplates as painful he abandons perception of pleasure when he contemplates as not self he abandons perception of self when he becomes dispassionate he abandons delight when his greed fades away he abandons greed when he causes cessation he abandons arising when he relinquishes he abandons grasping cf TrI 
He contemplates the body in these seven aspects
The body is the establishment  but it is not the mindfulness
Mindfulness is both the establishment and the mindfulness
By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that body
Hence Development of the Foundation of Mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body is said cf TrIII 
Development there are four kinds of development development in the sense of nonexcess of ideas produced therein development in the sense of single function of the faculties development in the sense of effectiveness of the appropriate energy and development in the sense of repetition TrI 
Here someone contemplates the water body    the fire body    the air body    the headhair body    the bodyhair body    the outerskin body    the innerskin body    the flesh body    the blood body    the sinew body    the bone body    the bonemarrow body 
That is how he dwells contemplating the body as a bodycf I 
How does he dwell contemplating feelings as feelings
Here someone contemplates pleasant feeling as impermanent not as permanent
He contemplates feelings in these seven aspects
The feeling is the establishment  but it is not the mindfulness
Mindfulness is both the establishment and the mindfulness
By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that feeling
Hence Development of the Foundation of Mindfulness consisting in contemplation of feeling as feelings is said cf TrIII 
Development in the sense of repetition  Here someone contemplates painful feeling  Here someone contemplates neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling  in the sense of repetition
That is how he dwells contemplating feelings as feelings
How does he dwell contemplating cognizance as cognizance
Here someone contemplates greedy cognizance as impermanent not as permanent
Cognizance is the establishment  but it is not the mindfulness
Mindfulness is both the establishment and the mindfulness
By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that cognizance
Hence Development of the Foundation of Mindfulness consist ing in contemplation of cognizance as cognizance is said cf Ill 
Development in the sense of repetition
Here someone contemplates ungreedy cognizance    hating cognizance    unhating cognizance    deluded cognizance   undeluded cognizance    cramped cognizance     distracted cognizance    exalted cognizance    unexalted cognizance    surpassed cognizance    unsurpassed cognizance    concentrated cognizance   unconcentrated cognizance    liberated cognizance    unliberated cognizance    eye consciousness    ear consciousness    nose consciousness    tongue consciousness   body consciousness   mind consciousness   in the sense of repetition
That is how he dwells contemplating cognizance as cognizance
How does he dwell contemplating ideas as ideas
Here someone contemplates all ideas excluding the body excluding feeling and excluding cognizance as impermanent not as permanent he abandons grasping cfTrIII 
He contemplates ideas in these seven aspects
Ideas are the establishment but they are not the mindfulness
Mindfulness is both the establishment and the mindfulness
By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates those ideas
Hence Development of the Foundation of Mindfulness consisting in contemplating of ideas as ideas is said
Development in the sense of repetition
That is how he dwells contemplating ideas as ideas
End of Treatise on the foundations of mindfulness
 in the sense of repetition
he abandons grasping
He contemplates cognizance in these seven aspects
he abandons grasping
Thus I heard At one time the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthi in Jetas Grove Anāthapindikas Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
Venerable Sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu sees all formations as impermanent it is possible that he shall make a choice in conformity with actuality and making a choice in conformity with actuality it is possible that he shall enter upon the certainty of lightness and by entering upon the certainty of lightness it is possible that he shall realize the fruit of streamentry or the fruit of oncereturn or the fruit of nonreturn or the fruit of arahantship
Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu sees any formation as pleasant it is not possible that he shall make a choice in conformity and and so on as in  up to or the fruit of arahantship
Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu sees all formations as painful it is possible that he shall make a choice in conformity and and so on as in  up to or the fruit of arahantship
Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu sees any idea as self it is not possible that he shall make a choice in conformity and and so on as in  up to or the fruit of arahantship
Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu sees all ideas as not self it is possible that he shall make a choice in conformity and  and so on as in  up to or the fruit of arahantship
Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu sees nibbana as painful it is not possible that he shall make a choice in conformity and  and so on as in  up to or the fruit of arahantship
Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu sees nibbana as pleasant it is possible that he shall make a choice in conformity and  and so on as in  up to  or the fruit of arahantship 
In how many aspects does he choose in conformity with actuality In how many aspects does he enter upon the certainty of lightness
He chooses in conformity with actuality in forty aspects He enters upon the certainty of lightness in forty aspects
In what forty aspects does he choose in conformity In what forty aspects does he enter upon the certainty of lightness
He sees the five aggregates as impermanent as painful as a disease a boil a dart a calamity an affliction as alien as disintegrating as a plague a disaster a terror a menace as fickle perishable unenduring as no protection no shelter no refuge as empty vain void not self as a danger as subject to change as having no core as the root of calamity as murderous as due to be annihilated as subject to cankers as formed as Maras bait as connected with the idea of birth connected with the idea of ageing connected with the idea of illness connected with the idea of death connected with the idea of sorrow connected with the idea of lamentation connected with the idea of despair connected with the idea of defilement
Seeing the five aggregates as impermanent he chooses in conformity
Seeing the five aggregates as painful he chooses in conformity
 as a disease

As connected with the idea of defilement is contemplation of pain
In these forty aspects he chooses in conformity with actuality
In these forty aspects he enters upon the certainty of rightness
When he chooses in conformity with actuality in these forty aspects and enters upon the certainty of rightness in these forty aspects how many kinds of contemplation of impermanence how many kinds of contemplation of pain and how many kinds of contemplation of not self does he have
Five and twenty contemplations of not self And fifty contemplations of impermanence
End of Treatise on insight
Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu sees any formation as permanent it is not possible that he shall make a choice in conformity with actuality and without making a choice in conformity with actuality it is not possible that he shall enter upon the certainty of lightness and without entering upon the certainty of lightness it is not possible that he shall realize the fruit of streamentry or the fruit of oncereturn or the fruit of nonreturn or the fruit of arahantship
seeing how the cessation of the five aggregates is nibbana which is permanent he enters into the certainty of lightness
seeing how the cessation of the five aggregates is nibbana which is pleasant he enters upon the certainty of lightness

Herein what are the Threads Terms of Expression
 They are  Expression in terms of greed   hate  delusion  nongreed  nonhate  nondelusion  bodily action  verbal action  mental action  the faith faculty  energy faculty  mindfulness faculty  concentration faculty  understanding faculty
Herein what is that expressed in terms of greed
 With a man engrossed in thoughts And strong in lust and beauty seeing
Then grows his craving more and more The while he makes his bondage firm  
With a man engrossed in thoughts is lust for sensual desires
 And beauty seeing  is the object of the lust for sensual desires
 Then grows his craving more and more  is craving for sensual desires
 The while he makes his bondage firm  is lust In this way whatever the idea presented as the Root that idea alone should be taken up here  
for the Blessed One does not teach an idea other than the idea he is instigated by
Of someone who thinks sensualdesire thinking he demonstrates that same thinking by sensualdesire thinking
By  strong in lust  he demonstrates that same thinkings object
By and beauty seeing Then grows his craving more and more he demonstrates that same lust as craving for sensual desires
By  The while he makes his bondage firm he demonstrates that same lust as the fetter of craving
That is how it should be assessed in the case of verses
Herein the Blessed One demonstrates a single idea in three ways as to Outcome as to Cause and as to Fruit 
For example When giving a man is dear and many frequent him The name he gets is goad his fame increases
He enters an assembly undismayed  A man intrepid without avarice 
When giving any gift which is the ground for making merit consisting in giving
this is the Cause herein 
many frequent him  and thatwith the words good name  a good name spreads abroad in the world and that he is dear and agreeable to many people
That on the dissolution of the body he reappears among the gods is the Fruit
This is expressed in terms of greed
Herein what is that expressed in terms of hate
Someone who kills a breathing thing Who speaks false speech
 Someone who kills a breathing thing   one who is affected by hate kills a breathing thing
 Who speaks false speech  also one who speaks false speech owing to vexation by hate
 Who has the habit to indulge In drinking spirituous liquor   there is a source for hate
Unless he these five risks abandons refers to the transgression  of the five training precepts  and this is a description of them when they are all hateborn  And this idea too can be demonstrated as to cause as to outcome and as to fruit
 
Herein that he is aggressive by body or by speech this is his state of a doer of the ill done 
And that he intends the mental misconduct consisting in illwill this is his  state of a  cogitator of the illcogitated 
Since he is possessed of these fools characteristics he exists with the three types of pain and grief correspondingly born therefrom And when he has gone to a meeting or gone to an assembly he talks the type of talk born therefrom
And when this tenfold course of unprofitable action  beginning with killing breathing things comes into being with that as source he experiences pain and grief
Furthermore when he sees a felon who has offended the king  arrested by the king and put to death then it occurs to him  If the king knew  about me he might have me put to death too   and with that as source he experiences pain and grief
Furthermore  with that as source he experiences pain and grief  Accordingly the fools characteristic is the cause
the three corresponding kinds of pain born therefrom are the outcome
Herein what is that expressed in terms of delusion
He who is pursuing the roundabout of births which has no recognizable end  has ignorance for his cause
And the purposes of determinativeacts have ignorance for their condition That the unseeing of the Buddhas word is ignorance is demonstrated in the Thread too
And in so far as he who is ignorant treats  determinations as self and allows the five views  in regard to the five categories thus
  this Thread is consequently presented under ignorance
Now the Master  presents it thus in the Thread under ignorance
And so there must only be demonstrated there the unshared idea by which he demonstrates it
not any other 
 and the rest of the four Truths in detail  Now the nonunderstanding herein is suffering this is the outcome 
When not understanding he determines  the various kinds of determinations this is the cause 
In so far as he misapprehends the type of views thus  this too is the outcome
The renewal of being that he generates is the fruit
And so this idea too is demonstrated as to cause as to fruit and as to outcome
But here in the case of these three some ideas that is fruit and outcome may appear shared in common
and then only  the cause as a beginning will be presented in a Thread
How would that be  For example 
Herein when someone goes a bad way through will and goes a bad way through fear this is the unprofitable root greed 
Thus these three unprofitable roots should be regarded as only a beginning that is as cause
likewise two likewise  three  for when not presented as a beginning  no cause or outcome or fruit can be demonstrated
And the verse here is this 
Herein will and fear  are greed as demonstrated above
This is expressed in terms of delusion
Herein what is that expressed in terms of nongreed 
 Who contemplating ugliness Abides with faculties restrained
Herein the scrutiny of ugliness is the giving up of gratification through perception of beauty by seeing the disappointment in sensual desires
That he has restrained his faculties is the fulfilment  of that same nongreed by not assuming any grieving for those sensual desires regarded as mine 
So when this nongreed is remembered as the basis for the state of a contemplator of ugliness that nongreed is a cause
When remembered as the province of guardedness in the faculty doors and when remembered besides as that of the state of knowing the right amount in eating then this is the outcome
That  Him Miira sure no more can shake Than can the wind a rocky peak is the fruit
So it is the same idea presented in the beginning that is also in the middle and the end 
 Bhikkhusfor the nonarising of unarisen will for sensual desires for the abandoning of arisen will for sensual desires I see no idea other than the sign of ugliness
Herein in one wlio gives the sign of ugliness attention the unarisen will for sensual desires  does not arise and the arisen is abandoned  
But in so far as it is only unarisen lust for sensual desires that is gripped in this way the fruit has both lust for form and lust for the formless
So this idea too has been demonstrated as to cause as to outcome and as to fruit
This is expressed in terms of nongreed
Herein what is that expressed in terms of nonhate
 Should a man with no hate  in liis heart kindlylove One breathing thing only by that he is skilled
But when he feels pity for all breathing things He has infinite scope in the merit he makes 
Should a man with no hate  in his heart kindlylove One breathing thing only  this nonhate
is gratification through counteraction  By that he is skilled   it is owing to his being associated with that skilful idea that he comes under the description in terms of ideas
 He has infinite scope in the merit he makes   the ripening of that is ripening only of the kind of action belonging to the worlds not of that dissociated from worlds
Herein the kindlyloving is the cause
The great merit he produces extending as far as the plane of nonillwill  does is the fruit
So in the case of nonhate too  it has been demonstrated as to cause as to outcome and as to fruit
 
Herein the  heartdeliverance of lovingkindness  which in the ideas of the Noble Ones is the  is the cause on the plane belonging to the worlds That he  these eleven ideas are the outcome
And that he arises in the body of the Retinue of High Divinity as One Who Has Not Yet Done 
This is expressed in terms of nonhate
Herein what is that expressed in terms of nondelusion
 Best  is understanding is the basis  for nondelusion
 The kind that deals with penetration  is the kind that deals with extinction since  it penetrates how things are
 The kind that rightly understands The exhaustion of birth and death  is nondelusion
The understanding is the cause
That he understands is the outcome
The exhaustion of birth and death is the fruit
So non delusion has been demonstrated by cause by outcome and by fruit
 
Herein what is the Ishallcometoknowfinallytheasyetnotfinallyknown faculty
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu arouses will for the actualizing of the as yet unactualized Noble Truth of Suffering and he makes efforts instigates energy exerts his cognizance and endeavours   
Herein what is the actoffinalknowing faculty
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu understands how it is that  This is Suffering  down to  the Path  This is actoffinalknowing faculty  
Likewise here as in   the understanding is the cause
That he arouses will and makes efforts and that  he understands is the outcome
That whereby there is entire exhaustion  of taints is the cause That knowledge of exhaustion arises and also knowledge of nonarising is the outcome
The Arahantship is the fruit
Herein the words Birth is exhausted for me the divine life has been lived out done is what was to be done  refer to knowledge of exhaustion
These are the three faculties So nondelusion too has been demonstrated as to cause as to outcome and as to fruit This is expressed in termns of nondelusion
These have been demonstrated by unshared quotations 
Herein what are those where the profitable roots are shared
Herein what is the root of the profitable
Herein what is the profitable
Herein the three roots of the profitable are the cause
Herein the nonhate is the cause
