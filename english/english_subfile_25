It can originate only out of itself ieit must have already existed in the bud or germ as it wereTo be sure besides this cause or rootcondition or seed there are still many minor conditions required for its actual arising and its development just as the mango tree besides its main cause the seed requires for its germinating growth and development such further conditions as earth water light heat etcThus the true cause of the birth of a being together with its character and destiny goes back to the kammavolitions produced in a former birthAccording to Buddhism there are three factors necessary for the rebirth of a human being that is for the formation of the embryo in the mothers wombThey are the female ovum the male sperm and the karmaenergy which in the Suttas is metaphorically called gandhabba ieghost or soul This kammaenergy is sent forth by a dying individual at the moment of his deathThe father and mother only provide the necessary physical material for the formation of the embryonic bodyWith regard to the characteristic features the tendencies and faculties lying latent in the embryo the Buddhas teaching may be explained in the following way The dying individual with his whole being convulsively clinging to life at the very moment of his death sends forth kammic energies which like a flash of lightning hit at a new mothers womb ready for conceptionThus through the impinging of the kammaenergies on ovum and sperm there appears just as a precipitate the socalled primary cellThis process may be compared with the functioning of the airvibrations produced through speech which by impinging on the acoustic organ of another man produce a sound which is a purely subjective sensationOn this occasion no transmigration of a soundsensation takes place but simply a transference of energy called the air vibrationsIn a similar way the kammaenergies sent out by the dying individual produce from the material furnished by the parents the new embryonic beingBut no transmigration of a real being or a soulentity takes place on that occasion but simply the transmission of kammaenergyHence we may say that the present lifeprocess is the objectification of the corresponding prenatal kammaprocess and that the future lifeprocess is the objectification of the corresponding present kammaprocessThus nothing transmigrates from one life to the nextAnd what we call our ego is in reality only this process of continual change of continual arising and passing awayThus follows moment after moment day after day year after year life after lifeJust as the wave that apparently hastens over the surface of the pond is in reality nothing but a continuous rising and falling of ever new masses of water each time called forth through the transmission of energy even so closely considered in the ultimate sense there is no permanent egoentity that passes through the ocean of Samsara but merely a process of physical and psychical phenomena takes place ever and again being whipped up by the impulse and will for lifeIt is undoubtedly true that the mental condition of the parents at the moment of conception has a considerable influence upon the character of the embryonic being and that the nature of the mother may make a deep impression on the character of the child she bears in her wombThe indivisible unity of the psychic individuality of the child however can in no way be produced by the parentsOne must here never confound the actual cause  the preceding state out of which the later state arises  with the influences and conditions from withoutIf it were really the case that the new individual as an inseparable whole was begotten by its parents twins could never exhibit totally opposite tendenciesIn such a case children especially twins would with positively no exception always be found to possess the same character as the parentsAt all times and in probably all the countries on earth the belief in rebirth has been held by many people and this belief seems to be due to an intuitional instinct that lies dormant in all beingsAt all times many great thinkers too have taught a continuation of life after deathAlready from time immemorial there was taught some form of metempsychosis ietransformation of soul or metamorphosis ietransformation of body etc thus by the esoteric doctrines of old Egypt by Pythagoras Empedocles Plato Plotinus Pindaros Vergil also by some African tribesMany modern thinkers too teach a continuation of the lifeprocess after deathThe great German scientist Edgar Dacque in his book The Primeval World Saga and Mankind speaking about the widespread belief shared by all peoples of the world in a transmigration after death gives the following warningPeoples with culture and acquaintance with science such as the old Egyptians and wise Indians acted and lived in accordance with this beliefThey lost this belief only after the rise of the naively realistic and rationalistic Hellenism and JudaismFor this reason it would be better concerning this problem not to assume the bloodless attitude of modern shamcivilization but rather adopt a reverential attitude in trying to solve this problem and grasp it in its profundityThis law of rebirth can be made comprehensible only by the subconscious lifestream which is mentioned in the Abhidhamma Pitaka and further explained in the commentaries especially the VisuddhimaggaThe fundamental import of bhavangasota or the subconscious lifestream as a working hypothesis for the explanation of the various Buddhist doctrines such as rebirth kamma remembrance of former births etc has up to now not yet sufficiently been recognized or understood by Western scholarsThe term bhavangasota is identical with what the modern psychologists such as Jung etc call the soul or the unconscious thereby not meaning of course the eternal soulentity of Christian teaching but an everchanging subconscious processThis subconscious lifestream is the necessary condition of all lifeIn it all impressions and experiences are stored up or better said appear as a multiple process of past images or memory pictures which however as such are hidden to full consciousness but which especially in dreams cross the threshold of consciousness and make themselves fully consciousProfessor James says Many achievements of genius have here their beginningIn conversion mystical experience and as prayer it cooperates with religious lifeIt contains all momentarily inactive reminiscences and sources of all our dimly motivated passions impulses intuitions hypotheses fancies superstitions in short all our nonrational operations result therefromIt is the source of dreams etcJung in his Soul Problems of the Present Day says From the living source of instinct springs forth everything creative And in another place Whatever has been created by the human mind results from contents which were really unconscious germs And The term instinct is of course nothing but a collective term for all possible organic and psychic factors whose nature is for the greater part unknown to usThe existence of the subconscious lifestream or bhavangasota is a necessary postulate of our thinkingIf whatever we have seen heard felt perceived thought experienced and done were not without exception registered somewhere and in some way either in the extremely complex nervous system or in the subconscious or unconscious we would not even be able to remember what we were thinking at the preceding moment we would not know anything of the existence of other beings and things we would not know our parents teachers friends and so on we would not even be able to think at all as thinking is conditioned by the remembrance of former experiences and our mind would be a complete tabula rasa and emptier than the actual mind of an infant just born nay even of the embryo in the mothers wombThus this subconscious lifestream or bhavangasota can be called the precipitate of all our former actions and experiences which must have been going on since time immemorial and must continue for still immeasurable periods of time to comeTherefore what constitutes the true and innermost nature of man or any other being is this subconscious lifestream of which we do not know whence it came and whither it will goAs Heraclitus says We never enter the same streamWe are identical with it and we are not Just so it is said in the Milindapañha na ca so na ca añño neither is it the same nor is it another All life be it corporeal conscious or subconscious is a flowing a continual process of becoming change and transformationNo persistent element is there to be discovered in this processHence there is no permanent ego or personality to be found but merely these transitory phenomenaAbout this unreality of the ego the Hungarian psychologist Volgyesi in his Message to the Nervous World saysUnder the influence of the newest knowledge the psychologists already begin to realize the truth about the delusive nature of the egoentity the mere relative value of the egofeeling the great dependency of this tiny man on the inexhaustible and complex working factors of the whole world The idea of an independent ego and of a selfreliant free will these ideas we should give up and reconcile ourselves to the truth that there does not exist any real ego at allWhat we take for our egofeeling is in reality nothing but one of the most wonderful fatamorgana plays of natureIn the ultimate sense there do not even exist such things as mental states iestationary thingsFeeling perception consciousness etc are in reality mere passing processes of feeling perceiving becoming conscious etc within which and outside of which no separate or permanent entity lies hiddenThus a real understanding of the Buddhas doctrine of kamma and rebirth is possible only to one who has caught a glimpse of the egoless nature or anattata and of the conditionality or idappaccayata of all phenomena of existenceTherefore it is said in the VisuddhimaggaEverywhere in all the realms of existence the noble disciple sees only mental and corporeal phenomena kept going through the concatenation of causes and effectsNo producer of the volitional act or kamma does he see apart from the kamma no recipient of the kammaresult apart from the resultAnd he is well aware that wise men are using merely conventional language when with regard to a kammical act they speak of a doer or with regard to a kammaresult they speak of the recipient of the resultIn the Milindapañha the King asks NagasenaWhat is it Venerable Sir that will be rebornA psychophysical combination O KingBut how Venerable SirIs it the same psychophysical combination as this present oneNo O KingBut the present psychophysical combination produces kammically wholesome and unwholesome volitional activities and through such kamma a new psychophysical combination will be bornAs in the ultimate sense there is no such thing as a real egoentity or personality one cannot properly speak of the rebirth of such a oneWhat we are here concerned with is this psychophysical process which is cut off at death in order to continue immediately thereafter somewhere elseSimilarly we read in the MilindapañhaDoes Venerable Sir rebirth take place without transmigrationYes O KingBut how Venerable Sir can rebirth take place without the passing over of anythingPlease illustrate this matter for meIf O King a man should light a lamp with the help of another lamp does the light of the one lamp pass over to the other lampNo Venerable SirJust so O King does rebirth take place without transmigrationFurther in the Visuddhimagga it is saidWhosoever has no clear idea about death and does not know that death consists in the dissolution of the five groups of existence he thinks that it is a person or being that dies and transmigrates to a new body etcAnd whosoever has no clear idea about rebirth and does not know that rebirth consists in the arising of the five groups of existence he thinks that it is a person or being that is reborn or that the person reappears in a new bodyAnd whosoever has no clear idea about Samsara the round of rebirths he thinks that a real person wanders from this world to another world comes from that world to this world etcAnd whosoever has no clear idea about the phenomena of existence he thinks that the phenomena are his ego or something appertaining to the ego or something permanent joyful or pleasantAnd whosoever has no clear idea about the conditional arising of the phenomena of existence and about the arising of kammic volitions conditioned through ignorance he thinks that it is the ego that understands or fails to understand that acts or causes to act that enters into a new existence at rebirthOr he thinks that the atoms or the Creator etc with the help of the embryonic process shape the body provide it with various faculties that it is the ego that receives the sensuous impression that feels that desires that becomes attached that enters into existence again in another worldOr he thinks that all beings come to life through fate or chanceWhen this conditionally arisen bodilymental phenomenon arises one says that it has entered into existenceHowever no being or lifeprinciple has transmigrated from the previous existence into this existence and yet this embryo could not have come into existence without a previous causeThis fact may be compared with the reflection of ones face in the mirror or with the calling forth of an echo by ones voiceNow just as the image in the mirror or the echo are produced by ones face or voice without any passing over of face or voice just so it is with the arising of rebirthconsciousnessShould there exist a full identity or sameness between the earlier and the later birth in that case milk could never turn into curd and should there exist an entire otherness curd could never be conditioned through milkTherefore one should admit neither a full identity nor an entire otherness of the different stages of existenceHence na ca so na ca añño neither is it the same nor is it another one As already said above all life be it corporeal conscious or subconscious is a flowing a continual process of becoming change and transformationTo sum up the foregoing we may say There are in the ultimate sense no real beings or things neither creators nor created there is but this process of corporeal and mental phenomenaThis whole process of existence has an active side and a passive sideThe active or causal side of existence consists of the kammaprocess ieof wholesome and unwholesome kammaactivity while the passive or caused side consists of kammaresults or vipaka the socalled rebirthprocess iethe arising growing decaying and passing away of all these kammically neutral phenomena of existenceThus in the absolute sense there exists no real being that wanders through this round of rebirths but merely this everchanging twofold process of kammaactivities and kammaresults takes placeThe present life is as it were the reflection of the past one and the future life the reflection of the present oneThe present life is the result of the past kammic activity and the future life the result of the present kammic activityTherefore nowhere is there to be found an egoentity that could be the performer of the kammic activity or the recipient of the kammaresultHence Buddhism does not teach any real transmigration as in the highest sense there is no such thing as a being or egoentity much less the transmigration of such a oneIn every person as already mentioned there seems to lie dormant the dim instinctive feeling that death cannot be the end of all things but that somehow continuation must followIn which way this may be however is not immediately clearIt is perhaps quite true that a direct proof for rebirth cannot be givenWe have however the authentic reports about children in Burma and elsewhere who sometimes are able to remember quite distinctly events of their previous lifeBy the way what we see in dreams are mostly distorted reflexes of real things and happenings experienced in this or a previous lifeAnd how could we ever explain the birth of such prodigies as Jeremy Bentham who already in his fourth year could read and write Latin and Greek or John Stuart Mill who at the age of three read Greek and at the age of six wrote a history of Rome or Babington Macaulay who in his sixth year wrote a compendium of world history or Beethoven who gave public concerts when he was seven or Mozart who already before his sixth year had written musical compositions or Voltaire who read the fables of Lafontaine when he was three years oldShould all these prodigies and geniuses who for the most part came from illiterate parents not already in previous births have laid the foundations to their extraordinary facultiesNatura non facit saltus nature makes no leapsWe may rightly state that the Buddhist doctrine of kamma and rebirth offers the only plausible explanation for all the variations and dissimilarities in natureFrom the apple seed only an apple tree may come no mango tree from a mango seed only a mango tree no apple treeJust so all animate things as man animal etc probably even plants nay even crystals must of necessity be manifestations or objectifications of some specific kind of subconscious impulse or will for lifeBuddhism says nothing on the lastmentioned points it simply states that all vegetable life belongs to the germinal order or bijaniyamaBuddhism teaches that if in previous births the bodily verbal and mental kamma or volitional activities have been evil and low and thus have unfavorably influenced the subconscious lifestream then also the results manifested in the present life must be disagreeable and evil and so must be the character and the new actions induced or conditioned through the evil pictures and images of the subconscious lifestreamIf the beings however have in former lives sown good seeds then they will reap good fruits in the present lifeIn Majjhima Nikaya a brahman raises the problemThere are found people who are shortlived and those that are longlived there are found people who are very sick and those that are healthy there are found people who are hideous and those that are beautiful there are found people who are powerless and those that are powerful there are found people who are poor and those that are rich there are found people who are of low family and those that are of high family there are found people who are stupid and those that are intelligentWhat then Master Gotama is the reason that among human beings such inferiority and superiority are foundThe Blessed One gave the replyBeings are owners of their kamma heirs of their kamma kamma is the womb from which they have sprung kamma is their friend and refugeThus kamma divides beings into the high and lowIn Anguttara Nikaya III it is said Killing stealing adultery lying backbiting harsh speech and empty prattling practiced cultivated and frequently engaged in will lead to hell the animal world or the realm of ghosts Further Whoso kills and is cruel will either go to hell or if reborn as a human will be shortlivedWhoso tortures other beings will be afflicted with diseaseThe hater will be hideous the envious will be without influence the stubborn will be of low rank the indolent will be ignorant In the reverse case a person will be reborn in a heavenly world or if reborn as a human being will be endowed with health beauty influence riches noble rank and intelligenceGeorge Grimm in his book The Doctrine of the Buddha tries to show how the law of affinity may at the moment of death regulate the grasping of the new germHe saysWhoso devoid of compassion can kill men or even animals carries deep within himself the inclination to shorten lifeHe finds satisfaction or even pleasure in the shortlivedness of other creaturesShortlived germs have therefore some affinity for him an affinity which makes itself known after his death in the grasping of another germ which then takes place to his own detrimentEven so germs bearing within themselves the power of developing into a deformed body have an affinity for one who finds pleasure in illtreating and disfiguring otherAny angry person begets within himself an affinity for ugly bodies and their respective germs since it is the characteristic mark of anger to disfigure the faceWhoever is jealous niggardly haughty carries within himself the tendency to grudge everything to others and to despise themAccordingly germs that are destined to develop in poor outward circumstances possess affinity for himHere I should like to rectify several wrong applications of the term kamma prevailing in the West and to state once for all Pali kamma comes from the root kar to do to make to act and thus means deed action etcAs a Buddhist technical term kamma is a name for wholesome and unwholesome volition or will and the consciousness and mental factors associated therewith manifested as bodily verbal or mere mental actionAlready in the Suttas it is said Volition monks do I call kammaThrough volition one does the kamma by means of body speech or mindThus kamma is volitional action nothing more nothing lessFrom this fact result the following three statementsThe term kamma never comprises the result of action as most people in the West misled by Theosophy wish this term to be understoodKamma is wholesome or unwholesome volitional action and kammavipaka is the result of actionThere are some who consider every happening even our new wholesome and unwholesome actions as the result of our prenatal kammaIn other words they believe that the results again become the causes of new results and so ad infinitumThus they are stamping Buddhism as fatalism and they will have to come to the conclusion that in this case our destiny can never be influenced or changed and no deliverance ever be attainedThere is a third wrong application of the term kamma being an amplification of the first view iethat the term kamma comprises also the result of actionIt is the assumption of a socalled joint kamma masskamma or groupkamma or collective kammaAccording to this view a group of people ega nation should be responsible for the bad deeds formerly done by this socalled same peopleIn reality however this present people may not consist at all of the same individuals who did these bad deedsAccording to Buddhism it is of course quite true that anybody who suffers bodily suffers for his past or present bad deedsThus also each of those individuals born within that suffering nation must if actually suffering bodily have done evil somewhere here or in one of the innumerable spheres of existence but he may not have had anything to do with the bad deeds of the socalled nationWe might say that through his evil kamma he was attracted to the hellish condition befitting himIn short the term kamma applies in each instance only to wholesome and unwholesome volitional activity of the single individualKamma thus forms the cause or seed from which the results will accrue to the individual be it in this life or hereafterHence man has it in his power to shape his future destiny by means of his will and actionsIt depends on his actions or kamma whether his destiny will lead him up or down either to happiness or to miseryMoreover kamma is the cause and seed not only for the continuation of the lifeprocess after death iefor the socalled rebirth but already in this present lifeprocess our actions or kamma may produce good and bad results and exercise a decisive influence on our present character and destinyThus for instance if day by day we are practicing kindness towards all living beings humans as well as animals we will grow in goodness while hatred and all evil actions done through hatred as well as all the evil and agonizing mental states produced thereby will not so easily rise again in us and our nature and character will become firm happy peaceful and calmIf we practice unselfishness and liberality greed and avarice will become lessIf we practice love and kindness anger and hatred will vanishIf we develop wisdom and knowledge ignorance and delusion will more and more disappearThe less greed hatred and ignorance dwell in our hearts the less will we commit evil and unwholesome actions of body speech and mindFor all evil things and all evil destiny are really rooted in greed hate and ignorance and of these three things ignorance or delusion is the chief root and the primary cause of all evil and misery in the worldIf there is no more ignorance there will be no more greed and hatred no more rebirth no more sufferingThis goal however in the ultimate sense will be realized only by the Holy Ones ieby those who forever and all time are freed from these three roots and this is accomplished through the penetrating insight or vipassana into the impermanency unsatisfactoriness and egolessness of this whole lifeprocess and through the detachment from all forms of existence resulting therefromAs soon as greed hate and ignorance have become fully and forever extinguished and thereby the will for life convulsively clinging to existence and the thirsting for life have come to an end then there will be no more rebirth and there will have been realized the goal shown by the Enlightened One namely extinction of all rebirth and sufferingThus the Arahant performs no more kamma ieno more kammically wholesome or unwholesome volitional actionsHe is freed from this lifeaffirming will expressed in bodily actions words or thoughts freed from this seed or cause of all existence and lifeNow what is called character is in reality the sum of these subconscious tendencies produced partly by the prenatal partly by the present volitional activity or kammaAnd these tendencies may during life become an inducement to wholesome or unwholesome volitional activity by body speech or mindIf however this thirst for life rooted in ignorance is fully extinguished then there will be no new entering again into existenceOnce the root of a coconut tree has been fully destroyed the tree will die offIn exactly the same way there will be no entering again into a new existence once the lifeaffirming three evil roots  greed hate and ignorance  have been forever destroyedHere one should not forget that all such personal expressions as I He Holy One etc are merely conventional names for this really impersonal lifeprocessIn this connection I have to state that according to Buddhism it is merely the last kammical volition just before death the socalled deathproximate kamma that decides the immediately following rebirthIn Buddhist countries it is therefore the custom to recall to the dying mans memory the good actions performed by him in order to rouse in him a happy and pure kammical state of mind as a preparation for a favorable rebirthOr his relations let him see beautiful things which they for his good and benefit wish to offer to the Buddha saying This my dear we shall offer to the Buddha for your good and welfare Or they let him hear a religious sermon or let him smell the odor of flowers or give him sweets to taste or let him touch precious cloth saying This we shall offer to the Buddha for your own good and welfareIn the Visuddhimagga it is said that at the moment before death as a rule there will appear to the memory of the evildoer the mental image of any evil deed kamma formerly done or that there will appear before his mental eyes an attendant circumstance or object called kammanimitta connected with that bad deed such as blood or a bloodstained dagger etc or he may see before his mind an indication of his imminent miserable rebirth gatinimitta such as fiery flames etcTo another dying man there may appear before his mind the image of a voluptuous object inciting his sensual lustTo a good man there may appear before his mind any noble deed kamma formerly done by him or an object that was present at that time the socalled kammanimitta or he may see in his mind an indication of his imminent rebirth gatinimitta such as heavenly palaces etcAlready in the Suttas there are distinguished three kinds of kamma or volitional actions with regard to the time of their bearing fruit namely kamma bearing fruit in this lifetime kamma bearing fruit in the next life kamma bearing fruit in later livesThe explanations of this subject are somewhat too technical for the general readerThey imply the following The kammavolitional stage of the process in mind consists of a number of impulsive thought moments or javanacitta which flash up one after the other in rapid successionNow of these impulsive moments the first one will bear fruit in this lifetime the last one in the next birth and those between these two moments will bear fruit in later livesThe two kinds of kamma bearing fruit in this lifetime and in the next birth may sometimes become ineffectiveKamma however that bears fruit in later lives will whenever and wherever there is an opportunity be productive of kammaresult and as long as this lifeprocess continues this kamma will never become ineffectiveThe Visuddhimagga divides kamma according to its functions into four kinds generative kamma supportive kamma counteractive kamma and destructive kamma which all may be either wholesome or unwholesomeAmongst these four kinds the generative generates at rebirth and during the succeeding lifecontinuity corporeal and neutral mental phenomena such as the five kinds of senseconsciousness and the mental factors associated therewith such as feeling perception senseimpression etcThe supportive however does not generate any kammaresult but as soon as any other kammavolition has effected rebirth and a kammaresult been produced then it supports according to its nature the agreeable or disagreeable phenomena and keeps them goingThe counteractive also does not generate any kammaresult but as soon as any other kammavolition has effected rebirth and a kammaresult been produced then it counteracts according to its nature the agreeable or disagreeable phenomena and does not allow them to keep going onAgain the destructive does not generate any kammaresult but as soon as any other kammavolition has effected rebirth and a kammaresult been produced then it destroys the weaker kamma and admits only its own agreeable or disagreeable kammaresultsIn the Commentary to Majjhima Nikaya generative kamma is compared with a farmer sowing the seeds supportive kamma with irrigating manuring and watching the field etc counteractive kammawith the drought that causes a poor harvest destructive kamma with a fire that destroys the whole harvestAnother illustration is this The rebirth of Devadatta in a royal family was due to his good generative kammaHis becoming a monk and attaining high spiritual powers was a good supportive kammaHis intention of killing the Buddha was a counteractive kamma while his causing a split in the Order of monks was destructive kamma owing to which he was born in a world of miseryIt lies outside the scope of this short exposition to give detailed descriptions of all the manifold divisions of kamma found in the CommentariesWhat I chiefly wanted to make clear by this lecture is that the Buddhist doctrine of rebirth has nothing to do with the transmigration of any soul or egoentity as in the ultimate sense there does not exist any such ego or I but merely a continually changing process of psychic and corporeal phenomenaAnd further I wanted to point out that the kammaprocess and rebirthprocess may both be made comprehensible only by the assumption of a subconscious stream of life underlying everything in living natureIt is rather with some hesitation that I dare to speak to you on that profoundest of all Buddhist doctrines paticcasamuppada dependent origination that is to say the conditional arising of all those mental and physical phenomena generally summed up by the conventional names living being or individual or person Thus being well aware of the great difficulty of speaking on this most intricate subject before an audience perhaps only little acquainted with Buddhist philosophy I shall try my utmost to avoid as far as possible all the highly technical or confusing detailsI shall use very plain and simple language so that any one of you may be able to follow my explanationsAt the same time I shall not lose sight of the real goal and purpose for which the Buddha taught this doctrine to the worldThus I would beg you to listen carefully and give my words full and undivided attentionAnd I further beg you to try to retain in mind those very few technical terms in Pali and English which in the course of my talk I shall be repeatedly usingYou may not be aware that up to this day the real significance and purpose of paticcasamuppada are practically unknown to Western scholarsBy this however I do not mean to say that nobody in the West has ever written or spoken on this doctrineNo quite the contrary is the caseFor there is no other Buddhist doctrine about which Western scholars and wouldbe scholars have written and discussed so much  but understood so little  as just this doctrine of paticcasamuppadaIf you wish to get a fair idea of those mostly absurd and immature speculations and fanciful interpretations often based on mere imagination you may read the Appendix to my Guide through the Abhidhamma PitakaIt seems that scarcely one of those Western authors and lecturers has ever put to himself the question for what earthly reason the Buddha ever should have thought it necessary to teach such a doctrineIt was surely not for the sake of mental gymnastics and dialecticsNo quite to the contraryFor paticcasamuppada shows the causes and conditions of all the suffering in the world and how through the removal of these conditions suffering may rise no more in the futurePSin fact shows that our present existence with all its woe and suffering is conditioned or more exactly said caused by the lifeaffirming volitions or kamma in a former life and that again our future life depends on the present lifeaffirming volitions or kamma and that without these lifeaffirming volitions no more future rebirth will take place and that thereby deliverance will have been found from the round of rebirths from the restless cycle of SamsaraAnd this is the final goal and purpose of the Buddhas message namely deliverance from rebirth and sufferingI think that after what you have heard just now it will not be necessary to tell you that PSis not intended as various scholars in the West have imagined as an explanation of the primary beginning of all things and that its first link avijja or ignorance is not to be considered the causeless first principle out of which in the course of time all physical and conscious life has evolvedPSsimply teaches the conditionality or dependent nature of all the manifold mental and physical phenomena of existence of everything that happens be it in the realm of the physical or the mentalPSshows that the sum of mental and physical phenomena known by the conventional name person or individual is not at all the mere play of blind chance but that each phenomenon in this process of existence is entirely dependent upon other phenomena as conditions and that therefore with the removal of those phenomena that form the conditions for rebirth and suffering rebirth and therewith all suffering will necessarily cease and come to an endAnd this as already stated is the vital point and goal of the Buddhas teaching deliverance from the cycle of rebirth with all its woe and sufferingThus PSserves in the elucidation of the second and third noble truths about the origin and extinction of suffering by explaining these two truths from their very foundations upwards and giving them a fixed philosophical formIn the discourses of the Buddha PSis usually expounded by way of twelve links arranged in eleven propositionsThey are as followsOur first proposition was Avijjapaccaya sankhara Through ignorance the kammaformations are conditionedAvijja also called moha is delusion infatuation regarding fleeting things as permanent miserable things as enjoyment and egoless things as a self or egoAvijja is ignorance not understanding that all our existence is merely an everchanging process of mental and physical phenomena it is not understanding that these phenomena in the ultimate sense do not form any real permanent entity or person or ego and that there does not exist any permanent entity in or behind these fleeting physical and mental phenomena that therefore what we call I or you or he or person or Buddha etc does not in the ultimate sense possess any reality apart from these everchanging physical and mental phenomena of existenceAvijja or moha is the primary rootcondition underlying all moral defilement and depravityIn avijja are rooted all the greed hatred conceit envy and misery in the worldAnd the overcoming and extinction of avijja and therewith of all evil and misery is the final aim of the Buddhas teaching the ideal for any true BuddhistAnd it is for these reasons that avijja is mentioned first in the formula of PSBy sankhara litformations are here meant the rebirthproducing kammically unwholesome or wholesome volitions or volitional activitiesLet us therefore remember sankhara as kammaformations or simply as kammaNow all such evil volitions manifested by body speech or mind as above alluded to are called akusala or unwholesome kammaformations as they bring unhappy results here and in the afterlifeKusala or wholesome kammaformations however are such volitions or cetana as will bring happy and pleasant results here and in the afterlifeBut even these wholesome kammaformations are still conditioned and influenced by avijja as otherwise they would not produce future rebirthAnd there is only one individual who no longer performs any wholesome or unwholesome kammaformation any lifeaffirming kammaIt is the Arahant the holy and fully enlightened disciple of the BuddhaFor through deep insight into the true nature of this empty and evanescent process of existence he has become utterly detached from life and he is forever freed from ignorance together with all its evil consequences freed from any further rebirthAvijja is to all unwholesome kammaformations or volitional activities an indispensable condition by way of its presence and simultaneous arisingFor example whenever an evil manifestation of will an evil kammaformation arises at that very same moment its arising is conditioned through the simultaneous arising and presence of avijjaWithout the coarising of avijja there is no evil kammaformationWhen for example an infatuated man filled with greed or anger commits various evil deeds by body speech or mind at that time these evil kammaformations are all entirely conditioned through the coarising and presence of avijja or ignoranceThus if there is no avijja there are no evil kammaformationsTherefore it is said that avijja is to its associated kammaformations a condition by way of conascence or simultaneous arisingFurther as there is no evil kammaformation without the presence of avijja and no avijja without the presence of evil kammaformations therefore both are at any time and under all circumstances also mutual conditions to each other and thus avijja and the evil kammaformations are inseparableIn so far as avijja is an everpresent root of all evil kammaformations we say that avijja is to the unwholesome kammaformations an indispensable condition by way of rootBut there is still another and entirely different way in which avijja may be a condition to unwholesome kammaformations that is as inducementFor example if a man being filled with greed or anger is induced by his infatuation and delusive thoughts to commit various crimes such as murder theft adultery etc in that case avijja is the direct inducement and driving power for the subsequent arising of all those bad manifestations of will ieof all those unwholesome kammaformationsIn other words those bad unwholesome kammaformations are conditioned by a preceding state of avijja as a direct inducementThere is still another way in which avijja may become an inducement to unwholesome kammaformations namely as object of thinkingSuppose somebody remembers some evil and foolish pleasure once enjoyed by him and while he is pondering over that former foolish state he finds delight in it and becomes again filled with infatuation and greed for it or he becomes sad and despondent that he cannot enjoy it any moreIn consequence of wrongly brooding over such a foolish object over such a state of ignorance many evil unwholesome states arise in his mindIn such a way avijja may be to unwholesome kammaformations a condition by way of inducement as objectHere I have to point out that for a detailed understanding of PS we should have to know at least something about those twentyfour different modes in which mental or physical phenomena may be the condition to other mental and physical phenomenaThe entire Patthana the last book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka which fills six bulky volumes treats exclusively of these twentyfour conditions or paccaya which it first describes and then applies to all the innumerable mental and physical phenomena of existenceHere we shall consider only those most prominent ones which we have already alluded to and applied to avijja namely hetupaccaya root condition sahajatapaccaya condition by way of conascence iecoarising aññamaññapaccaya condition by way of mutuality upanissayapaccaya condition by way of either direct inducement or inducement through objectHere it may be mentioned that all these translations of technical Pali terms are only very inadequate makeshifts and should be taken as suchI am therefore giving those technical terms repeatedly in both languages in English as well as in PaliThe Patthana Commentary compares the hetupaccaya or root condition to the root of a treeThe tree rests on its roots and it has life only as long as these roots are not destroyedIn the same way all kammically wholesome and unwholesome kammaformations are at any time conditioned through the presence and conascence or simultaneity of their respective wholesome or unwholesome rootsThe three unwholesome roots are lobha dosa moha iegreed hate and delusionThe three wholesome roots are alobha adosa amoha ienongreed or unselfishness nonhate or kindness nondelusion or knowledgeLet us now consider sahajatapaccaya the condition by way of conascenceSahajata literally means arisen together or arising together hence our term conascence or simultaneous arisingThis condition of conascence applies above all to consciousness and its concomitant mental phenomena such as feeling perception volition senseimpression attention etcFor consciousness and all these mental phenomena are mutually conditioned through their simultaneous arisingOne cannot arise or exist without the otherAll are inseparably associatedThus if we say that feeling is to consciousness a condition by way of conascence we mean to say that without the simultaneous arising of feeling consciousness will never be able to ariseIn exactly the same way it is with all the other mental phenomenaOnce a wellknown Buddhist author in a discussion with me to my greatest surprise positively declared that there may be painful feeling without consciousness for example during a painful operation whilst being under chloroformThis indeed is a most extraordinary blunderHow will it ever be possible to feel pain without being conscious of itPainful feeling is a mental phenomenon and as such inseparable from consciousness and the other mental phenomenaIf we do not perceive pain and are not conscious of pain how can we feel painThus consciousness feeling perception and all the other mental phenomena are mutually conditioned by way of conascenceNow let us consider upanissayapaccaya the condition by way of inducementThis condition is of various kinds and it forms combinations with certain other conditionsIt applies to a very wide field in fact to anything whatsoeverWe shall treat this condition here only in a very general way without making any distinctionsAnything past or future physical or mental real or imaginary may become an inducement to the arising of mental phenomena or of actions or occurrencesSo for example the Buddha and his Dhamma had been a condition for my coming to the EastSo were the Pali scholars whose translations I had readSo was the first Buddhist lecture I had heard in Germany inOr Nibbana as object of our thinking may become an inducement to our joining the Order or living a pure life etcAlso all those past thinkers scientists and artists were by their works and activities an inducement to the developed culture of later generationsMoney as object of our desire may become an inducement to our making the necessary exertions to get it or it also may become an inducement to theft and robberyFaith knowledge mental concentration etc may be a direct inducement to various noble and unselfish actionsGood or bad friends may be a direct inducement to good or bad conductSuitable or unsuitable climate food dwelling etc may be an inducement to physical health or illhealth physical health or illhealth to mental health or illhealthThus all these things are conditioned through other things by way of inducementNow we shall consider arammanapaccaya the condition by way of objectThe object may be either one of the five senseobjects as visible object sound smell taste or bodily impression or it may be any object of the mindAnything whatever may become the object of mind be it physical or mental past present or future real or imaginaryThus the visible object consisting in differences of color light and dark is called the objectcondition to eyeconsciousness or the visual senseSimilar it is with the four other sensesWithout a physical senseobject no senseconsciousness ever will ariseFurther past evil deeds through being the object of our thinking may as we already have seen become an inducement or upanissaya to repeat the same evil deeds or they may arouse our disgust or repentanceThus past evil deeds by wrong thinking about them may become an inducement to an immoral life by way of object and by right thinking about them the same past evil deeds may become an inducement to a moral lifeIn a similar way good deeds by right thinking about them may become an inducement to further noble deeds but by wrong thinking about ones own good deeds they may become an inducement to selfconceit and vanity and many other unwholesome statesHence also such an immoral thing as avijja may become a condition to noble and wholesome kammaformationsTo show this let us return to our first proposition Through avijja are conditioned the kammaformations How may such an evil state as avijja become a condition to noble and wholesome kammaformationsIt may become so in two ways either by way of direct inducement or inducement as mental objectI shall illustrate this statement by an exampleAt the Buddhas time many a heretic induced by mere vanity and delusion went to the Buddha and tried by dialectics to defeat the MasterHowever after a short controversy he was converted he became a virtuous follower and lifelong supporter of the Blessed One or even attained ArahantshipHere all these virtuous actions even the attainment of Arahantship of the new convert were conditioned by his former avijja as an inducement had this delusive idea of defeating the Buddha not arisen in his mind he perhaps might have never in his life even visited the Blessed OneThus avijja was to his noble and wholesome kammaformations a condition by way of direct inducementFurther suppose we take avijja as object of our contemplation considering it as something evil and rejectable as the rootcause of all misery in the world then we thereby may produce many noble and wholesome kammaformationsIn this case avijja is to these wholesome kammaformations a condition by way of inducement as objectBefore proceeding to the second proposition I wish to call your attention to the fact that avijja or ignorance though the main condition for kammaformations is in no way the only condition for them and so are the kammaformations to consciousness etcEach of the conditionally arising phenomena of PSis dependent on various conditions besides those given in the formula and all may be interrelated and interdependent in manifold waysYou may have noticed that nearly always I speak only of conditions and rarely have I used the word cause This word cause is often used in a very vague or wrong senseCause refers really to that thing which  if all the necessary conditions are present  by inner necessity is in time followed by another thing as its result so that already in the cause the future result is lying latent as it were just as in the mango seed the future mango tree lies latentAnd just as from the mango seed only a mango tree may result never an apple tree nor any other tree just so may a cause result only in just one single thing of a similar character never in various things nor in things of a different characterIf for example a man grows furious on being scolded people generally would say that the scolding man was the cause of the furyBut this is a very vague statementThe cause of the mans fury really lies in himself in his own character not in the person scolding himThe scolders words were merely an inducement to the manifestation of his latent furyThe word cause signifies only one of the many kinds of conditions and it should in Buddhist philosophy be reserved for kamma iethe rebirthproducing volitional activities bound up with wholesome or unwholesome roots constituting the cause of rebirth and resulting in rebirth as their effect or vipakaHerewith we come to the second proposition Sankharapaccaya viññanam Through the kammaformations consciousness is conditioned In other words through kamma or the volitional activities in the past birth the conscious life in this present birth is conditionedHere the following has to be stated The five links  consciousness mental and physical phenomena the six bases of mental life impression and feeling  refer here only to kammaresultant neutral phenomena thus representing the passive side of lifeHowever the five links  ignorance kammaformations craving clinging and kammical lifeprocess  constitute kamma thus representing the active side of lifeHence the five passive links as consciousness etc are to be considered the five results and the five active links as avijja etc the five causesThus the lifeaffirming will or volition manifested in these five kammic causes is the seed from which all life has sprung and from which it will spring again in the futureOur second proposition therefore shows that our present conscious life is the result of our kammaformations produced in the past life and that without these prenatal kammaformations as the necessary cause no conscious life would ever have sprung up in our mothers wombHence the kammaformations are to the rebirthconsciousness of the embryonic being at its conception in the mothers womb a condition by way of kamma or causeAnd so are the kammaformations to all the morally neutral elements of consciousnessHence also the five kinds of senseconsciousness with desirable and agreeable objects are the result or vipaka of the prenatal wholesome kammaformations and those with undesirable and disagreeable objects are the result of unwholesome kammaformationsNow we come to the third proposition namely Viññanapaccaya namarupam Through consciousness the mental and physical phenomena are conditioned The meaning of this proposition can be inferred from the Mahanidana Sutta where it is said If consciousness were not to appear in the mothers womb would the mental and physical phenomena ariseThe mental phenomena refer here to those seven universal mental phenomena inseparably bound up with all kammaresultant consciousness even with the five kinds of senseconsciousnessThese seven inseparable universal mental phenomena are feeling perception impression volition vitality attention concentration in kammaresultant mindconsciousness they are increased by three or four further phenomenaThe physical phenomena refer to this body and its various organs faculties and functionsNow how are the mental phenomena or nama conditioned through consciousnessAnd how the physical phenomena or rupaAny state of consciousness as already explained is to its concomitant mental phenomena such as feeling etc a condition by way of conascence or simultaneous arisingConsciousness cannot arise and exist without feeling nor feeling without consciousness and also all the other mental phenomena which belong to the same state of consciousness are inseparably bound up with it into a single unit and have no independent existenceThese mental phenomena are as it were only the different aspects of those units of consciousness which like lightning every moment flash up and immediately thereafter disappear foreverBut how may consciousness be a condition for the various physical phenomenaIn planes of existence where both matter and mind exist egin the human realm at the moment of conception consciousness is an absolutely necessary condition for the arising of organic physical phenomena it is a condition by way of conascenceIf there is no consciousness no conception takes place and no organic material phenomena appearDuring lifecontinuity however consciousness is to the already arisen physical phenomena a condition by way of postnascence or laterarising and also by way of nutriment because consciousness forms a prop and support for the upkeep of the bodyJust as the feeling of hunger is a condition for the feeding and upkeep of this already arisen body just so is consciousness to this already arisen body a condition and support by its postnascence or later arisingIf consciousness would rise no more the physical organs would gradually cease their functioning lose their faculties and the body would dieIn this way we have to understand the proposition viññanapaccaya namarupam Through consciousness the mental and physical phenomena are conditionedNow we come to the fourth proposition Namarupapaccaya salayatanam Through the mental and physical phenomena the six bases of mental life are conditioned The first five of these bases are the five physical senseorgans eye ear nose tongue body the sixth base the mind base is a collective term for the many different classes of consciousness iefor the five kinds of senseconsciousness and the many kinds of mindconsciousnessHence five bases are physical phenomena namely eye ear etc and the sixth base is identical with consciousnessIn which way now are the mental and physical phenomena a condition for the five physical bases or senseorgans and how for the sixth base or consciousnessHere we really get four chief questionsThe first question is How are the mental phenomena a condition for the five physical bases or senseorgansThe seven inseparable mental phenomena associated with senseconsciousness such as feeling perception etc are to the five physical bases or senseorgans a condition by way of postnascence and in other waysThe mental activity during life namely is a necessary support to the five physical bases or sense organs already produced at birth as explained beforeThe second question is How are mental phenomena a condition to the mindbase or consciousnessThe mental phenomena as feeling perception volition etc are at any time to the mindbase or consciousness a condition by way of simultaneous arising or conascenceYou will remember that I repeatedly said that consciousness cannot arise without the coarising of feeling and the other phenomena because consciousness and all its mental concomitants are inseparably bound up together and mutually dependent upon one anotherThus I have shown how the mental phenomena are a condition to the five physical bases or senseorgans as well as to the mindbase or consciousnessNow we come to the third question How are the physical phenomena a condition for the five physical bases or senseorgansThe four primary physical elements iethe solid fluid heat and motion are to any of the five physical bases or senseorgans at the very moment of their first coming into existence a condition by way of simultaneous arising but during life these four physical elements are to the five bases or senseorgans a condition by way of foundation on which the senseorgans are entirely dependentFurther the physical phenomenon vitality is to the five bases or senseorgans a condition by way of presence etc in other words the five bases or senseorgans depend on the presence of physical life without which the five sense organs could not existThe physical phenomenon nutrition is to the five physical bases a condition by way of presence because the five senseorgans can only exist as long as they get their necessary nutrimentThus I have shown how the physical phenomena or rupa are a condition for the five physical bases or ayatanaThere remains only the fourth question How are the physical phenomena a condition for the mindbase or consciousnessThe five physical phenomena as eye ear nose etc are to the five kinds of senseconsciousness ieto seeing hearing etc a condition by way of foundation and by way of prenascence presence etcThese five kinds of senseconsciousness during life cannot arise without the prearising of the five physical senseorgans as their foundation therefore without the prearising and presence of the eye no seeing without the prearising and presence of the ear no hearing etc so that if these five senseorgans are destroyed no corresponding senseconsciousness can arise any longerIn a similar way is the physical organ of mind the condition for the various stages of mindconsciousnessIn the canonical books no special physical organ is mentioned by name as the physical foundation of the mindconsciousness neither the brain nor the heart though the heart is taught as such by all the commentaries as well as by the general Buddhist traditionI think it is my Burmese friend Shwe Zan Aung who first made this fact known in his Compendium of PhilosophyFor the Buddhist it matters little whether it is the heart or the brain or any other organ that constitutes the physical base of mindThus we have seen how the physical phenomena are a condition to the mindbase or consciousnessAnd herewith we have settled the meaning of the proposition Through the mental and physical phenomena the six bases of mental life are conditionedNow we come to the fifth propostion Salayatanapaccaya phasso Through the six bases senseimpression is conditioned In other words Conditioned through the physical eye is visual impression conditioned through the ear sound impression conditioned through the nose smell impression conditioned through the tongue taste impression conditioned through the body bodily impression conditioned through the mindbase or consciousness mental impressionThe five physical bases are to their corresponding senseimpressions a condition by way of foundation and by way of prenascence and in other ways besidesThe five senseorgans are not only the foundation for consciousness as we have seen but also for all its mental concomitants hence also for senseimpressionAnd as these five bases or senseorgans have already come into existence at birth they are called a prenascent condition to the later arising five senseimpressionsThe mindbase or consciousness is at any time to its concomitant sensory or mental impression a condition by way of simultaneous arising or conascence etcIn other words eyeconsciousness arises simultaneously with visual impression earconsciousness with sound impression etc and mindconsciousness with mental impressionAlso the external physical bases  the five senseobjects as the visual object sound smell etc these too are an indispensable condition to the arising of senseimpressionSo visual impression could never arise without the prearising of the visible object sound impression never without the prearising of the soundobject etcHence the arising of the five senseimpressions depends on the prearising of the visual object the soundobject etcTherefore the arising of the five senseimpressions depends just as much on the prearising and presence of the five physical senseobjects as on the prearising of the five senseorgans as already statedThus senseimpression is also conditioned through the five external physical bases iethrough the five senseobjectsFurther as all the physical senseobjects may also become objects of mindconsciousness therefore they are also a condition for mindconsciousness as well as for its concomitant phenomena such as mental impression etcThus without physical senseorgan and physical senseobject there is no senseimpression and without mind and mindobject no mental impressionTherefore it is said Through the six sense bases senseimpression is conditionedThereafter follows the sixth proposition Phassapaccaya vedana Through impression feeling is conditioned There are six kinds of feeling feeling associated with visual impression feeling associated with sound impression feeling associated with smell impression feeling associated with taste impression feeling associated with bodily impression and feeling associated with mental impressionBodily feeling may be either agreeable or disagreeable according to whether it is the result of wholesome or unwholesome kammaMental feeling may be either agreeable iejoy or disagreeable iesadness or it may be indifferentThe feelings associated with visual sound smell and taste impression are as such always indifferent but they may have either desirable or undesirable objects according to the kamma in a previous lifeWhatever the feeling may be  pleasant or painful happy or unhappy or indifferent whether feeling of body or of mind  any feeling is conditioned either through one of the five senseimpressions or through mental impressionAnd these impressions are a condition to their associated feeling by way of conascence or simultaneous arising and in many other waysHere you will again remember that all the mental phenomena in one and the same state of consciousness hence also impression and feeling are necessarily dependent one upon another by their simultaneous arising their presence their association etcBut to any feeling associated with the different stages of mindconsciousness following upon a senseimpression the preceding visual or other senseimpression is an inducement by way of proximityIn other words the preceding senseimpression is a decisive support or inducement to any feeling bound up with the succeeding mindconsciousnessThus we have seen how through sensory and mental impression or phassa feeling or vedana is conditionedNow comes the seventh proposition Vedanapaccaya tanha Through feeling craving is conditionedCorresponding to the six senses there are six kinds of craving namely craving for visible objects craving for sounds craving for odors craving for tastes craving for bodily impressions craving for mindobjectsIf the craving for any of these objects is connected with the desire for sensual enjoyment it is called sensuous cravingIf connected with the belief in eternal personal existence it is called craving for existenceIf connected with the belief in selfannihilation at death it is called craving for selfannihilationAny neutral feeling whether agreeable disagreeable or indifferent whether happy or unhappy feeling may be to the subsequent craving a condition either by way of simple inducement or of inducement as objectFor example conditioned through pleasurable feeling due to the beautiful appearance of persons or things there may arise craving for such visible objectsOr conditioned through pleasurable feeling due to pleasant food craving for tastes may ariseOr thinking of those feelings of pleasure and enjoyment procurable by money people may become filled with craving for money and pleasureOr pondering over past pleasures and feelings of happiness people may again become filled with craving and longing for such pleasuresOr thinking of heavenly bliss and joy people may become filled with craving for rebirth in such heavenly worldsIn all these cases pleasant feeling is to craving either a condition by way of simple inducement or inducement as object of thinkingBut not only agreeable and happy feeling but even disagreeable and unhappy feeling may become a condition for cravingFor example to a man being tormented with bodily pain or oppressed in mind the craving may arise to be released from such miseryThus through feeling unhappy and dissatisfied with his miserable lot a poor man or a beggar or an outcast or a sick man or a prisoner may become filled with longing and craving for release from such a conditionIn all these cases unpleasant and miserable feeling of body and mind forms for craving a condition by way of inducement without which such craving might never have arisenEven expected future feeling of happiness may by thinking about it become a mighty incentive or inducement to cravingThus whatever craving arises depends in some way or other on feeling be it past present or even future feelingTherefore it is said Vedanapaccaya tanha Through feeling craving is conditionedNow we have reached the eighth proposition Tanhapaccaya upadanam Through craving clinging is conditioned Upadana or clinging is said to be a name for developed or intensified cravingIn the texts we find four kinds of clinging sensuous clinging clinging to wrong views clinging to faith in the moral efficacy of mere outward rules and rituals and clinging to the belief in either an eternal or a temporary egoentityThe first one sensuous clinging refers to objects of sensuous enjoyment while the three other kinds of clinging are connected with wrong viewsWhenever clinging to views or rituals arises at that very moment also craving must arise without the simultaneous arising of craving there would be no such attachments to these views and ritualsHence craving or tanha is for these kinds of clinging or upadana a condition by way of conascenceBut besides this craving may be to such kind of clinging also a condition by way of inducementSuppose a fool who is craving for rebirth in heaven thinks that by following certain outward moral rules or by mere belief in a creator he will attain the object of his desireSo he firmly attaches himself to the practice of mere outward rules and rituals or to the belief in a creatorIn this case craving is for such kind of clinging a condition by way of inducement or upanissayapaccayaTo sensuous clinging or kamupadana however craving may only be a condition by way of direct inducementThe craving for senseobjects itself gradually develops and turns into strong sensuous clinging and attachment or kamupadanaFor example craving and desire for objects of sensual enjoyment for money food gambling drinking etcmay gradually grow into a strong habit into a firm attachment and clingingThus I have shown how craving is the condition for clingingAs it is said Tanhapaccaya upadanam Through craving clinging is conditionedNext we come to the ninth proposition Upadanapaccaya bhavoThrough clinging the process of becoming is conditioned Now this process of becoming or existence really consists of two processes the kammaprocess iethe kammically active side of life and the kammaresultant rebirthprocess iethe kammically passive and morally neutral side of lifeThe kammically active side of this lifeprocess is as we have seen represented by five links namely ignorance kammaformations craving clinging kammaprocessThe passive side of life is represented by five links namely consciousness mental and physical phenomena the six bases impression feelingThus the five passive links as consciousness etc refer here only to kammaresultant phenomena and not to such as are associated with active kammaThe five active links as ignorance etc are the causes of the five passive links of the future as kammaresultant consciousness etc and thus these five passive links are the results of the five active linksIn that way the PSmay be represented by twenty links five causes in the past life and five results in the present one five causes in the present life and five results in the future oneAs it is said in the VisuddhimaggaLet me here recall to you my definition of the term cause as that which by inner necessity is followed in time by its result There are twentyfour modes of conditioning but only one of them should be called cause namely kammaThough this kammic cause is in time followed by its result it nevertheless may depend on a preceding kammaresult as its inducement conditionThus for example feeling within the PS is a kammaresult but still at the same time it is an inducementcondition to the subsequent arising of craving which latter is a kamma causeNow let us return to our proposition upadanapaccaya bhavoThrough clinging the process of becoming is conditioned that is the kammaprocess and thereafter in the next life the kammaresultant rebirthprocessThe kammaprocess in this ninth proposition is correctly speaking a collective name for rebirthproducing volition together with all the mental phenomena associated therewith while the second link kammaformations designates as such merely rebirthproducing volitionBut in reality both links amount to one and the same thing namely kammaClinging or upadana may be an inducement to all kinds of evil and unwholesome kammaSensuous clinging or attachment to senseobjects and sensual enjoyment may be a direct inducement to murder robbery theft adultery to envy hatred revenge to many evil actions of body speech and mindClinging to the blind belief in mere outward rules and rituals may lead to selfcomplacency mental torpor and stagnation to contempt of others presumption intolerance fanaticism and crueltyIn all these cases clinging is to the kammaprocess a condition by way of inducement and is a direct inducement to evil volitional activities of body speech or mindMoreover clinging is to any evil kammaprocess also a condition by way of simultaneous arisingThus I have shown how clinging is the condition of the kammaprocessNow I shall show how the kammaprocess is the condition for the kammaresultant rebirthprocessHere we come to the tenth propositionBhavapaccaya jatiThrough the process of becoming rebirth is conditioned That means the kammaprocess dominated by the lifeaffirming volitions is the cause of rebirthRebirth includes here the entire embryonic process which in the human world begins with conception in the mothers womb and ends with parturitionThus kamma volition is the seed from which all life germinates just as from the mango seed germinates the little mango plant which in the course of time turns into a mighty mango treeBut how does one know that the kammaprocess or kamma volition is really the cause of rebirthThe Visuddhimagga gives the following answerThough the outward conditions at the birth of beings may be absolutely the same there still can be seen a difference in beings with regard to their character as wretched or noble etcEven though the outward conditions such as sperm or blood of father and mother may be the same there still can be seen that difference between beings even if they be twinsThis difference cannot be without reason as it can be noticed at any time and in any beingIt can have no other cause than the prenatal kammaprocessAs also for the life of those beings which have been reborn no other reason can be found therefore that difference must be due to the prenatal kammaprocessKamma or volition indeed is the cause for the difference among beings with regard to their character as high low etcTherefore the Buddha has said kamma divides beings into high and low In this way we should understand that the kammic process is the cause of rebirthThus according to Buddhism the present rebirth is the result of the craving clinging and kamma volitions in the past birthAnd the craving clinging and kamma volitions in this present birth are the cause of future rebirthBut just as in this everchanging mental and physical process of existence nothing can be found that passes even from one moment to the next just so no abiding element can be found no entity no ego that would pass from one birth to the nextIn this ever repeated process of rebirth in the absolute sense no egoentity is to be found besides these conditionally arising and passing phenomenaThus correctly speaking it is not myself and not my person that is reborn nor is it another person that is rebornAll such terms as person or individual or man or I or you or mine etc do not refer to any real entity they are merely terms used for convenience sake in Pali voharavacana conventional terms and there is really nothing to be found beside these conditionally arising and passing mental and physical phenomenaTherefore the Buddha has saidTo believe that the doer of the deed will be the same as the one who experiences its result this is the one extremeTo believe that the doer of the deed and the one who experiences its result are two different persons this is the other extremeBoth these extremes the Perfect One has avoided and taught the truth that lies in the middle of both that is Through ignorance the kammaformations are conditioned through the kammaformations consciousness through consciousness the mental and physical phenomena through the mental and physical phenomena the six bases through the six bases impression through impression feeling through feeling craving through craving clinging through clinging the lifeprocess through the lifeprocess rebirth through rebirth decay and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairThus arises this whole mass of sufferingThis phenomenality and egolessness of existence has been beautifully expressed in two verses of the VisuddhimaggaIn hearing that Buddhism teaches that everything is determined by conditions someone might come to the conclusion that Buddhism teaches some sort of fatalism or that man has no free will or that will is not freeNow with regard to the two questions Has man a free will and Is will free the Buddhist will say that both these questions are to be rejected for being wrongly put and therefore unanswerableThe first question Has man a free will is to be rejected for the reason that beside these everchanging mental and physical phenomena in the absolute sense no such thing or entity can be found that we could call man so that man as such is merely a name without any realityThe second question Is will free is to be rejected for the reason that will is only a momentary mental phenomenon just like feeling consciousness etc and thus does not yet exist before it arises and that therefore of a nonexistent thing  of a thing which is not  one could properly speaking not ask whether it is free or unfreeThe only admissible question would be Is the arising of will independent of conditions or is it conditioned But the same question would equally apply also to all the other mental phenomena as well as to all the physical phenomena in other words to everything and every occurrence whateverAnd the answer would be Be it will or feeling or any other mental or physical phenomenon the arising of anything whatsoever depends on conditions and without these conditions nothing can ever arise or enter into existenceAccording to Buddhism everything mental and physical happens in accordance with laws and conditions and if it were otherwise chaos and blind chance would reignBut such a thing is impossible and contradicts all laws of thinkingNow we have reached the eleventh and last proposition Jatipaccaya jaramaranam Through rebirth decay and death are conditioned Without birth there cannot be decay and deathIf we had not been born we would not have to die and would not be exposed to all sorts of miseryThus rebirth is a necessary condition for decay and death and for all other forms of miseryHence it was said Through rebirth decay and death are conditionedHerewith the explanation of the eleven propositions of the paticcasamuppada formula has been brought to a closeFrom my explanations you will have seen that the twelve links of the formula are distributed over three successive lives and that they may be applied to our past present and future livesThe first two links avijja and kammaformations represent the kamma causes in the past life the next five links consciousness etc represent the kammaresults in the present life the following three links craving clinging and kammaprocess represent the kammic causes in the present life and the two last links rebirth and decay and death represent the kammaresults in the future lifeYou ought however to remember that the full kammic causes are five namely ignorance kammaformations craving clinging kammaprocess existence and that thus we really get five causes in the past and five results in the present five causes in the present and five results in the futureTherefore it was saidNow if there had been no ignorance and no kammaformations or lifeaffirming volitions in the past life no consciousness and new life would have sprung up in our mothers womb and our present birth would not have taken placeHowever if by deep penetration and deep insight into the evanescent nature and the egolessness of all existence one becomes fully detached from all forms of existence and freed from all ignorance craving and clinging to existence freed from all those selfish kammaformations or volitions then no further rebirth will follow and the goal taught by the Buddha will have been realized namely deliverance from rebirth and sufferingThe following diagram show at a glance the relationship of dependence between three successive livesThe whole of the Buddhas teachings may be summed up in three words morality mental concentration and wisdom sila samadhi and paññaThis is the threefold division of the Noble Eightfold Path leading to deliverance from the misery of SamsaraAnd of this Eightfold Path right speech action and livelihood are included in morality or sila right effort mindfulness and concentration in mental concentration or samadhi right understanding and thought in wisdom or paññaOf these three stages morality constitutes the foundation without which no real progress along the Eightfold Path to purity and deliverance is possibleThe two higher stages concentration and wisdom are brought to perfection by that which in the West usually but rather ambiguously is called meditation By this latter term the Buddhist Pali term bhavana is usually translatedThe word bhavana is a verbal noun derived from the causative of the verb bhavati to be to become and therefore literally means the bringing into existence ieproducing developmentThus the development of mind is twofoldIn this popular exposition I only wish to give a general idea of the authentic method of this twofold mental culture and I shall not be going much into detailsIt is to be regretted that in Sri Lanka one very rarely meets with laymen or even monks who are earnestly devoting themselves to these two higher stages of Buddhist lifeIn Burma and Siam however the other two strongholds of original Buddhism we still find quite a number of monks and hermits who are living in the solitudes of deep forests or in caves and who detached from all worldly wishes and anxieties are striving for the goal set forth by our Master and are training themselves in tranquillity and insightUndoubtedly for the real development of higher life solitude at least temporarily is an absolute necessityThough the concentration exercises may serve various preliminary purposes their ultimate object is to reach that unshakable tranquillity and purity of the mind which is the foundation of insight leading to deliverance from the cycle of rebirth and miseryThe Buddha has said Now what monks is NibbanaIt is the extinction of greed hate and delusionAnd what monks is the path leading to NibbanaIt is mental tranquillity and insightMental tranquillity is the unshakable state of mind gained through the persevering training in mental concentrationTranquillity according to the Commentary Sankhepavannana bestows a threefold blessing auspicious rebirth bliss in this very life and mental purity and fitness for insightInsight is a name for the flashing forth of the light of wisdom and insight into the true nature of existence ieinto the impermanency suffering and egolessness of all corporeality feelings perceptions mental formations and consciousnessFor the development of concentration and mental tranquillity there exist many different exercisesIn the Visuddhimagga forty such concentrationexercises are enumerated and minutely explained namely ten kasina exercises ten cemetery meditations ten reflections  on the qualities of the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha on morality liberality heavenly beings further on death the body inandout breathing and the peace of detachmentFurther the development of the four divine abodes the four immaterial states the perception of the filthiness of food and the analysis of the four elementsBefore entering into a discussion of some of these forty concentration exercises I have first to deal with the three grades of intensity of concentration and further to speak of those higher states of mind called jhanas or mental absorptions which may be attained by a great number of these exercisesThe three grades of intensity of concentration arePreliminary concentration is present whenever one directs ones mind to any of the various objects of concentrationNeighborhood concentration is that grade of concentration which approaches or comes near the first jhana and is in many exercises marked by a mentally visible pure and unshakable mental image the socalled reflexmark of which we shall speak laterAttainment concentration is that grade of concentration which is present during the jhanasBy the jhanas are meant supersensual states of perfect mental absorption in which the fivefold sense activity is suspendedThe jhanas can only be attained in absolute solitude and by unremitting perseverance in the development of concentrationNo visual or audible impressions arise at such a time no bodily feeling is feltIn this state the monk appears to the outside world as if deadBut though all the outer senseimpressions such as seeing hearing etc have disappeared the mind still remains active perfectly alert and fully awakeThe first jhana is a stage of peace ecstasy and joyful bliss yet thought conception and discursive thinking iethe socalled inner speech or verbal activities of the mind are still at workAs soon as these verbal activities of the mind have ceased one has attained the second jhana which is a state of highest rapture and joyful bliss free from thinking and ponderingAfter the fading away of rapture and ecstasy the third jhana is reached marked by equanimous joyAfter the complete fading away of joy a state of perfect equanimity abides called the fourth jhanaThe mind after emerging from the fourth jhana is again and again described in the suttas as serene pure lucid stainless devoid of evil pliable able to act firm and imperturbableLet us now deal separately with some of the concentration exercisesAmongst those forty exercises described in the Visuddhimagga the ten kasina exercises resemble somewhat certain methods of inducing hypnotic sleep etc by gazing at bright objectsTherefore in order to avoid such an outcome one must beware of sleepiness and strive to keep the mind ever alertThere are four color kasinas four element kasinas space kasina and light kasinaIn the color kasina a blue yellow red or white disk may serve as the object at which to gaze or flowers cloth etcof these colorsIn the earth kasina exercise the object of our gazing may be a plowed field seen from a distance or a circular piece of earth prepared for this purposeIn the water kasina exercise we may gaze at a pond seen from a higher elevation or at water contained in a vesselSimilar it is with the fire kasina and wind kasinaAs an example how to practice such an exercise let us consider the blue kasina exerciseFor this purpose let us prepare a round disk made of paper or cloth and fix it to the wall of our roomThen seated before the disk we fix our whole attention upon this preliminary mark and so produce preliminary concentrationNow while constantly gazing at this blue disk we must strive to remain mentally alert and steadfast in order not to fall into hypnotic sleep as already pointed outAt the same time we must keep from our mind all outside impressions and thoughts on other objects as well as all those disturbing and often dangerous mental visions and hallucinations that may ariseWhile exclusively fixing our eyes and thoughts on the blue disk as our sole object the things around the disk seem as it were to disappear and the disk itself seems to become more and more a mere mental phantomNow whether the eyes are opened or closed we perceive the mentalized kasina disk which more and more assumes the appearance of the bright orb of the moonThis is the acquired mark which though apparently seen by means of our physical eyes is nevertheless produced and perceived only by our mind independently of the sense activity of the eyeAs soon as this mentally produced image becomes steady and vanishes no longer but remains safely fixed in the mind we should move to another place and there continue our exerciseIn fixing our mental eye more and more upon the mentally produced image or light it becomes continually steadier and brighter till at last it may assume the appearance of the bright morning star or something similarHerewith the mental reflex mark is attained and along with it neighborhood concentrationAlready during this stage all mental hindrances have at least temporarily disappeared and do not ariseNo sensual lust arises in such a stateNo illwill can irritate the mindAll mental stiffness and dullness is overcomeNo restlessness and anxiety and no wavering doubt and scepticism can any more divert the mindAs long as there is a possibility for the arising of these five mental hindrances so long there can be no lasting tranquillity of the mindBy tenaciously fixing our mind to the reflex mark we eventually reach the attainment concentration and thereby enter into the first jhanaAnd by becoming more and more absorbed and by the gradual vanishing one by one of thought conception and discursive thinking of rapture and joy we consecutively pass through the three remaining jhanas as described beforeNext let us touch upon the cemetery contemplations The goal of these exercises is to create a concentrated and tranquil state of mind by arousing disgust for the carnal desires and detachment from themThe objects of the cemetery contemplations being either real or imaginary are a putrified corpse a corpse gnawed by wild animals or by worms a skeleton scattered bones bones crumbled to dust etcOf the remaining concentration exercises I intend to speak only of the four divine abodes allembracing kindness compassion altruistic joy and equanimityThe development of allembracing kindness is according to the Visuddhimagga to be practiced somewhat as followsFirst one should think of oneself May I be happyMay I be free from suffering Thus beginning with oneself one should then in the same way extend loving and benevolent thoughts to ones teacher then to ones friends and companions then to all persons living in and around the same house then to the inhabitants of the nearest street then by and by to the whole village or town then to the whole country and making not the slightest difference between friend and enemy blood relation and stranger good people and bad people one should finally pervade the whole world with allembracing kindnessAnd not only human beings but also animals down to the tiniest insects all should be embraced with kindnessIdentifying ourselves with all that lives we should pervade the whole world with allembracing kindness above below to all sides and should rouse in our innermost heart the fervent wish O that all beings may be happyThat all beings may be freed from greed hate and delusionThat all beings may find deliverance from SamsaraBy developing allembracing kindness and goodwill the heart will become purified of illfeeling and anger and filled with tranquillity steadfastness and peaceDuring this exercise the mind may eventually reach the ecstasy of the first jhana and even gradually pass through the first three jhanasIn a more or less similar way compassion and altruistic joy are to be developedIn the Suttas we again and again find the stereotype wordsThere O monks the monk with allembracing kindness or with compassion altruistic joy equanimity pervades first one direction then the second then the third then the fourth above below round about in every quarterAnd identifying himself with all he pervades the entire universe with allembracing kindness with heart grown great wide deep boundless free from wrath and angerIn the fourth divine abode the development of equanimity all persons and things are regarded with perfect equanimity and disinterestednessWith unshakable equanimity the mind looks upon wealth and poverty happiness and misery free from agitation free from inclination and aversion steadfast and unmoved beyond love and hatred beyond joy and sorrowIt may here be mentioned that concentration does not reach the same degree of intensity in each of the forty exercisesFor example in some of them only neighborhood concentration may be reached as in the reflections on the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha etcThe cemetery contemplations may induce entrance into the first jhanaThe first three divine abodes may induce the first three jhanasThe ten kasina exercises however as well as the exercise of equanimity and the attention on inandout breathing may induce all the four jhanasWith regard to the nature or temperament of the person practicing concentration it should be noted that the four color kasinas are particularly suited to an angry nature while for an unsteady nature the kasina disk should be of small sizeWe have already stated that all the concentration exercises as such serve only the purpose of developing mental tranquillityMental tranquillity however is the fundamental and indispensable condition for the successful development of insightAnd this insight alone possesses the power to confer immediate entrance to the four stages of holiness and thus to free us forever from the ten fetters that bind beings to the everturning wheel of existenceTherefore our Master has said May you develop mental concentration O monksFor whoso is concentrated in mind sees things as they really are Concerning insight we read in the Milindapañha Just as when a man brings a lamp into a dark chamber the lamp produces light and renders all things visible just so does insight as soon as it arises dispel the darkness of ignorance and bring forth the light of knowledge and sending out its rays of wisdom it renders clearly visible the Four Noble TruthsAnd thus the earnestly striving monk with clear and bright insight beholds the impermanence suffering and egolessness of all existence And in the Puggalapaññatti Just as a man in a dark and gloomy night at the sudden flash of lightning may with his eyes clearly recognize objects even so one may through deep insight perceive all things as they really are This is suffering this is the origin of suffering this is the extinction of suffering this is the path leading to the extinction of suffering Hence just as morality forms the indispensable foundation for the successful development of mental tranquillity and concentration just so supported by morality mental tranquillity and concentration forms the necessary foundation for the development of wisdom and insightAnd insight is the immediate condition for the entrance into the four stages of holinessFor the successful development of insight however it is not an absolute necessity to have gained the jhanasThe attainment of neighborhood concentration is sufficient for this purposeMoreover during the jhanas the development of insight is not possible as the initial practice of this exercise requires abstract thinking and analyzing while in the first jhana abstract thinking is already weak and totally absent in the three higher jhanasInsight as already said is induced by means of analysis and intense contemplation on all the phenomena of existence ieon corporeal phenomena feelings perceptions mental formations and states of consciousness by the contemplation on their impersonality futility emptiness and unsubstantiality by contemplating the fact that in reality neither inside nor outside these fleeting phenomena is there to be found any egoentity and that I or self or person etc are nothing but conventional namesReally this teaching of unsubstantiality and egolessness together with the teaching of the conditionedness of all phenomena of existence are the only specific doctrines of Buddhism and without insight into these profound truths nobody can ever rightly grasp the Four Noble Truths or enter the pathAll the other teachings of our Master may also be found in other philosophies or religionsThe jhanas have already been attained before and independently of the BuddhaLove was preached by some other religionsLikewise the impermanency and miserable nature of existence was taught by othersBut the liberating truths of impersonality and conditionedness of all existence have of all religious teachers been taught and revealed in full clarity only by the BuddhaAnd these are the only specific doctrines on which the whole Buddhist structure restsHence as the understanding of egolessness and conditionedness of existence is the indispensable condition for a real understanding of the Four Noble Truths and for deliverance from Samsara one may rightly say that none but the Enlightened One has shown the right method of mental culture and therewith the right way to deliveranceThe exercises for developing insight given in the Visuddhimagga are extremely variedAnyhow I shall here briefly indicate the most essential onesBefore however the monk begins with developing his insight he at first should acquire a thorough knowledge of the Dhamma and know that the only true or actual elements in this evanescent existence are the five groups of existence corporeal phenomena feelings perceptions mental formations and states of consciousnessAnd he should think of their impermanence their unsatisfactoriness their empty and conditioned nature as well as of their twofold division into a mental and corporeal processThus after attaining and rising again from one of the jhanas the monk may analyze the just experienced state of jhanaAnd while doing so he will realize that this mental state called jhana is nothing but a heap of rising and passing phenomena thought conception discursive thinking joy concentration feeling perception mental formations and consciousnessAnd pondering over these phenomena he will find that this entire mental process is dependent on corporeality and that again corporeality is a name for the four physical elements and the corporeality depending on them as egthe senseorgans objects etcAnother monk may divide this mentalcorporeal process into its eighteen elements iethe six senseorgans six objects and six kinds of consciousness as eye visible object eyeconsciousness ear sound earconsciousness mind mindobject mindconsciousnessAnd he will understand thus Mere mental and physical phenomena are there but no being no personality can be foundOr just as after building up walls and roof with various materials the enclosed space is called a house just so this bodily structure built up by bones flesh sinews etc is called bodyOr just as a wooden swiveldoll is empty lifeless and inactive but may by means of a pulling device move or stand and appear to be full of life and activity just so are mind and body as such something empty lifeless and inactive but through the mutual influence of mind and body upon one another this psychophysical structure may move or stand and appear full of life and activityThus the monk contemplates the conditionality of this psychophysical processAnd he understands how all those bodily and mental phenomena come to decay and dissolutionAnd he perceives the conditioned nature of the bodily and mental groups with regard to their dependent origination namely Among the phenomena old age and death can take place only if there is birth birth only if there is the prenatal kammaprocess the kammaprocess only if there is attachment to life the kammaformations only if there is ignorance and delusion In this way all doubts vanish in the monk such as Have I been in the past or Have I not been in the past etcEverywhere in all the forms of existence the monk sees only an everchanging mental and bodily process kept going through the concatenation of causes and effects and other conditionsNo doer does he see beside the deed no receiver of the kammaresultAnd he rightly understands that it is only by way of conventional language that the wise with regard to a deed speak of a doer or with regard to the kammaresult of a receiver of itThe monk considers thus The kammaproduced five groups of the past have become extinguished then and there but conditioned through the past kamma other groups have arisen in this existence yet from the past existence nothing has passed over to this existenceAlso the present groups produced through the past kamma will become extinguished here but conditioned through the present kamma other groups will arise in the future yet from this existence nothing will pass over to the next existenceWhatever there is of corporeality feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness whether past present or future ones own or external gross or subtle lofty or low far or near all these phenomena of existence are impermanent unsatisfactory nonselfFor whatever is nonself is unsatisfactory and unable to ward off its own impermanence or oppression due to its arising and disappearingHow could these things ever assume the role of a feeler an agent an experiencer of consciousness an abiding personalityAll these things the monk considers as conditioned subject to dissolution and disappearanceAlso in the external world the monk may observe the three characteristicsThe shoot of the asoka tree is at first lightred then after two or three days it becomes deepredThen it gets the appearance of a young sprout then of a ripe sprout then of a lightgreen leaf then of a bluegreen leafFrom this time continually depending upon a similar physical continuity it becomes after one year a yellow leaf and detaching itself from the stalk it drops to the groundThus each time before the next following stage has appeared the former stage dies offFurther by means of the eighteen kinds of insight the monk overcomes the wrong conceptions through their opposites namelyHaving thus by means of the eighteen kinds of insight understood the phenomena with regard to their three characteristics he has penetrated the impermanence unsatisfactoriness and egolessness of all existenceContemplation on arising and disappearing Further the monk trains himself in insight with regard to the arising and disappearing of things All the physical and mental phenomena without having been previously come to arise and arisen they disappear againThrough the arising of the prenatal ignorance craving kamma and nutriment there is conditioned the arising of corporeality and through the extinction of these four causes the extinction of corporeality takes placeAll life is like a dew drop that dissolves as soon as the sun risesLife is like an empty bubble or like a furrow drawn on the water which immediately disappears againLife is something unsubstantial unreal an illusion a mirage a phantom like a firewreath called forth by the circular swinging of a firebrand or like a ghostland or foam or a bananastemContemplation on dissolution Now while knowing that all these formations of existence once arisen will soon again come to extinction there arises in him the contemplation on dissolutionAs consciousness is conditioned through the physical or mental objects he considers it as impermanentHe turns away from it no longer delights in itHe detaches himself from it no longer has greed for itHe brings it to extinction does not let it rise againHe lets it go and no longer adheres to itAnd considering it as transient he overcomes the idea of something permanentKnowledge consisting in awareness of terror Whoso knows how in the past all formations of existence have become extinguished how the present ones are coming to extinction and how also all the future ones will become extinguished to him there arises on that occasion the knowledge consisting in awareness of terrorContemplation on misery The arising of existence is a terror such knowledge consisting in awareness of terror is called the knowledge of miseryThe continuity of existence the course of rebirth the entering into existence old age disease death sorrow lamentation despair are a terror such knowledge consisting in awareness of terror is called the knowledge of miseryContemplation on turning away While the disciple in this way understands that all formations of existence are misery his mind turns away from all formations is weary of them no longer delights in themKnowledge of the wish for deliverance Now while finding no delight in the formations of existence he wishes to get rid of them seeks for escape from themReflecting contemplation In order to find deliverance from all the formations of existence he reflects on them and determines their three characteristicsAll formations he understands as impermanent for their being without duration persisting only for a short while being limited by their arising and disappearance perishable transient frail unsteady subject to change without substance unreal conditioned subject to deathAll formations he considers as unsatisfactory for their being again and again oppressed their being hard to endure and their being the root of all sufferingAll formations he considers as nonself for their being something alien unreal void empty without owner without master without controller Empty are all formations void are they of any self and of anything pertaining to a self I am not anything to anyone nor does anything belong to me in any regard Just as a reed is hollow and without pith so also are corporeality feeling perception mental formations and consciousness empty void impersonal without master unfree something uncontrollable impotent and alienKnowledge consisting in equanimity with regard to all formations While the monk is thus grasping all the formations by considering them as empty and determining their three characteristics he gives up fear and anguish and abides in equanimity with regard to all the formations no more concerns himself about them and no longer conceives the idea of I and mineWhoever considers the formations of existence as impermanent to him they appear as a passing awayWhoever considers them as unsatisfactory to him they appear as terrorWhoever considers them as nonself to him they appear as emptyAdaptation knowledge Now the path will reveal itself thus thinking the monks mind reflects with equanimity on all the formations of existence as impermanent unsatisfactory and nonself and thereupon his consciousness sinks into the subconscious streamImmediately thereafter arises awareness at the minddoor taking as objects all phenomena just as before regarding them as impermanent unsatisfactory and nonselfThereafter in following up again the interrupted continuity of consciousness the three impulsive moments known as the preliminary access and adaptation moment flash up one after the other with the same phenomena as objectOne speaks of adaptation because this knowledge adapts itself to the preceding eight kinds of insight knowledge performing the same functions and to the following elements of enlightenment immediately thereafterAdaptation knowledge has the same functions because it arises through contemplation of the formations of existence together with their three characteristics of impermanence unsatisfactoriness and egolessnessThe adaptation knowledge however forms the conclusion for those kinds of insight that have the formations as object and are leading to the ascent ieto the pathMaturity knowledge immediately thereafter follows maturity knowledge which consists in the turning of the mind to the supramundane path of streamentranceAt that moment the mind is no longer driving towards all those phenomena no longer clinging to them no longer captivated by them and transcending the sphere of the worldling it enters the sphere of the noble onesJust as in the cloudless sky the moon shines pure and bright just so as soon as the darkness of ignorance veiling the truth is dispersed maturity knowledge beholds the purity of NibbanaPath knowledge Now following as immediate continuation upon adaptation knowledge path consciousness arises by dispersing and demolishing forever and all time the three fetters of personality belief sceptical doubt and clinging to rules and ritualsFruition knowledge immediately upon this path consciousness there arise as results those supramundane states of consciousness known as the fruits of the path which during the lifetime may be repeated innumerable timesThe corresponding process also takes place on attaining the three higher stages of holiness of which the highest one is identical with perfect holiness or ArahantshipHerewith we have arrived at the highest and final goal of the Buddhas teachingI should however like to warn you of the wrong conclusion as if according to the Buddhas teaching it would be necessary for the realization of the paths to be ever conscious of all those intricate workings of our mindThis is by no means the caseLet me tell you that in many places in the investigations contained in the Visuddhimagga the point is rather to give a scientific explanation of the whole process of gradual development on the path to deliveranceWe have here mostly to do with theoretical knowledge and hypotheses gained by abstract reasoning partly perhaps also with real knowledge gained through intuition by some extraordinary seers or mysticsIn any case deliverance may under favorable circumstances sometimes be realized already after a very short time and with no previous knowledgeAt the conclusion of our subject therefore I should like to summarize the more popular and more intelligible exposition of the twofold development as given in the Satipatthana Sutta and its commentaryThere is only one way to the realization of deliverance namely the four foundations of mindfulness iethe attentive contemplation of body feeling mind and mindobjectsFor that purpose the monk retires to a solitary place and sitting down and directing his whole attention in front of himself he watches attentively his inandout breathing and attains thereby mental concentration and the jhanasOr In going standing sitting or lying down he is well aware and knows that there is no living entity no real ego that moves about but that it is a mere conventional mode of speaking if one says I go I stand etcHe is full of attention and clearly conscious in going and coming looking forward and backward in bending and stretching his body in eating drinking speaking and keeping silentThus in all outer activities he is clearly conscious of purpose utility duty and truthFurther He contemplates the manifold parts of the body as hairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones etcFurther He analyzes the body with regard to the four elements iethe solid liquid heat and motionFurther Just as if he would see a corpse thrown to the burial ground swollen blueblack in color he draws the conclusion Also this my body has the same nature will become so cannot escape it Or Just as if he would see a corpse a framework of bones stripped of flesh bespattered with blood bones disconnected and scattered in all directions bones bleached and resembling shells bones heaped together bones weatherworn and crumbled to dust he draws the conclusion Also this my body has the same nature will become so cannot escape it Thus he contemplates his own body other bodies and bothHe sees how these bodily phenomena are arising and passing awayAnd he understands that only corporeality is there to be found but no egoentityIn contemplating the feelings he notices the agreeable feeling the disagreeable feeling the indifferent feeling he sees how these feelings are arising and passing away and does not find any egoentity within or without the feelingsIn contemplating the mind he notices when it is filled with greed or hate or delusion or when it is free from these things he notices when the mind is cramped or scattered concentrated or notAnd he sees how these states of mind are arising and passing away and knows that there is no egoentity to be foundIn contemplating the mindobjects he notices when one of the mental hindrances is present or not present how it arises and how it is overcomeHe contemplates the six senseorgans and the corresponding objects and the mental fetters conditioned through them contemplates the five groups of existence their arising and passing away the seven links of enlightenment and the Four Noble TruthsThus he contemplates all the phenomena sees how they arise and pass away and how nowhere any egoentity can be foundThe Satipatthana Sutta closes with the encouraging words that one who in this way practices the four foundations of mindfulness sometimes even for only seven days may find deliverance from all sufferingVenNyanatiloka Mahathera was the first Continental European in modern times to become a Buddhist monk and one of the foremost Western exponents of Theravada Buddhism in the twentieth centuryBorn in Germany he developed a keen interest in Buddhism in his youth and came to Asia intending to enter the Buddhist OrderHe received ordination in Burma inThe greatest part of his life as a monk was spent in Sri Lanka where he established the Island Hermitage at Dodanduwa as a monastery for Western monksHis translations into German include the Anguttara Nikaya the Visuddhimagga and the MilindapañhaVenNyanatiloka passed away in Colombo inThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThis year a large number of monks and novices came to be ordained and to live together here at Wat Asokaram for the Rains  some of them planning eventually to leave the monkhood some of them to stayThis being the case I wrote down a piece explaining and analyzing our duties for their information so that they would have something of religious value to keep and take with them for the progress of the community of monks and novices in the days to comeAfter the piece was written and read aloud to the group it seemed appropriate for use in the area of administering the Sangha at large and so it has been printed for free distribution as a gift of Dhamma in order that Buddhism may prosper and thrive for the wellbeing of us allThe administration of the Sangha as set out by the ecclesiastical authorities of Thailand is divided into four departmentsEach of these departments if its activities were in line with its aims would cause the religion to prosperBut I have come to see that each of them is so deficient as to be destructive  bringing about to a great extent the corruption of monks and novicesThis is why I would like to give the monks and novices here some sense of their duties and of the true aims of each of these departmentsOtherwise governance will turn into covernance  covering up what we dont want to be seenEach of these departments is divided into two sections the central office and the offices in the outlying regionsIn the central office the responsibility of the ecclesiastical authorities of both sects Dhammayutika and Mahanikaya is to cooperate in firmly carrying out the duties of each department in the area of central administrationAs for the outlying regions the responsibility of the ecclesiastical authorities on the regional provincial district and township levels and of the abbots of all temples is to train the officers of each department in their respective jurisdictions to be firm in carrying out their stated dutiesAny individual who proves incompetent in a particular area should not be placed in charge of the corresponding departmentThus I would now like to explain the duties of each department in a way that will bring about order in line not only with the laws and regulations of the Sangha but also with the disciplinary standards and with rectitude  because all of these laws and regulations need to be both right and up to standard if they are to lead to the wellbeing of the religionGovernance is of three sortsAGoverning by regulations of the Sangha is as follows The ecclesiastical chief of each region has the right the authority and the responsibility to administer his jurisdiction in accordance with all of his stipulated duties including the procedures to be followed in appointing officials on the regional provincial district and township levels in appointing the abbots of temples preceptors and minor officials and in delegating responsibilities on each levelThis being the case each of these officials should use his powers strictly in accordance with the regulations and guidelines set down by the Sangha authoritiesAnyone who sees that he is unqualified in a particular area should not accept appointment in that areaAt the same time those who make the appointments if they see that a particular individual is unqualified should not appoint him to a position of responsibilityIf he is appointed it will be damaging to that area and destructive to the religionBGoverning by Vinaya One should explain to those who come under ones authority the various procedures connected with the Vinaya so that they will understand how to follow themPoint out how and in what sort of places a ñattikamma is to be performedPoint out what sorts of acts should be performed as ñattidutiyakamma how they are to be performed where when and with how large a chapter of monksPoint out what sorts of acts should be performed as ñatticatutthakamma on what sorts of occasions and with how large a chapter of monks so as to be correct according to procedureOn the whole there are still great discrepancies in following these procedures even within the individual sectsWhen we compare the different sects the differences are even greaterThis being the case whose responsibility is it to govern the Sangha so that there is uniformity throughoutTo have standards means to weld discipline to justice  or in other words Dhamma and VinayaFor example we should have standards in the way we worship and chant  how the words are to be pronounced according to the Magadha and Sanyoga traditions and which tradition to use on which occasionsThere should be guidelines concerning this that are consistently followed everywhere and similar guidelines concerning the way we dress and use the necessities of life so that we will all be orderly and in proper line with one anotherOtherwise there will be discrepancies high and lowIf there is order however even the differences of high and low will present an acceptable appearanceHaving standards is thus an important part of governanceIf the authorities were really sincere about carrying out their duties instead of simply letting things slide it would help lead to the growth and prosperity of the religionOn the whole though there is a tendency in the area of governance not to look after things and simply to let them beThis has led to factions and splits within the monkhood each group taking offense at the way other groups behaveThus close adherence to the Vinaya and to the standards of order would lead to concord with no need for force or compulsion concord that would come of its own from the good and noble standards of the religionEvery official  and every monk and novice as well  should be strict in keeping his personal conduct within the bounds of the Vinaya so as not to abolish any of the training rules by means of his behaviorIn other words whatever has been set down by the Buddha should not be abolished through not observing it and at the same time whatever was not set down by the Buddha should not be established as a new observance through the example of ones behaviorThere are many kinds of standards and procedures related to the Vinaya that must be studied practiced and observedTaken together they are called vinayakammaSome vinayakamma are our own personal responsibility in training ourselvesFor example Vacikamma Any words whose purpose would be incorrect in light of the Vinaya should not be spoken in any circumstancesSpeak only those words that would be classed as Right SpeechManokamma We are bound to have thoughts that tend toward the accumulation of defilement and lead to transgressions of the training rules such as abhijjha greed focused on the four necessities of life byapada ill will and malevolence micchaditthi wrong views that would draw the mind into ways running counter to the standards of the VinayaIf we dont correct such mental states we are bound to break the training rulesFor this reason we should establish ourselves in all four of the Principles of Purity bIndriyasanvarasila Keeping watch over our senses of sight hearing smell taste feeling and ideation so as to keep them quiet and restrained and to do away with any defilements pertaining to the training rulescAjivaparisuddhisila Maintaining our livelihood in an honest and aboveboard manner not asking for anything by word or deed in circumstances ruled out by the Vinaya training ourselves to have few wants keeping our conduct in line with the standards of the Vinaya searching for the necessities of life with the proper attitude in each stage of the search Muñcayacetana When going through the actions of searching maintain purity in thought and deedAparaparacetana Once the desired item has been obtained use it in line with the regulations laid down in the VinayaThis is called dPaccavekkhanasila Reflecting carefully before using thingsThe act of reflection gives results on many levels Then we should reflect further on the fact that all things are made up of impersonal elements or properties foul and repugnant that they are inconstant stressful and notself  not beings not individuals not my self or anyone elsesWhen we consider things correctly in accordance with the standards of the Vinaya we are genuinely exercising good internal governance over ourselvesThe ultimate standards for judging clearly whether or not we are governing ourselves well are as followsWhatever behavior aims at the creation of suffering for oneself or for others is neither Dhamma nor VinayaWhatever behavior leads to the accumulation of defilement is neither Dhamma nor VinayaWhatever behavior aims at status and prestige is neither Dhamma nor VinayaWhatever behavior leads away from having few wants is neither Dhamma nor VinayaWhatever behavior aims at entanglement with others is neither Dhamma nor VinayaWhatever behavior leads to laziness and carelessness is neither Dhamma nor VinayaWhatever behavior makes one a burden to others is neither Dhamma nor VinayaTo be able to conduct yourself in this manner means that you are able to govern yourselfAnd when a person can govern himself he develops authority from within through the disciplinary standards enabling him to govern others wellThis is what is meant by governing by VinayaGoverning by Dhamma This means to govern with ones own inner quality as a person ie having rectitude constantly in the heart keeping the mind firmly established in Right View by fostering discernment through the practice of meditation developing Right Concentration so as to wipe out the fetters of sexual lust  which include for example sensual desire a willingness to give in to sensual moods which tends toward mental pain and stressWhen a persons mind falls under the power of such fetters it means that there is no quality to himFor the mind to lack quality means that it has fallen in with the mental HindrancesByapada ill will and malevolenceThinamiddha discouragement apathy laziness not making the effort to center the mind in the factors of jhana not developing a theme of meditation in the mindThe mind thus surrenders to lethargy and discouragement abandoning its duties and responsibilitiesThis makes it restless and a prey to distraction unable to put a halt to its train of thoughtThis is called UddhaccakukkuccaWhen this is the case then no matter how much Dhamma one may study the heart is still dark and blindedWhatever one knows or sees is unclearOnes conduct is lax and lacking unable to progress to anything of higher valueFor the heart to be caught on a snag like this is termed Vicikiccha doubt uncertainty indecision an inability to go forward or turn backWhen this is the case the mind is classed as having no qualityIn other words it lacks the concentration that will give rise to discernment and the skill of releaseThose however who can escape from the Hindrances and center the mind into jhana or concentration will give rise to discernment the power to keep their defilements within the bounds of rectitude and to unbind their goodness so that it can govern others effortlessly achieving their own wellbeing and that of others through the power of their governanceThey will awaken from the mundane world and the supreme good  Dhamma  will appear within themThis is what it means for the heart to have qualityMost of us by and large have no constant quality in our heartsInstead we go looking for quality in things outside and so can never succeed or find securityWhen this is the case were unfit to govern ourselves  and if were unfit to govern ourselves then to govern others for the sake of their betterment will be extremely difficultThis concludes our discussion of the Department of Internal Governance and the duties of those who accept responsibility in this areaThis is all there is to the Department of Internal GovernanceWhoever has responsibilities in this area must constantly bear his duties in mind if he is to contribute to the true prosperity of the religionOtherwise the establishment of this department will be empty and in vain yielding no fullfledged benefitsThe point to remember is that the governance of the Sangha in Thailand is of three sortsThis is all it comes down toIf we were to discuss this point in detail there would be much more to sayNow however we will go on to discuss Part IIEducation in Buddhism  of the kind that gives knowledge conducive to the prosperity of the religion  is of three sorts as followsPeople who are learned  who have studied and memorized a great deal  fall into two groupsThe first group contains those who have studied in line with the curriculum of the Department ie the official textbooks known as Nak Dhamma levels and or the Pali courses levels Whether or not one passes the examinations is not importantWhat is important is the knowledge gainedThis sort of education gives rise to one level of understanding termed sutamayapañña  discernment acquired through studyThe second group contains those who study on their own  listening to sermons reading textbooks studying the Vinaya Suttas and Abhidhamma discussing questions with one another which can lead to understanding on a higher level so that one may apply ones knowledge to training oneselfBoth groups are classed as being on the elementary level of education in the study of BuddhismThe study of memorized doctrine is of three sorts Thus to gain an education without then conducting oneself in line with the Dhamma can be called studying like a snakeSuch a person makes himself into a cobras head spreading his venom into anyone who comes nearTo consort with such a person is to consort with a fool and can poison the mind drawing it into evil and unskillful ways such as searching for wellbeing with reference only to this lifetime without looking for what is more worthwhile  ones wellbeing in future lifetimes  or for what is most worthwhile the liberation of nibbanaStudying for the sake of emancipation When we have studied the Dhamma and Vinaya and learned what is good and evil right and wrong skillful and unskillful we shouldnt do whatever we see as wrong or harmful to ourselves and othersInstead we should develop whatever is gracious and good benefiting ourselves and others in any of the following three ways Having learned the factors that promote wellbeing in the present life we should give rise to them for ourselves and othersHaving learned what is necessary to bring about our wellbeing in future lifetimes  going to a good bourn or the heavenly realms in the next life  we should conduct ourselves accordinglyAs for the ultimate wellbeing  nibbana  when we have learned what sort of person it will appear in and how to behave so as to be worthy of it we should then foster the qualities within ourselves necessary to bring it aboutThe qualities leading to these sorts of benefits are four bViriya persistence in making the effort to relinquish the evil within ourselves an unwillingness to lie wallowing in our evils persistence in fostering virtue within ourselves in maintaining and developing the virtues we already have and in using them for the wellbeing of othersThis is termed viriyiddhipada  persistence as a factor leading to successcCitta Whatever task we undertake we should be fully intent on it and not shirk our dutiesWe should try to develop our virtuous actions so that they reach the goal the supreme wellbeing to which we all aspireWhatever happiness is appropriate to us in this life we should bring it about through our own intentness of purposeWhatever happiness should arise in future lifetimes we should set our hearts on striving to cultivate itAs for the happiness unrelated to worldly baits we should focus our whole attention on correctly developing the path to reach itWe will then be able to attain our goal without a doubtdVimansa circumspectionThe discernment gained from our studies should be put into practice in line with the factors of the Noble PathBefore doing anything in thought word or deed we should first run things through carefully in the mind from beginning to end and only then go ahead and actWe should give rise to the mental virtue termed Right ConcentrationConcentration gives rise to discernment and when the discernment of liberating insight arises within us it leads to the happiness that lies beyond the worldTo be circumspect and thoroughly aware that whatever will not be beneficial to ourselves or others should not be done and that whatever will lead to our own wellbeing and that of others  in this life in the next or in the ultimate sense  should be fostered within ourselves through our own circumspection and discernment This is vimansiddhipada  circumspection as a factor leading to successWhen we do this we will reap two sorts of results iddhiriddhi  the power that arises from being established in these four qualities and puññariddhi  the influence that arises from our own inner virtueIddhiriddhi is authority puññariddhi is kindnessTo have these two qualities is to be a person with two eyes two ears two nostrils two arms two legs  puriso a complete human being who can help others become complete in their hearts as wellThis is what it means to be a person who studies for the sake of emancipationStudying to be a treasurer This refers to the education of a person who has already finished the training  ie an arahant one who has gained release from all defilementsWhy does such a person have to studyFor the sake of the work of the religion so as to be of assistance in helping Buddhism to prosperWhen was it ever the case that a person had to be thoroughly acquainted with all aspects of formulated Dhamma and customs before doing away with defilementSome people are born in lowerclass families others in upperclass familiesSome have a great deal of social sophistication others dontStill they are able to free their minds from defilement by means of the practice for in practice it isnt necessary to know a great deal of formulated DhammaEven a person who knows only a fair amount can still put an end to defilementSo when such a person sees that he can be of help to others he must educate himselfHis study is for the sake of gaining a sense of the differences in societies in communities and in types of individuals to gain a sense of time and place to know the varieties of beliefs and customs that people adhere toWhen he becomes thoroughly and properly acquainted with all customs and conventions he can then deal effectively with other people for their benefitThis is why he must study and take an interest in such thingsEducation of this sort is thus called studying to be a treasurer and is an aspect of the Department of EducationThese then are the three forms of studying memorized DhammaWhen we have studied  in whichever way  we mustnt stop thereWe should take all the Dhamma we have learned and chew it over with our own discernmentTo chew things over in this way  thinking and evaluating  may give rise to a flavor different from that of our previous educationWe think things through on our own instead of simply believing what other people say or what is written in booksWe believe our own sense of reason discovered within ourselves and termed paccattam  individual and personalThis sort of education grows out of the earlier sort in the same way that a person who has learned how to read the letters of the alphabet can then go on to use that knowledge to read textbooks and gain knowledge more valuable than the alphabet on its ownTo make a comparison with food this second form of education has more flavor than the firstThe first sort of education is like taking food arranging it according to type  maincourse dishes in one group desserts in another  and then finding delight simply in seeing it arrangedThe second form of education  thinking evaluating reasoning things through  is like taking the food and tasting itThe person who does this gets much more use out of the food than the person who simply sits and looks at it He can nourish his body and know whether or not the food tastes good whether its sour or sweet very sweet or just a little sweet  all on his ownThis is what it means to pursue this second form of education properlyTo study in this way gives rise to the flavor of the Dhamma which can then be used to nourish the heartWhen the heart is fed on what is truly nourishing it gains strength in the area of the Dhamma termed Viriyabala The quality of perseverance becomes dominantWe become resolute and courageous in practicing what is goodSatibala Our powers of mindfulness become allencompassing in the great frame of referenceSamadhibala The mind develops the steadiness and strength termed heightened consciousness beyond the power of the HindrancesPaññabala Right Understanding which comes from the sense of reason fostered in the heart through circumspectionUnderstanding is strength that can make the mind energetic competent and powerfulDiscernment acquired through reflection can give rise to the flavor of the Dhamma through the act of thinking but for thought to be truly nourishing and energizing we must go on to develop discernment through meditation so as to be complete in our practiceComing to know ourselves We should study and investigate ourselves so as to gain knowledge exclusively within by centering the heart in concentrationTo study ourselves by ourselves means to study by means of our own inner alphabet  the various parts put together out of the four properties within the body the five khandhas and the six sense mediaTo study on this level means to study with and within the mind investigating the inner alphabetAll five are things that a contemplative should studyUsually before we become ordained we dont even know our own inner ABCs much less how to spellSo our preceptors out of concern for us as their sons in the monkhood teach us these five things even before we become monks and novicesBut if we neglect them after our ordination it shows that we have no respect for education and no reverence for the teachings of the Lord BuddhaThis is the cause for degeneracy in the Department of EducationTo be able to read all of the parts in ones body and to teach others to do the same is to qualify as a member of the Sangha or as a true disciple of the Lord BuddhaWe should study all four or all six of the properties within us  earth water wind and fire  as a basis for tranquillity meditation giving rise to jhana by thinking about and evaluating the parts of the body until we gain an understanding of earth water wind and fire together with space and cognizance the overseer of the houseStudy the five khandhas  body feelings labels mental constructs and cognizanceKeep careful restraint over the six sense media  eye and visual objects ear and sounds nose and smells tongue and tastes body and tactile sensations intellect and thoughtsThe mind will then enter the first level of jhana composed of thinking evaluating rapture ease and singleness of preoccupationSuch a person thus goes on to a higher level of education comparable to high school or secondary educationWhen the heart becomes quiet a cool and refreshing sense of pleasure called rasa the flavor and nourishment of the Dhamma will appear in itAttha We will realize the aims of the Dhamma and our own aspirations as wellStudying on this level will give rise to a higher level of knowledge termed liberating insight  clear comprehension in terms of the four Noble Truths  enabling us to go beyond suffering and stressThis is termed the awareness of releaseWe will gain a special knowledge that is apart from all of the mundane things we may have learned This is transcendent knowledge that beginning with liberating insight enables us to escape one after another the fortress walls of the citadel of DeathThe citadel of Death has ten walls Doubt uncertainty about the paths and fruitions leading to nibbanaAttachment to precepts and practices groping about ie undependability in our behavior which leads us to clutch at various beliefs searching for absolute standards of good outside of the acts of our own heart and mindSensual passion desire caused by the power of defilementIrritation annoyance coming from the minds sense of being struck or disturbedPassion for form attachment to certain kinds of physical phenomenaPassion for formless phenomena attachment to mental phenomena such as feelings of pleasureConceit construing ourselves to be this or thatRestlessness distraction the minds tendency to get engrossed or carried awayUnawareness delusion ignorance being unacquainted with cause and effect and out of touch with what is trueAll ten of these factors are walls in the citadel of DeathNo one who lacks discernment will be able to destroy them which is why the Buddha was especially insistent on this level of education teaching his followers to study it from the very day of their ordination so that their education would be completeTo summarize there are three aspects to this third level of education Learning to spell Taking the consonants  such as the four properties of earth water wind and fire  and then adding the vowels  feelings labels mental constructs and cognizance  so that there is awareness of the six sense media enabling us to know that there are good sights good sounds good smells good tastes good tactile sensations and good ideas in the world and that sometimes things that are not so good can also come in through the six sense mediaThe awareness that enters in and interacts in this way can be called patisandhiviññana  cognizance connected with physical phenomena interacting with physical phenomena enabling us to know all levels of good and badWhen we are able to evaluate and choose what is good and bad within ourselves we qualify as being able to read knowing thoroughly all the ways our inner alphabet works in practiceLearning to make sense of it all The word sense here has two meaningsbComprehending all the various parts into which we are analyzed  the parts of the body the properties the khandhas and the six sense media  or what it all comes down to the body and mind plus the activity of thought word and deedTo put it briefly all things are achieved through the heartThe heart comes before all elseAll things are excelled by the heart and made from the heartA trained heart is the most superlative thing there isWhen we have tasted within ourselves the flavor and nourishment of all dhammas  mundane and transcendent  thenWe have performed the entirety of the holy lifeOur training in the holy life is perfect and pureThis is what it means to graduate to finish our higher education in the Buddhas teachingsWhoever has duties in the area of education then should attend to themOtherwise Buddhism is sure to degenerate because of our own lack of educationIf this happens the Department of Education established by the Sangha authorities will be futile and worthless due to our own misunderstanding of its meaning and aimsThis department is another important area in that it works for the convenience of the Sangha through improving repairing and maintaining the physical surroundings in which we liveTo be specific its duties are to build and repair inspect and maintain our dwellings or monasteries so that they will qualify as senasanasappaya  comfortable amenable places for contemplatives to stayMeditating monks by and large tend to have fixed notions about this area believing that to sponsor or do construction work for the sake of Buddhists at large is to devote oneself to merely material concerns and that such work thus shouldnt be doneSome even believe that work of this sort closes off the paths and fruitions leading to nibbanaNevertheless these people have not gone beyond the material benefits they criticizeFor this reason we should examine the area of building and development to see whether or not it is appropriate and accords with the VinayaI would like to divide the duties in this area into two sorts in line with the two major duties of those who are ordained AThe duty of study Those monks who are gamavasi or village dwellers are responsible for improving repairing and developing the places in which they live for the sake of the common good of Buddhists at largeWhen building they should have a sense of scale order and beauty so that their buildings will fit in with their physical surroundingsFor example monks quarters restrooms meeting halls and ordination halls should be arranged in so far as possible in an orderly way in keeping with their functionsOnce built they should be kept clean and in repair so as to contribute to the beauty of their surroundingsIf anything is lacking and one is in a position to search for it by proper means then obtain and maintain it in a righteous manner for the sake of ones own convenience and that of the groupAll of these activities form a part of the duty of study improving and developing the place in which we liveBThe duty of meditation This refers to those monks termed araññavasi or forest dwellers who search for secluded areas appropriate for meditation such as those mentioned in the Pali under the shade of a tree in a secluded dwelling under a leanto far from settled areas in a quiet tower under an overhanging rock in a cave in a forest in a cemetery or in a deserted buildingOne should learn how to select such a place and how to keep it clean and neat for the sake of ones convenience as a meditator while living thereThis is building and development in the forest Observing ones duties in caring for ones dwelling improving and maintaining order in ones surroundings and improving oneself while living thereThis is building and development on the external level one sign of a person who knows how to maintain himself in physical seclusionAs for internal building and development one should build a shelter for the mind viharadhamma a home for the heartOne should foster magga the path to ones home and phala the goodness that arises in the heart as a resultThe shelter along the way is Right Concentration the four levels of jhanaThis is the true shelter for those who are ordainedOnce we have been ordained as contemplatives we should realize that we come under this particular department and so should perform our duties properlyBut by and large we dont understand the true aims of the various departments and so grope around in external matters without building or developing any internal qualities that can give the heart shelterWhen the heart has no internal quality as its shelter it will go living outside building and helping only other peopleIf the heart is entangled with external matters then after death it will be reborn attached to physical objects and possessionsThose who are attached to their monasteries will be reborn there as guardian spiritsThose who are attached to their quarters their ordination halls their meeting halls their bodies will be reborn right thereThis is called sensual clinging Whatever object we cling to there we will be rebornFor example there is a story told in the Dhammapada Commentary of a monk who received a robe that gave him great satisfaction and of which he became very possessiveWhen he died he was reborn as a louse right there in the robe all because he had no inner quality as a dwelling for the heartSo for our building and development to go beyond physical objects we should build and repair a shelter for the heartOnly then will we be qualified to take on external duties  and in performing our duties we should be careful not to let our inner home become overgrown with the weeds of defilement or to let the termites of the Hindrances eat into itDont let vermin lizards or lice  character flaws  take up residence insideRoof the home of the heart  jhana  with restraint of the senses so that the fires of passion aversion and delusion dont burn it downTo purify the principles of our conduct is to clear and grade our propertyTo give rise to jhana is to build a home for ourselvesTo develop discernment within the mind is to light our homeWe will then be safe both while we stay and when we goWhen we are able to do this it will lead to the true prosperity of the religionThis is what it means to observe our duties in the area of building and developmentWays of spreading the Dhamma fall into three categoriesThis refers to the appointment of monks in the various divisions to teach and train the populace at largeIn addition the establishment of syllabi such as the Nak Dhamma courses and the appointment of teachers to instruct in accordance with them can also be classed as a means of spreading the DhammaSpreading the Dhamma can give rise to many sorts of benefits  welfare in this life welfare in lives to come and acquaintance with the ultimate welfare  nibbanaThese are the aims of spreading the Dhamma by means of the written and spoken word which is one aspect of the good that Buddhism has to offerbMaintenance We should take good care of the possessions we have earned and take good care of ourselves  which we have also worked hard to earn  so as not to fall into ways that are evil or wrongcHaving admirable friends We should associate with good people and avoid associating with immoral people who would lead us astray and cause our possessions to be squandered awaydAn appropriate life style We should spend our earnings wisely and provide for our needs in a proper wayWe should avoid spending our earnings in wrong ways that would soil how we liveThese four principles form the way to wellbeing in this lifetime but we shouldnt be shortsighted or unrealisticThe truth of the matter is that each and every human being born will have to die and be parted from the happiness found in this worldThis being the case we must provide for our welfare in the lives to comeThe way to happiness in the lives to come as taught by the religion is as follows bVirtue We should be true to our moral principles and train ourselves to be fullfledged human beings in thought word and deedWhatever we do should be done with honesty and rectitudecGenerosity We should be mature in our generosity making donations to others for instance as we are ableTo be giving in this way the Buddha teaches is a Noble Treasure bearing dividends both in this life and in lives to comeIf we are not giving of our possessions they will bear us fruit only in this lifetimeAt death they will vanishWe wont be able to transfer them for use in the next life just as Thai currency cant be used outside the boundaries of our countryWhen a person travels abroad he wont be able to use his native currency at all unless he is sensible enough to exchange his money beforehand and deposit it in an appropriate bankOnly then will it be of use to him when he goes abroadIn the same way sensible people deposit their possessions in the bank called the field of merit When they sacrifice their wealth in this way it becomes a Noble Treasure bearing dividends on the road aheadAnd this doesnt apply only to possessions When a person crosses the border from one country into another even his native language wont be of any useThe Buddha thus taught us a foreign language  chanting and the meditative practice of developing good will and lovingkindness  to serve us as language in the world to comedDiscernment We should be circumspect and judicious in all our actionsOtherwise we will act under the influence of such forms of delusion as chandagati  being prejudiced by affection with no reasonable thought for right or wrong bhayagati  being prejudiced by fear with no thought for what is reasonable dosagati  being prejudiced by anger and dislike with no thought for right or wrong and mohagati  being prejudiced by delusion mistaking right for wrong and wrong for rightTo act in any of these ways means that we have no discernmentFor this reason whatever we may do in the area of making merit we should first weigh things carefully and properly before actingOnly then will we qualify as being mature in our discernmentThese four practices open the way to a good bourn in the next life ie in heaven but even then we will still have to go whirling along the cycle of death and rebirthIf we have strong conviction we will be able to develop ourselves so as to go beyond this to the level of the ultimate welfare attaining the levels of transcendent virtueThis sort of virtue is something that all Buddhists should aim forThe prerequisites are twoWhen we possess these qualities they will serve as our tools  regardless of whether we are sharpwitted or dull men or women people with many defilements or with only a fewOnce we have set our sights we should then develop two practices that form the path to nibbana binsight meditation developing discernment in the mind gaining internal insight seeing through to the natural condition of the Dhamma that lies within usThe natural condition of the Dhamma is this birth momentary existence disbanding  like a wave on the seaWhen the wind blows great waves rise on the oceanThe same holds true with human life The natural condition of the khandhas within us behaves like a waveThis is called the natural condition of the DhammaAnother condition though stays as it is whether or not there are waves  just as the water of the sea when there is no wind is smooth level and clearThis natural condition in the heart  a condition that does not take birth does not change is not annihilated and does not die but simply stays as it is  lies within each and every one of usThese two practices  tranquillity and insight meditation  lead to the ultimate welfare nibbanaThe two natural conditions lie within each of usThose who know how to spread the Dhamma into themselves teaching and counseling themselves will attain wellbeing without a doubtSpreading the Dhamma by practicing it without having to use words simply behaving well so as to be an example to others through ones behavior This is an important factor in spreading the DhammaOur Lord Buddha for example was once staying in a forest with a following of monksAs twilight fell he rested inclining on his right side while the monks all did walking or sitting meditationNo one was talkingEverything was perfectly stillJust then a group of wandering ascetics came into the forest and seeing this were completely won overThey felt so inspired by the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha that they were willing to become disciplesLater they were of great help in spreading the religionThis shows that good and proper practice is an extremely important force in spreading the DhammaNot only human beings but even animals are able to follow the example of others behavior as when a man with a crippled leg leads a horse with sound legs around on a tether In no time at all the horse will learn to walk with a limpAs the leader goes so go his followers as the mould is shaped so are the items mouldedGood behavior is thus a way of spreading the religion that has a deep and telling influence on the hearts of those who come afterThis is one of our true duties within the religionEven if our defilements may be heavy and thick we can still be of service to others in this wayThus in spreading the Buddhas teachings its not enough simply to get up and deliver a sermonA person with discretion in teaching the Dhamma can convince others of its value in a variety of ways by his manners as already mentioned or by adesanapatihariya  the marvel of knowing another persons thoughts or by anusasanipatihariya  the marvel of teaching that when put into practice gives the promised resultsAll of these are means of spreading the Buddhas teachingsIn some areas of religious work spreading the Dhamma is done via the mind  as for example when the Venerable Culapanthaka performed a psychic marvel that astounded those who saw inspiring conviction reverence and awe in their heartsThose who had never before felt inspired by the Buddhas teachings suddenly became inspired because of those eventsOther instances were performed by the Buddha himself as when he went to break the pride of the three Kassapa brothersHe went out in the rain without getting wet did walking meditation in the flood without getting wet which led the elder Kassapa to abandon his stiffnecked pride  and when he had abandoned his pride the Buddha was able to teach him the DhammaKassapa and his followers saw the Dhamma appear within themselves experienced the paths fruitions and nibbana and proclaimed themselves followers of the BuddhaThey were then of great help in spreading the religionAnother example is when the Buddha subdued the bandit AngulimalaAs Angulimala ran chasing after him the Buddha radiated good will through the power of jhana causing the earth between them to rise and fall in great waves until Angulimala tired from his running called out in surrenderThe Buddha then instructed him to the point where he was so impressed and convinced that he was eventually able to make his heart attain the DhammaThere are many other examples of this sort by which the Buddha was able to proclaim the religion so that it has lasted into the present dayIf we take spreading the Dhamma to be simply a matter of words it wouldnt have been  and wont be  enoughThus spreading the Dhamma is done in three waysBBy word  teaching and explaining the Dhamma out loud giving rise to understanding and inspiration in those who hearBy thoughtWhen one has seen with the power of intuitive understanding that a person is ready to receive the Dhamma one should spread thoughts of good will dedicating the fruits of ones merit to that personThis way of spreading the Dhamma can be done both in public and in private with those who are near and those who are far awayIt can help certain human and divine beings and inspire conviction in those whose dispositions lie within the net of the Dhamma all without having to say a wordThis has been termed anointing with the waters of benevolence The good will that lies in the heart is like a cooling currentWherever this current is directed through the power of a radiant heart it can draw other beings both human and divine to become inspired to develop the qualities of their hearts in line with their varying dispositionsEven if we have yet to meet them and have simply heard news we can still cause their hearts to become cool and refreshed contributing to their welfare and happinessSpreading the Dhamma in this way is beneficial both to us and to othersTo be able to do this though we must first give rise to sufficient quality in our own heartsIf the quality isnt yet there then build it and dedicate it first of all to those to whom you owe kamma debts Spread this goodness to fill the bodySpread this goodness to fill the mindThis sense of fullness is what is meant by rapture  ie full of what is skillfulGoodness fills the heart refreshing it with what is skillfulWhen goodness fills the body and mind it is like water filling a tank or saturating the earthWherever the earth is saturated with water there the trees and vegetation flourishBut if we dont have enough goodness within were like a tank without any water No matter how far the faucet is opened only wind will come outThe coolness of wind and the coolness of water are two very different thingsThe coolness of wind can cause trees to wither and can send dust clouds flying but the coolness of water is useful in many ways It can be used to wash clothes to bathe the body to drink or to sprinkle on the ground nourishing plants and softening the earthNot only that it can also give a deep sense of refreshmentIn the same way people who practice the Dhamma even if they dont speak a word but simply spread thoughts of good will can be of great benefit to people at largeThis is termed mettaparami  the perfection of benevolenceSo when goodness arises within us we can work for the welfare of others even when we sit with our eyes closed perfectly stillBut its the nature of ignorant people to believe that such a person is simply saving his own skinThey havent looked deep insideThe teachers of the past thus made a comparison with thunder and rainSome people can teach others but they themselves have no inner goodnessSuch people are called thunder without rainThey can cause others to feel awe and respect but can give no sense of cooling refreshmentSome people are like rain without thunderThey rarely speak but spread thoughts of good will dedicating their merit to othersThey have received their own full measure of inner goodness and so can give goodness and inspire conviction in the hearts of others even when simply sitting stillThose who find peace and calm in the shelter of such an influence will in turn feel the highest form of respectSome people are like rain with thunder and others rain with thunder and wind to boot This for those who are able is the best of allSuch people after having developed their own inner goodness are able to teach others spreading the Dhamma by thought word and deed giving results in many ways People who are stubborn and fixed in their opinions will be able to soften in an instant just as giant trees bend before the windAt the same time teachers of this sort can be an example to others through their behavior and the kindness of their hearts feeling no envy for the goodness of others but only compassion providing the shelter of mental peace to all sorts of peopleThis is the way to spread the Dhamma fully and completely causing the religion to prosper in the true and proper wayThe field of spreading the Dhamma is extremely importantThose who practice it will get results in two waysBy knowing how to use authority  the power of the mind  so as to be of benefitBy knowing how to use compassion  the goodness of the heart  so as to benefit their fellow human beings with no need for power of any sort whatsoeverOnly those who can act in this manner are qualified for the Department of Spreading the DhammaWhen the duties of all these departments are fully observed by a community a group or an individual they will help the religion to prosper and thriveBut as long as we are unable to fulfill these duties the establishment of directives for each of the various departments is meaningless and can lead Im afraid only to the disappearance of the Buddhas teachings as happened in IndiaThis is why I have asked to explain our organization and duties so that we will all be thoroughly acquainted with themIt will be ideal if each individual can observe the duties of all four departments and to be true to the Dhamma each of us should regard all of these duties as his own personal responsibilityIf we pay attention only to the directives and rules we will be deficient in our duties and the establishment of the various departments will be a waste of timeAll the thought and consideration devoted to our welfare will be fruitlessThus we should use our authority and inner virtues in observing our duties firmly and properly for the sake of the good order of the religionIf I were to explain things at length there would be much more to say but I will stop for the time being with this condensed discussion of the main points at issue which should be enough to serve us as an adequate guideIf there is anything in any way wrong or defective in what I have written here I ask the readers forgivenessApalokanakamma A procedure to use in conducting communal business of the Sangha in which certain noncontroversial issues are settled simply with an informal announcementThe following terms  ñattikamma ñattidutiyakamma and ñatticatutthakamma  refer to procedures where the issue must be settled by a formal motion stated once twice or four times giving all the monks present the opportunity to object to the motion before it is carriedAttha Meaning sense aim resultAvijja Unawareness counterfeit knowledgeAyatana Sense mediumThe six inner sense media are the eye ear nose tongue body and intellectThe six outer sense media are their respective objectsBhagavant An epithet for the Buddha commonly translated as Blessed One or Exalted One Some commentators though have traced the word etymologically to the Pali root meaning to divide and by extension to analyze and so translate it as AnalystDhamma Event phenomenon the way things are in and of themselves their inherent qualities the basic principles underlying their behaviorAlso principles of behavior that human beings should follow so as to fit in with the right natural order of things qualities of mind they should develop so as to realize the inherent quality of the mind in and of itselfBy extension dhamma is used also to refer to any doctrine that teaches such thingsThus the Dhamma of the Buddha refers both to his teachings and to the direct experience of the quality of nibbana at which those teachings are aimedDhatu Element property the elementary properties that make up the inner sense of the body and mind earth water fire wind space and cognizanceJhana Meditative absorption in a single object notion or sensationKamma Acts of intention that result in states of being and birthKamma debts are the moral debts one has to others either through having been a burden to them or from having wronged themKhandha Component parts of sensory perception rupa vedana sañña sankhara and viññanaMagga The path to the cessation of suffering and stressThe four transcendent paths  or rather one path with four levels of refinement  are the path to streamentry the path to oncereturning the path to nonreturning and the path to arahantshipPhala  fruition  refers to the mental state immediately following the attainment of any of these pathsMala Stains on the character traditionally listed as nine anger hypocrisy envy stinginess deceit treachery lying evil desires and wrong viewsNibbana Liberation the unbinding of the mind from greed anger and delusion from physical sensations and mental actsAs this term is used to refer also to the extinguishing of fire it carries connotations of stilling cooling and peacePatimokkha The basic monastic code composed of training rulesPuñña Inner worth merit the inner sense of wellbeing that comes from having acted rightly or well and that enables one to continue acting wellPuññakkhetta Field of merit  an epithet for the SanghaSangha The community of the Buddhas disciplesOn the ideal level this refers to all those whether lay or ordained who have reached at least the path to streamentryOn the conventional level it refers to the Buddhist monkhoodIn Thai it also refers to the central administration of the Thai monkhood and to any individual monkTraditionally Sangha does NOT refer to all BuddhistsThe traditional term for the entire assembly of the Buddhas followers  ordained or not awakened or not  is buddhaparisaThe reason for this distinction is that Sangha is one of a Buddhists three refuges and not all members of the buddhaparisa can be taken as refugeSankhara Fashioning  the forces that fashion things the process of fashioning and the fashioned things  mental or physical  that resultIn some contexts this term refers specifically to the fashioning of thoughts in the mindIn others it refers to all five khandhasVinaya The monastic disciplineThe Buddhas own name for the religion he founded was this DhammaVinaya this doctrine and disciplineIf anything in this translation is inaccurate or misleading I ask forgiveness of the author and reader for having unwittingly stood in their wayAs for whatever may be accurate I hope the reader will make the best use of it translating it a few steps further into the heart so as to attain the truth at which it points The translatorPeople all over the world who are interested in Buddhism and keep in touch with its news and activities must have heard of the Buddha Jayanti celebrations held a few years ago in all Buddhist countries including India and JapanIt was in or according to the reckoning of some Buddhist countries in that Buddhism as founded by Gotama the Buddha had completed itsth year of existenceThe Buddhist tradition especially of the Theravada or Southern School such as now prevails in Burma Ceylon Cambodia Laos and Thailand has it that on the completion of years from its foundation Buddhism would undergo a great revival resulting in its allround progress in both the fields of study and practiceBuddhists throughout the world therefore commemorated the occasion in  by various kinds of activities such as meetings symposia exhibitions and the publication of Buddhist texts and literatureAs to whether or not the tradition mentioned above has any truth behind it the future alone will testifyHowever judging from news received from all corners of the globe it is no exaggeration to say that mankind is taking an everincreasing interest in BuddhismAs a matter of fact since the end of the Second World War interest in Buddhism as evinced by people in Europe America and Australia has reached a scale unheard of beforeAny casual perusal of journals on Buddhism in any of these continents will convince the readers of this statementIt is a matter worth noticing that after the end of the First World War also Buddhism made great headway in Europe and elsewhereThis phenomenon can perhaps be best explained by the fact that mankinds spiritual thirst is more sharpened by calamities like war and that in times of distress mankind realizes Truth betterThailand is perhaps the only country in the world where the king is constitutionally stipulated to be a Buddhist and the upholder of the FaithFor centuries Buddhism has established itself in Thailand and has enriched the lives of the Thais in all their aspectsIndeed without Buddhism Thailand would not be what it is todayOwing to the tremendous influence Buddhism exerts on the lives of its people Thailand is called by many foreigners The Land of Yellow Robes for yellow robes are the garments of Buddhist monksIn view of the increasing interest the world is taking in Buddhism and in view of the fact that Thailand is one of the countries where Buddhism still exists as a living force it will not perhaps be out of place to know something of the story of how this great faith reached that countryDifferent opinions exist about when exactly Buddhism reached that part of the world now officially known as ThailandSome scholars say that Buddhism was introduced to Thailand during the reign of Asoka the great Indian emperor who sent Buddhist missionaries to various parts of the then known worldOthers are of the view that Thailand received Buddhism much laterJudging from archaeological finds and other historical evidence however it is safe to say that Buddhism first reached Thailand when the country was inhabited by a racial stock of people known as the MonKhmer who then had their capital Dvaravati at a city now known as Nakon Pathom about kilometers to the west of BangkokThe great pagoda at Nakon Pathom Phra Pathom Chedi and other historical findings in other parts of the country testify to this fact as well as to the fact that Buddhism in its varied forms reached Thailand at four different periods namelyWe shall now proceed to study each of these periods in detailThat the first form of Buddhism introduced to Thailand was that of Theravada School is proved by various archaeological remains unearthed in the excavations at Nakon Pathom such as the Dharma Chakra the Buddha footprints and seats and the inscriptions in the Pali language all of which are in rocksSuch objects of Buddhistic veneration existed in India before the introduction of the Buddha image which appeared later as a result of Greek influenceBuddhism therefore must have reached Thailand during the rd century BC and it must have been more or less the same form of Buddhism as was propagated by the great Buddhist Emperor AsokaThis form of Buddhism was known as Theravada or Hinayana in contradistinction to the term Mahayana the two schools having sprung up soon after the passing away of the BuddhaWhen worship of the Buddha image became popular in India it also spread to other countries where Buddhism had already been introducedThis is borne out by the fact that many Buddha images especially those of the Gupta style had been found in the ruins of Nakon Pathom and the neighboring citiesJudging from the style of the Buddha images found it can also be assumed that the early Buddhist missionaries to Thailand went from MagadhaTo support the view that the first form of Buddhism introduced to Thailand was that of the Theravada School as propagated by Emperor Asoka we have evidence from the Mahavamsa the ancient chronicle of CeylonIn one of its passages dealing with the propagation of the Dhamma the Mahavamsa records that Asoka sent missionaries headed by Buddhist elders to as many as nine territoriesOne of these territories was known as Suvarnabhumi where two Theras Sona and Uttara were said to have proceededNow opinions differ as to where exactly this land of Suvarnabhumi isThai scholars express the opinion that it is in Thailand and that its capital was at Nakon Pathom while scholars of Burma say that Suvarnabhumi is in Burma the capital being at Thaton a Mon town in eastern Burma near the Gulf of MartabanStill other scholars of Laos and Cambodia claim that the territory of Suvarnabhumi is in their landsHistorical records in this connection being meager as they are it would perhaps be of no avail to argue as to the exact demarcation of SuvarnabhumiTaking all points into consideration one thing however seems clear beyond disputeThat is Suvarnabhumi was a term broadly used in ancient times to denote that part of Southeast Asia which now includes Southern Burma Thailand Laos Cambodia and MalayaThe term Suvarnabhumi is a combination of the words suvarna and bhumiBoth are Sanskrit words the former means gold and the latter stands for landSuvarnabhumi therefore literally means Golden Land or Land of GoldKeeping in view the abundance of nature in that part of Asia just referred to the term seems but appropriateThe reason why scholars of Thailand express the view that the capital of Suvarnabhumi was at Nakon Pathom was because of the archaeological finds unearthed in the area surrounding that townNowhere in any of the countries mentioned above not even at Thaton in Burma could one find such a large and varied number of ancient relics as were found at Nakon PathomBy age and style these archaeological objects belong to the times of Emperor Asoka and the later GuptasEven the Great Stupa at Nakon Pathom itself is basically identical with the famous Sañchi Stupa in India built by Asoka especially if one were to remove the shikhara or upper portionMany Thai archaeologists are of the opinion that the shikhara was a later addition to the pagoda a result so to say of the blending of the Thai aesthetic sense with Indian architectural artMoreover the name Pathom Chedi means First Pagoda which in all probability signifies that it was the first pagoda built in SuvarnabhumiThis would easily fit in with the record of the Mahavamsa  that Theras Sona and Uttara went and established Buddhism in the territory of Suvarnabhumi at the injunction of Emperor AsokaTaking cognizance of the fact that Asoka reigned from to BC we can reasonably conclude that Buddhism first spread to Thailand during the rd century BIt is interesting to note in this connection that the history of the penetration of Indian culture to Southeast Asia also started more or less during the same periodWith the growth of Mahayana Buddhism in India especially during the reign of King Kanishka who ruled over Northern India during the second half of the first century AD the sect also spread to the neighboring countries such as Sumatra Java and KambujaIt is probable that Mahayana Buddhism was introduced to Burma Pegu and Dvaravati from Magadha at the same time as it went to the Malay ArchipelagoBut probably it did not have any stronghold there at that time hence no spectacular trace was left of itStarting from the beginning of the fifth century ADMahayana Buddhist missionaries from Kashmir in Northern India began to go to Sumatra in successionFrom Sumatra the faith spread to Java and CambodiaBy about ADthe Srivijaya king with his capital in Sumatra rose in power and his empire spread throughout the Malay Peninsula and ArchipelagoPart of South Thailand came under the rule of the Srivijaya kingBeing Mahayanists the rulers of Srivijaya gave much encouragement and support to the propagation of Mahayana BuddhismIn South Thailand today we have much evidence to substantiate that Mahayana Buddhism was once prevalent thereThis evidence is in the form of stupas or chetiyas and images including votive tablets of the Buddhas and Bodhisattas which were found in large number all of the same type as those discovered in Java and SumatraThe chetiyas in Chaiya and Nakon Sri Thammarath both in South Thailand clearly indicate Mahayana influenceFrom to ADkings belonging to the Suryavarman dynasty ruled supreme in CambodiaTheir empire extended over the whole of presentday ThailandBeing adherents of Mahayana Buddhism with a strong mixture of Brahmanism the Suryavarman rulers did much to propagate and establish the tenets of the Northern SchoolThere is an interesting stone inscription now preserved in the National Museum at Bangkok which tells us that in about ADthere ruled in Lopburi in central Thailand and once a capital city a king from Nakon Sri Thammarath who traced his ancestry to Srivijaya rulersThe king had a son who later became the ruler of Kambuja and who more or less kept Thailand under the suzerainty of Cambodia for a long timeDuring this period there was much amalgamation of the two countries religions and culturesThe stone inscription under consideration probably refers to one of the Suryavarman kings who had blood relationship with the Srivijaya rulersFrom the inscription just referred to we also learn that at that period the form of Buddhism prevalent in Lopburi was that of Theravada and that Mahayana Buddhism already established in Cambodia became popularized in Thailand only after Thailand had come under the sway of CambodiaThere are no indications however that the Mahayana School superseded the Theravada in any wayThis was due to the fact that Theravada Buddhism was already on a firm basis in Thailand when the Mahayana School was introduced thereThat there were monks of both schools Theravada and Mahayana in Lopburi during those days is indicated in a stone inscription in the Cambodian language found in a Brahmanic Temple within the vicinity of Lopburi city itselfMuch of the Brahmanic culture which survives in Thailand till today could be traced to its origin from Cambodia during this periodMany of the Cambodian kings themselves were zealous adherents of Brahmanism and its ways of lifeThis period therefore can be termed Mahayana PeriodSanskrit the sacred language of the Hindus took its root deep in Thailand during these timesIn ADKing Anuruddha became powerful in the whole of Burma having his capital at PaganAnuruddha extended his kingdom right up to Thailand especially the Northern and Central parts covering areas now known as Chiengmai Lopburi and Nakon PathomBeing a Theravada Buddhist Anuruddha ardently supported the cause of Theravada which Burma like Thailand at first received directly from India through missionaries sent by Emperor AsokaHowever at the time under consideration Buddhism in India was already in a state of decline and as contact between Burma and India was then faint Theravada Buddhism as prevalent in Burma at that time underwent some changes and assumed a form somewhat different from the original doctrineThis at a later stage became what is known in Thailand as Burma BuddhismDuring the period of King Anuruddhas suzerainty over Thailand Burmese Buddhism exercised great influence over the country especially in the North where owing to proximity the impact from Burma was more feltIt is significant that Buddhist relics found in North Thailand bear a striking Theravada influence whereas those found in the South clearly show their Mahayana connections dating back from Srivijaya daysTo a great extent this is due to the fact that in their heyday of suzerainty over Thailand the Burmese under Anuruddha were content with Upper Thailand only while leaving the South practically to be ruled by their Khmer vassals whose capital was at LopburiFrom the beginning of the nd century Bthe Thai people whose original homeland was in the valleys between the Huang Ho and the Yangtze Kiang in China began to migrate southwards as a result of constant friction with the neighboring tribesIn the course of their migration which lasted for several centuries they became separated into two main groupsOne group went and settled in the plains of the Salween River Shan States and other areas and spread on as far as AssamThis group of Thais is called Thai YaiThe other main group moved further South and finally settled in what is today termed ThailandThe latter group of Thais is called Thai NoiThe Thais in presentday Thailand are actually the descendants of these migrant ThaisOf course in the course of their migration which as said above continued off and on for a long time there had been a great deal of mixture of blood through intermarriage which was only naturalWe should always bear in mind that there are several ethnic groups scattered through the length and breadth of Southeast Asia from times immemorialBut even today we can trace the language affinity of the Thais living in widely scattered areas such as Assam Upper Burma Southern China Shan States Laos North Vietnam and ThailandAfter struggling hard for a long time the Thais were able to establish their independent state at Sukhothai in North ThailandThis was probably about ADIt was during the period of their movement southwards that the Thais came into contact with the form of Buddhism as practiced in Burma and propagated under the royal patronage of King AnuruddhaSome scholars are of the opinion that as Mahayana Buddhism had spread to China as early as the beginning of the Christian Era the Thais while still in their original home in China must have already been acquainted with some general features of BuddhismAs the Thai migrants grew in strength their territory extended and finally they became the masters of the land in succession to Anuruddha whose kingdom declined after his deathDuring the succeeding period the Thais were able to exert themselves even more prominently in their southward driveThus they came into close contact with the Khmers the erstwhile power and became acquainted with both Mahayana Buddhism and Brahmanism as adopted and practiced in KambujaMuch of the Brahmanic influence such as religious and cultural rites especially in the court circles passed on from Cambodia to the Thais during this period for Hinduism was already firmly established in Cambodia at that timeEven the Thai scripts based on Cambodian scripts which in turn derived their origin from India were invented by King Ram Kamhaeng of Sukhothai during the period under considerationOf the period under discussion it may be observed in passing that Northern Thailand from Sukhothai District upwards came much under the influence of Burma Buddhism while in the central and southern parts of the country many Mahayana beliefs and practices inherited from the days of the Suryavarmans and the Srivijayas still persistedThis is the most important period in the history of the spread of Buddhism to Thailand for it witnessed the introduction to that country of that form of Buddhism which remains dominant there until todayAbout ADParakramabahu the Great became king of Ceylon known in ancient days as LankaA powerful monarch and a great supporter of Theravada Buddhism Parakramabahu did much to spread and consolidate the Dhamma of the Lord in his island kingdomHe it was who caused the Seventh Buddhist Council to be held under the chairmanship of Kassapa Thera of Dimbulagala in order to revise and strengthen the Doctrine and the DisciplineAs a result of the efforts of King Parakramabahu the Great Buddhism was much consolidated in Ceylon and the news spread to neighboring landsBuddhist monks from various countries such as Burma Pegu Kambuja Lanna and Lanchang flocked to Ceylon in order to acquaint themselves with the pure form of the DhammaThailand also sent her Bhikkhus to Ceylon and thereby obtained the upasampada vidhi from Ceylon which later became known in Thailand as LankavamsaThis was about ADApparently the early batches of Bhikkhus who returned from Ceylon after studies often accompanied by Ceylonese monks established themselves first in Nakon Sri Thammarath for many of the Buddhist relics bearing definitely Ceylonese influence such as stupas and Buddha images were found thereSome of these relics are still in existence todayNews of the meritorious activities of these monks soon spread to Sukhothai then the capital of Thailand and King Ram Kamhaeng who was ruling at the time invited those monks to his capital and gave them his royal support in propagating the DoctrineThis fact is recorded in one of the Kings rock inscriptions dated about ADSince then Ceylon Buddhism became very popular and was widely practiced in ThailandSome of the Thai kings such as King Maha Dharmaraja Lithai of Sukhothai dynasty and King Borom Trai Lokanath of the early Ayudhya Period even entered the Holy Order or Bhikkhu Sangha according to the ordination rite of Lankavamsa Buddhism by inviting a patriarch from Ceylon Maha Sami Sangharaja Sumana by name to be the presiding monk over his upasampada ceremonyMany monasteries stupas Buddha images and even Buddha footprints such as the wellknown one at Sraburi in central Thailand were built in accordance with the usage popular in CeylonThe study of Pali the language of Theravada or Southern Buddhism also made great progress and in all matters dealing with the Dhamma the impact of Ceylon was perceptibly feltHowever there had been no antagonism between the different forms of Buddhism already in existence in Thailand and the Lankavamsa which had been introduced later from CeylonOn the contrary they seemed to have amalgamated peacefully and all had adjusted themselves to one anothers benefitThis is evident in all religious rites and ceremonies of ThailandIndeed somewhat characteristic of the Buddhists there had been a spirit of forbearance in all mattersFor instance even today Brahmanic rites thrive side by side with Buddhistic ceremonies in Thailand and Cambodia especially in the royal courtsHistory repeats itselfYears after when in Ceylon under King Kirtisri the upasampada ordination was lost due to a decline of Buddhism and upheavals in the country Thailand was able to repay the debt by sending a batch of Buddhist monks under the leadership of Upali and Ariyamuni Theras who in the course of time established in Ceylon what is known as the Siyamopali Vamsa or Siyam Nikaya or Siamese Sect which still is a major sect in that countryUpali worked and died in Sri Lanka the country he loved no less than his ownToday for all purposes Thailand can be termed a Theravada Buddhist countryThere are of course a few Mahayana monks and monasteries but they are mostly confined to foreign communities chiefly the ChineseAll however live at peace and cooperate with one anotherSo much for the past of Buddhism in ThailandAccording to the census taken in the population of Thailand numbersOf this number  are BuddhistsThis fact itself demonstrates more than anything else how influential Buddhism is in ThailandIn their long history of existence the Thais seem to have been predominantly Buddhists at least ever since they came into contact with the tenets of BuddhismAll the Thai kings in the recorded history of presentday Thailand have been adherents of BuddhismThe countrys constitution specifies that the King of Thailand must be a Buddhist and the Upholder of BuddhismThe term The Land of Yellow Robes has not been inappropriately applied to Thailand for two things strike most foreigners as soon as they set foot in that countryOne is the Buddhist temple with its characteristic architecture and the other is the sight of yellowclad Buddhist monks and novices who are to be seen everywhere especially in the early hours of dawn when they go out in great numbers for almsThe two sights inevitably remind the foreigners that here is a country where Buddhism is a dominant force in the peoples lifeIndeed to the Thai nation as a whole Buddhism has been the main spring from which flow its culture and philosophy its art and literature its ethics and morality and many of its folkways and festivalsFor clarity and convenience we shall divide the study of the present state of Buddhism in Thailand into two parts namely the Bhikkhu Sangha or the Holy Order and the LaityThe Bhikkhu Sangha or the Holy Order of Buddhist monks has been in existence in Thailand ever since Buddhism was introduced thereAccording to the census there were in the whole kingdom of Thailand monks novices and monasteries or templesThese are scattered throughout the country particularly more numerous in the thickly populated areasThe Bhikkhu Sangha of Thailand being of Theravada or Southern School observes the same set of discipline as the Bhikkhu Sanghas in other Theravada countries such as Ceylon Burma Laos and CambodiaIn spite of the fact that the government allots a yearly budget for the maintenance and repair of important temples and as stipends for high ranking monks almost the entire burden for the support of the Sangha and the upkeep of the temples rests with the publicA survey entitled Thailand Economic Farm Survey made in by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Government of Thailand gives the religious cash expenses of the average Thai rural family per year as ranging from to per cent of its total annual cash incomeIt may be added here that the report concerns the average Thai rural family and not the urban dwellers the majority of whom in Thailand as elsewhere are less inclined to religion than the country folksThere are two sects or Nikayas of the Buddhist Order in ThailandOne is the Mahanikaya and the other is the Dhammayuttika NikayaThe Mahanikaya is the older and by far the more numerous one the ratio in the number of monks of the two sects being toThe Dhammayuttika Nikaya was founded in ADby King Mongkut the fourth ruler of the present Chakri Dynasty who ruled Thailand from to ADHaving himself spent years as a Bhikkhu the King was well versed in the Dhamma besides many other branches of knowledge including Pali the canonical language of Theravada BuddhismThe express desire of the King in founding the Dhammayuttika sect was to enable monks to lead a more disciplined and scholarly life in accordance with the pristine teachings of the BuddhaThe differences between the two Nikayas are however not great at most they concern only matters of discipline and never of the DoctrineMonks of both sects follow the same Vinaya rules as laid down in the Patimokkha of the Vinaya Pitaka and both receive the same esteem from the publicIn their general appearance and daily routine of life too except for the slight difference in the manners of putting on the yellow robes monks of the two Nikayas differ very little from one anotherFormerly and in accordance with the Administration of the Bhikkhu Sangha Act the organization of the Sangha in Thailand was on a line similar to that of the StateThe Sangharaja or the Supreme Patriarch is the highest Buddhist dignitary of the KingdomHe is chosen by the King in consultation with the Government from among the most senior and qualified members of the SanghaThe Sangharaja appoints a council of Ecclesiastical Ministers headed by the Sangha Nayaka whose position is analogous to that of the Prime Minister of the StateUnder the Sangha Nayaka there function four ecclesiastical boards namely the Board of Ecclesiastical Administration the Board of Education the Board of Propagation and the Board of Public WorksEach of the boards has a Sangha Mantri with his assistantsThe four boards or ministries are supposed to look after the affairs of the entire SanghaThe Ecclesiastical Ministerial Council which by the way corresponds to the Cabinet consists of ten members all senior monks of the SanghaIn addition to this there is a Consultative Assembly equivalent to the National Assembly the members of which number selected from various important monasteriesThe Sangha Sabha acts as an Advisory Body to the Ecclesiastical Ministerial CouncilBelow the Sangha Sabha the administration of the Sangha continues to correspond to the secular administration of the countryAll monks and novices have to live in monasteries which are scattered throughout the countryEach monastery has its abbot appointed by the Ecclesiastical Ministerial Council in consultation with local peopleIt may be pointed out here that all religious appointments in Thailand are based on scholarly achievements seniority personal conduct and popularity and contacts with monks further up in the SanghaThere is a Department of Religious Affairs in the Ministry of Education which acts as a liaison office between the Government and the SanghaIn general the Department of Religious Affairs works in cooperation with the Ecclesiastical Ministerial Council on all matters affecting the SanghaFor instance it issues all legal directives concerning the entire community of monks it keeps record of the Sanghas property such as lands etc it maintains facts and figures with respect to monks and monasteriesThe Religious Affairs Department also prepares the annual budget for the upkeep of the Sangha functionaries and the maintenance and repair of temples etcIt may be added here that all temples and monasteries are State propertyIn the Administration of the Bhikkhu Sangha Act of was abolished a new one was enacted insteadBy virtue of the new act the posts of Sangha Nayaka Sangha Mantris and Sangha Sabha were abolishedIn place of these there is a Mahathera Samagama headed by the Sangharaja himself and consisting of not less than four and not more than eight senior monks of the two sectsThe Mahathera Samagama in collaboration with the Department of Religious Affairs directly governs the entire SanghaAs is well known the original idea of mens entering monkhood during the Buddhas time or shortly later was to attain liberation from worldly existence in accordance with the teaching of the MasterSuch an idea of course springs from mans feeling of aversion to things mundaneIn other words in those faroff days men entered monkhood with the sole intention of ridding themselves of lifes miseries and of obtaining spiritual freedom or NirvanaInstances of such selfrenunciation are found in the holy books of the BuddhistsWith the passage of time as is only natural many of the ideals and practices of the early followers of the Buddha underwent modificationsToday over years after the passing away of the Buddha though the ideal of becoming a Bhikkhu still remains very lofty among Buddhists of all lands in practice it must be admitted that there have been many deviations from the Masters original admonitions with regard to the whys and wherefores of mans entering monkhoodGeneralization of any subject matter is often dangerous but it will not be far from truth to say that today in Thailand as in other Buddhist countries the practice of Buddhist males entering monkhood is to a considerable extent prompted rather by the dictation of custom the wish for education and other external considerations than by the desire to attain emancipationYet there are also many who join the Sangha through genuine love for a religious life and religious studies or out of the wish to be of service to Buddhism and their countryFinally in the Thai Sangha also those are not entirely lacking whose life is vigorously devoted to the aim of ultimate emancipation and to the guidance of others towards that goalThere have been and still are saintly and able meditation masters in Thailand with a fair number of devoted disciples in Sangha and laityThere are also still monks  the socalled thudong bhikkhus  who follow the ancient way of austere living embodied in the strict observances or dhutangasIn view of the above facts there are two categories of Buddhist monks in ThailandOne comprises those who become monks for long periods sometimes for life and the other those who enter the Order temporarilyTo serve in the monkhood even for a short period is considered a great meritearning attainment by the Thai BuddhistsEven kings follow this ageold customFor instance the present ruler HMKing Bhumibol Adulyadej also observed the custom for a period of half a month some time agoGovernment officials are allowed leave with full pay for a period of four months in order to serve in monkhoodThe idea is to enable young men to gain knowledge of Buddhism and thereby to become good citizensLife as a monk gives them practical experience of how an ideal Buddhist life should beIn rural districts the general tendency is still to give more deference to those who have already served in monkhoodSuch people are supposed to be more mature than those who have not undergone the monks lifeMoreover in Thailand wats used to be and are still regarded as seats of learning where all men irrespective of lifes position could go and avail themselves of education benefitsThis is especially so in the case of economically handicapped males of the countrysideInstances are not lacking in which people have climbed high up on lifes status ladder after obtaining education while in monkhoodThere are neither religious restrictions nor social disapproval against monks returning to lay life if and when they find themselves unable to discharge their duties as monksCases exist in which for some reason or the other men have entered monkhood more than once although such practice cannot be said to be in the esteem of the publicLooked at from this viewpoint the institution of entering monkhood in Thailand apart from being a way of gaining moral and spiritual enlightenment is a social uplift method by which those not so fortunately placed in life could benefitJudged from the ideal of adopting a monks life as enunciated by the Buddha whether or not such practice is commendable is a different storyThe fact is that even today when modernism has penetrated deep into Thailand about one half of the primary schools of the country are still situated in watsWith sex and crimes on the increase in the country the cry for living a better Buddhist life is being heard more and more distinctly in Thailand todayThe traditional education of monks and novices in Thailand centers mainly on the studies of the Buddhist Doctrine and Pali the language in which the Theravada scriptures are writtenOf the former the study of the Doctrine there are three grades with examinations open to both monks and laymenThose passing such examinations are termed Nak Dhamm literally meaning one who knows the DhammaThe latter ie the study of Pali has seven grades starting with the third and ending with the ninth gradeStudents passing Pali examinations are called parian in the Thai language the word parinna is used to mean academic degreeFor example monks and novices passing the first Pali examination are entitled to write P after their namesGenerally the Dhamma and the Pali studies go hand in hand and take at least seven years to completeThe stiffness of the two courses especially that of the Pali language can be guessed from the fact that very few students are able to pass the highest grade the Parian in any annual examinationIn the good old days when living was less competitive than now passing of even the lower Dhamma and Pali examinations used to be of much value in securing good government postsBut now things are quite different even those successful in the highest Pali examination the th Grade find it difficult to get suitable employmentOf late there has developed a new outlook in the education of monks in ThailandWith the rapid progress of science and with the shrinking of the world Buddhist leaders of Thailand monks as well as laymen are awakened to the necessity of imparting broader education to members of the Sangha if the Sangha is to serve the cause of Buddhism well for the gain of the many for the welfare of the many As a result of the new outlook there now function in Bangkok two higher institutes of learning exclusively for monks and novicesOne is the Mahachulalongkorn Rajvidyalaya and the other is the Mahamongkut RajvidyalayaBoth are organized on a modern university footing and both seem to be making satisfactory progress towards that directionInclusion in the curriculum of some secular subjects not incompatible with monks discipline is among the notable features of these two institutes the aim is to give an allround education to monks in order to enable them to be of better service to the cause of Buddhism amidst modern conditionsSo much for the education of longterm monksAs for those who enter the Order temporarily mostly for a period of three rainy months during the Vassa or Buddhist Lent the education is brief and devoted to the main tenets and features of Buddhism onlyAs pointed out above such people enter monkhood either by their own genuine desire for knowledge of the Dhamma by the dictum of custom or as generally is the case by the two reasons combinedMonks of this category return to lay life again as soon as the Lent is overThis is the reason why accommodations in monasteries are usually full during the Lenten periodNowadays owing to the pressure of modern life the custom of temporarily entering monkhood is not so rigorously observed by people living in urban areas as by those in the countrysideThe custom has its parallel in Burma Cambodia and Laos where Theravada Buddhism prevailsThe word wat means monastery and temple combinedIt is the residence of monks and novicesThere are about wats in the whole of ThailandIn Bangkok alone there are nearly two hundred watsSome big wats in Bangkok have as many as resident monks and novicesWats are centers of Thai art and architectureThai culture to a considerable extent flows from watsWatlands and constructions thereon are donated by royalty wealthy people and the public in generalThe wat is the most important institution in Thai rural lifeThe social life of the rural community revolves around the watBesides carrying out the obvious religious activities a wat serves the community as a recreation center dispensary school community center home for the aged and destitute social work and welfare agency village clock resthouse news agency and information centerA wat is headed by a Chao Avas who is responsible for the maintenance of the wat discipline the proper performance of religious services and rituals and the general welfare of the inmatesBesides monks and novices there are also the temple boys in wats who assist monks and novices in various ways such as bringing and arranging food cleaning dormitories washing yellow robes etcUsually these boys are related to resident monks in one way or another and their stay is free of chargeMost of them are students whose homes are far away and who would otherwise find it impracticable to get educationThis is especially so in Bangkok where accommodation is difficult to get and where all higher seats of learning of the country are situatedThe census taken in reveals that there are as many as temple boys in Thailand which indeed is not a small figureThe institution of the wat in itself a gift of Buddhism therefore contributes in no small measure to the social welfare and progress of the Thai BuddhistsThe benefits in this respect of course are more apparent among the lower strata of society than in the case of the fortunate few on the topApart from engaging themselves in doctrinal studies and observing disciplinary rules in general monks are expected to be friends philosophers and guides of the peoplePreaching to masses face to face or over the radio is one of the commonest ways by which monks help the promotion of moral stability among various members of the societyIt may not be out of place to reiterate the fact that Buddhism lays great stress on the necessity of leading a morally good life in order to obtain happiness in life here and hereafterIn most of the ceremonies and rituals whether private or public monks cooperation and benediction are indispensableIndeed in the life of the average Thai Buddhists from the cradle to the grave monks are persons to whom they constantly turn for moral supportThe role of monks in rural districts is even more important for there the local wat is not only the religious but also the social center of the communityIt is at the wat that people come together and experience a sense of comradeshipReligious rituals and ceremonies held at wats are always accompanied by social activities they are occasions for people especially the young to enjoy themselves in feast fun and festivitiesThis aspect of the religious service helps the common folks to relax and satisfies their needs for recreationNot a few matrimonial alliances started from contacts at wat premisesActing as a moral and ethical example monks are the most venerated persons in the countryside Thai society remaining very close to the hearts of the peopleIn times of crisis it is to monks that people bring their problems for counsel and encouragementWith few exceptions the Sangha has well justified this attitude of respect and honor shown to it on the part of the laity and on the whole has lived up to the dignity of the FaithThroughout its over years of existence Buddhism has been closely connected with the lay communityIn Pali the word for a male lay devotee is upasaka upasika is its female equivalentIn the history of Buddhism right from the time of its founder there had been numerous upasakas and upasikas whose faith in the Teachings of the Master had contributed largely to the dissemination of the DoctrineNames of the Buddhas munificent followers like Anathapindika Visakha Asoka Kanishka etc are on the lips of Buddhists even todayWithout the patronage of Emperor Asoka Buddhism probably could not have spread so far and the course of its history might have been differentIn India the land of its birth as well as in most of the countries where its Message has been accepted Buddhism has received unstinted support from people of all classes especially the ruling classHistory of the movements of Buddhism in China Japan Burma Ceylon Tibet etc amply justifies this statementIn the case of Thailand too ever since its introduction to that country Buddhism has been warmly received and patronized by kings and commoners alikeIt is wellknown that many of the Thai rulers not satisfied with being mere laydevotees got themselves ordained into monkhood and became famous for their erudition in the DhammaKing Mongkut Rama IV probably stands out as most distinguished among this class of royal devoteesThe custom of Thai males entering the Sangha also contributes much to the better understanding and cooperation between the lay community and the monkhoodAfter all personal experience is better than mere theoretical knowledgeThe Buddha himself in one of his discourses exhorted his followers to discharge their duties well so as to enable the Dhamma to endure long in the worldOne of the duties of the lay followers as taught by the Master is to look after the needs of monksHence it is the traditional practice with lay followers in all Buddhist countries especially those following Theravada Buddhism to see that monks do not suffer from lack of the four requisites namely food clothing shelter and medicineAlthough in the present age of competitive economy when life in any field is not so easy nobody can say in fairness that monklife in Thailand suffers greatly from shortage of the above four requisitesAs Bhikkhus are not allowed to follow any occupational activities it is clear that they entirely depend on the laity for their existenceIn return for this spontaneous support offered them by the public monks are expected to live exemplary lives for the benefit of themselves as well as of those who look to them as teachers and guidesWe have already seen what moral influence monks have upon the peopleCooperation between the laity and the Bhikkhu Sangha in Thailand is close and spontaneousTo a very great extent this is due to the fact that in an average Thai family some of its members are certain to be found who have for some time served in the SanghaTo the masses yellow robes are symbol of the Master and Bhikkhus are upholders of the Dhamma to be deferred to in all circumstancesIt is interesting to note that Bhikkhus or Samaneras found guilty of committing crimes are formally divested of their yellow robes before legal action is taken against them by the State and this is done invariably under permission of the chief monk or the abbotTo do good is a cardinal point in the teachings of BuddhismConsequently the idea of performing meritorious deeds is very deeply ingrained in the minds of BuddhistsWays of doing good or making merit among the Thai Buddhists are numerousA man gains merit each time he gives alms to monks or contributes to any religious ritualsTo get ordination into monkhood even for a short period of course brings much meritBesides there are other ways of meritearning such as releasing caged birds or freeing caught fishes plastering gold leaf on Buddha statues or religious monuments contributing to the construction of a new temple or the repair of an old one etcThe Law of Karma that each action has its corresponding result and the belief in rebirth are two important factors in molding such attitude towards life among the BuddhistsThough Nibbana the highest bliss in Buddhism is aspired to by all good Buddhists the vast majority of them still think it is not so easy to reach and that they will be reborn again in this world in heaven or some other world or  at the very worst  in hellHence as long as they live they must try to do good in order to ensure good results in this very life as well as in the life to comeBe a light unto yourselfEach man must strive for his own salvation  these were the Masters wordsIn view of this Theravada Buddhism is often said to have individualistic temperNevertheless it is very tolerant as the long history of its existence will proveIndeed the characteristic tolerance of Buddhism for instance in Thailand has always permitted the absorption of many beliefs and practices from other sources which have often served to supplement or expand its concepts or to fill gapsAnimism and Brahmanism may be cited in this connection the two being important supplements of popular Buddhism in ThailandA foreign writer has rightly observed that the attitude of the Thai masses towards their religion is of an easygoing natureThey do not bother to distinguish among the various components of their religion for them it is all of a pieceOnly the sophisticated few are concerned with doctrinal logic and purityOf course they too know much about its legends its festivals its ideals and its general message that good will render good On the whole it can be said that the Thais enjoy their religionReligious observances are to them as social and recreational as sacred occasionsAnd for the vast majority Buddhism suffices in that it enables them to feel and believe and enjoyOrganizations among the lay Buddhists of Thailand are recent establishmentsProminent and oldest among them is perhaps the Buddhist Association of Thailand under Royal Patronage which now is about years old having been established inHaving its head office in Bangkok it maintains branch organizations in almost all major districts of ThailandIts membership is open to both sexes irrespective of class creed and colorThe aim and object of the Buddhist Association of Thailand is to promote the study and practice of Buddhism and to propagate its message in and outside ThailandBesides arranging regular lectures and discussions on topics concerning the Dhamma the Association also publishes a monthly journal in the Thai language on the teachings of the BuddhaAnother organization is the Young Buddhists Association which came into being at the close of the Second World WarAs its name implies the Young Buddhists Association takes care of the interest of the young in matters concerning BuddhismIts primary object is to encourage the young to imbibe the tenets of Buddhism and to live a virtuous lifeChief among its activities are arranging regular lectures and discussions on the Dhamma issuing publications on subjects dealing with Buddhism in general and sponsoring meetings of the young on the platform of BuddhismThe Young Buddhists Association also has branches in the districtsAs said earlier the end of the Second World War saw a great revival of interest in Buddhism throughout the worldEven in countries like Thailand where the Doctrine of the Awakened One has been traditionally accepted for generations people seem to be increasingly eager to know more about the DhammaStrange as it may seem this is partly due to the interest the Occidental World has taken in BuddhismIn times past religion has been more or less regarded in Thailand as solace of the old But with the impact of the West in most matters and with the general interest shown towards Buddhism by Western intelligentsia the Buddhists of Thailand especially the younger generations who came into contact with the West began to evince an inquisitive attitude towards their religion  a heritage which they have all along accepted as their own but which they have cared little to know about its true valueThis is no attempt to belittle the exceedingly great importance the Thais attach to their religionBut human nature being what it is the saying Familiarity breeds contempt is in most cases not very far wrongIn the Thai language also we have a proverb klai kleua kin dang which may be rendered in English as to have the folly to resort to alkali when one is in possession of saltHaving taken root on the soil of Thailand for centuries Buddhism has naturally attracted many appendages to its fold some of which are not quite in conformity with the teachings of the Master as contained in the CanonMany leaders of Buddhistic thought in Thailand have therefore come forward to try to purify the Dhamma of the many impurities that have crept into itNotable among the reformatory groups are the Dhammadana Association in Jaiya South Thailand under the leadership of Buddhadasa Bhikkhu and the Buddha Nigama of Chiengmai started by Paññananda BhikkhuThe two organizations are showing good efforts in the field of awakening the Buddhists of Thailand to the pristine teachings of the Buddha as treasured in the Pali TipitakaThe mission is admittedly a difficult one but already a promising start has been made in this directionMuch will also no doubt depend on how things transpire in other spheres of human activities chiefly economic social and politicalThe present is an age of conflict  conflict between mind and body between spirit and matterMan must find harmony between the two if peace be his aim in lifeAnd to this task of finding harmony within man Buddhism could contribute in no small measureThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThis is the third further revised version of the original Sangha Guide on Buddhism and Sex published by the English Sangha Trust Dhammpadipa London NWThe greater part of it also appeared in the journal SanghaAs one of the older generation I have felt very conscious of my temerity in trying to write something on this subject which younger people might be willing to readIn this connection I am very grateful to Alan and Jacqui James for giving me the benefit of their criticism a task for which they are doubly qualified being both wise in the Dhamma and at the same time much closer in age to the younger generation who may read thisBut the opinions expressed here are of course my ownThis is an age in which sexual matters are discussed with great opennessThere are many who are puzzled to know what the Buddhist attitude towards sex is and it is therefore to be hoped that the following guidelines may be found helpful towards an understandingIt is of course true to say that Buddhism in keeping with the principle of the Middle Way would advocate neither extreme puritanism nor extreme permissiveness but this as a guiding principle without further specification may not seem sufficiently helpful for most peopleIn the first place we must distinguish between the rules undertaken by Buddhist monks for their own conduct and any guiding principles for lay peopleA bhikkhu or fullyordained monk in the Theravada tradition has taken upon himself a set of rules of conductThe aim of all of these is to enable him to conduct himself in such a way as is most conducive to the attaining of EnlightenmentThe rules are voluntarily undertaken and if a monk feels unable to live up to them he is free to leave the Order which is considered much more honorable than hypocritically remaining in the robe while knowingly infringing the ruleThere are four basic rules infringement of which is termed Parajika or Defeat and involves irrevocable expulsion from the OrderThe only one we are concerned with here is the first which deals with sexual intercourseComplete sexual continence is considered an essential feature of the monastic lifeIntercourse of a heterosexual or homosexual character is automatically a Parajika offenseA monk who performs such an act is considered to have expelled himself from the Order and is no longer in communion with the other monksAny acts of a sexually unbecoming nature falling short of intercourse result in suspension and require expiationSamaneras or novice monks who break their training in this respect are disrobedThe same principle applies to the Mahayana schools and of course to nuns in those schools where they existThere is no such thing as a married monk though in certain schools especially in Japan a form of quasimonasticism with married teachers who retain a form of ordination is permitted under certain conditionsBut all this has no relevance to the Theravada SanghaBefore turning to our main theme it is as well to have some idea of the sexual mores of ancient India in the Buddhas timeGotama himself as a prince was brought up surrounded by concubines and dancinggirls as a matter of coursePolygamy was commonAmbapali the courtesan from whom the Buddha accepted gifts was a person of some consequenceIt was not expected that young men would lead a life of much restraint and the Buddha with his profound understanding of human nature knew well what demands to make of people in this respectThus we find the following formulation of what a man should avoidHe avoids unlawful sexual intercourse abstains from itHe has no intercourse with girls who are still under the protection of father or mother brother sister or relative nor with married women nor female convicts nor lastly with betrothed girlsIf a man could observe greater restraint than this so much the betterThe Buddhas outlook on this question was then realistic for his age and we should endeavor to view the subject as realistically as possible in the light of modern conditionsThe third of the Five Precepts undertaken by lay Buddhists runs Kamesu micchacara veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami I undertake the course of training in refraining from wrongdoing in respect of sensuality Some lay people who usually for a specified period undertake more than the usual five precepts take this one in the stricter form Abrahmacariya veramani which commits them for the duration of the undertaking to observe the same restraint as the monksWith these too we are not further concerned as their position is now obviousFor the average lay person the Third Precept is on exactly the same footing as the other fourThere is in the Buddhist view nothing uniquely wicked about sexual offenses or failingsThose inclined to develop a guiltcomplex about their sexlife should realize that failure in this respect is neither more nor on the other hand less serious than failure to live up to any other preceptIn point of fact the most difficult precept of all for nearly everybody to live up to is the fourth  to refrain from all forms of wrong speechWhat precisely then does the Third Precept imply for the ordinary lay BuddhistFirstly in common with all the other precepts it is a rule of trainingIt is not a commandment from God the Buddha or anyone else saying Thou shalt not There are no such commandments in BuddhismIt is an undertaking by you to yourself to do your best to observe a certain type of restraint because you understand that it is a good thing to doThis must be clearly understoodIf you dont think it is a good thing to do you should not undertake itIf you do think it is a good thing to do but doubt your ability to keep it you should do your best and probably you can get some help and instruction to make it easierIf you feel it is a good thing to attempt to tread the Buddhist path you may undertake this and the other precepts with sincerity in this spiritSecondly what is the scope and purpose of this preceptThe word kama means in Pali sensual desire which is not exclusively sexualIt is here used in a plural form which comes close to what is meant by the Biblical expression the lusts of the flesh Greed for food and other sensual pleasure is also includedMost people who are strongly addicted to sexual indulgence are also much drawn to other sensepleasuresThough we are here only concerned with the sexual aspect this point should be notedFor those with any grasp at all of Buddhist principles the basic reason for such an injunction should be immediately obviousOur dukkha  our feeling of frustration and dissatisfaction with life  is rooted in our desires and cravingsThe more these can be brought under control the less dukkha we shall experienceIt is as simple as thatBut of course that which is simple is not necessarily easyThus while there is so to speak a considerable overlap in the content of the Third Precept with the Jewish and Christian commandment Thou shalt not commit adultery there is a big difference in the spirit and approachSince most people in the West have some Christian conditioning  even if only indirectly  it is as well to be clear about thisThe traditional Christian view is that sexual intercourse is permissible solely within the marriagebondEven then the implication is that except as a necessary means for the procreation of children it is really rather a bad thing and should be restricted as far as possible  hence the debate about the pill and the likeCertain things such as contraception homosexual activity and so on are often looked on with horror and declared unnaturalSome of these prohibitions may today be more honored in the breach than the observance but there is no doubt that rigid views of this sort are still widely held and officially propagatedThe inevitable reaction encouraged by some real or alleged psychological experts is towards an attitude of total permissiveness in which anything goes As was said earlier rigid puritanism and total permissiveness are extreme views to neither of which the Buddhist teaching subscribesThe one is merely an inadequate reaction against the otherWhat we have to do  what Buddhism in fact teaches us to do  is to map out a sane course between the twoReduced to essentials the great debate about sex revolves for many people around the concept of sinTo the puritan indulgence in sexual activity for the sake of pleasure is evil wicked or as he tends to say sinfulTo the permissivist this is nonsenseHe probably rejects the term sin as meaningless and not only sees nothing evil in sexual pleasure but regards it as highly legitimate perhaps as the highest pleasure there is and certainly as something to which in principle at least everybody has a rightMany people coming from a more or less Christian background with at least some puritanical overtones find the true Buddhist attitude to this problem rather difficult to seePerhaps they have never even been given a clear explanation of it or if they have it may have seemed too technical for them and they have not grasped the pointThe point in fact is of considerable importance so it is worthwhile attempting to make it clearIt involves a proper elementary grasp of what is meant by kamma  something which many people who may have been Buddhists for years have never hadWe may however perhaps begin more profitably by considering the word sin Sin to a Christian is primarily thought of as a breach of Gods commandmentsThis explanation is of course not wrong in terms of Christian theology but is not applicable in Buddhism where there are no such commandments that one can infringeAs already indicated the socalled precepts are in fact undertakings to oneself which is something differentThey are more on a par with the instruction Look both ways before you cross the road Still there is much agreement between the content of the Five Precepts and some of the Ten Commandments so it may be wise in many cases to behave accordingly whichever formulation one followsHowever there is another rendering of the word sin itself which in fact comes much closer to the Buddhist view of thingsIn the Bible sin actually renders Hebrew and Greek words which literally mean missing the mark ie behaving inadequately or unskillfullyThe sinner then is like an unskillful archer who misses his aimBut this comes surely very close to the idea of akusala kamma or unskilled action in BuddhismThe Pali word kamma literally means action which can be either skilled or unskilledThe results of action accrue to the doer as vipaka which is pleasant when the action was skilled unpleasant when it was unskilledThe feelings we experience are in fact of the nature of vipaka  they are dependent on past kammaAnd of course we are continually creating fresh kamma for a good part of our timeIt should therefore be noted that the feeling of pleasure is not an action but a resultThere is therefore nothing either skillful or unskillful about experiencing such a feelingWe should therefore not regard it as either virtuous or sinful So far so goodSuch pleasant feelings can be enjoyed with a clear conscience and no guilt feelingIf this were all there would be no problemThe puritans would be routed and the permissivists justifiedUnfortunately there is another side to the matterWe may recall that a few years ago there was a song Money is the Root of all Evil Some people pointed out that not money but the love for money is the root of all evilAnd here is the snagSexual pleasure is not evil but attachment to sexual pleasure isIf we can experience the pleasure without attachment we are all right if we become attached to it we are not hitting the mark Now of course it is rather difficult to experience pleasure of any sort without feeling attached to itBut attachment is kamma and unskilled kamma at thatAnd the results of that will inevitably according to Buddhism be something unpleasant in the futureMany people will find this explanation novelSome will find it puzzlingSome will undoubtedly reject it  with or without investigation  with the excuse that it is overly subtle or arbitrary or something of the sortWhat they mean is of course that they find it inconvenientBut it will repay a lot of consideration and mindful investigationCareful study in fact should show that it is the key to the whole problemThe matter can also be considered in terms of the law of Dependent Origination Contact is the basis for the arising of feeling feeling of craving craving of clinging etc the ultimate outcome being of course the continued process of becoming with all the sufferings entailedThus if we wish to adjudicate between the puritans and the permissivists we cannot say that either side is entirely rightWe might however suggest that the puritans are partly right for the wrong reasonsSexual indulgence is not wicked but it may be in some degree inadvisableMost people will not feel able to refrain altogether but there is merit in moderationSetting aside all ideas derived from other sources other religions and philosophies of life what is the Buddhist attitude towards marriageFor many Buddhists in the East or the West there is no great problemThey live a reasonably normal married life just as do many Christians humanists and othersWe may say they are lucky or enjoy the results of favorable kamma in this respectFor others of all creeds or none serious problems arise and must be somehow facedIn the Christian tradition marriage is usually termed a sacrament In some branches of Christianity it is treated as an indissoluble bond though usually there are a few loopholesOther branches of Christianity permit divorce in certain rather narrowly defined circumstances and of course in most countries the state permits divorce and the remarriage of divorced persons with or without the approval of the ChurchIn Buddhism marriage is not a sacrament as such a concept does not existAnd it is not any part of the functions of Buddhist monks to join lay people together in holy wedlockIf it is occasionally done today in Japan this is just a modern idea in conformity with a general tendency among Japanese Buddhists to imitate Christian institutionsIn the Buddhist tradition it is often the custom for bhikkhus to give their blessing after the civil weddingceremony has been performedBut even this is really more of a concession to the laity than anything elseAnd if the marriage does not turn out a success no bhikkhu has any authority to say that that marriage shall not be dissolvedDivorce like marriage is a civil affairLikewise if a married couple decide to practice contraception that is entirely their businessThe Sangha will not feel called upon to interfere or objectIt must be admitted that certain bhikkhus have been heard to declare that contraception is wrong and should be banned  but that is their private opinionIt is no part of the Buddhist teachingAbortion is of course a different matterSince this involves the taking of life it contravenes the First PreceptIt can only be condoned in cases of serious health hazards where it may represent the lesser evilIn getting married people obviously take on a responsibility both towards each other and towards whatever children they haveAny form of irresponsible behavior is clearly reprehensible by any reasonable standards whether we call ourselves Buddhists or anything elseIf we bear in mind and try to observe all the five precepts the chances of a successful marriage are obviously increasedExcessive drinking for instance is a potent source of unhappy marriagesWhat it may be asked of adultery ie extramarital sexual relationsThe short answer is that quite obviously this is something to be avoidedBut the point should be made that Buddhism does not regard this or any other sexual irregularities and deviations as somehow uniquely wickedIn countries nominally Christian the special kind of horror with which such things are or recently were regarded can be pushed to grotesque extremesNot many years ago a certain politician was solemnly declared by some to be unfit to become Prime Minister because he had been the innocent partner in a divorce caseMore recently still another politician was hounded from office because of acts of adultery of which his wife forgave himYet many politicians in all countries have got away with far worse things of a nonsexual character without a word being saidBuddhists should try to behave themselves sexually as in other respects to the best of their ability  but they should learn to exercise the maximum of charity towards the lapses of othersIf a marriage has irretrievably broken down even though it may continue in name the situation is of course quite differentIn such circumstances one may well feel that complete abstinence is a burden greater than one can reasonably be expected to bearThe things that can go wrong with a marriage are legionA partner can be impotent ill irresponsible jealous drunken a compulsive gambler deranged promiscuous miserly unemployable or several of these thingsOr both partners can be perfectly charming people and yet utterly unsuited to each otherIt may be that only the children  poor wretches  hold the marriage togetherAt the same time there may be many reasons which make a dissolution impossible or impracticableAn extramarital relationship in such circumstances may serve to make the situation tolerableThose who find themselves in such a situation must make the best job of it they canIt is not for others more fortunate or more timid to be excessively censoriousHere again we should try to look at things calmly and clearly and above all responsiblyNowadays there is pretty frank acceptance of what has always been the case that a lot of people in fact have sexual intercourse without going through the formality of getting marriedNo doubt there is more of it now than there used to be because for one thing contraception is a lot more efficient than formerly and also because religious prejudices are fast breaking downThis is a simple statement of fact not of what ought or ought not to be the caseIn the case of engaged couples it is probably by now the usual thing and is not very heavily frowned upon by most peopleBut it cannot be termed exactly rare among couples who have not the slightest intention of getting engagedIn the past it was widely considered that premarital sex was a good thing for young men but a bad thing for girlsNow sexequality has caught up on this as on so many other thingsIn any case we may as well accept the fact that whatever we may think about it preaching by the older generation will by and large have precious little effect on the youngThis is probably one thing most parents are worried aboutThe young people of today are not usually notably impressed by the wisdom of their eldersThey may quite often be perfectly right in this skepticism but of course it does not follow that they themselves are really any wiserIt may be that their folly merely takes on a different formLet us remember that basically if Buddhism teaches us anything at all it is that almost all human beings are pretty dimwitted on the wholeThat after all is why we are here at allBut still if those who are parents can succeed in inculcating a sense of responsibility into their young that in all probability is about all they can doThere are no easy answersQueen Victoria reigned for sixty glorious years and even despite the pioneering efforts of her son and successor Edward VII it still took England a further sixty years to cast off the last shreds of Victorian respectabilityNow at last the deed has been done and naked young men can stand on the stage and utter naughty words without a Lord Chamberlain to say them nayIs this progress or was Victorian prudery preferable to modern ruderyWe are back with the two extremes once againWe must seek the middle wayOf course if the young would only listen there is no doubt we older ones could give them all sorts of quite genuinely good adviceAnd there is just one chance that they will listen if we can somehow avoid being patronizingBut the heavy father act is now definitely out and the establishment line cuts no iceIf we tell the youth of today they stink they will simply turn round and tell us our ideas stinkHowever if we can succeed in getting across to them at all we may be able humbly to suggest certain things for their considerationSex is something the younger generation of today are intensely aware ofIn fact they would have to be born blind and deaf not to beIt is exploited commercially today in every conceivable wayOur entire commercial civilization is founded on the principle of stimulating bigger and better desires in all of us all the timeAnd at a conservative estimate about  of all advertising at the present time includes an element of sexual titillationIt has been found quite clearly that sex stimulates the sales of anything and everything from typewriters to weedkillersThat it is the mainstay of virtually every conceivable kind of entertainment to which we are voluntarily or involuntarily subjected goes without sayingIn other words our desires in general and our sexual desires in particular are being consistently and grossly overstimulated the whole time of set purpose and the bland assumption is that if it all suddenly stopped the countrys entire economy would be in ruinsWe all young and old have to live with this situation and to put it mildly it doesnt make selfrestraint any easierSo before we start lecturing the young we should realize this factIn this game the dice are loaded against usStill we may manage to get through to themAfter all many young people are themselves against the establishment and among other things they rebel against the sheer tawdriness of our livesTheir ideas may quite frequently be all wrong and badly mixed up but at least they sincerely yearn for something better and in fact they are desperately even if often incoherently trying to bring about a better state of affairsThey are by no means lacking in idealism and they have a keen eye for those who seek to exploit their idealism for dubious endsWe can latch on to them if we can only convince them that we are at least sincereLet us just take a cold hard look at this question of premarital intercourse among the youngIn the first place it happensAnd there are just two ways in principle by which it can cease to happenEither young people can exercise selfrestraint or they can get marriedA few do the former and quite a lot do the latterNow of course very early marriages can turn out wellBut the fact is that they quite often dont for obvious reasonsIt is therefore not an entirely selfevident fact that early marriage as such is preferable to a little experimentationIt is of course very hard for parents to stand back and silently watch their own children embarking on a course which may seem to them and indeed may actually be unwiseSome young people today are only prepared and able to learn by trial and errorThey are unwilling to ask for advice or even to accept it if given unaskedThey should however be aware that there are serious dangers in experimentation if too rashly undertaken and the trouble is that while parents may hold back with advice on restraint there are others who are only too ready to offer permissive advice without drawing attention to the risksIt is the duty of somebody whether parents or teachers to ensure that young people are aware of some of the less comfortable facts of life as well as those they want to know aboutVenereal disease is rampant today and on the increaseAnd it is by no means always the minor inconvenience it is made out to be in some quartersIt can still cause sterility serious illness or even deathThat the pill is not and is not meant to be any protection against VDwould seem obvious but many girls seem unaware of this  till it is too lateNor is the pill itself as harmless as all thatIt can have unpleasant and sometimes quite serious sideeffects and one recent estimate is that  of the women who use it ought not to do so on medical groundsEven common sense might suggest that prolonged chemical interference with hormone functioning could cause troubleThese are just some of the more obvious physical dangersThere are plenty of emotional problems and dangers tooTo take just one example genuine misunderstandings can arise because teenage lads want and expect to go all the way whereas often the girls only want to flirtThis situation is by no means uncommon at best it is embarrassing and at worst it can lead to very ugly incidentsThe way of selfrestraint is not necessarily an easy one for all to follow and under present conditions especially it is almost more than we can reasonably expectAnd it too can be undertaken for the wrong reasons and in the wrong wayThe English public school system was based on the segregation of the sexes and an ideal of sexual restraint and to a certain extent it workedIt produced the predictable crop of homosexuals as well as quite a few inhibited young men but it inculcated a genuine respect for women which was not always quite as ludicrous as some would have us believeOn balance it may have done more good than harm from the sexual point of view to the majority of those who were subjected to itBut it was based on an oversimplified ideaLife is more subtle than Arnold of Rugby allowed forAnd yet the best products of this system of education are in many respects admirableThey have a deep sense of selfdiscipline and responsibility qualities in rather short supply todayOf course many of the young people of today actually have such a sense quite strongly in some waysThey do feel responsible  they feel deeply committed  about apartheid or other social questionsAnd even the hairiest types quite often endure surprising hardships in the way of sleeping rough and the like with a kind of selfdiscipline which may appear strangely illdirected but is nevertheless thereThe present age has been justly called the PostChristian AgeTraditional Christian teachings are crumbling everywhereIt is not perhaps very difficult to find arguments in support of the view that this is a good thing or that it is a bad thingIt largely depends on what we want to put in place of the dear departedBut in any case one can scarcely avoid feeling a pang of sympathy for the Christians especially perhaps the Christian clergyMost Christian ministers of all denominations are after all decent upright hardworking and conscientious men who are desperately striving to do a good job and at least save something worthwhile from the wreckageThey are usually desperately underpaid they preach to their dwindling flock to the best of their ability and they are stuck with an impossible situationThey may often be ignorant and sometimes bigoted but they find themselves mocked by those who are often enough equally ignorant and bigoted and whose sole aim is frequently to replace their creed however inadequate by something ever more negative and destructiveIf the Church even in its present enfeebled state were to disappear totally from the scene the loss despite all doctrinal inadequacies and absurdities would certainly be greater than any conceivable gainIt is not quite true that any religion is better than no religion for some forms of religion are unbelievably awfulBut the best or even the secondbest of Christianity is assuredly a lot better than most of the purely secular substitutes for itThis as Buddhists we should be freely prepared to admit without thereby in the least falling into the trap of saying Well its all the same thing really when it quite obviously isntThe basic Christian attitude to sex is well enough known and has been briefly outlined aboveIt can assume thoroughly unhealthy forms but in its more moderate aspects it can perhaps still serve as a fairly useful basis for decent behaviorAt least it does provide some reasons which a good many people can accept as a basis for moralityNow of course one can have morals without religionIt is not too difficult to produce purely social reasons for a lot of moral conduct sexual or otherwise and the best of the antireligious propagandists today are at pains to do thisBut some others do notTheir policy is simply to controvert anything and everything the Churches teach and stand it on its headSensuality and aggression it is argued are basic drives in man which it is dangerous to dam up and which should accordingly be allowed free playIn the case of aggression the fallacy is so obvious that there are few who would literally subscribe to this though some societies in practice seem to allow it plenty of scopeBut in the case of sex complete permissiveness really is openly preached in some quarters and in fact a Swedish doctor has even announced that he wants to organize a corps of volunteers to provide everybody with sexual intercourseThis would apparently make everybody happy and the millennium would have arrivedThe sexual drive is in most circumstances just about the strongest urge there is in man and in the other animalsThis is so whether we think that it was implanted in us by God or by the devilIt can be denied all direct expression quite obviously and whether this is or is not a good thing to do depends very much indeed on how  and why  this is doneWhen we come to consider sex and religion we find that in fact this is often done in the Buddhist Sangha and the Roman Catholic Church to take the two most obvious examplesThe ostensible reasons for such a course in these two bodies may be quite different but it is surely not without significance that they both  and some others  consider it important to even attempt such a seemingly unnatural exerciseBut there is no doubt that a good deal of the enormous respect shown to members of both communities stems directly from the knowledge of their celibate way of lifeIn some parts or the world indeed such men are regarded as either supermen or hypocrites since no normal man could be expected to endure such a lifeAnd of course both communities do include quite a few hypocrites and probably a few supermenFor the vast majority or people of course there is no question of their attempting such a thing except perhaps for relatively short periodsThe lady who once asked in a class If everybody became a bhikkhu what would happen to the world could safely be told not to worryThe biological function of sex is obvious and requires no discussion hereBut the interesting thing for us to note is how sex  like everything else  is a purely impersonal forceWe tend to think of it in intensely personal terms but in actual fact it is a force that just flows through us and uses our most wonderful and inspiring emotions for its own ends which are totally concerned with the continuance of the race as a wholeThe idea that it is just a private and wonderful thing between you and me is merely a part of our general illusionAltogether it is a prolific breeder of illusionsIt can lead a man to think he has found the most wonderful woman in the whole world while everybody else is thinking What on earth can he possibly see in herTo the Buddhist of course sex is an expression  perhaps the chief expression  of that tanha or craving which brings dukkha in its trainIt is therefore quite logical that we should seek to bring it under controlIn a sense that is all there is to the whole questionThe aim of the true Buddhist is to bring about the cessation of craving and from the individual point of view there is no other reason for sexual restraint than thisBut from the broader ethical point of view there are of course other reasons which are no less important if we behave recklessly and irresponsibly in sexual matters we can cause untold harm to others we can trifle with other peoples emotions in a quite devilish way bring unwanted children into the world and so on and so forthBut none of these things would of course happen if we were able to control our own sexuality our own in quotes because it is as we have to remember an impersonal force working through us which is precisely why it is so difficult to controlTotal sexual control in the sense of perfect abstinence is quite obviously only for the fewIt is perhaps one mistake of the Roman Catholic Church that it seeks to impose this discipline on too many people and too absolutely as some Catholics now recognizeBut in fact there will always be more than sufficient people willing and even determined to keep the human race goingSocietys problem is rather to prevent the population explosion from getting completely out of hand  hence all the rather dreary arguments about the pillNow there are various possible ways of controlling the sexurge some bad some goodOne is through fear fear of hell fire fear of venereal diseases and so onThis is of course not a particularly good way though it can certainly work and is perhaps not always wholly harmfulAfter all there can be various unfortunate consequences of intercourse and we should be aware of themEven rebirth in some very unpleasant hellstate is not necessarily a complete fantasyBut of course an exaggerated fear of dreadful penalties for minor transgressions is not psychologically very helpfulAnother way is the way of repressionThis is of course not a conscious processIt is a form of successful self deception as a result of which we are not consciously aware of a thingRepression as ought to be better known than in fact seems to be the case is by no means the same thing as voluntary suppression Very few people in actual fact have really transcended sex  though quite a lot of people seem to think they haveThey never connect their resultant psychological troubles with the rootcause  repressed sexBut it should be firmly stated that if we can do it suppression with awareness does little or no harmA great deal of sexual energy can of course be canalized or sublimated into other things art music intense religious faith and so onPeople  especially but by no means only women  are well known in all religious groups who have done this with more or less successAnd those who have attained the meditative absorptions known as the jhanas may find therein an emotional outlet which is superior to that of sexAll this is fine and very much to the goodBut even these things do not in themselves entirely solve the problem at least in the ultimate senseAs long as there remains even a latent craving according to the Buddhist teaching rebirth will inevitably continue to take placeFor we are reborn not merely because of the sexual drive which brought about the union of our parents but also because of that same sexual drive in ourselves ie in that stream of consciousness which produces the changing series of patterns of our own particular individualityAnd this is in fact the deeper significance of the Oedipus complex and other such matters unearthed by FreudAccording to the Tibetan Book of the Dead those whose karmic predispositions destine them for rebirth in human form see couples in sexual union and experience desire for an attractive member of the opposite sex among those couplesBy this desire they thereupon find themselves drawn into the womb and reborn  which was not at all what they wantedThe Theravada scriptures do not specifically describe the process and it may be rather symbolic than literal but psychologically at least something like this is what happensQuite obviously the average Buddhist lay person has no present intention of living a celibate life  nor is this being urged hereBut some knowledge of the nature of sexuality and of how it can be transcended can help him to solve his sexual problems if only by helping him to avoid selfdeceptionAccording to the Buddhist teaching the path to Full Enlightenment is marked by the successive attainment of four stagesThe first of these is that of the streamwinner who has broken three of the ten fetters and glimpsed Nibbana The essential factor here is the clear realization of impersonalityThis realization at the same time eliminates skeptical doubt and belief in rites and ritualsIn our present connection the important point to note is this in the moment when anatta is realized  when that is the spurious nature of self  is clearly seen  there can obviously be no desire of any sort for that self and its gratificationTrue this moment of deep insight passes but its profound effects remainDesires return but their root has been irreparably broken so that they must eventually die awayIn fact at this stage  and this should be realized  sexual desire and aggression may still be quite strong in some types of characterBut of course they will never result in the grosser forms of misconductHowever craving in its more latent form may still be powerful enough to lead to repeated rebirths  up to seven times it is saidThe second stage that of the oncereturner when Nibbana has been glimpsed a second time results in a dramatic reduction of both these urgesHenceforth they have at most only nuisancevalue and rebirth in the world of sensuality cannot it is said take place more than onceOnly at the third stage that of the nonreturner are they quite eliminatedSuch a person has no more ties with this world and so will not be reborn here though he may be reborn in another sphere before attaining Full EnlightenmentFrom all this the conclusion may be drawn that while it is indeed possible to transcend sexuality in this life it is not by any means as simple as some suppose and many who think they have done it are deceiving themselvesNevertheless there are many in the robe and out of it who without having reached this stage have in practice gained complete control of the sex impulseHow then can control of sexuality be achievedA large measure of control can certainly be gained by concentrative meditation practice which stills the mind and can lead to the jhana statesIn nonBuddhist systems this is probably the best that can be hoped for and it is not to be despisedIndeed many people especially in the West are so disturbed that some such calming practice is almost essential perhaps for a very long timeBut the other way and the truly Buddhist way which can lead right to the goal is the way of InsightThe main scriptural basis for this is the Satipatthana SuttaThe four foundations of mindfulness as set forth there are mindfulness as to body feelings states of mind and mindcontentsWith reference to states of mind it is said He knows lustful mind and the mind that is free from lustHe knows how lust arises and how it ceases This is not a manual of meditation and it must suffice here just to indicate how by mindfulness one comes to discover how mental and physical phenomena arise and cease and therefore ultimately how to bring about their cessationIn this method there is no forcingRigid suppression by an act of will is not required  and will not anyway lead to the goalWhen even quite intractableseeming personal problems are fully seen in their true nature they will dissolveIt may take time and much perseverance but it is a way of gentleness which does no violence to ones natureEventually if steadfastly pursued it can lead to the solution of all our problems not only those connected with sexSlowly and patiently we can disentangle by mindfulness all the guilt feelings and other complications which may have developedAnd we come to realize probably to our surprise that the seeing is the cure when the seeing is deep enoughSex is a powerful force in us allIn itself it is neither good nor bad But it can certainly create problemsAnd modern Western man is particularly prone to such problems partly because of the sheer hectic pace and pressure of modern life which exaggerates all our troubles and more specifically because of his backgroundA puritanical Church tradition has now been vigorously challenged by a secular spirit of permissivenessFor many people it is not at all easy to find the middle way between these two extremesThere is nothing sinful about sexIf we make mistakes we should recognize them and try to avoid repeating them but we should not develop guiltcomplexes about themSexual lapses are not uniquely wicked and in fact all but the grosser forms of sexual misconduct are probably on the whole less harmful socially than a lot of other things many people doBut it should be borne in mind that sex does usually involve at least one other person and potentially the next generationIn this respect it is strictly incumbent on us at all times to act responsibly which means compassionatelyOtherwise the physical and emotional consequences for somebody may be very seriousThe ideal of sex only within monogamous marriage should be just as valid for Buddhists as for ChristiansIt should at least not be lightly departed fromThe way of mindfulness has been recommended aboveAdmittedly not everybody is prepared to practice intensive mindfulness whatever benefits may be urged for itBut even a moderate degree of habitual mindfulness can produce surprising resultsIf we learn with detachment to watch our desires at play it is often quite astonishing how they seem to drop away almost of their own accordTo take as an example a related problem many people when they first come to Buddhism are worried about the Fifth Precept which deals with intoxicationCant I have a drink occasionally they ask often rather anxiouslyThe answer is of course Its up to you But in this case too having tried a little mindfulness they are frequently surprised to find that they want a drink less and lessAs a matter of fact the same principle applies here tooHaving discovered the principle applied it and found that it works we can decide for ourselves how far we wish to take itIt will take us as far as we are prepared to goSome readers may wonder that there has been no mention of the word love in the foregoingTo have discussed this question would have led too farSo I will merely quote the following two phrases from a newspaper advicecolumnI am in love means I want me to be happy I love means I want to make you happyBuddhists might reflect and even meditate on these two statements  at various levelsGolden Rule Never let Passion override CompassionThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAll beings subsist on nutriment  this according to the Buddha is the one single fact about life that above all deserves to be remembered contemplated and understoodIf understood widely and deeply enough this saying of the Buddha reveals indeed a truth that leads to the root of all existence and also to its uprootingHere too the Buddha proved to be one who saw to the root of thingsHence it was thought useful to collect his utterances on the subject of nutriment together with the instructive explanations by the teachers of old the commentators of the Paali scripturesThe laws of nutriment govern both biological and mental life and this fact was expressed by the Buddha when speaking of four kinds of nutriment edible food senseimpressions volitions and consciousnessIt is hunger that stands behind the entire process of nutrition wielding its whip relentlesslyThe body from birth to death craves ceaselessly for material food and mind hungers as eagerly for its own kind of nourishment for ever new senseimpressions and for an ever expanding universe of ideasCraving is the principal condition of any intake or uptake that is of nutriment in its widest senseThis is the first factor common to all types of nutriment be they physical or mentalThe second common factor is the process of the assimilation of foodIn the process of eating and digesting what was external becomes absorbed in the internal what was foreign matter becomes ones own and is identified with ones personalityA German proverb says Der Mensch ist was er isst  Man is what he eats And this applies as well to mental nourishmentOur mind also feeds on external material on senseimpressions and variegated experiences on the contents of the storehouse of knowledge accumulated by the race and on the precipitate derived from all these sourcesAlso our memories when they become objects of mind are as external to the present thoughtmoment as the ideas read in a bookWhat cannot be absorbed by the system is discarded and thus in the body as well as in the mind there is a constant process of grasping and rejecting assimilating and dissimilating identifying with oneself and alienatingWhen we look closely at this process of nutrition physical and mental we shall notice that it is not only the eater who consumes the food but in the course of assimilation also the food devours the eaterThere is thus mutual absorption between themWe know how much people can be changed by ideas they have absorbed and which finally have absorbed and consumed themThese laws governing nutriment are indeed sufficient to convince a thoughtful observer how illusory the conception of an abiding self or substance isThis alone should be enough to vindicate the Anattaa doctrine the Buddhas deeply revolutionizing teaching of notselfIndividualized life is as Paul Dahlke says neither a metaphysical Iidentity nor a mere physical process but a nutrimental process and as such it is neither something which is in and by itself nor something caused by another but something that is maintaining itself and all these socalled higher faculties of thinking and feeling are different forms of eating of maintaining oneselfBut in addition to the vindication of the Anattaa doctrine nutriment is likewise a convincing teacher of the two other characteristics of life Impermanence and SufferingChange or Impermanence is at the very root of the nutritive process which cries for constant replenishment of the food consumedThe bottomless gaping hole has to be filled again and again as long as the being livesAnd it is no different with our mental hunger that craves for change and varietyThis repetitive monotony of the process of nutrition kept going by the urge to preserve life  this is enough to reveal the dukkhanature of life the tiresomeness of the tedious round of eating and being hungry againHence a medieval Jewish sage was moved to say I am fed up with being hungry again and again and I hunger after final satietyThis is the suffering inherent in the very function of eating though mostly hidden by the habituation to this most elementary feature of routine lifeThe concrete suffering and pain involved in the search for food and its acquisition is obvious enough to all and this misery was is and will be lifes constant companionThere is the mute suffering in the animal world where devouring each other is the law we also know of primitive mans fight for pasture land we also know of the pangs of hunger among the poor and of starving children the world overAnd though the resources for feeding humanity have grown considerably in our days man still has not controlled famine even where it would be in his power to do so and all progress in the field of foodproduction threatens to be dwarfed by the rapid growth of world populationThis problem looms large on the horizon of presentday humanity and may well become desperate if the disparity between available food and increasing population reaches a critical pointShould that critical point be reached we do not know what dire consequences may follow from that situation unless a united mankind can solve the problem by concerted action and peaceful meansHence also for mankinds future what the Dhamma teachers of old said remains true that the search for food is an everpresent source of suffering and as such it can stir mans sense of urgency when he considers in the light of nutriment mans own nature his incessant needs and his situation in the worldThis contemplation of the dukkhaaspect of nutriment leads us to a formulation of the Four Noble Truths in terms of nutriment as given in the last text of this anthologyThe four nutriments of life stand for the first truth of Ill the craving for the four nutriments is the origin of Ill the second Truth the stopping of that craving is the cessation of the continued process of grasping for material and mental food which is the end of Ill the third Truth and the Noble Eightfold Path is the way to that cessationIt is because the process of nutrition demonstrates the conditioned nature of all existence that we have found it to cover those salient features of the Dhamma  the three signata and the Four TruthsWe shall now consider each of the four kinds of nutriments singlyJust like the husband and wife in the Buddhas simile mankind ever since it emerged on this planet has traversed the desert of life where food is the most urgent concernAnd again as in that story the stilling of mans hunger has often been a heartrending business  if not for the sometimes quite callous eater then for his prey and for a sensitive observerOften in his search for food man has destroyed what is commonly dearest to him be it relatives and friends or the ideals of his youthTrue this is only one aspect of life life is not desert entire it has a goodly number of oases where travelers can rest and enjoy themselves to such an extent that they are prone to forget the surrounding desert which often encroaches on the tiny oasis and buries itThe couple in the Buddhas story coming near starvation eat their own beloved childIt is a gruesome and seemingly fantastic story indeedBut knowing from the records of history that at times of famine war or shipwreck men did resort to cannibalism we have to admit that what our story tells may have substantially happened ever so often in one way or anotherIn his incessant search for food or for better food or for control of food resources how often has man killed cruelly crushed or exploited his fellow creatures even those who are close to him by common blood or common raceAnd is there not close kinship between all that livesThese last words are not merely a sentimental phrase but they are also a hard and cruel factAre we not akin to the voracious greed the cruel rage and the destructive stupidity which we encounter in life and of which we become victim or perpetrator in the struggle for food or powerIf we were not akin to it could we encounter it in one way or anotherFor an unfathomable time caught in the everturning Wheel of Life we have been everything the prey and the devourer of all parent and child of allThis we should consider when contemplating the nutriment of edible food and the Buddhas simile for itIf we wish to eat and live we have to kill or tacitly accept that others do the killing for usWhen speaking of the latter we do not refer merely to the butcher or the fishermanAlso for the strict vegetarians sake living beings have to die under the farmers plowshare and his lettuce and other vegetables have to be kept free of snails and other pests at the expense of these living beings who like ourselves are in search of foodA growing populations need for more arable land deprives animals of their living space and in the course of history has eliminated many a speciesIt is a world of killing in which we live and have a partWe should face this horrible fact and remain aware of it in our Reflection on Edible FoodIt will stir us to effort for getting out of this murderous world by the ending of craving for the four nutrimentsIn one short lifetime how many trainloads of food have passed in and out of our puny bodyHow many people have had to labor in the production preparation and distribution of that food for keeping unbroken the traffic line that runs straight through our bodyIt is a grotesque picture if we visualize itThere is yet another aspect of that lifegiving function of eatingTo illustrate it let us think of a silo or a storehouse or food bag after it has been emptied a few grains or other tiny morsels of food will mostly remain in itSimilarly there will always be left some tiny remnants of food in our body that are neither assimilated nor expelled but remain and putrefySome physiologists say that it is this putrefaction of residual food that ultimately brings about the aging and death of the organism if there are no other causesIf they are right then food is not only lifegiving but also deathbestowing and it appears that we have in this life of ours the choice between death by starvation or by putrefactionThe food devours the eater This close connection between nutriment and death is very poignantly expressed in Greek myth according to which Demeter is the Goddess of corn and of death as wellBachofen that great explorer and interpreter of classic myth has expressed the significance of it very succinctly She feeds man as a prey to herselfPeople as far as they give any thought to the humdrum act of eating have taken very different attitudes towards foodSome who became tired of the dull routine of eating dull food have made a fine art of it and became gourmandsTo them the Buddha says All nutriment is miserable even divine food Others keenly aware of the importance of food for good health have devised various ideas about pure food we have here the dietetic rules of several religions and the belief of ancient and modern sects in mans purification by nutriment of which already the Buddha made mention down to our own days with their ersatz religions of numerous foodreformersOthers again have tried to solve the problem of the bodys dependence on food by reducing nourishment below sustenance level and by long periods of fastingThis harsh and futile method of selfmortification the Buddha too had tried out and rejected before his Enlightenment and had vividly described his experience in the Discourse on the Noble QuestAlso later on the Buddha never recommended periods of fasting beyond the abstention from solid food after noon enjoined upon bhikkhus and in the periodic observance of the Eight or Ten PreceptsWhat the Buddha as a teacher of the Middle Way advised was moderation in eating nonattachment to the taste of food and wise reflection on nutrimentLike a skinned cow man is helplessly exposed to the constant excitation and irritation of the senseimpressions crowding upon him from all sides through all six sensesThe Paali word phassa rendered here by senseimpression means literally touch or contact But it is not a physical impact that is meant here but a mental contact with the objects of all six senses including the mindSenseimpression together with attention is the minds first and simplest response to the stimulus exercised by the world of material objects and ideasAccording to Buddhist psychology senseimpression is a constituent factor in each and every state of mind the lowest and the highest occurring also in dream and in subliminal states of consciousnessSenseimpression is a basic nutriment that is a sustaining condition of life and what is nourished or conditioned by it are feelings or sensations which are living on that multitude of constantly occurring senseimpressions and assimilating them as pleasant unpleasant or indifferentThis relationship has also a place in the formula of Dependent Origination Conditioned by senseimpression is feeling As long as there is craving for senseimpressions which arises from unguarded feelings there will be an unlimited supply of that foodstuff to be digested by feelingIn an unending stream and in rapid alternation forms sounds smells flavors bodily impacts and ideas impinge upon us as long as we liveIt is the poignant awareness of that constant bombardment by senseimpressions that induced the Buddha to choose for the senseimpressions the simile of a skinned cow whose raw flesh is the target of swarms of insects that cause intensely painful feelings to the animalAccording to the Buddha any type of feeling is bound to cause suffering and conflict in him who has not yet freed himself from attachmentPainful feeling is suffering in itself pleasant feeling brings suffering through its transience and its unsatisfying and unsatisfactory nature worldly indifferent feeling produces suffering through the dullness and boredom involved in itIt is senseimpression that is the constant feeder of these feelingsA monk of old yearning to see still more vividly the burning and irritating nature of senseimpressions was moved to exclaimTheragatha vThough man is amply aware of the host of impressions that cause painful sensations in him yet he is quite willing to pay that price for his pleasurable experiences nay for almost any sort of experiencing which he prefers to no sensation at all unless the pain it causes comes too close to tolerance levelWhat is at the psychological root of this situation is mans hunger for ever new experiencesIf that hunger is not temporarily but regularly satisfied it leaves him empty starved and helplessFrom that comes mans wish for change and novelty and his longing for a close contact with life that for its own sake becomes a habituation and makes solitude unbearable for most menThe nutriment senseimpression feeds the World as Enjoyment or the World as Enjoyment of Experience It feeds the craving for existenceThis habitual craving can be broken only if one ceases to identify oneself with the stream of impressions and learns to stand back as an observer wherever one can dispense with active responseThen feeling that is nourished by senseimpression will cease to turn into craving and the Dependent Origination of suffering has been severed at this pointVolitional thought here means chiefly kamma  ie rebirthproducing and lifeaffirming action  and the Buddha has compared it with a man dragged by two others towards and into a pit of glowing embersThe two dragging forces are mans kammic actions good and evilIt is our kammic proclivities our lifeaffirming volitions our plans and ambitions that drag us irresistibly to that deep pit of samsaara with its glowing embers of intense sufferingHence it was said that volitional thought in the sense of kamma is the nutriment for rebirth on the three planes of existenceThe nutriment volitional thought manifests itself in mans incessant urge to plan and to aspire to struggle and conquer to build and to destroy to do and to undo to invent and to discover to form and to transform to organize and to createThis urge has sent man into the depth of the ocean and into the vastness of spaceIt has made him the most vicious of predatory animals and also enabled him to reach the lofty heights of a genius of creative art and thoughtThe restlessness that is at the root of all that lust for activity and of the creative urge is the constant hunger for all four nutriments of life and for a variety of them on different levels of coarseness and sublimityIt is volitional thought that has to go foraging to provide man with the other kinds of nutriment he craves forIt is an incessant task yielding a conquest of but short duration and one that again and again ends in defeatIn volitional thought the world appears as will and power and as creative forceNourished by this powerful nutriment the process of worldbuilding and worlddestruction will go on until samsaara is seen in its true nature as a pit of glowing embers the bottomless depth of which cannot be filled by our plunging into it again and again in whatever guise we assume in our migrationsThe nutriment consciousness has been compared with the punishment of a criminal who thrice daily is pierced with three hundred spearsThe sharp shafts of conscious awareness the punitive results of past cravings and delusions inflicted on us at all times of the day pierce our protective skin and lay us open to the impact of the world of objectsThis shockingly harsh image of consciousness as a punishment reminds us of one of Franz Kafkas main motifs so often appearing in his work  the hidden unknown intangible and seemingly quite amoral guilt of man inherent in his very existence for which he is inscrutably punished and which punishment in the depth of his being he accepts as justThe desire for conscious awareness has the same character as that for sense impressions the craving to be alive to feel alive in the constant encounter with the world of objects present to consciousnessBut there is still more meaning than that to be derived from the description of consciousness as a nutriment if we consider that it is explained primarily as rebirth consciousnessThis rebirth consciousness which is a single moments occurrence feeds the mindbody process of the present existence and it is the arising of such moments of rebirth consciousness at the beginning of each successive life that continues the interminable chain of future births deaths and sufferingsGrowth or proliferation is a characteristic feature of all consciousnessEach rebirth consciousness though its direct link is with the life immediately preceding it has behind it the inexhaustible storehouse of the beginningless past a vast granary of potential seeds of lifeFed from the dark unfathomable recesses of the past lurks consciousness an octopus with not eight but a thousand arms ready to grasp and take hold wherever it finds a chance and there to procreate a fresh breed of beings each with its own set of grasping tentaclesThe writer once visited large subterranean caverns which had long passages and highroofed templelike halls with huge stalactites and stalagmites resembling the lofty columns of a cathedralFor the convenience of the numerous visitors to the caverns electric light was installed and where the bulbs were low enough one could see around them a small spread of lichen the only trace of organic life amidst the barren rocksLife springs up wherever it gets the slightest chance through favoring conditions like warmth moisture and lightIn the spectators mind this little harmless proliferation of primitive plant life assumed the menacing features of a beast of prey that having lurked long under the cover of darkness at last got the chance for its hungry leapLife is always in readiness to spring up and its most prolific manifestation is consciousnessSeen from our limited viewpoint it is consciousness that contributes most to the expanding universe of samsaaraHence the Enlightened One warned Do not be an augmenter of worldsIt is by our insatiable and greedy feeding on consciousness and the other nutriments that the world grows and the potentialities for its growth are endlessAlso the end of the world of consciousness cannot be reached by walkingSeen from that worldwide perspective consciousness appears as the feeder and procreator of innumerable beings all of whom undergo that daily ordeal of lifes piercing spearsSuch a visualization of the reach of consciousness will increasingly lead to revulsion to turningaway and dispassion undeceived by the magicians enchanting illusions with which the aggregate consciousness was compared by the BuddhaLooking back to the Buddhas similes for the four nutriments we are struck by the fact that all four evoke pictures of extreme suffering and dangerThey depict quite unusual situations of greatest agonyConsidering the fact that the daily process of nutrition physical and mental is such a very humdrum function in life those extraordinary similes are very surprising and even deeply disturbingAnd they obviously were meant to be disquietingThey are meant to break through the unthinking complacency in which these so common functions of life are performed and viewed eating perceiving willing and cognizingThe contemplations on the four nutriments as presented in these pages cut at the very roots of the attachment to lifeTo pursue these contemplations radically and methodically will be a grave step advisable only for those who are determined to strive for the final cessation of craving and therefore are willing to face all consequences which that path of practice may bring for the direction of their present life and thoughtBut apart from such full commitment also a less radical pursuit but serious and repeated thought given to this teaching of the four nutriments will be beneficial to any earnest follower of the BuddhaTo those who feel it premature for themselves to aim straight at the cessation of craving the Dhamma has enough teachings that will soothe the wounds received in the battle of life and will encourage and help a steady progress on the PathThough gentle guidance will often be welcome amidst the harshness of life yet when there is only such gentleness and when for a while the winds of fate blow softly and pleasantly there will be the danger that man settles to a comfortable routine and forgets his precarious situation in this world which the Buddha so often describedHence there is the need that man and especially a Buddhist should face now and again such stern teachings as those on the nutriments which will keep him alert and will strengthen his mental fiber so that he can fearlessly meet the unveiled truth about the world in which he livesThe contemplation on the four nutriments of life can do this for himFrom that contemplation man can learn not to recoil from the real and not to be carried away by the unreal He will learn from it that it is suffering which is nourished and pampered by the four nutrimentsHe will more deeply understand thatOnly suffering arises where anything arises and only suffering ceases where anything ceasesAnd another word of the Master will gain fresh significance and increasing weightThis only do I teach suffering and its endMonks when a monk becomes entirely dispassionate towards one thing when his lust for it entirely fades away when he is entirely liberated from it when he sees the complete ending of it then he is one who after fully comprehending the Goal makes an end of suffering here and nowWhat one thingAll beings subsist by nutriment When a monk becomes entirely dispassionate towards this one thing when his lust for it entirely fades away when he is entirely liberated from it and when he sees the complete ending of it then O monks he is one who after fully comprehending the Goal makes an end of suffering here and nowAt SaavatthiiThere are O monks four nutriments for the sustenance of beings born and for the support of beings seeking birthWhat are the fourEdible food coarse and fine secondly senseimpression thirdly volitional thought fourthly consciousnessHow O monks should the nutriment edible food be consideredSuppose a couple husband and wife have set out on a journey through the desert carrying only limited provisionsThey have with them their only son dearly beloved by themNow while these two traveled through the desert their limited stock of provisions ran out and came to an end but there was still a stretch of desert not yet crossedThen the two thought Our small stock of provisions has run out it has come to an end and there is still a stretch of desert that is not yet crossedShould we not kill our only son so dearly beloved prepare dried and roasted meat and eating our sons flesh we may cross in that way the remaining part of the desert lest all three of us perishAnd these two husband and wife killed their only son so dearly beloved by them prepared dried and roasted meat and eating their sons flesh crossed in that way the remaining part of the desertAnd while eating their sons flesh they were beating their breast and crying Where are you our only and beloved sonWhere are you our only and beloved sonWhat do you think O monksWill they eat the food for the pleasure of it for enjoyment for comeliness sake for embellishmentCertainly not O LordWill they not rather eat the food merely for the sake of crossing the desertSo it is O LordIn the same manner I say O monks should edible food be consideredIf O monks the nutriment edible food is comprehended the lust for the five senseobjects is comprehendedAnd if lust for the five senseobjects is comprehended there is no fetter enchained by which a noble disciple might come to this world againAnd how O monks should the nutriment senseimpression be consideredSuppose O monks there is a skinned cow that stands close to a wall then the creatures living in the wall will nibble at the cow and if the skinned cow stands near a tree then the creatures living in the tree will nibble at it if it stands in the water the creatures living in the water will nibble at it if it stands in the open air the creatures living in the air will nibble at itWherever that skinned cow stands the creatures living there will nibble at itIn that manner I say O monks should the nutriment senseimpression be consideredIf the nutriment senseimpression is comprehended the three kinds of feeling are thereby comprehendedAnd if the three kinds of feeling are comprehended there is I say no further work left to do for the noble discipleAnd how O monks should the nutriment volitional thought be consideredSuppose O monks there is a pit of glowing embers filled to cover a mans height with embers glowing without flames and smokeNow a man comes that way who loves life and does not wish to die who wishes for happiness and detests sufferingThen two strong men would seize both his arms and drag him to the pit of glowing embersThen O monks far away from it would recoil that mans will far away from it his longing far away his inclinationAnd whyBecause the man knows If I fall into that pit of glowing embers I shall meet death or deadly painIn that manner I say O monks should the nutriment volitional thought be consideredIf the nutriment volitional thought is comprehended the three kinds of craving are thereby comprehendedAnd if the three kinds of craving are comprehended there is I say no further work left to do for the noble discipleAnd how O monks should the nutriment consciousness be consideredSuppose O monks people have seized a criminal a robber and brought him before the king saying This is a criminal a robber O MajestyMete out to him the punishment you think fit Then the king would tell them Go and in the morning strike this man with a hundred spears And they strike him in the morning with a hundred spearsAt noon the king would ask his men How is that man  He is still alive Your Majesty  Then go and strike him again at noontime with a hundred spears So they did and in the evening the king asks them again How is that man  He is still alive  Then go and in the evening strike him again with a hundred spears And so they didWhat do you think O monksWill that man struck with three hundred spears during a day suffer pain and torment owing to thatEven if he were to be struck only by a single spear he would suffer pain and torment owing to thatHow much more if he is being struck by three hundred spearsIn that manner I say O monks should the nutriment consciousness be consideredIf the nutriment consciousness is comprehended mindandmatter are thereby comprehendedAnd if mind and body are comprehended there is I say no further work left to do for the noble discipleIn explaining the need arisen ie the particular reason for the Buddha giving this discourse the commentator says that at that time the community of monks received abundant support by way of alms food and other requisitesConsidering this the Master asked himselfWill the bhikkhus be able or will they not be able to eat the alms food and still keep to that mindfulness and clear comprehension which lays hold of nutrimentWill they be detached and free of desire and greediness And he saw that there were some sons of good families recently ordained who ate the alms food without due reflectionSeeing this he thought When I practiced the perfections for four incalculable periods and a hundred thousand kalpas I did not do so for the sake of the requisites such as robes alms food etc but for the sake of the highest fruition of sainthood did I practice themAlso these bhikkhus who went forth under me did not go forth for the sake of these requisites but for the sake of attaining sainthood did they go forthAnd now they take the unessential for the essential the worthless for what is worthy Such concern arose in him and he thought further If it were possible to declare a fifth grave offense the monks partaking of food without due reflection should be made a fifth grave offenseIt is however not possible to do so because food is constantly used by beingsBut I shall speak to them in such a way that they will consider as if it were a fifth grave offenseI shall place before them a mirror of the Dhamma for their selfcontrol and restraint so that contemplating on it again and again the bhikkhus of times to come will make use of the four requisites only after due reflectionNutriment has the meaning of condition because conditions carry their own resultsHere an objection may be raised If the meaning of nutriment is that of condition why are only four of them mentioned here though living beings are conditioned also in other ways In reply it is said Because these four are prominent conditions for the individual lifecontinuityFor beings living on material food edible food is an important condition for their physical organismAs to their mental organism senseimpression is an important condition of feeling volitional thought of consciousness and consciousness of mindandbodyAccordingly it was said Just as this body subsists on nutriment subsists because of nutriment does not subsist without nutriment in the same way O monks are feelings conditioned by senseimpression is consciousness conditioned by kammaformations is mindandbody conditioned by consciousnessWhat is it now that is fed by each of the four nutrimentsEdible food feeds and conditions the set of corporeal qualities that have nutritive essence as their eighth factorThe nutriment senseimpression feeds and conditions the three kinds of feelingThe nutriment volitional thought feeds and conditions the three states of existenceThe nutriment consciousness feeds and conditions mindandbody at rebirthIn which way does this take placeEdible food immediately when it is placed in the mouth produces the eight corporeal qualitiesAnd each morsel that is chewed and swallowed produces again a set of the same eight qualitiesThus it is that edible food feeds and conditions the eight corporeal qualities that have nutritive essence as their eighth factorThe nutriment senseimpression that is liable to be felt as pleasant immediately on its arising feeds and conditions a pleasant feelingAnd it is similar with senseimpressions liable to be felt as unpleasant or neutralSo does the nutriment senseimpression in all its types feed and condition the three kinds of feelingThe nutriment volitional thought when occurring as kamma leading to rebirth on the sensuous plane feeds and conditions sensuous existenceWhen occurring as kamma leading to rebirth on the finematerial or immaterial plane it feeds and conditions the corresponding existenceSo does the nutriment volitional thought in all cases feed and condition the three states of existenceThe nutriment consciousness at the moment of rebirth feeds and conditions the three other mental groups conjoined with it and by way of conascencecondition etc it feeds and conditions the thirty corporeal processes that arise in a triple continuitySo does the nutriment consciousness feed and condition mindandbody at rebirthWhen saying that volitional thought feeds and conditions the three states of existence only karmically wholesome and unwholesome volition subject to the taints is spoken of and when saying that consciousness feeds and conditions mindandbody at rebirth only rebirthconsciousness is meantBut in general application these four are called nutriments because they carry or feed the mental processes associated with these nutriments and the corporeal processes produced by themAmong these four nutriments edible food fulfills the function of nourishing by way of sustaining senseimpression by touching volitional thought by accumulating consciousness by cognizingIn which wayThe nutriment edible food sustaining the body by fortifying it serves for the stability of beingsThough this body is produced by kamma it is through being sustained by edible food that it lasts for years or years until the end of a beings normal life spanThis may be compared firstly to a child that though brought forth by the mother is nourished by the wetnurse at the breast and is nurtured in other ways and reared thus it lives longSecondly it is like a house propped up by supportsAs it was said Just as a house that is about to fall will not fall when supported by timber so O great king is this body sustained by nutriment and persists because of nutrimentSimilarly it is by sustaining that the nutriment edible food fulfills its function of nourishingIn fulfilling that function it is a condition to two kinds of corporeal continuity that produced by nutriment and that karmically acquiredFor kammaborn corporeal processes edible food is a condition by way of being their preserver and for those produced by nutriment by way of being their originatorThe nutriment senseimpression by establishing contact with an object that is the basis of pleasure etc makes for the sustenance of beings by causing the occurrence of pleasant feelings etcThe nutriment volitional thought in accumulating wholesome and unwholesome kamma makes for the sustenance of beings by generating the root of existenceThe nutriment consciousness in its cognizing function serves the sustenance of beings by causing the occurrence of mindandbodyIn these four nutriments thus fulfilling their respective functions of sustaining etc there are four kinds of danger which should be knownIn the nutriment edible food desire is the danger in senseimpression approaching is the danger in volitional thought accumulation is a danger in consciousness manifestation is the dangerFor what reasons are they dangerHaving desire for the nutriment edible food people taking up various crafts for the sake of food undergo many hardships like enduring cold etcOthers having become monks in this dispensation seeking food in a way wrong for a monk engage themselves in a physicians work etc and thereby incur blame in this very life and hereafter they become hungry monkghosts as described in the Lakkhanasamyutta with his robe burning and ablaze For these reasons it should be understood that desire is an element of danger in edible foodThose who are fond of senseimpressions may in their approach to senseimpression offend against others property which is under their guard and protection or they may offend against the wives of others etcThen the owners of that property will seize the offenders and the goods cut those thieves into pieces and throw them on the rubbish heap or the owners will hand them over to the king who will punish them inflicting various tortures on themAnd after the breakup of the body a bad destiny awaits the offendersThus all kinds of danger occur here and hereafter which are rooted in fondness for sense impressionsFor this reason approach is the danger in senseimpressionAll danger that occurs in the three states of existence is rooted in the accumulation of wholesome and unwholesome kammaHence the danger in the nutriment volitional thought is the accumulation of kammaIn whatever place rebirthconsciousness becomes manifest there it arises along with the mindandbody existing at the moment of rebirthAnd with the arising of that mindandbody all dangers have arisen because they have their roots in itIt is for this reason that manifestation is the danger in the nutriment consciousnessThus it should be understoodBased on the bare factual account the meaning of the simile may in brief be explained as followsOnce it seems a couple husband and wife together with their little son set out for a journey through a desert of yojanas extent taking with them only few provisionsHaving traversed yojanas their provisions came to an endFeeble from hunger and thirst they sat down in a sparse patch of shade and the man spoke to his wife My dear for yojanas from here in any direction there is not a single village or hamletTherefore I cannot do now what is a mans work like tilling a field or raising cattleHence you had better kill me eat half of the flesh and taking the other half with you as provision you can safely cross the desert together with our child But she said My lord I too cannot do now a wifes duty towards you like weaving and other workSo please kill me eat half of the flesh and with the other half as provision you can safely get through the desert together with our boy He replied My dear if the mother dies it means death of twoThis delicate little boy cannot live without his motherBut if we two remain alive we may get another childHence let us kill the child take the flesh and thus escape from the desert Thereupon the wife told the child Go my dear to your father And the child wentBut the father said To bring up this child I took up on me the great suffering and fatigue of a farmers workI cannot kill the childYou may kill it And he sent it back to the motherBut she said Longing for a son I went through much hardship by offering prayers and undertaking severe vows to say nothing about the pains I suffered when bearing it in my wombI cannot kill my son And she told the child Go to your father dear While thus being sent to and fro the feeble child diedSeeing it dead the parents took the flesh ate of it and continued their trek through the desertThis food of their sons flesh being loathsome for nine reasons was not eaten by them for pleasure and enjoyment nor for comeliness sake and for the bodys embellishment but solely to enable them to cross the desertWhat are the nine reasons of its loathsomenessIts being flesh of the same  ie human  species the flesh of a relative their own son the flesh of a beloved son its being tender raw tasteless unsalted unsmokedWhen partaking of their sons flesh so loathsome for those nine reasons they did not eat it with gusto and full of greed for it but ate it in a detached way without lust and desireWhen eating they did not leave aside what was attached to bone sinew and skin selecting only the choice substantial pieces but they ate just what came to their handsThey did not take their fill gorging themselves but they took only very little of it just sufficient to sustain them for a dayThey did not grudge or envy each other the food but free from the stain of selfishness they ate it with a pure heartThey did not eat it with the illusion that it was deers meat or peacocks meat but they were well aware that it was the flesh of their beloved sonThey did not eat it with longing Oh may we again eat such flesh of our son but they ate it without any such longingThey did not hoard a portion of it thinking That much we shall eat in the desert and the remainder we shall eat when we are out of the desert adding to it salt and spices But having reached the end of the desert and fearing that the town people would see it they would have buried any remainder in the ground or burned itThey did not harbor any such pride and conceit as There is none like us who has the chance of eating such meat but they rather ate it with quite the opposite of such prideThey did not eat it with disdain Oh that saltless tasteless and evilsmelling thing but they ate it without such disdainThey did not quarrel with each other This is your share that is my shareIt is your sonIt is my son but they ate in concord and harmonyNow the Master considering in such food its aspect of being taken without greed and attachment wanted also the community of monks to appreciate that aspect and said What do you think monks will they eat the food for the pleasure of itIn the same manner that is similar to the flesh of a beloved son should edible food be considered by way of its nine loathsome aspectsWhat nineA monk takes edible food reflecting on the repulsiveness of having to go out of having to search and of the partaking of it the repulsiveness of the bodily secretion of the foods bodily receptacle of its digested and undigested condition of smearing and evacuationThese nine are explained in detail in The Path of Purification in the section on The Perception of the Repulsiveness in NutrimentHence food should be taken after applying the Simile of the Sons Flesh by way of those nine reasons of loathsomenessHere follows a lengthy section in which the statements about the couple not eating their sons flesh with gusto and greed etc are applied to a monks attitude towards his almsfoodThis is treated in full up to the last item on not quarrelingComprehensionIf the nutriment edible food is comprehended  ie if comprehended by the three kinds of comprehension comprehension as the known as investigating and abandoningIn which wayHerein a monk understands What is called the nutriment edible food is the material group with nutritive essence as the eighth factor with its material basisThis material octad where does it impingeAt the tonguesensitivityOn what is the tonguesensitivity basedOn the four great primaries of matterHence the material octad with nutritive essence as its eighth factor tonguesensitivity and the conditions of it the four great primaries  these things constitute the aggregate of corporealityThe group of mental factors having contact as the fifth factor which takes it up these are the four mental aggregatesAll these five aggregates are just mindandmatterThus he understandsHaving defined these phenomena according to their individual functions and characteristics he searches for their conditionality and finds it in the dependent origination in its ascending and descending orderBy such correct understanding of mindandmatter with its conditions in the instance of the nutriment edible food the latter has in so far been comprehended as knownTo that very mindandmatter with its conditions he now applies the three signata  impermanence suffering and notself  and discerns it by way of the seven contemplationsHereby the nutriment edible food has been comprehended by way of the investigating comprehension consisting in the full penetration of the three signata and the knowledge of discernmentBy discarding attachment and desire in regard to that very mindandmatter and comprehending it through the attainment of the path of nonreturning the nutriment edible food has been comprehended by comprehension as abandoningFor explaining the same statement in the discourse that is If the nutriment edible food is comprehended the lust for the five senseobjects is thereby comprehended there is another set of three kinds of comprehension namely single comprehension total comprehension and rootcomprehensionWhat is single comprehensionIf a monk fully understands the single craving for taste occurring at the sensedoor of the tongue thereby lust for the five senseobjects is comprehendedWhyBecause that craving arises at the five sense doorsThis very craving when arising at the eye door is called lust for visual objects when arising at the door of the ear etc it is called lust for sounds etcIt is as with a robber who does his misdeeds on five roads if he is caught on one of these roads and subsequently beheaded then all five roads will be safeSimilarly if the craving for taste is comprehended at the tongue sensedoor the entire lust for the five senseobjects is thereby comprehendedThis is the single comprehensionWhat is total comprehensionIn a single food morsel that has been placed into the monks almsbowl all fivefold sensedesire obtainsHowBy first looking at the foods clean bright appearance there is lust for visual objectsWhen hot ghee is poured over it there is a sizzling sound or when chewing hard food there is also a sound and when enjoying such sounds there is lust for soundsWhen enjoying the foods smell there is lust for odorsThrough its pleasant taste there is lust for taste objectsWhen enjoying the softness of the food there is lust for touch objectsWhen in such a way the food is considered with mindfulness and clear comprehension and is being eaten without greed and attachment then there is a total comprehension of itWhat is root comprehensionThe nutriment edible food is the root or basis of the lust for the five senseobjectsWhyBecause when the former exists the latter arisesIt is told that during the famine at the time of the brahman Tissas rebellion for twelve years husband and wife did not even look at each other with sensuous thoughtsAnd whyBecause of the scarcity of foodBut when the famine had subsided the whole isle of Ceylon was like a single large festival of childrens birth celebrationsIf nutriment is thus comprehended as being the root also the lust for the five senseobjects is hereby comprehendedThis is root comprehensionJust as the skinned cow exposed to the danger of being attacked by the creatures living in various places has no wish for honor and attention paid to her nor for bodily care given to her by cleaning her back and massaging  similarly the monk considering that he is exposed to the danger coming from those devouring creatures the mental defilements that are rooted in the nutriment senseimpression has no desire for the senseimpressions of the three planes of existenceHere too there are three comprehensionsIn this case senseimpression represents the formation aggregate the feeling conjoined with it is the feeling aggregate perception is the perception aggregate consciousness is the consciousness aggregate the organ base and its objects are the corporeality aggregateSuch correct understanding of mindandmatter with its condition is comprehension as the knownThe application to it of the three signata and the examining of it as impermanent etc by way of the seven contemplations  this is comprehension as investigatingThe path of sainthood that discards attachment and desire for that very mindandbody  this is comprehension as abandoningIf the nutriment senseimpression is thus comprehended in a threefold way the three kinds of feeling are likewise comprehended thereby because they have their root in senseimpression and are conjoined with itIn such a way the exposition of the nutriment senseimpression has been led up to the attainment of sainthoodThe application of the simile of the pit of glowing embers is as followsThe pit of glowing embers is the round of existence in its three spheresThe man desirous to live is a foolish worldling attaching himself to the round of existenceThe two strong men are the wholesome and unwholesome kammaTheir dragging the man to the pit is the accumulation of kamma because if kamma is accumulated it drags into rebirthThe pain inflicted by the pit of embers is the samsaaric suffering inflicted by kammaThe connection with the threefold comprehension is the same as in the case of senseimpressionIf the nutriment volitional thought is comprehended the three kinds of craving are thereby comprehended ie the sensual craving the craving for existence and the craving for selfannihilationWhy is this soBecause volitional thought has its root in craving and if the cause is not abandoned the result cannot be abandonedIn such a way the exposition of the nutriment volitional thought has been led up to the attainment of sainthoodIn the application of the simile of the criminal pierced by spears the king should be understood as kammaThe criminal is the foolish worldling attaching himself to the round of existenceThe spears are the rebirthconsciousnessThe order of the king to pierce the criminal with spears corresponds to the King of Kamma seizing the foolish worldling attached to samsaara and flinging him into rebirthThough herein the spears have been compared to rebirth consciousness there is no pain in the spears themselves but the pain that originates from the wound caused by the spears piercingSimilarly there is no suffering in rebirth itself but there is kammaresultant suffering arising during the lifeprocess in a given rebirth as corresponding to the painful wound caused by the spearsHere too the threefold comprehension should be understood as in the case of the nutriment senseimpressionMindandbody are thereby comprehended mindandbody as conditioned by consciousnessIf consciousness is comprehended also mindandbody are comprehended being rooted in consciousness and arising together with itIn such a way also the exposition of the nutriment consciousness has been led up to the attainment of sainthoodAt SaavatthiiThere are O monks four nutriments for the sustenance of beings born and for the support of beings seeking birthWhat are the fourEdible food coarse and fine secondly senseimpression thirdly volitional thought fourthly consciousnessOf these four nutriments O monks what is their source what is their origin from what are they born what gives them existenceThese four nutriments O monks have craving as their cause have craving as their origin are born of craving and craving gives them existenceAnd this craving O monks what is its source what its origin from what is it born what gives it existenceCraving has feeling as its source and origin it is born of feeling and feeling gives existence to itAnd this feeling O monks what is its source and origin from what is it born and what gives existence to itFeeling has senseimpression as its source and originAnd this senseimpression O monks what is its sourcesenseimpression has the six sensebases as its source and originAnd these six sensebases O monks what is their sourceThe six sensebases have mindandbody as their source and originAnd this mindandbody O monks what is its sourceMindandbody has consciousness as its source and originAnd this consciousness O monks what is its sourceConsciousness has kammaformations as its source and originAnd these kammaformations O monks what is their source and origin from what are they born what gives existence to themKammaformations have ignorance as their source and origin they are born of ignorance and ignorance gives existence to themThus O monks through ignorance conditioned are kammaformations through the kammaformations conditioned is consciousness through consciousness conditioned is mindandbody through mindandbody conditioned are the six sensebases through the six sensebases conditioned is senseimpression through senseimpression conditioned is feeling through feeling conditioned is craving through craving conditioned is clinging through clinging conditioned is becoming through becoming conditioned is birth through birth conditioned are decay and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairThus arises this whole mass of sufferingIn this discourse the origin of the four nutriments is traced to craving and the conditioned arising is pursued further back in terms of the dependent originationBut while in the usual formula of the dependent origination it is clinging that is conditioned by craving here in this text nutriment takes the place of clingingSo it also does in the MahaaTanhaasankhaya Sutta while the CuulaSihanaada Sutta has here the fourfold division of clinging with otherwise the same wording as our present textBoth Paali words aahaara and upaadaana have originally the same meaning of taking up seizing and both are also used to signify the fuel of a fire or a lampHere the statement in the discourse that the four nutriments have craving as their source should be understood to mean that cravings in a former life are the source of the nutriments or in other words of the individual from rebirth onwardsHowAt the moment of rebirth there is present nutritive essence that has originated within the corporeality arisen by way of seven units of corporeal continua in the case of beings with complete sense faculties or in the case of other beings with the appropriate reduction of the continuaThis nutritive essence constitutes the karmically acquired nutriment edible food that has craving as its sourceThe senseimpression and volition associated with the rebirthconsciousness as well as that consciousness itself  these are the karmically acquired nutriments senseimpression volitional thought and consciousness which have craving as their sourceThis so far refers to the nutriments arising at rebirth and having as their source the craving in a former lifeThe same applies also to the nutriments arising later at the first moment of bhavanga and so forthBut because the Exalted One not only knows the source of the nutriments which is craving but also the latters source which is feeling and so forth therefore the discourse continues And this craving O monks what is its source showing by this method the samsaaric cycle and the stopping of that cycleHere however the exposition is given under the aspect of the past and accordingly the cycle of kamma and kamma result has been described in terms of pastHowThis individual is conceived the four nutriments craving is the generative kamma for this individualFeeling senseimpression sixfold sensebase mindandbody and consciousness are the factors present in the individual that performs that kamma they have been mentioned here for indicatingThus the individual has been indicated here in two places and in two places the generative kamma of that has been indicatedIn such a way two things have been shown here in brief kamma and kamma result and in doing so the exposition has been given under the aspect of the past and accordingly the samsaaric cycle has been described here in terms of pastBut one should not think that this exposition of the dependent origination is incomplete because it does not extend to its future partit is implied by indicating the method and therefore it should be understood that this exposition is quite completeThis is a simile for it Suppose a clearsighted man sees a crocodile lying on the waters surfaceAt the foremost part of it he sees the throat further on the back and at the end the root of the tailBut when looking at the belly he does not see the rest of the tail nor the four legs which are submerged in the waterYet for that reason he does not think that the crocodile is incomplete but by methodical inference he takes it to be completeThe application of this simile is as followsThe crocodile lying on the surface of the water is like the samsaaric cycle on its three levelsThe clearsighted man standing on the shore is the meditatorThe time when the man sees the crocodile on the surface of the water corresponds to the time when the meditator understands this individual existence by way of the nutrimentsSeeing the throat as the foremost part is like seeing craving as the generative force for this individualSeeing the crocodiles back is like the seeing of feeling etc in that existence where the kamma called craving has been performedSeeing the root of the tail is like seeing ignorance and kammaformations being the generative factors of this individuals existenceLooking at the belly below and though not seeing the end of the tail and the legs yet not assuming that the crocodile is incomplete but taking it as complete by methodical inference  this is like accepting the exposition to be complete and not believing it to be incomplete if in a canonical passage this or that section of the cycle of conditions is not mentionedThere is here one link between nutriment and craving one link between craving and feeling and one link between consciousness and kammaformationsThus the cycle has been shown in three links and four sectionsThere are O monks four nutrimentsAfter these words the venerable MoliyaPhagguna addressed the Exalted One as followsWho O Lord consumes the nutriment consciousnessThe question is not correct said the Exalted OneI do not say that he consumes If I had said so then the question Who consumes would be appropriateBut since I did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be For what is the nutriment consciousness And to that the correct reply is The nutriment consciousness is a condition for the future arising of a renewed existence when that has come into being there is the sixfold sensebase and conditioned by the sixfold sensebase is senseimpression Who O Lord has a senseimpressionThe question is not correct said the Exalted OneI do not say that he has a senseimpression Had I said so then the question Who has a senseimpression would be appropriateBut since I did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be What is the condition of senseimpression And to that the correct reply is The sixfold sensebase is a condition of senseimpression and senseimpression is the condition of feeling Who O Lord feelsThe question is not correct said the Exalted OneI do not say that he feels Had I said so then the question Who feels would be appropriateBut since I did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be What is the condition of feeling And to that the correct reply is senseimpression is the condition of feeling and feeling is the condition of craving Who O Lord cravesThe question is not correct said the Exalted OneI do not say that he craves Had I said so then the question Who craves would be appropriateBut since I did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be What is the condition of craving And to that the correct reply is Feeling is the condition of craving and craving is the condition of clinging Who O Lord clingsThe question is not correct said the Exalted One I do not say that he clings Had I said so then the question Who clings would be appropriateBut since I did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be What is the condition of clinging And to that the correct reply is Craving is the condition of clinging and clinging is the condition of the process of becoming Such is the origin of this entire mass of sufferingThrough the complete fading away and cessation of even these six bases of senseimpression senseimpression ceases through the cessation of senseimpression feeling ceases through the cessation of feeling craving ceases through the cessation of craving clinging ceases through the cessation of clinging the process of becoming ceases through the cessation of the process of becoming birth ceases through the cessation of birth old age death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair ceaseSuch is the cessation of this entire mass of sufferingAt SaavatthiiThere are O monks four nutriments for the sustenance of beings born and for the support of beings seeking birthWhat are the fourEdible food coarse and fine senseimpression is the second volitional thought the third and consciousness the fourthIf O monks there is lust for the nutriment edible food if there is pleasure in it and craving for it then consciousness takes a hold therein and growsWhere consciousness takes a hold and grows there will be occurrence of mindandbodyWhere there is occurrence of mindandbody there is growth of kammaformationsWhere there is growth of kammaformations there is a future arising of renewed existenceWhere there is a future arising of renewed existence there is future birth decay and deathThis I say O monks is laden with sorrow burdened with anguish and despairIf O monks there is lust for the nutriment senseimpression volitional thought consciousness if there is pleasure in it and craving for it then consciousness takes a hold therein and growsWhere consciousness takes a hold and grows there will be occurrence of mindandbodyWhere there is occurrence of mindandbody there is growth of kammaformationsWhere there is growth of kammaformations there is a future arising of renewed existenceWhere there is a future arising of renewed existence there is future birth decay and deathThis I say O monks is laden with sorrow burdened with anguish and despairSuppose there is a dyer or a painterHaving some dye or lac turmeric indigo or crimson he would depict on a wellsmoothed wooden tablet on a wall or a piece of cloth the figure of a woman or a man with all the major and minor featuresSimilarly O monks if there is lust for the nutriments edible food senseimpression volitional thought and consciousness then consciousness takes a hold therein and growsWhere consciousness takes a hold and grows there is occurrence of mindandbodyWhere there is occurrence of mindandbody there is growth of kammaformationsWhere there is growth of kammaformations there is a future arising of renewed existenceWhere there is a future arising of renewed existence there is future birth decay and deathThis I say O monks is laden with sorrow burdened with anguish and despairBut if O monks there is no lust for the nutriments edible food senseimpression volitional thought and consciousness if there is no pleasure in them and no craving for them then consciousness does not take a hold therein and does not growWhere consciousness does not take a hold nor grow there will be no occurrence of mindandbodyWhere there is no occurrence of mindandbody there is no growth of kammaformationsWhere there is no growth of kammaformations there is no future arising of renewed existenceWhere there is no future arising of renewed existence there is no future birth decay and deathThis I say O monks is free of sorrow of anguish and despairSuppose O monks there is a gabled house or a gabled hall with windows at the northern southern and eastern sidesNow when at sunrise a ray of the sun enters through a window where would it find hold  On the western wall O Lord  But if there were no western wall O monks where would it find a hold  On the earth O Lord  And if there were no earth where would it find a hold  On the water O Lord  And if there were no water where would it find a hold  It would not find any hold whatsoever O LordSimilarly O monks if there is no lust for the nutriments edible food senseimpression volitional thought and consciousness if there is no pleasure in them and no craving for them then consciousness does not take hold therein and does not growWhere consciousness does not take a hold nor grow there will be no occurrence of mindandbody there is no growth of kammaformationsWhere there is no growth of kammaformations there is no future arising of renewed existenceWhere there is no future arising of renewed existence there is no future birth decay and deathThis I say O monks is free of sorrow of anguish and despairThis has come to be  do you see that SaariputtaThis has come to be  that O Lord one sees with true wisdom as it really isAnd having seen with true wisdom as it really is that this has come to be one is on the way towards revulsion from what has come to be towards dispassion and cessationProduced by such nutriment  that one sees with true wisdom as it really isAnd having seen with true wisdom as it really is that this has been produced by such nutriment one is on the way towards revulsion from its production by nutriment towards dispassion and cessationBy the cessation of nutriment that what has come to be is bound to cease  that one sees with true wisdom as it really isAnd having seen with true wisdom as it really is that By the cessation of that nutriment what has come to be is bound to cease one is on the way towards revulsion from what is liable to cease towards dispassion and cessationThus O Lord is one in higher trainingAnd how O Lord is one a comprehender of DhammaThis has come to be  that O Lord one sees with true wisdom as it really isAnd having seen with true wisdom as it really is that this has come to be then through revulsion from what has come to be through dispassion and the cessation one is liberated without any clingingProduced by such nutriment  that one sees with true wisdom as it really isAnd having seen with true wisdom as it really is that this has been produced by such nutriment then through revulsion from its production by nutriment through dispassion and the cessation one is liberated without any clingingBy the cessation of nutriment that what has come to be is bound to cease  that one sees with true wisdom as it really isAnd having seen with true wisdom as it really is that by the cessation of that nutriment what has come to be is bound to cease then through revulsion from what is liable to cease from dispassion and the cessation one is liberated without any clingingThus O Lord is one a comprehender of Dhamma Well spoken Saariputta well spoken said the Exalted OneThen the monks put another question to the venerable Saariputta Friend could there be another way in which a noble disciple can be said to be one of Right Understanding whose view is upright who is possessed of steadfast confidence in the Dhamma who has attained to this good teachingThere could be friendsIf friends a noble disciple knows nutriment knows the origin of nutriment knows the ceasing of nutriment and knows the way leading to the ceasing of nutriment then he is in so far one of Right Understanding whose view is upright who is possessed of steadfast confidence in the Dhamma who has attained to this good teachingAnd what is nutrimentThere are four nutriments for the sustenance of beings born and for the support of beings seeking birthWhat are the fourEdible food coarse and fine senseimpression is the second volitional thought the third and consciousness the fourthThrough the origin of craving there is origin of nutrimentThrough the ceasing of craving there is ceasing of nutrimentThe way leading to the ceasing of nutriment is the Noble Eightfold Path namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationFriends if a noble disciple thus knows nutriment knows the origin of nutriment the ceasing of nutriment and the way leading to the ceasing of nutriment he entirely abandons the inner tendency to lust he casts off the inner tendency to illwill eliminates the inner tendency to the opinionandconceit of I am he discards ignorance produces knowledge and becomes an ender of suffering here and nowIn this discourse there is one link between consciousness and mindandbody one link between feeling and craving and one link between the process of becoming and birthSubComy Since in the words of the discourse The nutriment consciousness is a condition for the future arising of a renewed existence as being a condition in a former existence for a future existence and as being a principal cause therefore the Commentary says that there is a link between consciousness and mindandbody Hence it should be understood that by the term consciousness also the kammaforming consciousness is impliedHere taking nutriment together with consciousness there is one link between nutriment and mindandbodyIncluding mindandbody in the section of the resultants there is one link between mindandbody and kammaformationsFinally there is one link between kammaformations and the future existenceThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseI have written this book The Divine Mantra as a means of drawing to purity those who practice the Dhamma because the chant given here brings benefits to those who memorize and recite it inasmuch as it deals directly with matters that exist in each of usNormally once we are born we all dwell in the six elementsThese elements are brought together by our own actions both good and evilThis being the case these elements can give a great deal of trouble to those who dwell in them like a child who can be a constant nuisance to its parentsRepeating this chant then is like nourishing and training a child to be healthy and mature when the child is healthy and mature its parents can rest and relaxRepeating this chant is like feeding a child and lulling it to sleep with a beautiful song the Buddhaguna the recitation of the Buddhas virtuesThe power of the Buddhaguna can exert influence on the elements in each individual purifying them and investing them with power just as all material elements exert gravitational pull on one another every secondOr you might make a comparison with an electric wire This chant is like an electric current extending to wherever you direct itIt can even improve the environment because it also includes the chant of the Kapila hermit whose story runs as followsThere was once a hermit who repeated this chant in a teak forest in IndiaAs a result the forest became a paradiseThe trees took turns producing flowers and fruit throughout the yearThe waters were crystal cleanAny diseased animal that happened to pass into the forest and drink the water would be completely cured of its illnessThe grasses and vines were always fresh and greenFierce animals that normally attacked and ate one another would when entering the forest live together in peace as friendsLife was joyous for animals in this forestThe smell of dead animals never appeared because whenever an animal was about to die it would have to go and die elsewhereThis forest is where the Buddhas ancestors the Sakyan clan later established their capital Kapilavatthu which still stands today within the borders of NepalAll of this was due to the sacred power of the chant repeated by the Kapila hermitAnd this is how he did it First he faced the east and repeated the chant day and night for seven days the second week he faced north the third week south and the fourth week westThe fifth week he looked down toward the earth the sixth week he raised his hands and lifted his face to the sky made his heart clear and focused on the stars as the object of his meditationThe seventh week he practiced breath meditation keeping his breath in mind and letting it spread out in every direction through the power of a mind infused with the four Sublime Attitudes good will compassion appreciation and equanimityThus the chant was named the Divine MantraWhen all of this was related to me while I was in India I couldnt help thinking of the Buddha who was pure by virtue of the peerless quality of his heart to the point where he was able to invest the elements in his body with power making them more pure than any other elements in the worldHis relics for example have appeared to those devoted to him and I have heard come and go on their own which is very strange indeedAll of these things are accomplished through the power of a pure heartWhen the heart is pure the elements also become pure as a resultWhen these elements exist in the world they can have a refreshing influence on the environment  because all elements are interrelatedIf we Buddhists set our minds on training ourselves in this direction we can be a powerful influence to the good in proportion to our numbersBut if we dont train ourselves and instead run about filling ourselves with evil our hearts are bound to become hot and disturbedThe flames in our hearts are bound to set the elements in our bodies on fire and the heat from these inner fires is certain to spread in all directions throughout the worldAs this heat gathers and becomes greater it will raise temperatures in the atmosphere around the worldThe heat from the sun will become fiercerWeather will become abnormalThe seasons for example will deviate from their normal courseAnd when this happens human life will become more and more of a hardshipThe ultimate stage of this evil will be the destruction of the world by the fires at the end of the aeon which will consume the earthAll this from our own thoughtlessness letting nature by and large go ahead and follow this course  which shows that were not very rational because everything has a reason everything comes from a causeThe world we live in has the heart as its causeIf the heart is good the world is sure to be goodIf the heart is corrupt the world is sure to be corruptThus in this book I have written down the way to train the heart so as to lead to our happiness and wellbeing in the coming futureTo pay respect to and ask forgiveness of the Buddhas relics relics of the Noble Disciples Buddha images stupas the Bodhi tree  all of

breaths thinking bud with the inbreath and dho with the out Keep the meditation syllable as long as the breathBe clearly aware of each inandout breathObserve the breath as it goes in and out noticing whether its comfortable or uncomfortable broad or narrow obstructed or freeflowing fast or slow short or long warm or cool If the breath doesnt feel comfortable change it until it does For instance if breathing in long and out long is uncomfortable try breathing in short and out short As soon as you find that your breathing feels comfortable let this comfortable breath sensation spread to the different parts of the bodyTo begin with inhale the breath sensation at the base of the skull and let it flow all the way down the spine Then if you are male let it spread down your right leg to the sole of your foot to the ends of your toes and out into the airInhale the breath sensation at the base of the skull again and let it spread down your spine down your left leg to the ends of your toes and out into the air Then let the breath from the base of the skull spread down over both shoulders past your elbows and wrists to the tips of your fingers and out into the airLet the breath at the base of the throat spread down the central nerve at the front of the body past the lungs and liver all the way down to the bladder and colonInhale the breath right at the middle of the chest and let it go all the way down to your intestinesLet all these breath sensations spread so that they connect and flow together and youll feel a greatly improved sense of wellbeingLearn four ways of adjusting the breathBreathe whichever way is most comfortable for you Or better yet learn to breathe comfortably all four ways because your physical condition and your breath are always changingBecome acquainted with the bases or focal points for the mind  the resting spots of the breath  and center your awareness on whichever one seems most comfortable A few of these bases areIf you suffer from frequent headaches or nervous problems dont focus on any spot above the base of the throat And dont try to force the breath or put yourself into a trance Breathe freely and naturally Let the mind be at ease with the breath  but not to the point where it slips awaySpread your awareness  your sense of conscious feeling  throughout the entire bodyUnite the breath sensations throughout the body letting them flow together comfortably keeping your awareness as broad as possible Once you are fully aware of the aspects of the breath you already know in your body youll come to know all sorts of other aspects as well The breath by its nature has many facets breath sensations flowing in the nerves those flowing around and about the nerves those spreading from the nerves to every pore Beneficial breath sensations and harmful ones are mixed together by their very natureTo summarize for the sake of improving the energy already existing in every part of your body so that you can contend with such things as disease and pain and for the sake of clarifying the knowledge already within you so that it can become a basis for the skills leading to release and purity of heart  you should always bear these seven steps in mind because they are absolutely basic to every aspect of breath meditationWorship chanting and meditation have to go handinhand before they can truly purify the mind in line with the basic principles of the Buddhas teachingsSabbapāpassa akaraṇaṃKusalassūpasampadāDevelop skill in all of your actionsWhat this means is that in worship we have acted skillfully with our deeds in chanting we have acted skillfully with our words and in meditation we have acted skillfully with our thoughts Once this is the case we will be able to reach the heart of the Buddhas teachingsSacittapariyodapanaṃAttain purity of heartEverything in the world comes about solely through the power of the heart A corrupt heart will abuse this power A welltrained heart can use this power to uplift others and to gain blessings beyond priceTo people looking at Buddhism through the medium of English the practice of compassion and detachment can appear incompatible especially for those who consider themselves to be socially and politically engagedIn contemporary usage compassion brings to mind outwardmoving concern for others while detachment suggests aloofness and withdrawal from the worldYet Buddhism recommends both as admirable and necessary qualities to be cultivatedThis raises questions such as the followingIt is certainly possible to draw sentences from Buddhist writers which seem to support a rejection of outward concern for othersFor example Edward Conze has written The Yogin can only come into contact with the unconditioned when he brushes aside anything which is conditioned Similarly GSPMisra writes In the final analysis all actions are to be put to cessation The Buddha speaks of happiness involved in nonaction which he further says is an integral part of the Right WayTaken in isolation and out of context these remarks can give the impression that the path to Nibbaana implies developing a lack of concern towards everything in samsaaraBut is this inference soundI would argue that it is notThis is an issue which touches on the whole question of transferring concepts across linguistic barriers in this case Paali and EnglishIt calls not only for an understanding of how the concepts are used within the framework of the Paali Buddhist texts but also for an awareness of how the English terms used in translation function and whether they are adequateInevitably a dialogical approach between two linguistic frameworks is necessaryViveka and viraaga are the two Paali words which have been translated as detachment The two however are not synonymousThe primary meaning of viveka is separation aloofness seclusionOften physical withdrawal is impliedThe later commentarial tradition however identifies three forms of viveka kaayaviveka cittaviveka and upadhivivekaKaayaviveka as a chosen way of life was not uncommon during the time of the BuddhaTo withdraw from the household life renounce possessions and adopt a solitary mendicancy was a recognized pathThe formation of the Buddhist monastic Sangha was grounded in the belief that going out from home to homelessness could aid concentrated spiritual effortYet to equate the renunciation which the Buddha encouraged with a physical withdrawal which either punished the body or completely rejected human contact would be a mistakeThe Buddha made it clear that the detachment of a noble disciple  the detachment connected with the path  was not essentially a physical act of withdrawal let alone austerityKaayaviveka was valuable only if seen as a means to the inner purging and mental transformation connected with the destruction of cravingThis is illustrated in the Udumbarika Siihanaada Sutta in which the Buddha claims that the asceticism of a recluse who clings to solitude could lead to pride carelessness attentionseeking and hypocrisy if not linked to the cultivation of moral virtues and the effort to gain insight through meditationA further insight is given in the Nivaapa Sutta which weaves a lengthy story around the relationship of four herds of deer with a certain crop representing sensual pleasure sown by the hunter for the deers ensnaringBoth the ascetics who crave for pleasure and those who deny themselves any enjoyment in an extreme way are destroyedReferring to the latter the Buddha saysBecause their bodies were extremely emaciated their strength and energy diminished freedom of mind diminished because freedom of mind diminished they went back to the very crop sown by Maara  the material things of this worldThe message of the sutta is that ascetic withdrawal can reduce the minds ability to discernIt can also lead to the repression of mental tendencies rather than to their rooting out and destructionThe detachment of which Buddhism speaks therefore is not an extreme turning away from that which normally nourishes the human bodyNeither is it a closing of the eyes to all beauty as is clear from the followingDelightful reverend AAnanda is the Gosinga salwoodIt is a clear moonlit night the saltrees are in full blossomMethinks devalike scents are being wafted aroundThis is an expression of delight uttered by Saariputta an arahant on meeting some fellow monks one nightOne must look away from external acts and towards the area of inner attitudes and motivation for a true understanding of the role of detachment in BuddhismPhysical withdrawal is only justified if it is linked to inner moral purification and meditationIn this light cittaviveka and upadhiviveka become necessary subdivisions to bring out the full implications of detachment within Buddhist spiritual practiceUpadhiviveka as withdrawal from the roots of suffering links up with viraaga the second word used within Buddhism to denote detachmentViraaga literally means the absence of raaga the absence of lust desire and craving for existenceHence it denotes indifference or nonattachment to the usual objects of raaga such as material goods or sense pleasuresNonattachment is an important term here if the Paali is to be meaningful to speakers of EnglishIt is far more appropriate than detachment because of the negative connotations detachment possesses in EnglishRaaga is a close relation of upaadaana which within the causal chain binding human beings to repeated births grows from tanhaa and results in bhava  continued samsaaric existenceThe English word nonattachment suggests a way of looking at both of themThe Buddhist texts refer to four strands of grasping grasping of sense pleasures of views of rule and custom of doctrines of selfAll of these can also be described as forms of raaga or desireTo destroy their power over the human psyche attachment to them must be transformed into nonattachmentNonattachment or nongrasping would therefore flow from the awareness that no possession no relationship no achievement is permanent or able to give lasting satisfaction from the discovery that there is no self which needs to be protected promoted or defended and from the realization that searching for selfish sensual gratification is pointless since it leads only to craving and obsessionPhrases which overlap with attachment in this context and which can help to clarify its meaning are possessiveness in relationships defensiveness jealousy covetousness acquisitiveness and competitivenessThrough nonattachment these are attenuated and overcomeThere is nothing yet in this description which points to a lack of concern for humanity or the worldThe emphasis is rather on inner transformation so that destructive and divisive traits can be destroyed making way for their opposites to flourishTo take attachment to sense pleasures as an example many suttas mention the peril involvedThe person attached to sense pleasures is likened to a wet sappy stick placed in waterAs such a stick cannot be used to light a fire so the one addicted to sense pleasures cannot attain the incomparable selfawakeningHe is one with whom Maara can do what he likesHe is like one holding a blazing torch which must be dropped if burning and pain is to be avoidedIn fact it is stressed that attachment to sense pleasures destroys the minds ability to think clearly and objectivelyViraaga on the other hand is linked to the practice of mindfulness and to seeing into the truth of thingsFor Buddhists therefore nonattachment or detachment does not mean a withdrawal from striving for truth but a movement towards seeing the true nature of things more clearlyIn contrast saraaga leads to biased and false perceptions since objects are sensed through a net of predispositions towards attraction and aversionSeeing the truth through nonattachment can operate both at a mundane and a higher levelAt a mundane level for instance if greed always arises when an opportunity for gaining quick wealth is glimpsed wealth will never be seen objectively as it really is  as transient subject to change and no answer to the search for happinessBecause of raaga neither the consequences nor the alternatives will be appreciatedIn fact if any decision has to be made the alternatives will not be seen clearly as long as the mind is clouded by raagaDishonesty and the manipulation of others in order to gain what is craved might resultWith reference to the higher stages of insight satipatthaana viveka and viraaga are intertwinedFound in many suttas are words such as the followingHe chooses some lonely spot to rest on his way  in the woods at the foot of tree on a hillside and returning there after alms round he seats himself when his meal is done crosslegged Putting away the hankering after the world he remains with a heart that hankers not and purifies his mind of lustsAloof from the pleasures of the senses aloof from unskilled states of mind he enters and abides in the first jhaanaThe ultimate results of such practices are the four jhaanas or absorptions the verification by direct vision of the doctrine of karma insight into the Four Noble Truths and eventually the knowledge that release from rebirth has been gainedViraaga is in fact a prerequisite for attaining nibbaana and the treatment of the word in the texts implies that the two are almost synonymousAt this point it is worth looking at how the word detachment has been used in the Western traditionIn colloquial usage to say that a person is detached can be derogatory implying that the person is not willing to become involved with others or that he or she is neither approachable nor sympatheticThis current usage must be borne in mindThree strands of meaning however emerge from most dictionary definitionsPrimarily detachment refers to the action and process of separatingFlowing from this has come the military usage to describe the dispatch of a body of troopsMore relevant to this study however is the third body of meanings connected with detachment as an attitude of mindAloofness and indifference to worldly concerns are phrases used to describe this attitudeAlthough these might appear to conform to the abovementioned contemporary connotations we find linked with this freedom from bias and prejudice Thus in both the Western tradition and the Eastern detachment is linked with clarity of perception nonpartiality and fair judgmentVoices supporting this come from the Christian mystical tradition and the contemporary scientific worldClassical Christian mysticism saw indifference to worldly and material concerns as an essential component of the movement towards GodFulfilling Gods will with total love and obedience was accompanied by detachment from the worldlyIn modern scientific research a similar quality is emphasizedA commitment to truth is recognized but so is the necessity for a mind detached from the results of research detached from the wish for a particular outcomeFor it is known that if the scientist is searching for one particular scientific result he might unconsciously manipulate the experiments or observations in order to obtain that resultTherefore when looking at the implications of detachment it is worth taking into account Western usage as wellThe socially active person can be quick to look down on those who appear either distanced from or untouched by the social economic and political crises facing the worldBut they should remember that detachment can have a positive fruit even in relation to social activism the ability to see the truth more clearly and to judge more impartiallyTo return to the Buddhist tradition The Buddha was once faced with the remark that the most worthy person is the one who speaks neither in dispraise of the unworthy nor in praise of the praiseworthyThe Buddha disagreed with thisHe replied that because of his ability to discriminate the person who speaks in dispraise of the unworthy and in praise of worthy is bestThe Buddha rejects the selfdistancing which refuses to take sides or to speak out against what should be condemnedHe criticizes the desire to keep the truth inviolate and unspoken through a wish not to become involved with societyViveka and viraaga therefore do not imply the kind of withdrawal which is unconcerned with what is good or bad for human welfareThe fruits of nonattachment are not only linked with the gaining of knowledge the incomparable selfawakening but are also related to creating a just and harmonious societyThe Mahaadukkhakkhandha Sutta makes a direct connection between attachment to sense pleasures and the movement towards chaos in societyGreed for the possessions of another leads to disputes and contentions at the level of both the family and nation until having taken sword and shield having girded bow and quiver both sides mass for battle and arrows are hurled and swords are flashing In the same sutta theft adultery and vicious corporal punishment are likewise attributed to sense pleasures and attachment to themIn other texts attachment to views is spoken about as a cause of disputes especially in the religious communityYet the point drawn is relevant to the whole of societyThe result of a person asserting This is the very truth all else is falsehood is disputeAnd If there is dispute there is contention if there is contention there is trouble if there is trouble there is vexationTherefore far from implying lack of concern for the welfare of others detachment from such things as sensual desires and the urge to assert dogmatic views is seen as essential to itWe are back to the four strands of grasping and the need to root these outKarunaa is the Paali word translated as compassionContemporary writers have spoken of it thusIt is defined as that which makes the heart of the good quiver when others are subject to suffering or that which dissipates the suffering of othersCompassion is a virtue which uproots the wish to harm othersIt makes people so sensitive to the sufferings of others and causes them to make these sufferings so much their own that they do not want to further increase themThis isnt selfpity or pity for othersIts really feeling ones own pain and recognizing the pain of others Seeing the web of suffering were all entangled in we become kind and compassionate to one anotherThe above definitions varyYet central to all is the claim that karunaa concerns our attitude to the suffering of othersIn the Buddhist texts the term often refers to an attitude of mind to be radiated in meditationThis is usually considered its primary usageNevertheless the definitions of Buddhist writers past and present as well as the texts themselves stress that it is also more than thisAnukampaa and dayaa often translated as sympathy are closely allied to itIn fact at least three strands of meaning in the term compassion can be detected in the texts a prerequisite for a just and harmonious society an essential attitude for progress along the path towards wisdom and the liberative action within society of those who have become enlightened or who are sincerely following the path towards itAll these strands need to be looked at if the term is to be understood and if those who accuse Buddhist compassion of being too passive are to be answered correctlyThe foundation for any spiritual progress within Buddhism is the Five PreceptsRites rituals ascetic practices and devotional offerings are all subservient to the morality they stressCompassion for the life feelings and security of others is inseparably linked with the first second and fourth preceptsFor instance the ideal of ahimsaa of the first must flow from compassion if it is to be effectiveThe Vasala Sutta makes this relationship explicit although the word dayaa usually translated as sympathy or compassion is used and not karunaaWhoever in this world harms living beings onceborn or twiceborn in whom there is no compassion for living beings  know him as an outcastImportant to the exercising of this kind of compassion is the realization that life is dear to all as shown in the following Dhammapada verseHere nonharming and compassion flow both from a sensitivity to our own hopes and fears and the ability to place ourselves in the shoes of othersCompassion towards self and compassion towards others are inseparableThe Buddhas teachings about statecraft and government also embody compassion as a guiding principleThe Cakkavatti Siihanaada Sutta describes a state in which the king ignores his religious advisers and does not give wealth to the poorPoverty becomes widespread and in its wake follow theft murder immorality in various forms and communal breakdownThe culmination is a sword period in which men and women look upon one another as animals and cut one another with swordsIn this sutta lack of compassion for the poor leads to the disintegration of societyLack of social and economic justice leads to disasterIn contrast the ideal Buddhist model for society as deduced from the texts would be one in which exploitation in any part of its structure is not toleratedSuch a society would be rooted in compassionCompassion is its prerequisiteTo move to the second strand I have already stated that the word karunaa was most often mentioned in the texts in the specialized context of meditation to denote an important form of mind trainingHere the emphasis is on each persons pilgrimage towards Nibbaana rather than on interaction with other beingsFor example the Kandaraka Sutta describes the path of a person who does not torment himself or others Moral uprightness is stressed initially but the final stages of the path are seen purely in terms of meditation and mindtrainingAt this point no mention is made of outgoing actionBy getting rid of the taint of illwill he lives benevolent in mind and compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings he purifies the mind of the taint of illwillIn this context the development of karunaa plays an essential part in the meditation practice that leads towards wisdom and the destruction of cravingThe importance of this must not be underestimatedThe development of a compassionate mind is a direct preparation for right concentration and a prerequisite of NibbaanaIf from a brahmans family if from a merchants family if from a workers family and if from whatever family he has gone forth from home into homelessness and has come into this dhamma and discipline taught by the Tathaagata having thus developed friendliness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity he attains inward calm  I say it is by inward calm that he is following the practices suitable for reclusesKarunaa is one of the four brahmavihaaras or sublime states along with mettaa muditaa and upekkhaaThe higher stages are seen to rest on them because they have the power to weaken the defilements of lust illwill and delusion and to bring the mind to a state of peaceRarely is meditation mentioned without reference to themYet a distinction must be made between mettaa and karunaaThe two are linked together at one level through the brahmavihaarasYet in the texts mettaa constantly remains a disposition an interior attitudeKarunaa is more than thisSignificant here is Buddhaghosas treatment of the word in the VisuddhimaggaWhen referring to the brahmavihaaras he treats karunaa in a similar way to mettaaYet in a later definition his words can be translated asWhen there is suffering in others it causes good peoples hearts to be moved thus it is compassionOr alternatively it combats others suffering and demolishes it thus it is compassionOr alternatively it is scattered upon those who suffer or extended to them by pervasion thus it is compassionBhikkhu Naanamoli in the notes to his translation stresses that kinaati here does not come under the usual meaning of to buy but is linked with the Sanskrit krnaati to injure or killTherefore he chooses to translate it as combat unmistakably connecting Buddhaghosas definition of karunaa with actionIn a later paragraph Buddhaghosa adds that compassion succeeds when it makes cruelty subside and it fails when it produces sorrow To Buddhaghosa karunaa was both a deliverance of the mind and liberative action or more exactly a quality compelling people towards such actionThis emphasis on liberative action is seen supremely in AAcariya Dhammapaalas words about the great compassion and wisdom of the BuddhaThe passage is structured in a series of parallel sentences each one contrasting and comparing the fruits of the two qualitiesThe following are selected from the longer wholeIt is through understanding that he fully understood others suffering and through compassion that he undertook to counteract it It was through understanding that he himself crossed over and through compassion that he brought others acrossLikewise it was through compassion that he became the worlds helper and through understanding that he became his own helperIn the above passage pannaa or wisdom is connected with knowledge and insight and karunaa or compassion with liberative actionThe two are held in corrective balance counteracting the view that karunaa is linked only with the passivity of meditationFor the Enlightened One karunaa was what impelled him to remain in society as teacher and liberatorHe saw the need of the murderer Angulimaala and a destructive life was put on another courseFor fortyfive years he preached in the face of criticism opposition and misunderstanding in the knowledge that the Dhamma would be understood only by a fewHe did not hide the fact that suffering is universal but made compassion the reverse side of this truth as is shown in the traditional stories of his encounters with Pataacaaraa Kisaagotamii and the slave girl RajjumaalaaHe was not slow either to admonish monks who were unwilling to tend the sick among them or to do the tending himself however distressing the illness was Whoever would attend on me should attend on the sick has come down the centuries as words he said on one such occasionThis ideal was placed before the whole monastic SanghaAlthough many members of the Sangha may have failed to reach it it is certain that some attained a stage where compassionate loving action had replaced selfishnessIn the final stage of the path there is a sense in which action ceasesYet it is the kind of action which is dictated by attraction or aversion which must stop action which has kammic results not that which flows from a purified mind filled with compassionThe mission he set for himself and for the Sangha was one of compassionate liberative actionThe first sixty arahants were sent out with the wordsGo forth bhikkhus for the good of the many for the happiness of the many out of compassion for the world for the good benefit and happiness of gods and menLet not two go by the same wayMahaakassapa is praised because he teaches the doctrine to others out of pity out of caring for them because of his compassion for themFor the above disciples all that had to be done for their release had been doneThey now embodied compassionCompassion was their nature  Mahaakarunaa great compassion rather than the elementary compassion which the novice on the path attempts to radiate and practiceFor these disciples all desire for selfpromotion and selfachievement had been replaced with outwardmoving energyTherefore any statement which describes the enlightened Buddhist disciple as distant from society would be false or more exactly would be using inappropriate categoriesThe strength of the concept of compassion within Buddhism is that it is both a powerful form of mental purification and a form of liberative actionThis paper began with questions raised by observers about the Buddhist notions of detachment and compassionThey center around two main points that the two concepts seem to represent contradictory forces the one moving away from society and the other towards it that the Buddhist concept of compassion is not active enough being more connected with personal spiritual growth than the altruistic reformation of societyPart of the problem is the linguistic framework and the modern connotations surrounding such concepts as detachment The question would not arise in the same form for those thinking exclusively in Paali and using the terms viraaga and karunaaIt would be evident to them that viraaga does not imply apathy and indifference but a freedom from passion and attachment that is necessary if actions are not to become biased or partialFor what passes as compassion can cloak emotions of a very different kind such as anger attachment or the wish to interfereWith reference to the second point a distinction in terms must be madeThere is a form of concern for self which is compatible with and even essential to altruismThe care for oneself which enables one to feel empathy with others can be termed autism Autism is necessary for altruism since it is necessary to be able to accept and even love oneself before one can show true empathy and compassion for others before one can feel what they feelAutism is not egoismEgoism is the enemy of both autism and altruismEgoism seeks to use others for the material welfare and gain of selfIts love is possessive and manipulativeEgoism has to be destroyed if karunaa is to developViraaga viveka karunaa and anukampaa are interrelated terms within BuddhismCompassion needs the clear insight that viragaa can bringThe challenge for Buddhists and nonBuddhists alike is to realize this in our livesAll societies need the active liberative compassion which seeks to relieve the suffering of others establish greater justice and assert the dignity and equality of human beingsKarunaa should certainly be seen in its concentrated meditative form as a powerful and peacegiving discipline of the mind and an important part of any spiritual pathBut it should never be confined to this frameworkIt breaks the framework as liberative action to relieve suffering and oppressionElizabeth JHarris studied Buddhism in Sri Lanka from to and obtained a PhDdegree from the Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies University of KelaniyaShe is now Secretary for Interfaith Relations in The Methodist Church in LondonHer previous BPS publications include Violence and Disruption in Society and Journey into BuddhismThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIt is sometimes said that Death today has replaced Sex as The Great Unmentionable and certainly it is for most people an uncomfortable subject which they do not care to think about overmuchYet if there is one thing that is certain in life it is that we shall all die sooner or laterThere was once a creed which declared Millions Now Living Will Never Die and it had great appeal  but all those who first heard it proclaimed are now deadSo we all have to face death whether we like it or notAnd we all know it however we may try to forget the factLet us then at least for a while stop trying to forget it and look death straight in the faceIt is of course perfectly true that we can be too preoccupied with deathThere are those who are eaten up with fear of death so that they hardly have any energy or zest for living and there are some for whom mortality and all its accompaniments and trappings have a peculiar fascinationFacing death realistically does not mean being obsessed by itHere as in other respects Buddhism teaches a Middle WayFor those who have an unhealthy preoccupation with the subject it can teach a saner and more balanced concern for those who seek at all costs to avoid thinking about it it can likewise show a reasonable approachFear of death is an unwholesome state of mind and for this as for other unwholesome states of mind Buddhism can show a remedyIn the West today there are many different attitudes to death and a large number of people are probably quite bewildered by it not knowing what to believeBut two main ones predominate the Traditional Christian view and the Modern Secular viewThe Traditional Christian view asserts the reality of an afterlife which the Modern Secular view denies or at the very least calls strongly into questionThis asserts that man has an immortal soul created by GodAfter death a man will in some shape or form receive the reward or punishment for his deeds on earthIn short the good will go to heaven and the wicked to hellHeaven and hell are everlastingOf course many Christians  even fairly traditional ones  are more or less uneasy about this especially about the eternity of hell but this doctrine is still taught by many Churches in some form with whatever loopholes or reservationsIt should also be noted that on this view only man has an immortal soul and that animals simply perish at deathA few Christians especially in England dislike this and hope to be reunited with their pets in another worldInquiry would probably show that this is a genuine stumblingblock for more people than might have been supposedAccording to this view which usually claims to be scientific man is just another animal and like the animals in the Christian view simply perishes totally at physical deathThis could actually be in part an unrecognized heritage from Christian thinkingThe Christian says Animals have no souls The Secularist caps this by saying Man is an animal therefore he has no soul Modern biology medical science psychology and so on tend markedly to take this view for grantedAs has been stated and will be shown the scientific basis for this attitude is at the very least highly questionableBut its exponents are often people enjoying considerable prestige and are widely listened to by those who do not feel able to form an independent opinion on this subjectThe Buddhist attitude to both of these types of view is that they are extremes neither of which is in fact trueThe first type of view is called in Buddhism the heresy of eternalism while the second is called the heresy of annihilationismThey both in fact miss the pointWhat actually happens according to Buddhism can only be clearly understood if we have some acquaintance with the Buddhist view of the general nature of manBut before considering this it may be as well to observe how the Buddhist view can be misinterpretedIf we say for instance that in the Buddhist view man is not distinguished from animals by the possession of an immortal soul then this looks very like the Modern Secular positionIf on the other hand it is pointed out that according to Buddhism we reap the rewards and penalties after death for our actions in this life then this looks rather like the Traditional Christian viewIf both propositions are stated to be correct the result looks like a contradiction though in fact it is notThese misapprehensions about Buddhism result from failure to realize the kind of optical illusion which occurs when a middle position is viewed from one of the extremesIf an island is exactly in the middle of a river then from either bank it looks closer to the opposite bank than to the observerOnly an observer on the island can see that it is equidistantViewed from the extreme left any middle position looks much further to the right than it is and vice versaThe same phenomenon is commonly observable in politics and other walks of lifeIn this case the true Buddhist view is that the impersonal stream of consciousness flows on  impelled by ignorance and craving  from life to lifeThough the process is impersonal the illusion of personality continues as it does in this lifeIn terms of Absolute Truth there is no immortal soul that manifests in a succession of bodies but in terms of the relative truth by which we are normally guided there is a being that is rebornIn order to gain Enlightenment it is necessary to come to a realization of the situation as it is according to absolute truth in order to face and begin to understand the problem of death we can in the first instance view it in terms of that relative truth which normally rules our lives and which has its validity in its own sphereWe need merely for the present to remind ourselves that this is but a provisional view of thingsIn this connection too we have to observe that we are dealing only with the question of death as it affects the ordinary person not one who has attained EnlightenmentWe may therefore say that Buddhism rejecting Annihilationism outright partly agrees with the Eternalists to the extent of accepting a form of Survival without for the moment considering the differences furtherIt makes a considerable difference to our outlook on life whether we believe in any form of survival or notThose who entirely reject the idea of survival inevitably concentrate all their ambitions and hopes for themselves and others on this single life on earthThis life they feel is all they have and for them the only reasonable goal can be the achievement of some kind of mundane satisfaction or contentment in this world  all else being meaninglessThe precise implications of such an attitude will depend greatly on a persons characterThe idealist may devote himself to all kinds of plans for bettering the human conditionIt is claimed and not without some justice that this view of things has led to a great many social improvementsNevertheless if we look at the whole picture it may be doubted whether all the social consequences of a purely thisworldly view have been beneficialAnd even the idealist must admit that his hopes are strictly limited not only for himself but for the race itself which will inevitably die out one day possibly hastened to its end by mans own wicked folly or even his incompetent attempts to control nature Furthermore those who are less idealistically inclined may tend to regard this onelifeonly theory as an excuse for enjoying themselves as selfishly as they like while they have the chance with no fear of any postmortem retributionIn addition there are very many people who are more or less tormented by the fear of utter extinction at deathTo point out that this is illogical is uselessFor many such fear of cancer or other fatal diseases or war and other disasters is not made any easier to bear because they see no future for themselves beyond the graveThose who preach the we have only one life gospel too enthusiastically may forget in their zeal for good causes the serious psychological harm such talk can doFear of death is not of course confined to those who do not believe in an afterlifeIt is in fact universalIn that sleep of death what dreams may come is a thought that has given pause to many besides Hamlet and in the past many have gone terrified of hellfire  and some still doProbably however most believers or wouldbe believers in survival today settle in fact for something vaguely comforting a trifle wishful and with few clearly envisaged detailsIt should be noted that lack of belief in survival is not entirely incompatible with a religious attitude though probably most sincere believers in all religions have some such faith however vagueThe Jewish religion for instance has little to say on an afterlife and probably many orthodox Jews have little or no faith in oneThis is partly due to the reticence of most of the Hebrew Bible on the subject and in this connection the wellknown concern of Jews with their race and its continuance is significant  as in the case of the secularists noted aboveThe relation of course is an inverse one the Jew concerned with racial survival thinks little about personal survivalThe secularist rejecting personal survival pins his hopes on that of the raceThe concern of many Christian churchmen with social problems today often goes together with a marked reticence on the subject of survival and occasionally even with a degree of open skepticismIn some cases this looks like a scarcelyveiled capitulation to the dominant materialistic outlook of the present ageOf course there are many who believe  rightly or wrongly  that they can get in touch with the departedMediums who claim to be able to do this are numerous and while some are fraudulent and some others are selfdeluded it would be unwise in the extreme to suppose that this is always the caseGenuine clairvoyants spiritual healers and other such specially gifted people unquestionably exist as anyone who is prepared to undertake an impartial investigation can readily discoverBut in the public mind such people tend still to be dismissed en masse as fraudulent or at best crankyThose who consult them often do so surreptitiously guarding the fact from their friends as a guilty secret they would be ashamed to divulgeWhile excessive concern with such matters is not necessarily a good thing the loudly voiced scornful skepticism of many materialisticminded people is simply an inadequate response to something of which they are woefully  sometimes even culpably  ignorantSince in fact a fear of death is deeprooted in everybody the propagation of an attitude of total skepticism can do much harmEven a great psychologist like the late DrErnest Jones the biographer of Freud considered it necessary to declare that it was important to eliminate from ones mind all belief in an afterlifeNow if in fact it could somehow be finally proved that there is no such thing and if further it were possible through psychoanalysis or some such methods to get rid of all fear of extinction this might be a good thingBut since these premises cannot be substantiated the claim falls to the groundThe fact is that orthodox psychoanalysis was able to find out a great deal about the problem of sex with which it was largely able to copeBut it had not and has not the equipment to adequately deal with the problem of deathWhat DrJones failed to see is that the only result of such an attempt can be repressionRepression may be briefly defined as the active process of keeping out and ejecting banishing from consciousness the ideas and impulses that are unacceptable to it We can call it successful selfdeceptionIts deleterious effects on the psyche are wellknown thanks above all to the work of Sigmund Freud and his followersIn this case it means that we deceive ourselves into believing that we are not afraid of death  and in fact very many people do thisBuddhism is actually an even better and more radical method of dealing with ones repressions than psychoanalysis and it is often a hard task to convince people that they have in fact not transcended but merely repressed their fear of deathThe reader is earnestly advised at this point to consider seriously the possibility that he or she has done just this bearing in mind that in the nature of things an immediate negative reaction proves nothingIf in fact there is any instinctive tendency to shy away from the whole subject the answer is actually obvious though it may be hard to acceptThis is due not only to the fear itself but to conceit  the belief that one is advancedThe consequences of a definite denial of the possibility of survival are the persistence of the fear of death in either an overt or repressed formEither way there is a distortion of the psyche with resultant suffering whatever the exact form it may takeSince such an attitude of denial is very widespread in many parts of the world today these deleterious effects on a very wide scale are quite inevitableIn passing in may be presumed that if in fact there were no survival we would not have this builtin fear of deathIn present circumstances the man who thinks or wants to think otherwise is in something of a dilemmaAssuming that he is not a psychic or drawn to spiritualism or the like nor on the other hand an orthodox believer in one of the traditional faiths he is probably plagued by doubts and has at best only a hazy notion of what it is he believes He may indulge in many fanciful speculationsIt is not at all clear to him on what basis he can judge of the possibly validity of these ideasUnder the impact of his surroundings his belief vague though it may be but perhaps based on some genuine intuition is liable to be weak and fail him in times of crisisIn such a case a resolute dismissal of all such ideas as wishful thinking may for the time being even bring a sense of reliefAll this must be admitted and it is presumably for just such reasons that thinkers like DrJones advocate the course they doIn fact of course it does not solve the real problemThe social and personal drawbacks of the Jonesian solution do not end thereThis negative attitude is the outcome of a materialistic view of the world which  though it is still held by many scientists  is in fact outmodedBeing in essence materialistic it tends also to reduce our respect for human lifeThe traditional Christian view that animals have no souls is in fact semimaterialistic in this senseThose who think that man is a special case tend all too easily to take the view that animals are totally subservient to him and can be treated as of no account  hence factoryfarming and many other such horrorsThe true materialist goes a step further and regards man himself as an animal in this senseThe extreme consequences of a radical application of this idea can be witnessed in many places at this day and are often utterly appallingBut even when tempered with liberal humanism they can be pretty badPower over life and death is given to the medical profession and others to a degree which is sometimes quite irresponsibleTransplant surgery to take an example is based on a view of death which is entirely unethical by traditional standards apart altogether from any religious considerations and similar objections apply to demands for virtually indiscriminate abortionWhat then should be a truly Buddhist attitude towards deathLet us first note that in traditional Christianity as for instance in the Roman Catholic Church great attention is paid to the dyingSpecial rites are performed and every effort is made to help the dying person to pass on in what is considered to be a right frame of mindTo those with no belief in a hereafter all such things are meaninglessTo Buddhists and other nonCatholic survivalists they may be open to certain criticisms but the principle is wholly admirableIn Tibetan Buddhism especially there are observances of a very similar nature while in Theravada countries it is part of the duties of a vipassanaa bhikkhu to assist the dyingOf course the frame of mind in which a Buddhist should die is not quite the same as that expected of an adherent of a theistic religionBut at least it is better to try to give the dying such understanding as one can than to drug them into unconsciousness as an almost routine measureThat way they will pass on to another existence in much the same state of blindness and confusion with which they have gone through this lifeLet us note once again that such considerations can only be rejected as quite valueless if we are perfectly certain that there is no form of afterlife  and even on that basis it might be very cruel to deprive many of the dying people of such comfortTherefore the suggestion made in the humanist circles that hospital chaplains should be abolished can only be characterized as downright wickedSome such chaplains may be pretty useless but the majority can give the sick and dying at least some comfortIdeally of course they should all be highlytrained bhikkhusHowever when one is actually dying it is a bit late to begin thinking seriously about deathWe should familiarize ourselves with the thought long before we hope it will happenAnd besides even for the young and strong it can still come with unexpected suddennessMors certa  hora incerta Death is certain  the hour is uncertain To bear this in mind is for the Buddhist an important aspect of Right UnderstandingAnd therefore the Buddhist practice of Meditation on Death  not very popular in the West  should be encouragedDeath for the Buddhist is not indeed the absolute end  but it does mean the breaking of all ties that bind us to our present existence and therefore the more detached we are from this world and its enticements the more ready we shall be to die and incidentally the further we shall get along the path that leads to the Deathless  for this is one of the names of Nibbaana amatam the Deathless State Meanwhile for those who have not got so far along the Path death is inseverable from birthExistence in the phenomenal world is continual birthanddeathThe one cannot be understood without the other and cannot exist without the otherWe all fear death but actually we should also fear the rebirth that followsIn practice this does not always happenFear of rebirth is less strong than deathThis is part of our usual shortsighted view and the fact must be facedFull Enlightenment will only be achieved when there is the will to transcend all forms of rebirth  even the pleasantestThough as a first step then acceptance of the fact of rebirth may help to overcome the fear of death the attachment to rebirth itself must then also be gradually overcomeThough there is a strong fear of death there is strangely enough also a desire for itPsychoanalysis has a good deal to say about this though it is perhaps not very illuminatingBut the fact remains that many people show suicidal tendencies or even actually commit suicide whatever be the explanationThe Buddha in fact included this deathwish as the third of three kinds of craving besides desire for sensepleasures we find in the formula of the Second Noble Truth the desire for becoming and the desire for cessationSince life is by its very nature frustrating we can never get it on our own terms and therefore there is an urge to be quit of the whole thingThe fallacy of course lies in the fact that one cannot just step out so easily since death by suicide like any other death is followed immediately by rebirth in some plane or other  quite possibly worse than that which one had leftThe traditional Christian view indeed is that suicide is a mortal sin  with the implication that it would be a case of out of the fryingpan and into the fire Some psychoanalysts speak  ignorantly  of the Nirvanaprinciple in connection with the deathwishBut what we are here dealing with is not in fact the urge to true liberation but merely an escapereactionOnly if by insight more profound than that of the Freudians this revulsion is followed by complete equanimity can it be turned towards the Supramundane which alone is the goal of BuddhismThis will not happen spontaneouslyIt should be noted that the deathwish here referred to is associated in Buddhism with the heresy of annihilationism already mentionedIn a somewhat aggressive form it can even serve to mask repressed deathfearThis would seem to explain the vehemence with which people like DrErnest Jones assert the desirability of their antisurvivalist viewsBy way of curiosity it may be mentioned that a distinguished biologist has gone on record as declaring that whether or not we believe in survival is entirely determined by our genesThis would seem to be pushing determinism pretty farIt is of course easy to suggest that those who believe in some form of survival are victims of wishful thinking fantasy and the likeAnd in many cases there is a good deal of truth in the allegationBut what is less often realized is the fact that the opposite situation also existsAs has been indicated quite a number of cases can be found of a curiously fanatical and intolerant belief in death as the end That this attitude masks a repressed deathfear has been suggested aboveIt also betrays a measure of conceit by adopting it one appears scientific realistic tough and so onIt may even to some extent be an assertion of ones masculinityThe fact that more women than men are churchgoers may be partly due to the fact that women in general feel less urge than men to put on this particular actApart from these factors this attitude also curiously enough gives a certain sense of security One has made up ones mind on that particular question and can now dismiss it and turn to other thingsThis enables the scientist  and the politician  to make realistic decisions without reference to traditional objectionsAlso by excluding one whole branch of phenomena from the need for investigation it helps to make our scientific knowledge more neat and tidy Unfortunately for this type of view however there is a whole field of knowledge which runs directly counter to any smug mechanisticmaterialistic view of the worldA wide variety of paranormal phenomena  some with direct relevance to the question of survival  are so well attested that to brush them aside is a trifle difficultSome scientists contrive to ignore the whole lot and just go on behaving as if there were nothing there A few  but a growing minority  investigate and as a result are convinced that there is at least something there however you may explain itOthers can do neither of these things that is they can neither ignore the whole lot nor investigate with genuine objectivityThey therefore set themselves up as debunkers They set out to expose or disprove whatever they disapprove ofThe assumption is in effect that since admittedly and obviously there are some fraudulent mediums and so on therefore all such people are fraudulent or at any rate deludedQuite a number of books and articles have appeared in recent years assiduously debunking various classical cases of paranormal phenomenaBut genuinely impartial investigation frequently shows that whatever may have the been the weaknesses in the reporting of these cases the debunkers have in fact gone widely beyond all reasonable criticism and have sometimes themselves been  unconsciously no doubt  quite unscrupulousThe wellknown case of Bridey Murphey a few years ago illustrates thisSome very confident debunking of this story turned out on further investigation to be quite wide of the markOne book on hypnotism too pours scorn on attempts to recall past lives by this methodThe author calls these a hunk of junk and clearly implies deliberate fraudulent suggestion by the hypnotist  a suggestion which is not only ridiculous but libelousAnd the present writer once a heard a very intelligent lady psychologist say Id rather believe anything than accept precognition it would upset my entire scientific conception of the universe Perhaps one can even sympathize a little with this lady nevertheless since precognition however mysterious is a wellattested fact it is up to her to revise her conception of the universeShe did however neatly phrase the dilemma in which a lot of scientifically trained people find themselves todayIn view of all this it is important to be aware of the psychological motives which may underlie different attitudes to this whole problem  not only in others but in oneselfWhile excessive credulity and uncritical dabbling in the occult is to be deplored the opposite extreme of total rejection should also be treated with more suspicion and reserve than it often getsWhile Buddhism certainly does not encourage too much preoccupation with these matters it does not of course deny the existence of various classes of discarnate beingsThey dwell in various realms and on various planes some higher and happier than this world others such as the socalled hungry ghosts more miserableThey are relatively real  ie no less real than we ourselves in this worldThey all without exception belong to the realm of samsaara or birthanddeath and their stay in any of the realms they inhabit is therefore temporary though in some cases it may be fantastically longlasting by human standardsThere is no contradiction here with the idea of rebirth on earth since the realm one is born in depends on ones kamma the human condition being only one of the various possibilitiesTherefore human rebirth is considered to be as desirable as it is rare  a precious opportunity which it is a folly to wasteIt is also stated in the scriptures that man has a mindmade body complete in all its parts which would seem to correspond to the astral or etheric body referred to by occultistsResponsible occultists  of whom there are many  are themselves of course thoroughly well aware of the dangers of incautious involvement with these matters which they often stressThe inhabitants of the various realms are not enlightened beings and while some are undoubtedly much wiser and more advanced than the average human others are not and can even exert a definitely malevolent powerIt is not in the province of Buddhist monks to practice any of the occult arts  it is in fact forbidden them in terms  although it is not infrequently done in the EastWestern Buddhists should actually also not concern themselves with such mattersIf they nevertheless do so they should at least be extremely careful to consult only responsible and conscientious practitioners with a high moral standardSuch people are not hard to find and are often very fine charactersBut it should always be borne in mind that even quite genuine messages from the departed can be misleading since they are still in varying degrees ignorantFor this reason too the wellknown triviality of so many spirit messages proves nothing about their genuinenessThe beings of higher worlds are known in Buddhism as devas and it seems certain that many of them are truly concerned to help mankind as far as lies in their powerIt might even be suggested that there is perhaps no essential difference between the higher devas and the bodhisattvas of the Mahaayaana traditionSome people are naturally psychic and some even develop psychic powers as a result or byproduct of meditationSuch powers are perfectly real but should not be sought after or clung to if attainedIf they are gained without sufficient insight or moral purification they can be disastrousIt is another of the many illusions of the modern liberal humanist that such things as witchcraft do not existRighteous indignation at the cruel treatment of real or alleged witches in the past should not lead us to imagine that the whole thing was completely mythicalSo we should be very wary of seeking contact with the psychic planes not because they do not exist but because they doWe now come to the Buddhist definition of deathAccording to the VenNyanatiloka it is ordinarily called the disappearance of the vital faculty confined to a single lifetime and therewith of the psychophysical lifeprocess conventionally called Man Animal Personality Ego etcStrictly speaking however death is the continually repeated dissolution and vanishing of each momentary physicalmental combination and thus it takes place every momentThis definition is very importantEach moment I die and I am reborn in other words a new I takes over from the old which has vanished foreverAt the end of my physical life there is at the same time a severing of the link between this mental process and the body which quickly decays in consequenceBut rebirth in exactly the same way is instantaneous in some sphere whether as conception in a fresh womb or elsewhereDeath then except in the case of the arahant is in the Buddhist view inseparable from rebirthBut two kinds of rebirth are distinguished rebirth from life to life and rebirth from moment to moment as indicated in the above definitionSome people today maintain that the Buddha taught only the latterThis is nonsenseThere are many hundreds of references to rebirth throughout the Buddhist scriptures of all schools and they cannot be simply explained away as either symbolic or as concessions to popular beliefsNor is there any need for such explanations since there is plenty of convincing evidence for the reality of the processThough rebirth from moment to moment is very important to understand and should not be overlooked what we are really concerned with here is rebirth from life to life In this connection two general somewhat minor points should be madeThe term birth here is not confined to extrusion from a womb it includes other processes such as the spontaneous appearance of beings in certain statesBirth of the human type is thus simply a particular caseThere is also the question of intermediate states between birthsSome Buddhists and others speak of such statesThis is really just a question of semantics in the Theravada view at least any such socalled intermediate state between existences of a certain type is itself a rebirthThe reason why rebirth of whatever kind takes place is because of the unexpended force of tanhaa or craving conditioned by ignoranceThis force of ignorance and craving is comparable to a powerful electric currentTo suppose that it just ceases at physical death is actually quite unreasonable and contradicts the law of conservation of energyAs to the question of the identity of the being that is reborn with the one that died the best answer is that given by the Venerable Naagasena to King Milinda It is neither the same nor differentThe whole process is really quite impersonal but seemingly a being exists and is rebornWe can thus make a clear distinction between the terms Reincarnation and RebirthReincarnation is the term used by those who hold that a real entity exists and passes on from life to life occupying successive bodiesLiterally this should only apply to manifestation in fleshy bodies though it is commonly applied to discarnate states as wellRebirth denotes the Buddhist view that while this is indeed what seems to happen the true process is entirely impersonalWhat therefore in terms of relative truth appears as Reincarnation is in terms of absolute truth RebirthThe formulation of Dependent Origination describes the process as follows ignorance conditions sankhaaras the sankhaaras condition consciousness consciousness conditions mindandbody and so onThis means that the pattern or shape of a persons character is based on ignorance this pattern is impressed like a seal on wax on the new consciousness arising in the womb on which the development of a new being dependsThe Western assumption that character and mental traits are genetically inherited is not accepted in Buddhism true there may be some genetic element apart from the purely physical side but essential inheritance here is karmicThe apparent inheritance of mental traits can be explained in many other waysIn part it is mere assumptionIf a child turns out to be musical people will recall that his uncle George used to play the clarinet a fact which would have been forgotten had the child been tonedeafParental and other environmental influences can undoubtedly account for much especially when we allow for unconscious influenceSir Alister Hardy has even suggested that genes may be capable of being influenced telepathicallyFurther the choice of ones parents is bound to be influenced by some affinity and even by karmic links from the pastBy the same token suggestions that it would be possible to breed a race of clones with identical reactions belongs no doubt very fortunately strictly to realm of science fictionSuch people even if bred would not be karmically identical any more than identical twins areLife is not as mechanical as all thatFor one who has attained full Enlightenment in this life the death of the body brings with it the end of all individual existence this at least is the Theravada teachingThis is called anupaadisesanibbaana Nibbaana without the groups remaining While the final attainment of Nibbaana should not be understood as mere annihilation in the materialistic sense nothing positive can be predicated of itIt is not the extinction of self for that self never was real in the first place nor is it entering into Nibbaana for there is no being who entersIt is the final cessation however of the five aggregates which were the product of greed hatred and delusionWe may think of it as a state of utter peace and perhaps we can leave it at thatIt is the Deathless StateIn his elaborate survey of Buddhist meditation methods the VenDrVajiranaana says this of the meditation on mindfulness of death It virtually belongs to the Vipassanaa meditation for the disciple should develop it while holding the perception of anicca dukkha and anattaaWhen the VenSomdet Phra Vanarata the then VicePatriarch of Thailand visited Wat Dhammapadiipa Hampstead London on rd October he spoke on the subject of deathHe said that we are fortunate to be born in the human condition in full possession of all our faculties as this gives us the possibility of hearing the Dhamma and practicing itThis is an advantage we should not neglect because birth in the human state is a rare thingIf people are born blind or deaf or without other faculties this is the result of kammaThey may have to wait for another opportunityWe should always remember the inevitability of deathThe awareness of this should make us cease from clinging too much to worldly thingsIf we constantly keep the thought of death before our minds this will be an instigation to work hard on ourselves and make good progressThe standard Meditation on Death is given by Buddhaghosa in Chapter VIII of the VisuddhimaggaIt may be summarized as follows Buddhaghosa begins by stating the kinds of death he is not considering the final passing of the Arahant momentary death or metaphorical uses of the term death He refers to timely death which comes with exhaustion of merit or the lifespan or both and to untimely death produced by kamma that interrupts other kammaOne should go into solitary retreat and exercise attention wisely thus Death will take place the life faculty will be interrupted or Death death Unwise attention may arise in the form of sorrow joy indifference or fearThere should always be mindfulness a sense of urgency and knowledgeThen accessconcentration may be gained  and this is the basis for the arising of InsightBut says Buddhaghosa one who finds that it does not get so far should do his recollecting of death in eight ways that is to say as having the appearance of a murderer as the ruin of success by comparison as to sharing the body with many as to the frailty of life as signless as to the limitedness of the extent as to the shortness of the moment Some of these terms are not quite selfexplanatory thus means by comparing oneself with others  even the great and famous even Buddhas have to die means that the body is inhabited by all sorts of strange beings the eighty families of worms They live in dependence on and feed on the outer skin the inner skin the flesh the sinews the bones the marrow and there they are born grow old and die evacuate and make water and the body is their maternity home their hospital their charnel ground their privy and their urinal means that death is unpredictable refers to the shortness of the human lifespanBuddhaghosa concludes A bhikkhu devoted to mindfulness of death is constantly diligentHe acquires perception of disenchantment with all kinds of becomingHe conquers attachment to lifeHe condemns evilHe avoids much storingHe has not stain of avarice about requisitesPerception of impermanence grows in him following upon which there appear the perceptions of pain and notselfBut while beings who have not developed mindfulness of death fall victims to fear horror and confusion at the time of death as though suddenly seized by wild beasts spirits snakes robbers or murderers he dies undeluded and fearless without falling into any such stateAnd if he does not attain the deathless here and now he is at least headed for a happy destiny on the break up of the bodyThere are still those who suppose that it is somehow unscientific to believe in any form of survivalThere is actually no justification for this view and certainly today not all scientists would endorse itAs has been pointed out earlier there are psychological reasons why some scientists almost willfully shut their eyes to all evidence for the paranormal this enables them to continue operating on the assumption that all manifestations of mind are simply byproducts of the body determined by it and perishing with itIn this way mental activities are reduced to mere functions of the brain and so onIn fact however it should be stressed that the brain does not thinkThe human brain is a very remarkable organ which has still been only very superficially explored owing to obvious practical difficulties in addition to its own quite extraordinary complexityBut quite certainly not all mental activities can be related to itThe various forms of ESP phenomena are facts and nothing in the physical brain has been found to account for them even by officially materialist Sovietbloc scientists who have a vested interest in establishing such a connectionTelepathy for instance is not a form of mental radio as the late GNMTyrrell who was both a distinguished psychic researcher and a radio expert long ago pointed out it does not obey the law governing all forms of physical radiation the inverse square law connecting intensity with distanceNow while the existence of telepathy does not in itself prove survival or rebirth  indeed it is often rather freely invoked to explain evidence pointing to survival  it does prove that something mental can jump through space with no physical linkAnd this is of the very essence of rebirth in the Buddhist viewAnd since telepathy is certainly a fact and widely accepted as such all arguments against the possibility of rebirth fall to the ground on this point aloneThe shrinking band of hardened skeptics who still doubt the fact of telepathy have quite clearly not faced up to the overwhelming evidence for it indeed they have not even observed it in themselves though it probably occurs to some extent with everybody even if unrecognized as suchThere is of course a wealth of positive evidence for survival in general and for rebirth in particularThe material collected by the Society for Physical Research over nearly a century is highly impressive and every single item in these records has been subjected before acceptance to the most stringent tests  far more stringent in fact than for many modern scientific discoveries On rebirth in

message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseOne day not too long ago I picked up on my shortwave radio an interview with an American futurist whose name I didnt catchA futurist as the word implies is one whose job it is to predict the futureBy collating a vast amount of information about developments presently taking place in various fields he discovers the most prominent trends at work beneath the surface of events and by projecting from these trends he constructs a picture of the future over increasingly longer time frames  over the coming decade century and millenniumNaturally as temporal distance from the present increases the picture he paints becomes proportionally more liable to error but though an element of conjecture is unavoidable in all longrange forecasts what the futurist holds is that his projections are based squarely on the trajectory we are traveling along todayThe questions the interviewer posed drew out from the futurist an astonishing picture of things to comeIn his cheery view the great perennial springs of human suffering are about to yield to the insistent pressure of our ingenuity and determination to create a better worldThe next century will usher in an era of unprecedented progress prosperity and justice with radical changes taking place even on the most primordial frontiers of biologyCouples who want children will no longer be dependent on natural processes vulnerable to chance and tragedy they will be able to specify the precise features they would like their children to have and theyll get exactly what they wantMedical science will find cures for cancer AIDS and other dreaded illnesses while virtually every vital organ will be replaceable by a synthetic counterpartBiologists will discover how to halt the process of aging enabling us to preserve our youthfulness and vitality well into our twilight yearsBy the end of the next century our life span itself will be extended to yearsAnd before the next millennium draws to a close science will have found the key to immortality Thats a hundred percent certain he assured usWhile I listened to this intelligent articulate man ramble on with such optimistic verve I felt a sense of uneasiness gnawing away in my gutWhats wrong with this picture I kept on asking myself Whats missingWhats so troubling Here he was depicting a world in which humanity would triumph over every ancient nemesis perhaps even over death itself and yet I felt that I just couldnt buy it that I would prefer this wretched fragile vulnerable existence nature has conferred on us by birthWhyFor one thing it seemed to me that his glowing picture of the future depended on some pretty big assumptions  assumptions which could only work by conveniently turning a blind eye to other present trends which are very far from comfortingHe was presupposing that advances in technology will bring only benefits without entailing new problems just as formidable as those that taunt us today that by sheer cleverness we will be able to rectify old blunders without having to curb the greed that caused those blunders in the first place that people will spontaneously place the common good above the promptings of naked avarice that the spread of material affluence will suffice to eliminate the suspicion hatred and cruelty that have bred so much misery throughout historyBut as I continue to reflect I realized that this was not all that was troubling me about the futurists picture I felt there was something still deeper scratching at the back of my mindAt its root I came to see my disquietude revolved around the issue of orientationThe picture he presented showed a future in which human beings are completely immersed in temporal concerns absorbed in the battle against natural limitations oriented entirely to the conditioned worldWhat was conspicuously absent from his picture was what might be called the dimension of transcendence There was no hint that human existence is not a selfenclosed circle from which it gains its meaning that the quest for true fulfillment requires reference to a domain beyond everything finite and temporalBy deleting all mention of a dimension of transcendence the futurist could portray a humanity pledged to the idea that the ultimate good is to be realized by gaining mastery over the external world rather than mastery over ourselvesGiven that life involves suffering and that suffering arises from the clash between our desires and the nature of the world we can deal with suffering either by changing the world so that it conforms to our desires or by changing ourselves so that our desires harmonize with the worldThe picture drawn by the futurist showed a future in which the first alternative prevailed but the Buddha and all humanitys other great spiritual teachers as well unanimously recommend the second routeFor them our task is not so much to manipulate the outer conditions responsible for our discontent as it is to overcome the subjective roots of discontent to vanquish our own selfishness craving and ignoranceIn preferring the more ancient approach I dont mean to suggest that we must passively submit to all the frailties to which human life is proneStoic resignation is certainly not the answerWe must strive to eliminate debilitating diseases to promote economic and social justice to fashion a world in which the basic amenities of health and happiness are as widely distributed as possibleBut when the driving engine of civilization becomes sheer innovation in techniques we risk venturing into dangerous areasTo struggle with Promethean audacity to bend nature to our will so that all the objective causes of our suffering will be obliterated seems an exercise in hubris  in arrogance and presumption  and as we know from Greek tragedy hubris inevitably provokes the wrath of the godsEven if our reckless tinkering with the natural order does not unleash a cosmic cataclysm we still risk a gradual descent into the trivialization and mechanization of human lifeFor by making technological ingenuity the criterion of progress we lose sight of the moral depth and elevation of character which have always been the classical hallmarks of human greatnessWe flatten out the vertical dimensions of our being reducing ourselves to a purely horizontal plane in which all that matters is technical expertise and organizational efficiencyThereby we veer closer to the situation described by TSEliot The world ends not with a bang but a whimperWhile I reflected on the futurists predictions there came to mind a series of verses from the Dhammapada which offer a strikingly different picture of the challenge facing us in our livesThe verses occur in the Chapter of the Thousands vvThe first four stanzas tell us that it is not how long we live that really counts but how we live the qualities we embody in our innermost being Better than to live a hundred years immoral and unconcentrated is it to live a single day virtuous and meditativeBetter than to live a hundred years foolish and unconcentrated is it to live a single day wise and meditativeBetter than to live a hundred years lazy and dissipated is it to live a single day with energy firmly arousedBetter than to live a hundred years without seeing the rise and fall of things is it to live a single day seeing the rise and fall of thingsIn these verses the Buddha tells us that our primary task the task to which all others should be subordinate is to master ourselvesThe challenge he throws at us is not to remove all the thorns strewn over the earth but to put on sandals to vanquish the desires responsible for our suffering in the very place where they arise in our own mindsAs long as our lives are ruled by desire there will never be an end to discontent for the elimination of one obstacle will only give rise to a new one in a selfreplicating cycleWhat is essential is not to prolong life by readjusting biological processes so that they fulfill our wildest dreams but to ennoble life by sober mental training within the humble limits of our natural conditionAnd this is achieved as the Buddha repeatedly stresses by the triple discipline of moral restraint meditation and deep insight into the impermanence of all conditioned thingsThe last two verses in this series introduce the end toward which this training points which is also the goal toward which our lives should be steered Better than to live a hundred years without seeing the Deathless is it to live a single day seeing the DeathlessBetter than to live a hundred years without seeing the Supreme Truth is it to live a single day seeing the Supreme Truth If human progress is not to be reduced to a mere pageant of technological stunts aimed at pushing back our natural limits we require some polestar toward which to steer our lives something which enables us to transcend the boundaries of both life and deathFor Buddhism that is Nibbana the Deathless the Supreme Truth the state beyond all limiting conditionsWithout this transcendent element we might explore the distant galaxies and play cards with the genetic code but our lives will remain vain and hollowFullness of meaning can come only from the source of meaning from that which is transcendent and unconditionedTo strive for this goal is to find a depth of value and a peak of excellence that can never be equaled by brazen technological audacityTo realize this goal is to reach the end of suffering to find deathlessness here and now even in the midst of this imperfect world still subject as always to old age illness and deathThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe discourse of the Buddha on the Snake Simile that is presented here together with explanatory notes taken mostly from the commentarial literature is the nd text in the Collection of Discourses of Medium LengthIt is a text rich of contents and graced by many similesAt the very beginning there is a sequence of ten pithy similes on the perils of sense desires then follows the simile on correctly or wrongly getting hold of a snake further and still better known the parable of the raft and finally the simile of the vegetation of the Jeta GroveThe evocative power of these similes will strengthen the impact of the suttas message in him who ponders on them deeply and repeatedlyThe main concern of this discourse is to warn against misconceptions misrepresentations and dilution of the TeachingWhile the Buddha repeatedly stressed that his Teaching should be accepted only after due investigation and uninfluenced by tradition or external authority while he also advised his monks to make light of praise and blame of the Teaching uttered by outsiders the Master was quite firm and even stern when misrepresentations of the Teaching occurred on the part of his monks  that is by those who had accepted the Teaching and had chosen a life devoted to its realizationOur discourse is not the only one where the Buddha had voiced a stern rebuke of monks who misinterpreted essential parts of the TeachingWhat moved the Buddha to do so was his deep concern that the efficacy of his unique Path of Deliverance should not be impaired his Teaching not be undermined from within and the purity of conduct and wisdom not be tarnishedIf that were to be the raft of the Teaching of which the discourse speaks would be rendered incapable of carrying those across who have placed their confidence in itThe raft would forever be chained to the Hither Shore by those very fetters from which it is intended to bring releaseOur discourse deals with two chief obstacles which will impede the rafts progress the affirmation of sensegratification and the affirmation of egobeliefIf by misrepresenting the Teaching these are admitted entrance in it in whatever guise and whatever degree of dilution they will necessarily nullify the effort for final liberationIt should be noted that it is the affirmation the approval of those two tendencies that constitutes misrepresentation of the TeachingThese two tendencies themselves  ie sensuality and egobelief  are deeply ingrained in human nature as we find itThey are in fact the two taproots from which existence and with it suffering spring craving and ignoranceTo weaken them first and finally eradicate them is the difficult task before us which however we can face courageously if guided by the methods of the Dhamma which are realistic as well as radicalBut if what ought to be overcome is actually affirmed and approved if hidden or open reservations with regard to either of these two tendencies are maintained there is obviously no chance for achieving minds final deliverance from that bondage to craving and ignoranceThe attitude towards dispassion and towards the doctrine of egolessness is in fact a crucial test how far the core of the Teaching has been preserved or impaired or entirely abandoned in those presentations of the Dhamma that appeared after the Master passed away and some of these developments obviously do not stand the testConsidering all this we shall understand and appreciate the grave warning and the firm repudiation expressed in our discourse by the Master wishing for the welfare and progress of those who had confidence in his guidanceThe first section of the discourse deals with the rejection of the views held by the monk AritthaHis views are not merely a misconception of the Teaching but a direct challenge of some of the Buddhas statementsArittha expressly denies that what the Buddha taught as obstructive is an obstruction by necessityHe does not specify the obstructions he means but from the monks reply referring to sensedesires it is evident that they were well aware of Aritthas intention the condoning of sex indulgence for a monkIt need hardly be stressed that the Buddhas firm rejection of such condonation was meant for monks onlyOf his lay followers he did not expect sexual abstinenceTo them he advised restraint and mindfulness and avoidance of giving excessive nourishment to sex desireHere if anywhere a middle path between unrestrained indulgence and enforced repression was aptBut the Buddha made it clear that full deliverance required full detachment from desireThe gradual progress towards it however was left to the degree of insight and selfcontrol possessed and developed by the individual lay followerFor the monk however it was expected that the ardor of his quest for the final goal the serenity of mind and emotional satisfaction derived from meditation and his relative freedom from external sense titillation  that all these and other factors should enable him to keep the sex urge well in check and his mind tranquil enough for allowing further progress on the road to radical detachmentHe who could not attain to that degree of selfmastery was free to leave the Order and no stigma was attached and he was also free to return whenever he wantedBut inside the Sangha no compromise could be admitted unless the Buddha was to invite disintegration from within and disrepute from withoutThe instance of Aritthas wrong view is now used by the Buddha as an opportunity to warn against any other wrong approach to the Teaching and the misuse of itHe gives here the simile of the wrong grasp of a snake to illustrate the harm and the danger of misconceiving the DhammaThe harm done is to the individuals character and his progress on the Path and the danger is the likelihood of his falling into lower forms of existence or at the least a rebirth unfavorable to the understanding and practicing of the DhammaThat such results may follow can be easily understood in the case of Aritthas views which are an outright reversal and corruption of the TeachingIt may however at first sight be surprising to the reader that in the section now under consideration the misuse of the Teaching for the verbal wrangles of disputation is likewise regarded as a dangerously wrong grasp of the DhammaHere the danger and harm have more subtle but no less real rootsThe danger in contentiousness is chiefly twofoldIt provides one of the many evasions by which the mind shirks from devoting itself earnestly to the actual practice of the DhammaSecondly under the respectable guise of the advocacy of the Dhamma the attachment to I and Mine finds an easy outletIn disputations the ego gets the chance to indulge in selfassertion superiority feeling selfrighteousness and opinionatednessFurthermore the ego may attach itself to the Dhamma in an attitude of possessiveness which sometimes may even resemble the behavior of a dog jealously and angrily defending a morsel of food without having himself the inclination to eat itWe see here the danger that an excessive concern with an argumentative advocacy of the Dhamma may strengthen subconsciously the deeply engrained egotistic impulsesIt may even become one of the grounds for false views as describe by the BuddhaFinally from indulging in wordy warfare will also spring feelings of partisanship intolerance fanaticism and hostilityTruly we have here a formidable catalogue of detrimental qualities of mind and from this we can now better understand why the Buddha applied here too the metaphor of the dangerously wrong way of grasping a snakeHe who is so much preoccupied with doctrinal controversy furnishes indeed a fitting illustration of one who carries the raft of the Dhamma on his head or shoulders and in his case this will be not after the crossing but before he has done or even seriously tried the fording of the streamIn fact this famous parable of the raft will in most cases apply to those who in the words of the Dhammapada run up and down the rivers bank on this side of the stream without daring or wishing to crossWe find them using the raft for a variety of purposes they will adorn it and adore it discuss it compare it  indeed anything else than use itThere are on the other hand those who wrongly believe that this parable justifies them in jettisoning the raft before they have used it and that it invites them to let go the good teachings along with the false ones even before they have benefited by the former and fully discarded the latterAs we see there are indeed many more ways of grasping wrongly than of grasping rightly hence the strong emphasis laid on examining wisely the true meaning and purpose of the DhammaAnd there should be frequent reexamination  lest we forgetThis section on the grounds for false views connects with the mention of false teachings in the preceding paragraphHere and in almost all the following sections up to  it is the gravest of all wrong views  the belief in a Self in an abiding egoentity  that is dealt with from different anglesOur discourse is one of the most important texts concerned with the Anattaadoctrine the teaching on NotselfThis teaching is the core of the Buddhist doctrine and a singular feature of itIt is of a truly revolutionary nature and hence it is not easily absorbed by the human mind which since an unfathomable past has been habituated to think and to induce action in terms of I and Mine But this bias towards egocentricity has to be broken on the intellectual emotional and ethical level if deliverance from suffering is ever to be wonIn this task the repeated and careful contemplation of our discourse can become a valuable aidIn  the Buddha speaks of the sources from which the notion of a self is derived and formedIt is in the first instance the identification with any or all of the five aggregates constituting what is conventionally called the personalityIdentification with the body is the ground or standpoint for materialismFeeling is seen as the core of Being in the hedonists attitude to life or when in mystical teachings the soul is regarded as pure Divine Bliss or Divine LoveThe self is identified with perception when being is equated with perceiving when the personality is regarded as nothing but a bundle of sensationsThe mental formations contribute to egobelief when eg the will is regarded as the ultimate essence of self and world or when any other function of the mind receives an excessive emotional or intellectual emphasisThe aggregate of consciousness is circumscribed in the discourses by terms denoting the content of consciousness indicating hereby that the self is here believed to be the totality of mind or consciousnessIncluded in this view are the conceptions of a Super or Cosmic Consciousness or any notion of an Overself imagined to exist beyond the five aggregatesThe view that the self is the unity of all five aggregates is found for instance in those religions which believe in a final resurrection of a body or in other forms of survival of the whole personality body and mind be it in an eternal heaven or an eternal hellThe first five grounds for false views can be summarized by the following succinct statement of the Buddha Those ascetics and brahmans O monks who conceive a self in many ways all those conceive it as the five aggregates or as one of themAs to the sixth ground for false views it should be noted that it does not consist in the eternalist view itself but in the strong attachment to that view up to the degree of full identification with it as part and parcel of ones individuality This is mine this I am this is my self Such a tenacious clinging to the soulbelief has its roots firstly in the deep urge for selfassertion and selfperpetuation and secondly in the conditioning forces of education environment and traditionLike the other more common types of selfdefense this identification with the belief in a self can assume quite a passionate character with hostility or contempt for those who do not share itThe persistence of the soulbelief is demonstrated by the fact that from the earliest time of the Teaching up to the present day there have been not only individuals but also groups and sects within the Buddhist fold who believed in a self though they usually relegate it to a realm beyond the five aggregatesIn the next section it is shown that the belief in I and Mine instead of giving a feeling of security is in fact a cause of anxiety fear and worryAnd even when the faith in an immortal soul breaks down its aftereffect is still so strong that the assumption of a self that can be destroyed still persists and through the fear of annihilation becomes a source of despairThis belief in I and Mine and the passionate attachment to it is at the root of the existentialist philosophers anguish as well as of the anxiety neuroses that haunt modern manThe belief in unrealities even if a temporary solace must ultimately end in disappointment and despairHence the Buddha took great care to question and requestion his monks on this crucial point of soul and self in order to remove any doubt in this respectThe thorough manner of his inquiry is exemplified in  which leave no room for ambiguity on this issueIn  all the possible constituents of an alleged self are examined and found to be evanescent liable to suffering and without a self or any other underlying substanceIt should be noted that the statement of the text extends also to the most sublime manifestations of consciousness be they conceived as internal or externalThough the analysis of the individual and its property as given in the preceding sections is placed here in the context of refuting wrong views this is in no way its intrinsic value and purpose which rather consists in opening the gateway to liberationTo indicate this  speak of the attainment of final deliverance in sainthood brought about by insight that leads to alienation and detachment from all that is transient and void of substanceIn the following there is an impressive metaphorical description of the saint concluding with the solemn declaration of the untraceable nature of one who has uprooted all craving and ignoranceWith express reference to that solemn utterance the Buddha now rejects emphatically the imputation that a denial of self and soul makes him a nihilist and he summarizes his teaching in those words of wide renownWhat I teach now as before O monks is suffering and the cessation of sufferingIn the section on Praise and Blame we have a practical application of the Anattaadoctrine it frees the mind from elation and pride in the case of praise and from dejection and anger in the case of blameThe Buddha asks his disciples to emulate him in this respectTo be unshaken in the serene detachment of ones mind by any approval or disapproval by others this is another benefit bestowed by the deep realization of the truth of AnattaaPointing out this additional benefit the Master makes another earnest appeal to the monks to give up attachment to what is not yours the five aggregates constituting the socalled personalityIndeed if viewed in the singleminded and passionfree detachment of insightmeditation these physical and mental processes so long regarded as I and Mine will be seen to be as alien as the vegetation of the Jeta Grove to which the Buddhas finger may have pointed while he spokeThe symphonic rhythm of this great discourse approaches now its finaleIt is the majestic voice of uncompromising truth that speaks here in grave tones of crystalclear penetrative power without any gentler softening and soothing notesThe teaching as here conveyed plain and open explicit and consistent was and is a bold challenge of public opinion It goes counter to the two mighty currents of sense desire and selfaffirmation which make up the common stream of mankindIn this discourse the Buddha rejects repeatedly and excludes carefully any attempt at compromise in these two respectsFurthermore the Buddha voices here a grave warning that a wrong grasp and misuse of the Dhamma may bring much harm and sufferingAll escape routes for circumventing the true purpose and for avoiding the salient truths of the Doctrine were thus envisaged and carefully closedIn this brief recapitulation our discourse appears indeed as a rather formidable assemblage of stern messagesYet for one who is familiar with the Buddha Word this will be softened by the fact that in numerous discourses the Buddha spoke of his Teaching as one that offers gradual training gradual progress It is here that the Buddhas gentleness and compassion appears his forbearance with human frailties and his wise and patient guidance of menOur discourse too ends on an encouraging note of assuranceHaving earlier evoked the inspiring image of the saint the Master now speaks of the fruits and highest summit the final deliverance in saintship preceded by the three Noble Paths leading to it to the access stage of minds growing maturity for enlightenment down to those aspirants who in the indubitable confrontation with the Truth by way of insightmeditation have won deep faith in the Master and sublime love for himOf them our discourse says that they are assured of those superhuman realms which are usually called heaven But it may well be as the ancients explain that it is the heaven on earth which is meant here the superhuman bliss experienced when for the first time and still imperfect the insight dawns on the meditator that phenomena being evanescent and coreless throughout do not and cannot enforce bondage unless we ourselves forge the chains of craving and delusion Dhammapada vv Nyanaponika TheraThus have I heardOnce the Blessed One lived at Saavatthii in Jetas Grove in Anaathapindikas monasteryNow on that occasion a monk called Arittha formerly of the vulture killers had conceived this pernicious view There are things called obstructions by the Blessed OneAs I understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for one who pursues themSeveral monks hearing about it went to the monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers and asked him Is it true friend Arittha that you have conceived this pernicious view There are things called by the Blessed OneAs I understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for one who pursues themYes indeed friendsThen those monks wishing to dissuade Arittha from that pernicious view urged admonished questioned and exhorted him thus Do not say so friend Arittha do not say soDo not misrepresent the Blessed OneIt is not right to misrepresent himNever would the Blessed One speak like thatFor in many ways indeed has the Blessed One said of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues themSense desires so he has said bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointmentThe perils in them are greaterSense desires are like bare bones has the Blessed One said they are like a lump of flesh like a torch of straw like a pit of burning coals like a dream like borrowed goods like a fruitbearing tree like a slaughter house like a stake of swords like a snakes head are sense desires has the Blessed One saidThey bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointmentThe perils in them are greaterYet though the monk Arittha was thus urged admonished questioned and exhorted by those monks he still clung tenaciously and obstinately to his pernicious view saying There are things called obstructions by the Blessed OneAs I understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for one who pursues themWhen those monks could not dissuade the monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers from his pernicious view they went to the Blessed One and after respectfully saluting him they sat down at one sideBeing seated they told the Blessed One and they said Since O Lord we could not dissuade the monk Arittha from his pernicious view we have now reported this matter to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One addressed a certain monk thus Go O monk and tell the monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers that the Master calls him  Yes Lord replied the monkHe went to the monk Arittha and spoke to him The Master calls you friend Arittha  Yes friend replied Arittha and he went to meet the Blessed OneHaving arrived he saluted the Blessed One respectfully and sat down at one sideWhen he was seated the Blessed One addressed him thusIs it true Arittha that you have conceived this pernicious view There are things called obstructions by the Blessed OneAs I understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for him who pursues them  Yes indeed Lord I understand the teaching of the Blessed One in this way that those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not necessarily obstructive for him who pursues themOf whom do you know foolish man that I have taught to him the teaching in that mannerDid I not foolish man speak in many ways of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues themSense desires so I have said bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointmentThe perils in them are greaterSense desires are like bare bones have I said they are like a lump of flesh they are like a snakes head have I saidThey bring much suffering and disappointmentThe perils in them are greaterBut you O foolish man have misrepresented us by what you personally have wrongly graspedYou have undermined your own and have created much demeritThis foolish man will bring you much harm and suffering for a long timeThen the Blessed One addressed the monks thus What do you think O monks has that monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers produced any spark in this teaching and discipline  How should that be LordCertainly not O LordAfter these words the monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers sat silent confused with his shoulders drooping and his head bent brooding and incapable of making a rejoinderThen the Blessed One knowing spoke to him You will be known foolish man by what is your own pernicious view I shall now question the monks about thisThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Do you O monks also understand the teaching proclaimed by me in the same manner as this monk Arittha does who misrepresents us by what he personally has wrongly grasped who has undermined his own and created much demeritCertainly not LordFor in many ways has the Blessed One told us of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues them Good monksIt is good that you thus understand the teaching proclaimed by meFor in many ways have I spoken of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues themSense desires so have I said bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointmentThe perils in them are greaterSense desires are like bare bones have I said they are like a lump of flesh like a torch of straw like a pit of burning coals like a dream like borrowed goods like a fruitbearing tree like a slaughterhouse like a stake of swords like a snakes head are sense desires have I saidThey bring much suffering and disappointmentThe perils in them are greaterBut this monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers misrepresents us by what he personally has wrongly grasped he undermines his own and creates much demeritThis will bring to this foolish man much harm and suffering for a long timeMonks it is impossible indeed that one can pursue sense gratification without sensual desire without perceptions of sensual desire without thoughts of sensual desireThere are here O monks some foolish men who study the Teaching having studied it they do not wisely examine the purpose of those teachingsTo those who do not wisely examine the purpose these teachings will not yield insightThey study the Teaching only to use it for criticizing or for refuting others in disputationThey do not experience the purpose for which they study the TeachingTo them these teachings wrongly grasped will bring harm and suffering for a long timeAnd whyBecause of their wrong grasp of the teachingsSuppose monks a man wants a snake looks for a snake goes in search of a snakeHe then sees a large snake and when he is grasping its body or its tail the snake turns back on him and bites his hand or arm or some other limb of hisAnd because of that he suffers death or deadly painAnd whyBecause of his wrong grasp of the snakeSimilarly O monks there are here some foolish men who study the Teaching having studied it they do not wisely examine the purpose of those teachingsTo those who do not wisely examine the purpose these teachings will not yield insightThey study the Teaching only to use it for criticizing or for refuting others in disputationThey do not experience the purpose for which they study the TeachingTo them these teachings wrongly grasped will bring harm and suffering for a long timeAnd whyBecause of their wrong grasp of the teachingsBut there are here O monks some noble sons who study the Teaching and having studied it they examine wisely the purpose of those teachingsTo those who wisely examine the purpose these teachings will yield insightThey do not study the Teaching for the sake of criticizing nor for refuting others in disputationThey experience the purpose for which they study the Teaching and to them these teachings being rightly grasped will bring welfare and happiness for a long timeAnd whyBecause of their right grasp of the teachingsSuppose monks a man wants a snake looks for a snake goes in search of a snakeHe then sees a large snake and with a forked stick he holds it firmly downHaving done so he catches it firmly by the neckThen although the snake might entwine with its body that mans hand or arm or some other limb of his still he does not on that account suffer death or deadly painAnd why notBecause of his right grasp of the snakeSimilarly O monks there are here some noble sons who study the Teaching and having learned it they examine wisely the purpose of those teachingsTo those who wisely examine the purpose these teachings will yield insightThey do not study the Teaching for the sake of criticizing nor for refuting others in disputationThey experience the purpose for which they study the Teaching and to them these teachings being rightly grasped will bring welfare and happiness for a long timeAnd whyBecause of their right grasp of the teachingsTherefore O monks if you know the purpose of what I have said you should keep it in mind accordinglyBut if you do not know the purpose of what I have said you should question me about it or else those monks who are wiseI shall show you monks the Teachings similitude to a raft as having the purpose of crossing over not the purpose of being clung toListen monks and heed well what I shall say  Yes Lord replied the monksand the Blessed One spoke thusSuppose monks there is a man journeying on a road and he sees a vast expanse of water of which this shore is perilous and fearful while the other shore is safe and free from dangerBut there is no boat for crossing nor is there a bridge for going over from this side to the otherSo the man thinks This is a vast expanse of water and this shore is perilous and fearful but the other shore is safe and free from dangerThere is however no boat here for crossing nor a bridge for going over from this side to the otherSuppose I gather reeds sticks branches and foliage and bind them into a raft Now that man collects reeds sticks branches and foliage and binds them into a raftCarried by that raft laboring with hands and feet he safely crosses over to the other shoreHaving crossed and arrived at the other shore he thinks This raft indeed has been very helpful to meCarried by it laboring with hands and feet I got safely across to the other shoreShould I not lift this raft on my head or put it on my shoulders and go where I likeWhat do you think about it O monksWill this man by acting thus do what should be done with a raft  No Lord  How then monks would he be doing what ought to be done with a raftHere monks having got across and arrived at the other shore the man thinks This raft indeed has been very helpful to meCarried by it and laboring with hands and feet I got safely across to the other shoreShould I not pull it up now to the dry land or let it float in the water and then go as I please By acting thus monks would that man do what should be done with a raftIn the same way monks have I shown to you the Teachings similitude to a raft as having the purpose of crossing over not the purpose of being clung toYou O monks who understand the Teachings similitude to a raft you should let go even teachings how much more false onesThere are monks these six grounds for false viewsWhat are the sixThere is here monks an uninstructed worldling who has no regard for Noble Ones who is ignorant of their teaching and untrained in it who has no regard for men of worth who is ignorant of their teaching and untrained in it he considers corporeality thus This is mine this I am this is my self he considers feeling perception mental formations thus This is mine this I am this is my self and what is seen heard sensed and thought what is encountered sought pursued in mind this also he considers thus This is mine this I am this is my self and also this ground for views The universe is the SelfThat I shall be after death permanent stable eternal immutable eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition  that too he considers thus This is mine this I am this is my selfBut monks there is here a wellinstructed noble disciple who has regard for Noble Ones who knows their teaching and is well trained in it who has regard for men of worth who knows their teaching and is well trained in it he does not consider corporeality in this way This is mine this I am this is my self he does not consider feeling perception mental formations in this way This is mine this I am this is my self and what is seen heard sensed and thought what is encountered sought pursued in mind this also he does not consider in this way This is mine this I am this is my self and also this ground for views The universe is the SelfThat I shall be after death permanent stable eternal immutable eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition  that too he does not consider thus This is mine this I am this is my selfConsidering thus he is not anxious about unrealitiesWhen this was said a certain monk asked the Blessed OneLord can there be anxiety about unrealities in the externalThere can be O monk said the Blessed OneIn that case monk someone thinks Oh I had itThat alas I have no longerOh may I have it againBut alas I do not get it Hence he grieves is depressed and laments beating his breast he weeps and dejection befalls himThus monk is there anxiety about unrealities in the externalBut Lord can there be absence of anxiety about unrealities in the externalThere can be O monk said the Blessed OneIn that case monk someone does not think thus Oh I had itThat alas I have no longerOh may I have it againBut alas I do not get it Hence he does not grieve is not depressed does not lament he does not beat his breast nor does he weep and no dejection befalls himThus monk is there absence of anxiety about unrealities in the externalLord can there be anxiety about unrealities in the internalThere can be monk said the Blessed OneIn that case monk someone has this view The universe is the SelfThat I shall be after death permanent stable eternal immutable eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition He then hears a Perfect One expounding the Teaching for the removal of all grounds for views of all prejudices obsessions dogmas and biases for the stilling of all processes for the relinquishment of all substrata for the extirpation of craving for dispassion cessation NibbaanaHe then thinks I shall be annihilated I shall be destroyedNo longer shall I exist Hence he grieves is depressed and laments beating his breast he weeps and dejection befalls himThus monk is there anxiety about unrealities in the internalBut Lord can there be absence of anxiety about unrealities in the internalThere can be monk said the Blessed OneIn that case monk someone does not have this view The universe is the Self eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition He then hears a Perfect One expounding the Teaching for the removal of all grounds for views of all prejudices obsessions dogmas and biases for the stilling of all processes for the relinquishing of all substrata for the extirpation of craving for dispassion cessation NibbaanaHe then does not think I shall be annihilated I shall be destroyedNo longer shall I exist Hence he does not grieve is not depressed does not lament he does not beat his breast nor does he weep and no dejection befalls himThus monk is there absence of anxiety about unrealities in the internalYou may well take hold of a possession O monks that is permanent stable eternal immutable that abides eternally the same in its very conditiondo you see monks any such possession  No Lord  Well monks I too do not see any such possession that is permanent stable eternal immutable that abides eternally the same in its very conditionYou may well accept monks the assumption of a selftheory from the acceptance of which there would not arise sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despairdo you see monks any such assumption of a selftheory  No Lord  Well monks I too do not see any such assumption of a selftheory from the acceptance of which there would not arise sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despairYou may well rely monks on any supporting for views from the reliance on which there would not arise sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despairdo you see monks any such supporting for views  No Lord  Well monks I too do not see any such supporting for views from the reliance on which there would not arise sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despairIf there were a self monks would there be my selfs property  So it is Lord  Or if there is a selfs property would there by my self  So it is Lord  Since in truth and in fact self and selfs property do not obtain O monks then this ground for views The universe is the SelfThat I shall be after death permanent stable eternal immutable eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition  is it not monks an entirely and perfectly foolish idea  What else should it be LordIt is an entirely and perfectly foolish ideaWhat do you think monks is corporeality permanent or impermanent  Impermanent Lord  And what is impermanent is it painful or pleasant  Painful Lord  What is impermanent painful subject to change is it fit to be considered thus This is mine this I am this is my self  Certainly not Lord  What do you think monks Is feeling is perception are mental formations is consciousness permanent or impermanent  Impermanent Lord  And what is impermanent is it painful or pleasant  Painful Lord  And what is impermanent painful subject to change is it fit to be considered thus This is mine this I am this is my self  Certainly not LordTherefore monks whatever corporeality whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  all corporeality should with right wisdom thus be seen as it is This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhatever feeling whatever perception whatever mental formations whatever consciousness whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  all consciousness should with right wisdom thus be seen as it is This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfSeeing this monks the wellinstructed noble disciple becomes disgusted with corporeality becomes disgusted with feeling with perception with mental formations with consciousnessThrough his being disgusted his passion fades awayHis passion having faded he is freedIn him who is freed there is the knowledge of freedom Ceased has rebirth fulfilled is the holy life the task is done there is no more of this to come thus he knowsThis monk is called one who has removed the crossbar has filled the moat has broken the pillar has unbolted a Noble One who has taken down the flag put down the burden become unfetteredAnd how monks is that monk one who has removed the crossbarHerein the monk has abandoned ignorance has cut it off at the root removed it from its soil like a palmyra tree brought it to utter extinction incapable of arising againThus has he removed the crossbarAnd how monks is that monk one who has filled the moatHerein the monk has abandoned the round of rebirths leading to renewed existence he has cut it off at the root removed it from its soil like a palmyra tree brought it to utter extinction incapable of arising againAnd how has he broken the pillarHe has abandoned craving has cut it off at the root removed it from its soil like a palmyra tree brought it to utter extinction incapable of arising againAnd how has he unboltedHe has abandoned the five lower fetters has cut them off at the root removed them from their soil like a palmyra tree brought them to utter extinction incapable of arising againAnd how is the monk a Noble One who has taken down the flag put down the burden become unfetteredHe has abandoned the conceit of self has cut it off at the root removed it from is soil like a palmyra tree brought it to utter extinction incapable of arising againThus is the monk a Noble One who has taken down the flag put down the burden become unfetteredWhen a monks mind is thus freed O monks neither the gods with Indra nor the gods with Brahma nor the gods with the Lord of Creatures when searching will find on what the consciousness of one thus gone is basedWhy is thatOne who has thus gone is no longer traceable here and now so I saySo teaching so proclaiming O monks I have been baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly accused by some ascetics and brahmans A nihilist is the ascetic Gotama He teaches the annihilation the destruction the nonbeing of an existing individualAs I am not as I do not teach so have I been baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly accused by some ascetics and brahmans thus A nihilist is the ascetic Gotama He teaches the annihilation the destruction the nonbeing of an existing individualWhat I teach now as before O monks is suffering and the cessation of sufferingIf for that others revile abuse scold and insult the Perfect One on that account O monks the Perfect One will not feel annoyance nor dejection nor displeasure in his heartAnd if for that others respect revere honor and venerate the Perfect One on that account the Perfect One will not feel delight nor joy nor elation in his heartIf for that others respect revere honor and venerate the Perfect One He will think It is towards this which was formerly fully comprehended that they perform such actsTherefore O monks if you too are reviled abused scolded and insulted by others you should on that account not entertain annoyance nor dejection nor displeasure in your heartsAnd if others respect revere honor and venerate you on that account you should not entertain delight nor joy nor elation in your heartsIf others respect revere honor and venerate you you should think It is towards this which was formerly comprehended that they perform such actsTherefore monks give up whatever is not yoursYour giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happinessWhat is it that is not yoursCorporeality is not yoursGive it upYour giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happinessFeeling is not yoursGive it upYour giving it up will for a long bring you welfare and happinessPerception is not yoursGive it upYour giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happinessMental formations are not yoursGive them upYour giving them up will for a long time bring you welfare and happinessConsciousness is not yoursGive it upYour giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happinessWhat do you think monks if people were to carry away the grass sticks branches and leaves in this Jeta Grove or burnt them or did with them what they pleased would you think These people carry us away or burn us or do with us as they please  No Lord  Why not Because Lord that is neither our self nor the property of our self  So too monks give up what is not yoursYour giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happinessWhat is it that is not yoursCorporeality feeling perception mental formations consciousness are not yoursGive them upYour giving them up will for a long time bring you welfare and happinessMonks this Teaching so well proclaimed by me is plain open explicit free of patchworkIn this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork for those who are arahants free of taints who have accomplished and completed their task have laid down the burden achieved their aim severed the fetters binding to existence who are liberated by full knowledge there is no round of existence that can be ascribed to themMonks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those monks who have abandoned the five lower fetters will all be reborn spontaneously and there they will pass away finally no more returning from that worldMonks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those monks who have abandoned three fetters and have reduced greed hatred and delusion are all oncereturners and returning only once to this world will then make an end of sufferingMonks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those monks who have abandoned three fetters are all streamenterers no more liable to downfall assured and headed for full EnlightenmentMonks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those monks who are mature in Dhamma mature in faith are all headed for full EnlightenmentMonks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those who have simply faith in me simply love for me are all destined for heavenThis said the Blessed OneSatisfied the monks rejoiced in the words of the Blessed OneThe similes about sensedesires given in the following section of the discourse seem to support the commentarial reference to sexual intercourseBare bones fleshless bloodsmeared are thrown to a starving dog but cannot satisfy the animals hungerSimilarly sensedesires give no lasting satisfactionA lump of flesh for which birds of prey fight each other if the bird that has seized the lump of flesh does not yield it it may meet death or deadly pain from the beaks and claws of the other birdsSimilarly the sensedesires are common to many ie the same sense objects may be claimed by many and may become the cause of deadly conflictA torch of straw carried against the wind may cause severe burns to the careless man if not quickly discardedSimilarly sensedesires will severely burn ie greatly harm him who thoughtlessly and unaware of the great danger partakes of them in the belief that they will bring light and joy to his lifeA pit of burning coals towards which a man is dragged by others if he cannot free himself from the grip he will be thrown into the fire and consumed by itSimilarly sensedesires are like a vast conflagration into which the victim is dragged by bad company or by his own deeds causing his rebirth in miserable states of woeA dream of a beautiful landscape that vanishes on awakeningSimilarly sensedesires are a brief illusion like a dream and disappointing after one awakens from infatuation to realityBorrowed goods on which the borrower foolishly prides himself in public but which are withdrawn by the owners when they see the boastful manSimilarly sensedesires are temporary and not a true and lasting possession of him who enjoys them filled with vain gloryA fruit tree climbed by one who craves for the fruits but another man likewise greedy for them but unable to climb chooses another method and fells the tree and unless the first man quickly descends he will break his limbsSimilarly in the blind pursuit of sense pleasures one may break all ones limbs may suffer severe injury of body and mindThe SubComy refers also to punishment and torture incurred by reckless deeds to which people are driven by sense infatuationA slaughter house because sensedesires are like a butchers blockThis may mean that sensedesires kill much that is noble in man and cut off his higher developmentA stake of swords sensedesires are piercing penetrating deep within causing wounds where there had been noneUnfulfilled or frustrated desire or the pains of jealousy are indeed like that ancient torture of the state of swordsA snakes head sensedesires are a grave risk and peril for the present and future welfare if one walks unwarilyNijjhaana has here the meaning of insight or comprehensionThis phrase appears with the same meaning and in the same context in the Kiitaagiri Sutta and the Cankii Sutta that is likewise preceded by an examination of purpose Also SNconfirms our rendering Yassa khobhikkhave imedhammaa evam paññaaya mattaso nijjhaanam khamanti ayam vuccati dhammaanusaariiHe who studies the Buddhas word for getting robes and other requisites or for becoming widely known that is he who learns for the sake of fame and gain his study is that of the Snakesimile but better than such a study would be for him to sleep and not to study at allBut there is one who studies the Buddhas word and when morality is the subject he fulfills morality when concentration is the subject he lets it take deep root when insight is the subject he establishes himself well in insight when the paths and fruitions are the subject he studies with the intention I shall develop the path I shall realize the fruition Only the studying of such a one is studying for the sake of crossing overBut the studying by one who has extinguished the taints is studying in the Treasurers position For him indeed there remains nothing unpenetrated nothing unrelinquished nothing undeveloped and nothing unrealizedHe is one who has penetrated the aggregates of existence who has relinquished the defilements developed the path and realized the fruitionHence in studying the Buddhas Word he studies it as a keeper of the scriptures as a guardian of the tradition as a preserver of the continuityThus his study is like a treasurerNow when those proficient in the books cannot live at one place being afraid of starvation etc if there is one who while himself going the alms round with very great fatigue as an unliberated worlding takes up studies with the thought Lest the exceedingly sweet Buddhaword may perish I shall keep the scriptures shall preserve the continuity and guard the tradition in that case is his study of the Treasurers type or is it not It is notAnd why notBecause his study is not applied to his own situation cross overAn unliberated worldlings study will either be of the type of the Snakesimile or for the sake of crossing over while for the seven who have entered the higher training the study is only for the sake of crossing over for the saint it is only of the Treasurers typeComy and SubComy False views themselves are grounds for subsequently arising false views like personality belief eternalism etcFurther the grounds are the subjectmatter of the views ie the five aggregates the visual objects etcFinally they are also the conditioning factors of the false views eg ignorance senseimpression perceptions and thoughts unwisely directed attention bad company others speech etcThese with the aggregates as the first are the eight grounds for false views as mentioned in the Patisambhidaa MaggaThe term ditthitthaana also occurs in the Brahmajaala Sutta and in the commentary to itThe terms thought encountered etc refer to the fifth aggregate ie consciousness which was not mentioned in the first part of In the Commentary specific to our text this eternalistic view is rendered and classified in the terminology of the DhammaThe Commentary saysThis statement refers to the view He considers corporeality etc as the self The canonical quotation included here in the Commentary has two implications which are of importance for understanding the reason why it was cited in this contextAs very often in the commentaries the term world is explained as truly referring to the five aggregates singly or in totoThis quotation is the formula for the first of the twenty types of personalitybeliefIn the first five of these twenty the self is said to be identical with each of the five aggregatesHence the application of this quote to our textual passage signifies that the theorist conceives the world as identical with the selfThe double So so  in our text should therefore be taken as standing for yo so lit what is the world that is the selfIn the Comy to MN we find a similar phrase Someone considers corporeality as self what is corporeality that is I what is I that is corporealityThus he considers corporeality and self as nondual According to this interpretation the phrase has been translated here by This universe is the SelfMostly the first five types of personalitybelief are explained as referring to the wrong view of annihilationismBut their being quoted in our context shows that they may also apply to eternalismWe have come to this conclusion since it is improbable that in our textual passage two mutually exclusive views should have been combined in a single statement formulating the sixth ground for false views that is in the first part of that statement annihilationism and in the second eternalismThis entire statement of the sixth ground for views may well have been the original creed of an eternalistic doctrineThe phrasing appears rather vague in the first part and in general it is rather loosely wordedTo contemporaries however the meaning may have been quite clear since it was perhaps the stock formula for teachings that were well knownHence in this translation we have left the first part of the statement in its rather cryptic and ambiguous original form while giving the interpretations in the notes onlyComy By showing herewith the taintfree saint who has no anxiety at the destruction of his own aggregates the Blessed One concludes his expositionQuoting this passage of our text the VenDrWalpola Rahula remarks If there had been any soultheory which the Buddha had accepted he would certainly have explained it here because he asked the monks to accept that soultheory which did not produce sufferingBut in the Buddhas view there is no such soultheorySee Satipatthaana Sutta where in explanation of anissito the Comy mentions tanhaanissaya and ditthinissaya dependence on craving and viewsComy Here a twofold voidness is shown that of self and of property belonging to a selfThere are two cities one is a city of brigands the other a city of peaceNow to a great warrior of the city of peace the following thought occurs As long as this city of brigands exists we shall never be free from danger So he dons his armor and goes to the city of brigandsWith his sword he breaks the gate pillar together with the door wings he removes the bolt lifts the crossbar fills in the moat and lowers the flagSuch a saint has put down for good the burden of the five aggregates of kammaproducing volitions and of the defilements has fully liberated himself from the round of existenceSubComy There is no teaching of the Master that is unrelated to the Four TruthsBy saying What I teach now as before is suffering and the cessation of suffering the Blessed One indicates this Never do I teach a self that is annihilated or destroyed nor do I teach that there is any kind of selfThis phrase chinnapilotika seems however to point to the inner consistency of the Teaching which like a new cloth is of one piece and is not in need of patching up contradictions by artificial attempts of reconciling inconsistenciesHence the term may freely be rendered by the single word consistentThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arosePublishers Note This booklet contains chapter of The Questions of King Milinda An Abridgement of the Milindapañha edited by NKGMendisThis work is based on existing translations of the Pali original primarily upon the rendition by IBHorner published in the Sacred Books of the Buddhists series by the Pali Text SocietyMsHorners translation was used as the basis for the BPSs abridged edition with the kind permission of the Pali Text SocietyThen King Milinda approached the Venerable Nagasena greeted him and sat down at a respectful distanceKing Milinda anxious to know anxious to hear anxious to remember anxious to see the light of knowledge anxious to break down the lack of knowledge anxious to find the light of knowledge anxious to expel the darkness of ignorance aroused extreme steadfastness and zeal and mindfulness and clear consciousness and spoke thus to the Venerable Nagasena Revered Nagasena have you ever seen the BuddhaNo sireBut have your teachers ever seen the BuddhaNo sireRevered Nagasena if you have never seen the Buddha and if your teachers have never seen the Buddha well then revered Nagasena there is no Buddha the Buddha is not manifested hereBut sire did those former noble warriors exist who were the forerunners of your noble warrior dynastyYes revered sir what doubt is thereHave you sire ever seen the former noble warriorsNo revered sirBut have those who have instructed you sire  priests generals judges chief councilors  have these ever seen the former noble warriorsNo revered sirBut if you sire have not seen the former noble warriors and if your instructors have not seen the former noble warriors where are the former noble warriorsRevered Nagasena articles of use enjoyed by the former noble warriors are to be seen that is to say the white sunshade the turban the shoes the yaktail fan the treasure of the sword of state and the couches of great priceBy these we can know and can believe that the former noble warriors existedEven so sire we may also know and believe in this Blessed OneThere is this reason according to which we may know and believe that there was this Blessed OneWhat is the reasonThere are sire articles of use enjoyed by that Blessed One who knows and sees the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness the four right efforts the four bases of psychic power the five spiritual faculties the five powers the seven factors of enlightenment the Noble Eightfold PathBy these the world with the devas knows and believes that there was this Blessed OneFor this reason sire for this cause because of this method because of this inference it should be known that there was this Blessed OneRevered Nagasena make a simileAs sire a cityarchitect when he wants to build a city first looks about for a district that is level not elevated not lowlying free from gravel and stone secure irreproachable and delightful and then when he has made level there what was not level and has had it cleared of stumps of trees and thorns he might build a city thereIt would be fine and regular well planned the moats and encircling walls dug deep the city gates the watchtowers and the ramparts strong the crossroads squares junctions and the places where three or four roads meet numerous the mainroads clean level and even the bazar shops well laid out the city full of parks pleasances lakes lotus pools and wells adorned with a wide variety of shrines to devas the whole free from defectsWhen that city was fully developed he might go away to another districtThen after a time that city might become rich and prosperous well stocked with food secure successful happy without adversity without accident crowded with all kinds of peopleWhen these people had seen the city new well laid out without a defect irreproachable delightful they would know by inference Clever indeed is that cityarchitect who was the builder of the cityEven so sire that Blessed One is without an equal equal to the unequaled equal to the matchless ones unique incomparable boundless immeasurable of unmeasured special qualities attained to perfection in special qualities of infinite steadfastness infinite incandescence infinite energy infinite power gone to perfection in the powers of a Buddha

the power of the Buddha by inference through reasons such as theseI am satisfied revered Nagasena by your extremely variegated exposition of the questionThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIn his Dictionary of Paali Proper Names Professor GPMalalasekera introduces Maara as the personification of Death the Evil One the Tempter He continues The legends concerning Maara are in the books very involved and defy any attempts at unraveling themAnalyzing a series of allusions to Maara in the commentarial literature he further elaborates on his definition with the following observationsMalalasekera proceeds to attempt a theory of Maara in Buddhism which he formulates in the following mannerThe commonest use of the word was evidently in the sense of DeathFrom this it was extended to mean the world under the sway of death and the beings thereinThence the kilesas also came to be called Maara in that they were instruments of Death the causes enabling Death to hold sway over the worldAll temptations brought about by the kilesas were likewise regarded as the work of DeathThere was also evidently a legend of a devaputta of the Vasavatti world called Maara who considered himself the head of the Kaamaavacaraworld and who recognized any attempt to curb the enjoyment of sensual pleasures as a direct challenge to himself and to his authorityAs time went on these different conceptions of the word became confused one with the other but this confusion is not always difficult to unravelWhat follows from this statement even though Malalasekera did not elucidate enough is that the term Maara when it occurs in Buddhist literature could signify any one of the following fourIn this paper where the Buddhas encounters with Maara are analyzed as they are presented in literature and art the main concern will be with Maara as a personification of temptation above but we will also briefly examine how the other concepts are sometimes subsumed under this and how the literary description or the artistic representation of Maara is conditioned by the merger of three separate concepts as well as by the general body of Indian mythologyIt has to be noted that Maara is another name for the Indian God of Love known also as Kaama or Kaamadeva Manmatha Ananga Kusumaayudha Pañcabaana and MakaradhvajaThe Paali Canon includes several accounts attributed to the Buddha himself on his quest for deliverance and these have obviously provided the raw material for the reconstruction of his biographyAmong them the most comprehensive as regards the details of the discipline and training which the Buddha followed is the Mahaasaccaka Sutta of the Majjhima NikaayaIt elaborates the circumstances leading to the renunciation the Great Departure as the term Abhinikkhamana is usually translated the period of studentship under AAlaara Kaalaama and Uddaka Raamaputta the austerities he practiced for six years the process of meditation and contemplation and the progressive spiritual attainments and the final achievement of EnlightenmentThe entire statement has a ring of authenticity  a purposeful recollection of the highlights of his life and careerBut as EJThomas has pointed out the most remarkable feature in this recital is the entire absence of any temptation by MaaraThe same comment would also apply to the Bhayabherava Sutta where the Buddha recounts the doubts and fears which he encountered in the days of his austerities in the forestNor does the Dvedhaavitakka Sutta of the same Nikaaya which analyzes the Buddhas thought process prior to the Enlightenment and how it led to his Enlightenment digress from the philosophical treatment of the theme to refer to temptations by MaaraThomass explanation is that later authorities put additional events in different places But a more reasonable explanation to my mind is that poetical imagery or allegorization is more the domain of poetry and hence not to be expected in prose sermonsThat is precisely why almost all the accounts of Maaras temptations in the Paali Canon are in verse fully or partially and the conversations with Maara invariably are recorded in verseThe most important among them is the Padhaana Sutta in the Suttanipaata of the Khuddaka NikaayaHere Maara is presented as Namuci and described as a person who approached the striving Bodhisatta speaking kind wordsThe words attributed to him are as followsThe reply which the Buddha gave Maara has the makings of the entire concept of the allegorization or personification of temptation and psychological conflictWe find here all the ingredients which in course of time fired the imagination of countless writers poets painters and sculptors all over Asia for over two millenniaThe Buddha recognizes the speaker of these kind words and is conscious of Maaras hidden agendaSo he rebukes him as Pamattabandhu Paapimaa and KanhaThe hosts of Maara are also identifiedAlthough the numbering of the hosts stops at eight two more sets are identifiableThus the concept of ten hosts has also been establishedSimilarly conceived is Maara riding an elephant which could of course mean any ride  elephant horse or chariot  and arrayed for war with an army all aroundThe Buddha himself announces his readiness to give battleThe Buddhas squadrons however are not named but earlier in listing the psychological defenses he possessed against Maaras kind persuasive words the Buddha had saidFurther to underline the psychological dimension of the battle as conceived in this context the Buddha proceeds to tell MaaraOne element however is still not evident Maara does not claim the seat on which the Bodhisatta is seated and hence the need to call as witness the earth has not arisenIt may nevertheless be noted that the Buddhas reply assumes an effort on the part of Maara and his hosts to dislodge him from his positionOn the other hand a further reason is given for the Buddhas determination to fightThis implies a further element in the legends of Maaras temptations which are found in canonical texts as well as elsewhere relating to the obstacles he had tried to place on the Buddhas advent into his mission as a teacherAnother pointer in the Padhaana Sutta to other legends is contained in the last three verses which speak of a later encounter of Maara with the BuddhaThough Chalmers interprets this passage as a statement addressed to the Buddha the accusative case Gotamam in verse indicates that it need not be so construedHere Maara saysThe final verse of the sutta which tradition assigns to the Buddha but which appears from the contents to be of much later origin than verses  shows the degree to which the personification of Maara had developedHere he is called dummano yakkho a disappointed sprite and is said to be so frustrated that his lute drops from his armpitWe shall return later to the implications of this reference to Maara as yakkhaAltogether absent from the Padhaana Sutta is the episode with the daughters of Maara who are elsewhere represented as tempting the Buddha with their charms after their father with all his hosts had failedThis story along with several others occurs in the Maarasamyutta of the Samyutta NikaayaThe majority of these episodes do not fall within the category of temptations by MaaraThey reflect mostly the hostility which Maara had to the Buddhas mission and consist largely of disturbances he had created in different guises  making noises breaking things disrupting sermonsIt is Maara preventing the people from getting out of his clutches in the sense of escaping from MaaradheyyaThese therefore do not come in the category of temptations the topic of this paperThe Maarasamyutta comprising twentyfive suttas does contain a number of temptations in which the Buddha or a disciple is involvedSutta Nospeaks of a moment when Maara became aware of a thought of the Buddha as regards his attainment of Enlightenment and approached him sayingIn another sutta when the Buddha was in pain on account of a foot injury Maara addressed him in verseAgain Sutta Norecords an instance when the Buddha was debating in his mind whether it was possible to govern without killing and ordering execution without confiscating and sequestrating without sorrowing and inflicting sorrow in other words righteouslyMaara is said to have approached the Buddha and persuaded him to govern righteouslyApparently the temptation here was for the Buddha to revert to lay life and resume a royal career so as to rescue those suffering from the cruelty of rulersIn each of these cases the Buddha gives an apt reply which convinces Maara that he has been recognizedEach discovery is concluded with the statement Sad and disappointed Maara vanishedThe Bhikkhuniisamyutta in particular gives ten similar accounts of temptations which bhikkhuniis had experienced in lonely placesHere too the statements attributed to Maara or the bhikkhunii concerned and often both are in verseFor example it was Kisaagotamii who was addressed thus by MaaraShe gives a replyMaara knows that he has been found out and  as in the case of all similar episodes  vanishes from the place unhappy and despondentInto this same pattern falls the episode narrated in the Mahaavagga of the Vinaya PitakaWhen the Buddha was alone after he had sent out the first sixty disciples on missions to propagate the doctrine Maara approached him sayingThe Buddha bluntly contradicts him and Maara disappearsThe recurring idea behind all these episodes is that doubts anxieties and longings which arise in the lonely mind of the Buddha or a disciple are personified as MaaraWith a firm resolve they vanish and that is what Maaras disappearance signifiesVery different from all these suttas is the Maaradhiitu Sutta which starts with the story of the Padhaana Sutta and continues to describe how the vanquished Maara sat down crosslegged on the ground not too far from the Blessed One silent dismayed with shoulders drooping and head down glum with nothing to say scraping the ground with a reed The way the story is connected with the preceding sutta gives the impression that this incident takes place seven years after the Enlightenment when all the efforts of Maara to discover the Buddha heedless had failedThe daughters of Maara inquire about their fathers despondency and receive the replyWhat follows is pure allegoryThe three daughters have apt names Tanhaa Arati and RagaaThey conspire and on the principle that mens tastes vary assume forms ranging from those of virgins to mature womenThey display wiles by which any ordinary mans heart would have burst or hot blood would have gushed from his mouth or he would have gone mad or crazy or he would have shriveled dried up and withered like a cut green rush Unmoved by all their charms and wiles the Buddha rejects them with a series of wellchosen similesWhat all these Maara legends in the canonical texts establish beyond any doubt is that the allegorization of temptations had commenced very early in Buddhist circlesThe imagery of a personified Maara accompanied by a tenfold army and supported by three daughters could even have originated with the Buddha himselfAs suggestive imagery it must have epitomized what most of the Buddhas disciples and followers had subjectively experienced with wavering faith when the sweet delights of home and love the charms of wealth and power began to show themselves with attractive colors While they were perpetuated in poetry no one took them literallyAs Malalasekera says with reference to the Buddhas victory over Maara That this account of Buddhas struggle with Maara is literally true none but the most ignorant of the Buddhists believe even at the present dayBut that does not mean there had been no confusionWith the four concepts of Maara outlined in the introduction to this paper such confusions were quite commonplaceFor example even Buddhaghosa could not distinguish between the allegorical Maara and the MaaradevaputtaWith regard to the seven year surveillance of the Buddha by Maara in Noof the Maarasamyutta he says that Maaradevaputta having failed to see any lapse on the part of the Buddha over this period came to him and worshipped himDespite the lack of clarity Maara was already a fullfledged concept by the time the Paali Canon was completed in its present formAs the biography of the Buddha came to be presented systematically temptations by Maara began to figure as a major element in relation to several decisive steps taken by the BuddhaA number of such occasions representing critical points in the career before and immediately after the Enlightenment had been identified by the time the introduction to the Jaataka Commentary was composedThis introduction which contains perhaps the oldest continuous life story of the Buddha mentions six such occasionsIt should be noted that other encounters individually described in the Maarasamyutta are not included in this list possibly because they were not connected with any important event or decision in the life of the BuddhaAlso to be stressed is the fact that the list is at variance with the information given elsewhere in the Paali CanonNot all biographies of the Buddha agree with this list or with the timing of the encounters or with the words or actions attributed to MaaraThe Lalitavistara though a later Buddhist Sanskrit work appears to have been based either on the introduction to the Jaataka Commentary or on an earlier sourceAs such the divergences other than in regard to poetic exaggerations and greater emphasis on the supernatural aspects are minimalOne important variation in the Lalitavistara is that Maara the wicked one closely followed the Bodhisattva for six years as he was practicing austerities seeking and pursuing an entrance Such a long period of surveillance suggests the function of Maaradevaputta rather than an encounter explainable in allegorical termsAnother departure is that the daughters of Maara try to tempt the Buddha under the Bodhitree and their names are Rati Arati and TisnaaWhereas the Paali sources say that the vanquished Maara drew lines on the ground with a stick or a reed the Lalitavistara states that Maara wrote the words the ascetic Gotama will escape from my realmThe version which reveals some very significant departures is the life of the Buddha recorded in the Tibetan textsAs far as Rockhills selective translation of the relevant material in the Dulva shows five points have to be notedThe Chinese Abhiniskramana Suutra has a few more variationsFor instance it says that Maara brought a bundle of official notices purporting to be from Saakya princes to dissuade the future Buddha from continuing with his quest for deliveranceWhether as a conscious effort in rationalizing this diversity of information or as a result of concentrating on the most dramatic instances when the Buddha encountered temptations three events gained in popularity namely the Renunciation or Great Departure the Victory over Maara described either as Maaravijaya or Maarayuddha and the Temptation by Maaras daughtersEach incident acquired embellishments at the hands of poets and creative writers until by about the first century Ba number of elements had firmly taken rootThese basic elements are observable both in literature and artThe second and the third have of course become more popular as themes for graphic description in prose or verse as well as for imaginative representation in sculpture and paintingAmong the earliest poems on these themes is Asvaghosas Buddhacarita which devotes two chapters to the Victory over Maara and the Temptation by Maaras daughtersAlready new elements had begun to appearMaara comes not only with three daughters but also with three sons  Vibrama Harsa and DarpaOf course Maara himself is represented as an enemy of the perfect Dharma and is actually called Kaamadeva the God of LoveHe whom they call in the world Kaamadeva the owner of the various weapons the flowerarrowed the lord of the course of desire  it is he whom they also style Maara the enemy of liberationIn the typical style of this Indian Cupid the first weapons used are the five flowerarrowsWhen they fail Maara thinks He is not worthy of my flowershaft nor my arrow gladdener nor the sending of my daughter Rati he deserves the alarms and rebukes and blows from all the gathered hosts of demons Thus he summoned his army of animalfaced and hideous monsters which Asvaghosa describes conjuring many a grotesque appearanceTheir collective assault on the future Buddha finds lively description in as many as twentythree versesThe reaction of the future Buddha is his resolute steadfastness and an admonition to Maara to desist from his futile effortGive not way then to grief but put on calm let not your greatness O Maara be mixed with pride it is not well to be confident  fortune is unstable  why do you accept a position on a tottering baseThe description of the encounter ends with the following four versesHaving listened to his words and having seen the unshaken firmness of the great saint Maara departed dispirited and broken in purpose with those very arrows by which O world you are smitten in your heartWith their triumph at an end their labor all fruitless and all their stones straw and trees thrown away that host of his fled in all directions like some hostile army when its camp has been destroyed by the enemyWhen the flowerarmed god thus fled away vanquished with his hostile forces and the passionless sage remained victorious having conquered all the power of darkness the heavens shone out with the moon like a maiden with a smile and a sweetsmelling shower of flowers fell down wet with dewWhen the wicked one thus fled vanquished the different regions of the sky grew clear the moon shone forth showers of flowers fell down from the sky upon the earth and the night gleamed out like a spotless maidenThere is no reference to either the ten squadrons of Maara or the matching armies in the form of the recollection of the Ten Perfections by the future BuddhaNor is the question of the right to the seat raised or the earth summoned as a witnessAs writer after writer vied with one another to present the momentous struggle of the Buddha in his endeavor to attain Enlightenment new details were added and new imagery createdRight down to the modern writers and poets in Buddhist countries particularly Sri Lanka Burma and Thailand the process has continuedThe license which they continue to exercise is an indication by itself that what is elaborated is an allegory a symbolic representation of an inner conflict and crisis and not an historical eventThe writers or the artists are not meddling with facts and misrepresenting history but are sharpening their own conception and appreciation of the most critical experience of a man who transcended himselfAsvaghosa takes up the episode of Maaras daughters in ChapterThe Buddha has passed four weeks since the Enlightenment and Maara comes to him saying O holy one be pleased to enter Nirvaana your desires are accomplished The Buddhas response being negative Maara becomes despondent and the daughters take upon themselves the task of luring the BuddhaWhat follows in contrast to the Victory over Maara is a tame dialogue between the Buddha and each of the daughtersThe whole theme is disposed of in twelve verses and the girls end up by professing to be the Buddhas disciplesThis episode too underwent embellishment and elaborationEarlier Paali sources as well as the Lalitavistara had given an indication of the potential which the theme has both in descriptive poetry and graphic artPoets in several languages have succeeded in conjuring up scenes of singing and dancing of three damsels in seductive posturesAccording to the tenets of Oriental poetry a great poem has to evoke a range of emotions among which heroism and eroticism have been especially sought afterThe Victory over Maara and the Temptation by Maaras daughters provided the basis for many a creative effort in rendering a more balanced character in terms of the tenets of ornate poetry to poems on the Buddha which could otherwise be humdrum or deeply philosophicalWhether this was permissible had been a question which the Buddhist writers had grappled with from the days of AsvaghosaBut the fact that the themes have been widely if not entirely viewed as symbolic and allegorical have all alone ensured a very high degree of liberty in artistic expressionThis is what the farflung representations of these themes in sculpture and painting demonstrate even more convincinglyEven before the Buddha came to be represented in human form the Great Departure and Victory over Maara had become popular themes depicted at both Sanchi and AmaravatiSculptures on the gateways of the Great Stupa at Sanchi include a scene of the Great Departure and two scenes of Maaras Assault and DefeatA riderless horse represents the future Buddha leaving the city in the company of countless gods in a mood of jubilationNone of the figures can however be identified as MaaraApparently the panel does not represent Maaras temptationBut as described in the Lalitavistara and Asvaghosas Buddhacarita the horse is borne on the hands of yaksas or deitiesIn the panels depicting the assault and defeat of Maara the future Buddha is represented by an empty seat under the BodhitreeMaara himself is shown in one as a stately figure a veritable god reflecting Asvaghosas identification of Maara as Kaamadeva the Indian God of LoveThis figure is characteristically handsome whereas his hosts in both panels are grotesque in size and appearanceIn the assault scene they make hideous faces and are apparently jeering and shoutingIn the defeat scene they are despondent and retreating in disarrayAs Maaras hosts retreat on the righthand half of the panel the rejoicing deities are shown approaching the Bodhitree from the leftApparently it is Maara who with bow in hand rides the elephantIn neither is there any overt depiction of the temptation by Maaras daughters unless the two female figures at the lefthand corner of the assault scene are meant to suggest it but this appears most unlikelyAmong the Amaravati sculptures of the second century Aare two scenes depicting the Great Departure and Maaras AssaultIn the first a riderless horse above whom is held the royal insignia of a parasol is carried on the hands of squatting dwarf figuresHere again the encounter with Maara is not representedWith the characteristic phenomenon of horror vacuii in the sculptures of this period the panel is crowded with rejoicing deities one of them in a dancing poseEven in the damaged state the panel on Maaras Assault gives the impression of the dynamism that the sculptor had intended to conveyThe hosts of Maara are depicted with various weapons raised ready to attack while Maara himself appears to be the seated figure to the left of the empty seat under the BodhitreeHere too Maara is a handsome god in princely attireThis panel seems to combine synoptically three events the Assault the Defeat of Maara and the Temptation by Maaras daughters note the dancing figure on the rightIt is in Gandhara art that we notice a further development of the two themes and the emergence of the scene depicting the Temptation by Maaras daughtersA sculpture in the Lahore Museum shows the future Buddha riding a horseAround him are depicted two of the four sights which prompted the renunciation namely old age and deathA princely figure with a halo standing in the left corner of the panel could be Maara and the wheellike object at the right upper corner could be the symbol of Universal Monarchy of which Maara apprised the future BuddhaThe scene includes symbolically a third element the role of the earth represented as a female figure emerging from the ground in enabling the future Buddha to take a last look at his city without turning backNot only do we see here the story of the Great Departure in all its traditional details but also the continuing representation of Maara as a devaputtaThe halo here is particularly suggestiveAnother fragment of a Gandhara sculpture appears to be a Great Departure panelHere again the earthgoddess emerges from the ground and bears upon her shoulders the feet of the horseThe two standing figures have been identified by Grunwedel as guardsBut there is also the likelihood that the one in front with the bow in hand is MaaraHence this panel too might be a representation of this encounterThe representation of Maara in Gandhara sculpture has been discussed at length by GrunwedelHe says Maara rarely if ever appears in Buddhist sculptures except in the representations of the temptation scene Though different sculptors may have taken their own ways of representing Maara still there was a fixed type also for this devaHe appears at a later date in full festal attire youthful in figure with bow and arrow His attributes bow and arrow and Makara suggest that there is some connection with Greek ErosHe had further attempted to identify as Maara a figure earlier considered to be Devadatta in a sculpture depicting the Kaasyapa legend which is now in the Lahore MuseumThis figure occurs in another sculpture in the Lahore Museum which depicts the hosts of MaaraAn Indianized version of the figure appears in the relief from Loriyan Tangai in the Calcutta MuseumTwo Gandhara sculptures of Maaras Assault show further developments in the treatment of the subjectIn the Mardan sculpture the characteristic posture of touching the earth in summoning it to witness has already come into existence and the defeat of Maaras host is symbolized by a crouching and a wailing figure in front of the future BuddhaThe sculpture at the Boston Fine Arts Museum depicts in great detail the symbolic crouching and falling figuresThe exact composition and details of Gandhara art with pronouncedly Indian countenances are to be found in the later sculptures of Amaravati and NagarjunikondaBut the temptation scene of Maaras daughters gradually asserts a prominence in artistic representationThe defeated hosts of Maara depicted in reduced scale crouching in front of the Buddhas seat are overshadowed by the dancing female figures in the seductive half bent poseThe finest combination of the attack by the hideous hosts of Maara and the temptation by Maaras daughters is to be found in Ajanta both in a painting in Cave and in a sculptured version in CaveApart from their artistic merits the composition has demonstrated how this could be extended to massive dimensionsExamples come from farflung places like Tunhuang in China and Dambulla and Hindagala in Sri LankaAt Dambulla the entire ceiling of the largest cave is devoted to the theme of Maaras Assault bringing together many characteristics that had been progressively incorporated in the artistic representation of this eventA curiously interesting piece of art comes from Qyzyl in Chinese TurkistanA fresco depicting how the death of the Buddha was announced to King Ajaatasattu shows a painting on cloth of major events in the Buddhas lifeOn the left upper corner is Maaras Assault represented in miniature with tremendous economy of space and figures but with a telling effectIn a tenth century fresco of Tunhuang is a highly Sinocized version of Maaras Assault but Maaras hosts have been represented as described in literatureThe two fully dressed Chinese damsels standing by the seat of the future Buddha could be two of Maaras daughtersIf they are in the process of luring the ascetic they seem to be doing so only by songThe imposing figure of a Chinese warlord standing behind them could be Maara himselfIn Borobudur we see the continuation of the Indian tradition of sculpture and the panels depicting Maaras Assault and the Temptation by Maaras daughters reflect the Lalitavistara accounts most faithfullyOf special interest is the representation of Maara with his thousand arms wielding a bowThe theme persists in Southeast AsiaFrom Angkor Thom comes a relief which depicts not an attack on the person of the future Buddha as elsewhere but a war between two armies the hosts of Maara pitted against the army of paaramitaas of the BuddhaA book cover from Nepal depicts the daughters of Maara in demure poses and a wood carving of the th century shows the future Buddha in the bhuumisparsamudraa the earthtouching posture surrounded by the hosts of MaaraIn a gradual process to abstract representation of Maaras Assault the bhuumisparsamudraa becomes a shorthand way of recalling the eventFrom Pagan comes an example where the additional element of the Temptation by Maaras daughters is portrayed discreetly on the pedestal with three dancing girls and two playing musical instrumentsPerhaps the same interpretation would apply to the Naalandaa sculpture in which three female figures on the pedestal have grotesque faces possibly suggesting the association of Maara as a yaksa or demonBut the three female figures do not appear in all casesThe Buddha statue in the earthtouching posture ultimately becomes identified as one of the Dhyaani Buddhas of the Mahaayaana tradition with the specific name Aksobhya meaning imperturbable  an instance where the quality of steadfastness which the temptations of Maara brought out in the Buddha becomes personified as a separate entityJust as the mode of presentation of the Temptation scenes underwent change over the centuries the concept of Maara too changed in the eyes of the peopleAs late as the eleventh century Sri Lankan Buddhists  as seen from a representation of vanquished and retreating Maara in the murals of the Mahiyangana Stuupa relic chamber  seemed to have considered Maara to be a devaputta a godBut as time went on he came to be depicted exactly like his hideouslooking hosts and his godlike appearance was replaced by what was traditionally ascribed to a yaksa or demonThis change is further seen on the cover of an ola book which depicts Maara not in a temptation scene but in a JaatakaThe prevalence of this concept is further attested by examples from Thailand where a picture of the Great Departure drawn in the eighteenth century represents Maara as a demonThe final evolution of Maaras transformation may perhaps be seen in the Tibetan Yamaantaka who is iconographically represented as a fierce looking demon with multiple armsThis examination reveals that the temptations of Maara as allegorical representations of the mental torment conflict and crisis experienced by the Buddha as well as his disciples are as old as Buddhism itself and the imagery could have originated in the Buddhas own graphic poetical expressionsThe early compilers of the life of the Buddha did not make a conscious effort to deal systematically with individually recorded instances of such temptationsAs such there is a fair amount of confusion as regards the nature and the timing of the related eventsEventually however the Great Departure the Victory over Maara and the Temptation by Maaras daughters came to be singled out for detailed treatment in literature and artEmbellishments and variations were freely allowed according to the writers or artists conception of the situation as the allegorical aspect was considered the more significantThe historical or factual aspect of the related events was secondary and the diversity of presentation made a definite contribution to the enrichment of both literary and artistic creativityWhat both literature and art show very clearly is that Maaras personality as conceived by Buddhist writers and artists underwent a marked change with the spread of Buddhist cultureIn India in earlier times Maara was yet a devaputta in fact the handsome God of Love with all his traditional characteristicsLater on closer to modern times in Sri Lanka Burma Thailand Cambodia and Indonesia he becomes more and more pronouncedly demonicThis analysis has been limited to those of Maaras encounters with the Buddha which have a predominant character of temptation iewhere Maara is allegorized and personifiedOther aspects of Maara as a devaputta and a personification of death await similar analysisAn effort made in this direction could be invaluable especially to answer the many questions which Malalasekera had raised in his article in the Dictionary of Paali Proper NamesThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose Edwin Arnold Light of AsiaTo those who live in lands where the teachings of the Lord Buddha have been long established the sight of a bhikkhu collecting food in the early morning is a common oneBut where the teachings are newly arrived or where bhikkhus are few the practice of giving food to wandering monks is known only by pictures or from written accountsNeither of these convey the real atmosphere of this giving and receiving to those interested in the Buddhist Way and yet live in countries where the Teaching is not the traditional form of religionEven many Buddhists living in Northern Buddhist lands may know little of pindapata for the practice of almsgathering by bhikkhus there has for various reasons which we need not here investigate been largely discontinued and the traditional practice now survives only in Southeast Asian countries practicing the Theravada Buddhist traditionThough this too is also a written account of almsgiving and collecting it is written from experience and will try to be as evocative of the atmosphere of the pindapata as possible and as many factors basic to the Buddhist way of life are involved in this simple act it is hoped that this may prove useful to all those Buddhists who are far separated from these Buddhist landsApart from his three robes a bhikkhus most prized possession is his bowlHe takes great care of it so that it may last long after eating he wipes it carefully each day to prevent it rusting always places it on a stand so that it may not fall and break and often carries it in a sling for it is heavy when full of food and may be dropped by tired handsIn doing so he carries out the Lord Buddhas injunction to practice mindfulness with regard to his bowl which has been given him by others and without which he may not collect foodPractice varies in different countries and viharasIn those viharas where meditation is practiced the bhikkhus will have arisen early sitting long in the cool darkness of the meditation hallIn the country the only sounds at this time are the night insects a frog or two perhaps a forward cockerel long anticipating the dawn and a cool wind in the trees which may blow away the everpresent mosquitoesThe quietness is at last ended as the assembled monks prostrate themselves before the Buddhaimage and clear rings out the homage to the Enlightened OneNamo tassa bhagavato arahato samma sambuddhassaTwo hours or so will have passed in this way before it is light enough to gather foodNot only must the bhikkhus allow the laywomen time to cook food they also have to consider the dangers of going out while it is yet darkIn countries where snakes centipedes and scorpions abound it is wise to be able to see the ground under ones feet and apart from this quite important fact there are the fears and suspicions of others to consider as one rather amusing incident in the Majjhima Nikaya showsA bhikkhu wandering for food while it was still dark frightened a woman who saw him in the lightning flashShe mistook him for a demon and cried out How terribleA demon is after meOnly after having robed himself correctly does the bhikkhu start upon his foodcollecting roundBoth shoulders are covered at this time for he is going among the houses and must have his body covered from the neck down to below the kneesHe may go with a senior bhikkhu in which case the latter walks in front and he follows or a novice may accompany himSometimes the samanera or a young boy following him may collect the liquid curries soups etc in a tiffincarrierSo he sets out observing good conduct in many waysPerhaps he remembers at this time the earnest injunction of the DhammapadaSometimes one sees bhikkhus following gently and quietly after an elder monk perhaps carrying his bowl for him until the first house is reached upon the almsroundThe monk does not speak unless spoken to silence being considered a part of the training during ones roundNor does he look here and there but keeps his eyes directed to the ground in front of him by so doing he practices restraint of the eyeLastly whether his round takes ten minutes or two hours he does not rush along as though anxious to get over it and be done with itThe welltrained bhikkhu walks with mindfulness steadily and dignifiedWe remember that it was the noble bearing and restraint of the Venerable Assaji one of Lord Buddhas first five disciples that deeply impressed Upatissa who shortly after become known as Venerable Sariputta the foremost among Lord Buddhas disciplesIf a bhikkhu practices meditation he will strive to keep his subject of meditation in mind while both going and comingIt is related that the Venerable Sariputta developed access concentration in the practice of lovingkindness while walking for foodcollectionAs some bhikkhus are engaged in the practice of the study rather than meditation they frequently take with them a passage of the Pali scriptures written upon a small piece of paper and mentally recite this while walkingNow that we have gathered so many facts what is the picture of pindapata likeImagine the time about six in the morningIt is still cool but there is light and bhikkhus are robing themselves in the salaIf they practice the Vinaya strictly they will go out wearing all three of their robes  none should be left behind in the monastery lest they be stolen so precious are the robesAt this same time monastery boys are scuttling about on lastminute preparations which ought to have been made on the previous dayThen when everyone is ready they set out in groups or singlyIf the vihara is in the country the little groups of monks can be seen like an orange ripple spreading out into the green countrysideSoon they are lost to sight as the roads or paths they walk upon wind between trees over canals through fields around hills or among villagesOn the morning which we describe the sun shines brightly at first a great red ball glowing upon the horizon and all is easy going under footOther days may be different with bhikkhus slithering over muddy tracks sinking deeply into black ooze and huddling beneath umbrellas which sometimes keep off some of the torrential monsoon rainsAs however this day is bright let us follow one of these bhikkhus and observe what happens upon his roundHe walks as we have described holding his bowl in its sling drawn under one hem of his upper robe and he walks until it is apparent to him that in some house which he is approaching a laysupporter wishes to offer some foodHow does he know thisOutside that house there may be a little table on which food is placed or laysupporters may have invited him to take food from their house every dayOr perhaps he just perceives a layperson coming out of the house with a tray of offeringsIf he passes such a house he may hear the word nimon called out to invite him to stop thereAny of these things we may observeWe shall also see that he stops to take food from everyone who wishes to giveA very poor person may invite him and reverently spoon out some coarse rice into his bowl at a wealthy house the donor may serve perhaps fifty or more monks every morning and they may receive the finest rice curries in little plastic bags and sweets wrapped in banana leaves  it is all the same to him and without discriminating it all goes into the same bowlLord Buddha out of his great compassion once accepted from a poor child who had nothing else to offer a handful of dust from this one learns that it is not what is given that is important but rather what is at the heart of the givingBut before we proceed we shall notice a very curious thingHere is man without any other means of getting food and yet he makes no effort to attract the attention of anyoneQuite the contrary he undertakes to train himself in a rule of conduct which forbids him to make any sound while he goes among the houses If he comes to a house where a regular supporter of his lives or where he knows that food is to be offered he just stands in silence neither does he cough nor stamp his feet and unlike many other ascetic orders originating in India he may not carry any musical instrument or sing as they do to attract attentionThis is a time for cultivating patience a virtue which in the Buddhist training finds its highest expression in the perfection of patienceHe may wait for many minutes before anyone sees him or he may decide that no one is giving him anything that day and go his wayIt happens sometimes that a bhikkhu who patiently waits gets nothing at allIt even happened at least once to Lord Buddha and a little story from modern times will emphasize thisThere was a young bhikkhu newly come to Bangkok some years agoHe knew no one he had no supporters on the first morningHe went out from the monastery where he was staying and walked through the streets to gather food  with hundreds of other bhikkhus from the monasteries aroundHe received nothingHe went back to his kuti and practiced meditationThe second morning he went out again received nothing and again spent the day in meditation perhaps consoling himself with the words of the BuddhaThe third day feeling a little weak he passed silently through the streets and at one house he was given a bananaAnd that was allHe came back to his monastery and saw there a starving dogOpening his bowl he gave half the banana to the dogBut bananas are not fare for dogs  even starving ones  and having sniffed it it limped disdainfully awayThe young bhikkhu reached out his hand to take that rejected half back into his bowl Then he paused remembering that when a bhikkhu has given something to someone it must be returned into his hands by a layman  and there was no layman in sightThe bhikkhu closed his bowl and went into his kuti where he ate his half of the banana washing it down with a good draught of waterThe next day his patience and compassion were rewarded and thereafter someone offered him food every dayWhen Mara closed peoples hearts against giving food to him Lord Buddha spoke the following famous verse from the Dhammapada showing his power to obtain spiritual food from meditationThe bhikkhu of whom we have spoken also practiced meditation and later become a famous teacher and a founder of a new school of meditation in BangkokHe has but recently passed awayTo come back after this little digression to our bhikkhu on pindapataWe shall notice perhaps with surprise that he is treated with great respect by the laypeoplePerhaps only yesterday he was a layman himself yet today shorn barefoot in orange robes and bowl in hand he is reverenced by those who serve himPeople passing him may stop crouch down and raise their hands to their foreheads in reverence others may walk past him the hands reverentially raised while laymen and laywomen who wish to give him food squat down raise their hands in worship before offering to him whatever they have preparedSeeing this one might ask why they did it and why do they regard him so highlyThe skeptical man of this materialistic age might indeed ask what all this fuss is aboutHe might say Here is this beggar who does no work contributes no material gain to society and yet people treat him as though he was a god walking in their midst In saying this he would be right for Buddhist monks in these countries are beggars in the sense that they depend for their sustenance on others moreover the word by which they are known is derived from the root bhik whence bhikkhati  to beg for foodThey would also be correct in their limited assessment of his worth to society as he does not indeed increase the societys material wealthAgainst such a materialistic approach born of conceit an ancient verse might be quoted and then two relevant considerations regarding this chargeThe first consideration must be to stress again that a bhikkhu does not beg as do ordinary beggars but passes on silently collecting offered food and secondly it is a narrow system of thought indeed that assesses a mans worth by material gain aloneThe Bhikkhu is treated with reverence simply because he offers to others an example by his own pure conductHe shows the way to deliverance and if all cannot follow his example completely and lay off the cares of the world then there can be many who may profit from seeing his life and listening to his adviceHe is thus highly regarded as one who is striving for deliverance from suffering for that supreme bliss which is NibbanaTo attain this it is emphasized all through the Buddhist tradition that renunciation is essentialThus he is worshipped as an example of renunciation one who has given up worldly pleasures and comforts given up family attachments and one who tries to make the greatest renunciation  that of the cravingandignorance complexIndeed Lord Buddhas words in the Dhammapada have a deep truth in themSuch are some of the paths which thought might take as we witness a householder give food to himFollowing the scene before us we see that the laysupporter has raised the bowl of food to be given to her forehead and remains thus for halfaminute or soWhile doing this she is making some fervent wish or vow that the good merit which accrues to her by this beneficent act shall result in some particular blessing  health wealth family or those who think further the attainment of heavenly states or higher still the end of rebirth  the unsurpassed peace of NibbanaThe food is placed in the bowl by the supporter and while this is taking place the bhikkhu does not look to see who is giving him foodWe notice that with senses wellcontrolled he keeps his eyed fixed upon the open bowl and is not inclined to speak to lay people unless they ask him somethingIn this way his mind is not disturbed by the sight of the members of the opposite sex or any other desirearousing objectThe same applies to Buddhist nuns when they go out for the collection though very few of them do soThe writer observed in Bangkok a few nuns who wearing the dark cloth indicating a meditative life walk on pindapata with great dignity and evident sincerityThey of course are concerned to avoid the sight of menThis is one practical application of the step of Buddhist training called restraint of sensesThe food having being placed in his bowl the laysupporter may as the monk is turning to go on his way reverence him againOn his part the bhikkhu feels no elation at reverence nor distress if such salutation is not performed for in the Buddhist teaching reverence is a skillful act and profits him who performs itFurther as we are within earshot we may be surprised by another fact the bhikkhu utters no thanks for his foodHe goes as silently as he arrives and from what we see it appears indeed as though the laysupporters feel more disposed to thank him for having taken the food from their handsAs we follow our bhikkhu this matter may give us further food for thought  until he reaches another house where we can again observe what takes placeWhy then does the bhikkhu offer no thanks for what he has receivedThe answer to this lies in an understanding of the Buddhist teaching regarding meritMerit is acquired by the performance of skillful actionAn example of such an action which is easy for all to practice is givingIndeed this too is not only a perfection in the highest ranges of Buddhist practice but is the first among all the ten perfections the perfection of givingSo deeply is giving felt to be an essential for the beginning of the holy life that it stands first also in the triad of practices so often recommended for the Buddhist laity and the bhikkhu practices it by giving to other bhikkhus and to laypeople the gift of Teaching which is the highestTo give opens the heart and is manifestly opposed to the worldly way to get The latter is linked to attachment while the former is generosity and close to renunciationThus thanks for giving lie in the very act itself and the householder is happy that the bhikkhu has given him the opportunity to giveThe merit which one gets from giving is really not a possession which ensures a good birth in the future etc but a change in heart a raising in the level of skillful consciousness so that one performs and rejoices in performing skillful actsThis of course does have its effectA little family group stands outside the house an old lady a young lady perhaps her daughter and two small boys one of whom is only just old enough to toddleThey cry out joyfully and loud enough for all the neighborhood to hear The bhikkhu has come The mother of the house balances a tray on her knees as she crouches down her daughter reverences likewise while the small boys each have to be restrained from running towards the bhikkhu in order to give him something  so great is their desire to do soThe bhikkhu opens his bowl and bends down so that the elder of the little boys can give a little bowl of riceThis having been successfully engineered into the bowl the bhikkhu smilesNow the smaller boy reaches up to place curry in a plastic bag into the bowl even this is successful and he manages this without falling over which indeed he came close to doingThen without prompting he raises two podgy hands in the direction of his forehead and toddles unsteadily back to the girlThe elder one however is rather boisterous and has forgotten this bit of trainingThen that monk says to him for his good Wai phra  Salute the bhikkhu  and the boy laughingly gently dutifully raises his handsThe people of the house who have invited him to take food from them every day then inquire from him when there will be a preaching at the vihara and where the teacher is nowHaving learned suchlike matters which take but a minute for the bhikkhu to relate they invite him as he goes on his way to come again on the morrow  and the little boys call out again and again Come againCome againThe bhikkhu goes on his way the sun rises higher and it begins to be a little warmHis next donor is nearby and he walks slowly to give her time to come from her little houseWe see him suddenly step rather wide and not until we are up to that place do we see why he did soAcross the road there march in milling millions an army of ants and quite apart from the undesirability of being bitten by this species the bhikkhus must go barefoot for pindapata  their way of training instructs them to practice harmlessnessThat is never to take life intentionally and to be as careful as possible so as not to kill even without intentionIn the Dhammapada we read one of Lord Buddhas beautiful versesAn old old woman bent with age and hard work totters out from her little cabin to invite him to receiveIt is true that she need not exert herself in this way for she has a younger woman living with her but she desires as her life grows shorter and death comes nearer to give to a bhikkhu every day and so pile up as much merit as she may in the short time left to herShe lives by the side of a little canal and makes a perilous living by rotting down fish in water and salt and so producing the ubiquitous fishwater which is used as sauce and source of salt by many ThaisLeaning on a stick she brings her thin toilworn hands shakily upwards while her face bronzed by the sun and wrinkled in a thousand places reflects a serene devotionShe carries an old and rusty tin out of which she ladles some of her fishwaterAs silently as he opened his bowl to receive her offering so silently he closes it as she turns now happy towards her doorLord Buddha has saidWe follow again as he goes on his way to the right of the roadThere is at this point a low area of marshy swamp in which grow tall sedgesIt is rather surprising therefore to see the bhikkhu apparently step into this swamp and yet go forward freelyThe mystery is soon resolved as we see a singleplank gangway in front of us which will carry the wary walker some two hundred yards across to further sideThe bhikkhu has already gone far along the planks carefully picking his way and so there is nothing else to do but to follow himGingerly we set out the sixinch wide plank swaying and bending with our weight it seems very likely that at any moment we may be precipitated into the ooze beneathHere is indeed a time for mindfulnessWe manage the hazard wellenough  it is perhaps more a matter of good luck than judgment  and when at last we raise our eyes from the gangway the bhikkhu is almost out of sightHowever we manage to catch up with him just in time to see that he entered the courtyard gate of a big houseEvidently he is invited to take food here each day indeed he has already been invited to sit down for a few minutesWe watch the monk and his supporters through the open gateThe compound lying inside this gate seems to be a very large one and at least three good sized houses are visible interspersed by lawns trees courtyards and such decorative features as some hundreds of orchids growing hung up in little pots or great glazed blueandwhite Chinese waterjars and in them water lilies floweringThe bhikkhu sits in a little summerhouse and before him is placed a table upon which are three trays with little bowls of rice and various fruits with unknown foods done up in bananaleavesMeanwhile a crowd of bhikkhus has gatheredWe did not notice them come but now they stand silently waitingA young man carries a stout table and places it outside the gate where the other bhikkhus are standing and comes back shortly afterwards staggering under the weight of a huge bowl of steaming riceAn elderly lady in the traditional dress follows him carrying a large tray stacked high with oranges and bananaleaf packetsA bhikkhu is standing near us and so we ask him quietly whose house this isOh he says this house belongs to one of the noble families closely related to the kingEvery day they give food to about eighty monksWe watch this general almsgiving in progressEach bhikkhu approaches the table when the one before has already leftEverything is very orderly and each bhikkhu is obviously very careful to avoid jumping his turnYoung bhikkhus and samaneras are seen to invite elder monks to take their food first courtesy and care are observed by allThe rice spooned out into bowl after bowl grows less and the numbers of waiting monks dwindle but the lady householder seems happier and happier with every spoonful she givesThe monks silently go  old theras of many years standing go slowly while little samaneras scarcely four feet high or twelve years old make off at a good speedOur attention now reverts to our bhikkhuHe has been seated the while and offered a glass of coffeeA lady sits at a respectful distance upon the summerhouse floor while her small daughter wanders aboutShe has been asking him some problem regarding the teaching and he has briefly repliedShe gets up and invites him saying nimonAs it is her daughters birthday the lady holds the tray of offerings while the little girl places the rice and various foods into his bowlThus the small girl has earned great merit upon this dayIndeed it is common in Buddhist lands to give on the day of ones birth and whatever the giving may be the birthday is thought an excellent occasion for meritmakingThose who cannot afford or somehow just do not give on other days usually make a point of offering to a monk or monks pindapata on the day of their own or their childrens birthThe elder lady having finished her giving at the gate now comes and salutes the bhikkhuShe provides him with food from another trayThe young man her gardener offers yet another while just as the bhikkhu is preparing to depart a cry of nimon halts him as another member of this manybranched family comes up with his offeringWith a bowl now become heavy but we hope a little refreshed by the coffee the bhikkhu goes on his way the elder lady of the house inviting him to come again on the morrowThe last house on his round obviously also belongs to an affluent familyHe waits as they have promised foodLocked gate and wide lawns separate the family from the roadside and they do not see him as easily as his other patronsAt last someone spots him and sings out the monk has come The householders here do not come to the door but send who are possibly their son and daughter with foodThey are both near to grownup and perhaps with less understanding of their teaching than they ought to haveAt any rate they are rather careless the boy while opening their big gates drops a banana or two on the ground which they wipe before offering while the girl tipping rice into the bowl in a lackadaisical fashion manages to empty half of it on the groundThey chatter while doing this and then prance offIt seems that they do this as though it was all rather a drudgeThe bhikkhu carefully removes the rice grains from his robes and from his bowlsling so that they do not become soiled and starts back on his long walk to the monasteryHe passes down the whole road of rich mens houses but there is nothingHe does not care for he has more than enough to keep him going enough medicine to allay the disease of hunger for another dayStill we note that those who give most are if not poor people at least those in the middle ranges of incomeRiches alas do not usually lead to great generosityIt is the poor and those moderately welloff who give generouslyToo many of the rich are too much sunk into the supposed comforts of this world to think overmuch of givingLord Buddha has taught them with the following word of warningBut those who know the sting of poverty know also a way to rid themselves of this stingBy giving however little it is they may attain to greater wealth in future than they possess now  and greater happiness tooOne of the factors which governs the lack or possession of wealth is what one had done with money when one had itIf one misuses it for others pain squanders it all upon fleeting pleasures or only amasses a great collection of status symbols about oneself  then in a future life one is very liable to meet with poverty and misery which this entailsThe results of action are so Buddhism teaches very just indeedThose who give however are assured of receiving so that all that must be decided is how and what should one giveBesides occasional giving there are gifts made to the SanghaAccording to a wellknown passage in the Pali scriptures the bhikkhus are anuttaram puññakkhettam lokassati  The supreme field of merit in the world All this is summed up as followsNow again occasionally bhikkhus require robes dwellings or medicines but every day they walk out for foodcollectingTherefore this is a great opportunity to gain merit which should not be missed for all whether poor or rich can do with more meritThere is indeed nothing like merits made in this way for ensuring a happy life a peaceful death and a blissful life hereafterLord Buddha has saidThis is obviously one reason why people give to the bhikkhu who passes their doors  and it is a very important reasonThe skeptic might butt in objecting that the motive for that giving is very selfish  to make oneself happy in futureBut then he must be told that it is possible in Buddhism by means of goodwill and compassion to make over ones merits for the good of othersThus a mother might make merit by giving food etc for her childrens happiness or recovery from sicknessOr a king may make merit turning this over to the welfare of his peopleAnd expressions of utterly selfless  indeed universal  benevolence are by no means rare among the meritdedications of quite ordinary folk while the unlimited compassion of the wisdom beings is expressed in many sublime engravings and writingsWith the merit which such a one piles up he vows to lighten beings innumerable and to deliver all from the woes of continued existenceHowever few aspire so high their reasons for giving are correspondingly less exalted though nevertheless they may be deeply religiousFor instance many laypeople give out of great devotion to their religionSometimes too a particularly esteemed bhikkhu may be the object of this great devotionThen there are gifts to relatives who are now bhikkhus for in the country a bhikkhu may live in his own village temple and pass his former house and relatives oftenNaturally they give to himThen there are those who give out of habit or from conventionOne sometimes comes across cases of this such giving being no longer accompanied by the warmth of devotion tends to become mechanicalIt is quite easy to understand that in this case the merit from giving is decidedly lessLastly comes a category of giving which hardly applies to our present subject grudged givingFrom this and from giving for commercial advantage  purely selfish this  come the least amount of meritThe attitude of Why should I give something which really means  What do I get out of it  is hardly found in Buddhist landsWhere the Buddhist Teaching has distinctly taught that deliberate actions are liable to give rise to results even those who have little knowledge of the heights of Buddhist philosophy will readily understand that the results of giving is happinessThe writer was once asked if people who give much and often but nevertheless came across disasters and grief in their lives would lose faith and thereafter cease to giveBut the Buddhist reaction is not thusDisasters and grief do not arise causelessly nor yet from one cause but they are often attributed more soundly it would seem to misdeeds committed in the past  if not in this life then in the individuals past existencesHence a Buddhist thinks that such misdeeds can only come to fruition if conditions are suitable which is more likely to be when one has but little a storehouse of meritTherefore to cure this lamentable circumstance the answer is to give more and give more often rather than neglecting to giveThis connection between knowledge and generosity is illumined by a verse in the DhammapadaAnd again on this subject we findAnd so we have now followed the bhikkhu back to his monasteryHe is perhaps a little footsore and if his bowl is full his shoulder may ache and his hands and arms also if he uses no sling for the bowlMemories arise at this point of having seen in some book a writer complaining of the size of a bhikkhus bowl  as though to imply that they were greedyThis is far from the truthFirstly a bhikkhus bowl has to be reasonably large to accommodate all the food that people wish to give himWe should not forget that laysupporters wish to make their merit each day and that a very small bowl would mean that he would have to refuse their offeringsSecondly a bowl may be really large if the bhikkhu to whom it belongs goes wandering on foot staying in caves mountain fastness or forestHis bowl is then his suitcase and in it must be packed the very few items which he can easily take along with himBack to the monastery the food that all have collected is shared by all and the bhikkhu himself makes a little merit by offering something choice from his bowl to his teacher usually an elder monk and also by seeing that those who have collected little food that day  and such is the fate of many samaneras  have sufficient fareHe practices thus one method of promoting lovingkindness among his fellowmonks  that is the sharing of the contents of even an alms bowlIn the monasteries where meditation is practiced it is common to undertake also the ascetic practicesIn such monasteries therefore the monks take only one meal at about eight in the morning immediately after returning from pindapataTheir almsfood is shared with the monasteryboys and anyone else who cares to eatNo one need starve or be without a meal in a Buddhist country  one has only to go to a monastery and some sort of food will be availableAs for the monks  bhikkhus or samanera  if they have undertaken the dhutangas they mix all their food together determining just how much will be suitable for them and then apply the meditation on the loathsomeness of food which prevents the arising of greedIt is eaten in silence so as to maintain this concentrationAnd when fingers have scooped enough of this medicine into the mouth monasteryboys will be happy with remaining delicacies while the mixture still unconsumed will feed the animals which have taken refuge in the vihara grounds away from the harshness of worldlingsThus none of this precious food is wastedIn all ways there are benefits to be seen for all  for the donors who give there is merit for the bhikkhus who take there is support and for many other beings there is good foodThis little description of pindapata and its virtues may be fittingly brought to an end with another verse expressing wherein lies the taste of truthMay all beings wheresoever they be taste of this truthIf the preceding account sounds somewhat idyllic readers should realize that it is because the writer has happened to describe a combination of fortunate experiences in fine weather where houses are abundant where more prosperous people dwell where these donors are not too distant from the vihara where land is flat and paths are good and so forthThe reverse of such conditions will make the bhikkhus almsround more difficult as does the pouring rain during the monsoon seasonMore hazards still would confront the bhikkhu who sets out to get his food in a nonBuddhist countryAs in Lord Buddhas days he would experience some difficultiesBut this although interesting is another storyLord Buddha himself ignored the artificial barriers of caste distinction when he walked for pindapataHe took  and his monks still take  food from all regardless of their social statusAll men have the right to practice giving if they wish to do so and to reap the merits deriving therefromThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard

past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAnicca vata sankhara  Impermanent alas are all formations  is the phrase used in Theravada Buddhist lands to announce the death of a loved one but I have not quoted this line here in order to begin an obituaryI do so simply to introduce the subject of this essay which is the word sankhara itselfSometimes a single Pali word has such rich implications that merely to sit down and draw them out can shed as much light on the Buddhas teaching as a long expository articleThis is indeed the case with the word sankharaThe word stands squarely at the heart of the Dhamma and to trace its various strands of meaning is to get a glimpse into the Buddhas own vision of realityThe word sankhara is derived from the prefix sam meaning together joined to the noun kara doing making Sankharas are thus codoings things that act in concert with other things or things that are made by a combination of other thingsTranslators have rendered the word in many different ways formations confections activities processes forces compounds compositions fabrications determinations synergies constructionsAll are clumsy attempts to capture the meaning of a philosophical concept for which we have no exact parallel and thus all English renderings are bound to be impreciseI myself use formations and volitional formations aware this choice is as defective as any otherHowever though it is impossible to discover an exact English equivalent for sankhara by exploring its actual usage we can still gain insight into how the word functions in the thought world of the DhammaIn the suttas the word occurs in three major doctrinal contextsOne is in the twelvefold formula of dependent origination where the sankharas are the second link in the seriesThey are said to be conditioned by ignorance and to function as a condition for consciousnessPutting together statements from various suttas we can see that the sankharas are the kammically active volitions responsible for generating rebirth and thus for sustaining the onward movement of samsara the round of birth and deathIn this context sankhara is virtually synonymous with kamma a word to which it is etymologically akinThe suttas distinguish the sankharas active in dependent origination into three types bodily verbal and mentalAgain the sankharas are divided into the meritorious demeritorious and imperturbable ie the volitions present in the four formless meditationsWhen ignorance and craving underlie our stream of consciousness our volitional actions of body speech and mind become forces with the capacity to produce results and of the results they produce the most significant is the renewal of the stream of consciousness following deathIt is the sankharas propped up by ignorance and fueled by craving that drive the stream of consciousness onward to a new mode of rebirth and exactly where consciousness becomes established is determined by the kammic character of the sankharasIf one engages in meritorious deeds the sankharas or volitional formations will propel consciousness toward a happy sphere of rebirthIf one engages in demeritorious deeds the sankharas will propel consciousness toward a miserable rebirthAnd if one masters the formless meditations these imperturbable sankharas will propel consciousness toward rebirth in the formless realmsA second major domain where the word sankharas applies is among the five aggregatesThe fourth aggregate is the sankharakhandha the aggregate of volitional formationsThe texts define the sankharakhandha as the six classes of volition volition regarding forms sounds smells tastes tactile objects and ideasThough these sankharas correspond closely to those in the formula of dependent origination the two are not in all respects the same for the sankharakhandha has a wider rangeThe aggregate of volitional formations comprises all kinds of volitionIt includes not merely those that are kammically potent but also those that are kammic results and those that are kammically inoperativeIn the later Pali literature the sankharakhandha becomes an umbrella category for all the factors of mind except feeling and perception which are assigned to aggregates of their ownThus the sankharakhandha comes to include such ethically variable factors as contact attention thought and energy such wholesome factors as generosity kindness and wisdom and such unwholesome factors as greed hatred and delusionSince all these factors arise in conjunction with volition and participate in volitional activity the early Buddhist teachers decided that the most fitting place to assign them is the aggregate of volitional formationsThe third major domain in which the word sankhara occurs is as a designation for all conditioned thingsIn this context the word has a passive derivation denoting whatever is formed by a combination of conditions whatever is conditioned constructed or compoundedIn this sense it might be rendered simply formations without the qualifying adjectiveAs bare formations sankharas include all five aggregates not just the fourthThe term also includes external objects and situations such as mountains fields and forests towns and cities food and drink jewelry cars and computersThe fact that sankharas can include both active forces and the things produced by them is highly significant and secures for the term its role as the cornerstone of the Buddhas philosophical visionFor what the Buddha emphasizes is that the sankharas in the two active senses  the volitional formations operative in dependent origination and the kammic volitions in the fourth aggregate  construct the sankharas in the passive sense They construct the conditioned therefore they are called volitional formationsAnd what are the conditioned things they constructThey construct the body feeling perception volitional formations and consciousness therefore they are called volitional formationsThough external inanimate things may arise from purely physical causes the sankharas that make up our personal being  the five aggregates  are all products of the kammically active sankharas that we engaged in our previous livesIn the present life as well the five aggregates are constantly being maintained refurbished and extended by the volitional activity we engage in now which again becomes a condition for future existenceThus the Buddha teaches it was our own kammically formative sankharas that built up our present edifice of personal being and it is our present formative sankharas that are now building up the edifices of personal being we will inhabit in our future livesThese edifices consist of nothing other than sankharas as conditioned things the conditioned formations comprised in the five aggregatesThe most important fact to understand about sankharas as conditioned formations is that they are all impermanent Impermanent alas are formations They are impermanent not only in the sense that in their gross manifestations they will eventually come to an end but even more pointedly because at the subtle subliminal level they are constantly undergoing rise and fall forever coming into being and then in a split second breaking up and perishing Their very nature is to arise and vanish For this reason the Buddha declares that all sankharas are suffering  suffering however not because they are all actually painful and stressful but because they are stamped with the mark of transienceHaving arisen they then cease and because they all cease they cannot provide stable happiness and securityTo win complete release from suffering  not only from experiencing suffering but from the unsatisfactoriness intrinsic to all conditioned existence  we must gain release from sankharasAnd what lies beyond the sankharas is that which is not constructed not put together not compoundedThis is Nibbana accordingly called the Unconditioned  asankhata  the opposite of what is sankhata a word which is the passive participle corresponding to sankharaNibbana is called the Unconditioned precisely because its a state that is neither itself a sankhara nor constructed by sankharas a state described as visankhara devoid of formations and as sabbasankharasamatha the stilling of all formationsThus when we put the word sankhara under our microscope we see compressed within it the entire worldview of the DhammaThe active sankharas consisting in kammically active volitions perpetually create the sankhara of the five aggregates that constitute our beingAs long as we continue to identify with the five aggregates and to seek enjoyment in them we go on spewing out the volitional formations that build up future combinations of aggregatesJust that is the nature of samsara an unbroken procession of empty but efficient sankharas producing still other sankharas riding up in fresh waves with each new birth swelling to a crest and then crashing down into old age illness and deathYet on it goes shrouded in the delusion that were really in control sustained by an evertantalizing ever receding hope of final satisfactionWhen however we take up the practice of the Dhamma we apply a brake to this relentless generation of sankharasWe learn to see the true nature of the sankharas of our own five aggregates as unstable conditioned processes rolling on with no one in chargeThereby we switch off the engine driven by ignorance and craving and the process of kammic construction the production of active sankharas is effectively deconstructedBy putting an end to the constructing of conditioned reality we open the door to what is everpresent but not constructed not conditioned the asankhatadhatu the unconditioned elementThis is Nibbana the Deathless the stilling of volitional activities the final liberation from all conditioned formations and thus from impermanence and deathTherefore our verse concludes The subsiding of formations is blissfulThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAjaan Fuang Jotiko my teacher was born in to a small farming family in the province of Chanthaburi near the Cambodian border of southeastern ThailandOrphaned at the age of eleven he was raised in a series of monasteries and received ordination as a monk when he turned twentyAs he began to study the monastic discipline though he realized that the monks of his monastery were not really serious about practicing the Buddhas teachings and he longed to find a teacher who would give him a training more in line with what he had readHis chance came during his second year as a monk when Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo a member of the forest ascetic tradition founded by Ajaan Mun Bhuridatto came to set up a meditation monastery in an old cemetery just outside of ChanthaburiTaken with Ajaan Lees teachings Ajaan Fuang reordained in the sect to which Ajaan Lee belonged and joined him at his new monasteryFrom that point onward with few exceptions he spent every Rains Retreat under Ajaan Lees guidance until the latters death inOne of the exceptions was a fiveyear period he spent during World War II meditating alone in the forests of northern ThailandAnother was a sixyear period in the early fifties when Ajaan Lee left Ajaan Fuang in charge of the Chanthaburi monastery and wandered about various parts of Thailand in preparation for finding a place to settle down near BangkokWhen in Ajaan Lee founded Wat Asokaram his new monastery near Bangkok Ajaan Fuang joined him there to help in what was to be the last major project of Ajaan Lees lifeAfter Ajaan Lees death Ajaan Fuang was generally expected to become abbot at Wat AsokaramThe monastery by that time though had grown into such a large unwieldy community that he did not want the positionSo in when the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand in residence at Wat Makut Kasatriyaram in Bangkok asked him to spend the Rains Retreat at his temple to teach meditation to him and to any of the other monks at the temple who were interested Ajaan Fuang jumped at the chanceHe spent a total of three Rains Retreats at Wat Makut wandering about the countryside looking for solitude during the dry seasonsAlthough he had immense respect for the Supreme Patriarch as an individual he grew tired of the politicking he saw at the higher ecclesiastical levels and so began looking for a way outIt came in when a woman named Khun Nai Sombuun Ryangrit donated land to the Patriarch for a small monastery in a mountainous region near the coast of Rayong province not far from ChanthaburiAjaan Fuang volunteered to spend time at the new monastery Wat Dhammasathit until a permanent abbot could be foundThe monastery though was in a very poor area where the local people were not enthusiastic about the idea of a strict meditation monastery in their midst so no one could be found to take on the position of abbotThus shortly before the Supreme Patriarchs death in a car accident in Ajaan Fuang accepted the position of abbot at Wat Dhammasathit himselfIt was soon after this that I first met him in April ofWat Dhammasathit had the look of a summer camp down on its luck three monks living in three small huts a leanto where they would eat their meals a kitchen with room for a couple of nuns and a small wooden structure on top of the hill  where I stayed  which had a view of the sea off to the southThe land had been donated shortly after a fire had stripped it of all its vegetation and the hillsides were covered mostly with cogon grassYearly fires still swept through the area preventing trees from taking hold although the area on the mountain above the monastery was covered with a thick malarial forestIn spite of the poor conditions Ajaan Fuang seemed to have a cleareyed downtoearth wisdom that allowed him to transcend his surroundings  an inner peace happiness and stability that I envied and admiredAfter spending a few months practicing meditation under his guidance I returned to America and then found my way back to Thailand in the fall of to be ordained as a monk and to begin training under him in earnestIn my absence he had begun to develop a small but devoted following of lay meditatorsIn early the new abbot of Wat Makut had invited him back to teach there on a regular basis and for the rest of his life  until his death in  he split his time evenly between Bangkok and RayongMost of his students came from the professional classes of Bangkok people who were turning to meditation for spiritual strength and solace in the face of the fastchanging pressures of modern Thai urban societyDuring my first years back in Rayong the monastery was an incredibly quiet and secluded place with only a handful of monks and almost no visitorsFire lanes had begun to hold the fires in check and a new forest was developingThe quiet atmosphere began to change though in the fall of when construction began on a chedi at the top of the hillBecause the chedi was being built almost entirely with volunteer labor everyone was involved  monks laypeople from Bangkok and local villagersAt first I resented the disruption of the monasterys quiet routine but I began to notice something interesting People who never would have thought of meditating were happy to help with the weekend construction brigades during breaks in the work when the regulars would go practice meditation with Ajaan Fuang the newcomers would join in and soon they too would become regular meditators as wellIn the meantime I began learning the important lesson of how to meditate in the midst of less than ideal conditionsAjaan Fuang himself told me that although he personally disliked construction work there were people he had to help and this was the only way he could get to themSoon after the chedi was finished in work began on a large Buddha image that was to have an ordination hall in its base and again as work progressed on the image more and more people who came to help with the work were drawn to meditationAjaan Fuangs health deteriorated steadily in his later yearsA mild skin condition he had developed during his stay at Wat Makut grew into a fullblown case of psoriasis and no medicine  Western Thai or Chinese  could offer a cureStill he maintained an exhausting teaching schedule although he rarely gave sermons to large groups of peopleInstead he preferred to teach on an individual basisHis favorite way of getting people started in meditation was to meditate together with them guiding them through the initial rough spots and then have them meditate more and more on their own making way for new beginnersEven during his worst attacks of psoriasis he would have time to instruct people on a personal basisAs a result his following  though relatively small compared to that of Ajaan Lee and other famous meditation teachers  was intensely loyalIn May a few days after the Buddha image was completed but before the ordination hall in its base was finished Ajaan Fuang flew to Hong Kong to visit a student who had set up a meditation center thereSuddenly on the morning of May while he was sitting in meditation he suffered a heart attackThe student called an ambulance as soon as he realized what had happened but Ajaan Fuang was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospitalBecause he had requested a few years earlier that his body not be cremated plans began immediately to build him a mausoleumI was given the task of assembling his biography and any taperecorded talks that might be transcribed and published as a commemorative volumeI found to my amazement that I knew more about his life than anyone elseThe people with whom he had lived when he was younger had either died or grown so old that their memories were failing themAll of a sudden the anecdotes he had told me during my first years back with him  of his youth and his years with Ajaan Lee  became the substance of his biographyHow much I probably missed given the fact that my abilities in Thai and familiarity with Thai culture were still developing was disconcerting to think aboutEven more disconcerting was to discover how little of his teachings were left for posterityOrdinarily he refused to let people taperecord his instructions as he maintained that his teachings were intended for the people listening to put into practice right then and there and might be wrong for other people at other stages in their practiceThe few tapes that were made came from simple introductory talks that he gave to firsttime visitors who had come to give a group donation to the monastery or to people who were just getting started in meditationNothing of a more advanced nature was on tapeSo after we printed the commemorative volume I started a project of my own writing down what I could remember of his teachings and interviewing his other students for similar materialThe interviewing took more than two years and involved a fair amount of editing to extract teachings that would be helpful for people in general and would work in a written formatThe result was a small book entitled The Language of the HeartThen shortly before I returned to the States to help start a monastery in California another Ajaan Fuang tape was found a sermon in which he was giving more advanced instructions to one of his studentsI transcribed it and arranged to have it printed as a small booklet named Transcendent DiscernmentThe book you are holding in your hand is drawn from these three booksMost of the material comes from The Language of the Heart although parts of that book had to be cut either because they referred to incidents peculiar to Thai culture or because the puns and wordplay made them untranslatableAjaan Fuang loved playing with language  his sense of humor was one of the first things that attracted me to him  and many of his memorable sayings were memorable for just that reasonUnfortunately most of these passages lose their impact on translation and the explanations they would require might quickly become tedious so I have omitted nearly all of them leaving in a few  such as the litter story  to give a taste of his way with wordsIn addition to the passages from The Language of the Heart I have included almost all of Transcendent Discernment along with highlights from the commemorative volumeNot everything is a straight translation from these books for in some cases I have had to retell the anecdotes to make them more accessible to a Western readerI have been careful throughout though to translate the message of Ajaan Fuangs own words as exactly as possibleIn putting this book together I have had the opportunity to reflect on the studentteacher relationship as it exists in Thailand and in Ajaan Fuangs dealings with his disciples both lay and ordainedHe provided an atmosphere of warmth and respect in which his students could discuss with him the particular problems of their lives and minds without being made to feel like patients or clients but simply as fellow human beings to whom he was offering a solid reference point for their livesSince coming to the West I find that this sort of relationship is sadly lacking among us and I hope that as Buddhism becomes established here this sort of relationship will become established as well for the sake of the mental and spiritual health of our society as a wholeA group of Thai people once asked me what was the most amazing thing I had ever encountered in Ajaan Fuang hoping that I would mention his mindreading abilities or other supernatural powersAlthough there were those  his knowledge of my mind seemed uncanny  I told them that what I found most amazing was his kindness and humanity In all our years together he had never made me feel that I was a Westerner or that he was a ThaiOur communication was always on a direct persontoperson level that bypassed cultural differencesI know that many of his other students although they would not have phrased the issue quite this way sensed the same quality in himI offer this book as a way of sharing some of what I learned from Ajaan Fuang and dedicate it with deepest respect to his memoryHe once told me that if it hadnt been for Ajaan Lee he would never have known the brightness of lifeI owe the same debt to himNote For this new revised edition I have reinstated the section entitled Merit most of which was omitted from the first edition in Normally Ajaan Fuang was a man of few words who spoke in response to circumstances If the circumstances warranted it he could give long detailed explanationsIf not hed say only a word or two  or sometimes nothing at allHe held by Ajaan Lees dictum If youre going to teach the Dhamma to people but theyre not intent on listening or not ready for what you have to say then no matter how fantastic the Dhamma youre trying to teach it still counts as idle chatter because it doesnt serve any purposeI was constantly amazed at his willingness  sometimes eagerness  to teach meditation even when he was illHe explained to me once If people are really intent on listening I find that Im intent on teaching and no matter how much I have to say it doesnt tire me outIn fact I usually end up with more energy than when I startedBut if theyre not intent on listening then I get worn out after the second or third wordBefore you say anything ask yourself whether its necessary or notIf its not dont say itThis is the first step in training the mind  for if you cant have any control over your mouth how can you expect to have any control over your mindSometimes his way of being kind was to be cross  although he had his own way of doing itHe never raised his voice or used harsh language but still his words could burn right into the heartOnce I commented on this fact and asked him Why is it that when your words hurt they go right to the heartHe answered Thats so youll rememberIf words dont hit home with the person listening they dont hit home with the person speaking eitherIn being cross with his students hed take his cue from how earnest the student wasThe more earnest the more critical hed be with the thought that this sort of student would use his words to best effectOnce a lay student of his  who didnt understand this point  was helping to look after him when he was ill in BangkokEven though she tried her best to attend to his needs he was constantly criticizing her to the point where she was thinking of leaving himIt so happened though that another lay student came to visit and Ajaan Fuang said in a passing remark to him When a teacher criticizes his students its for one of two reasons either to make them stay or to make them goThe first student on overhearing this suddenly understood and so decided to stay A story that Ajaan Fuang liked to tell  with his own twist  was the Jataka tale of the turtle and the swansOnce there were two swans who liked to stop by a certain pond every day for a drink of waterAs time passed they struck up a friendship with a turtle who lived in the pond and they started telling him about some of the many things they saw while flying around up in the airThe turtle was fascinated with their stories but after a while began to feel very depressed because he knew hed never have a chance to see the great wide world the way the swans didWhen he mentioned this to them they said Why thats no problem at allWell find a way to take you up with us So they got a stickThe male swan took one end of the stick in his mouth the female took the other end in hers and they had the turtle hold on with its mouth to the middleWhen everything was ready they took offAs they flew up into the sky the turtle got to see many many things he had never dreamed about on the earth below and was having the time of his lifeWhen they flew over a village though some children playing below saw them and started shouting LookSwans carrying a turtleSwans carrying a turtle This spoiled everything for the turtle until he thought of a smart retort NoThe turtles carrying the swans But as soon as he opened his mouth to say it he fell straight to his death belowThe moral of the story Watch out for your mouth when you enter high placesLitter is Thai slang for idle chatter and once Ajaan Fuang used the term to dramatic effectIt happened one evening when he was teaching in BangkokThree young women who were longtime friends happened to show up together at the building where he was teaching but instead of joining the group that was already meditating they found themselves an outoftheway corner to catch up on the latest gossipAs they were busy talking they didnt notice that Ajaan Fuang had gotten up to stretch his legs and was walking right past them with an unlit cigarette in his mouth and a box of matches in his handHe stopped for a second lit a match and instead of lighting his cigarette tossed the lit match into the middle of their groupImmediately they jumped up and one of them said Than PhawWhy did you do thatYou just barely missed meI saw a pile of litter there he answered and felt I should set fire to itOne day Ajaan Fuang overheard two students talking one of them asking a question and the other starting his answer with Well it seems to me Immediately Ajaan Fuang cut him off If you dont really know say you dont know and leave it at thatWhy go spreading your ignorance aroundWe each have two ears and one mouth  which shows that we should give more time to listening and less to speakingWhatever happens in the course of your meditation dont tell it to anyone except your teacherIf you go telling other people its braggingAnd isnt that a defilementWhen people advertise how good they are theyre really advertising how stupid they areIf somethings really good you dont have to advertiseThailand has a number of monk magazines somewhat like moviestar magazines which print the life stories and teachings of famous and notsofamous monks nuns and lay meditation teachersThe life stories tend to be so heavily embellished with supernatural and miraculous events though that they are hard to take seriouslyFrom the occasional contact he had with the editors and reporters responsible for these magazines Ajaan Fuang felt that by and large their primary aims were mercenaryAs he put it The great meditation teachers went into the wilds and put their lives on the line in order to find the DhammaWhen they found it they offered it free of charge on their returnBut these people sit in their airconditioned offices write down whatever comes into their heads and then put it up for sale As a result he never cooperated with them when they tried to put him in their magazinesOnce a group of reporters from a magazine named People Beyond the World came to visit him armed with cameras and tape recordersAfter paying their respects they asked for his prawat or personal historyNow it so happens that the Thai word prawat can also mean police record so Ajaan Fuang responded that he didnt have one as he had never done anything wrongBut the reporters were not easily discouragedIf he didnt want to give his life story they said could he please at least teach them some DhammaThis is a request no monk can refuse so Ajaan Fuang told them to close their eyes and meditate on the word buddho  awakeThey turned on their tape recorders and then sat in meditation waiting for a Dhamma talk and this was what they heardThats todays Dhamma two words  bud and dhoNow if you cant keep these two words in mind it would be a waste of time to teach you anything elseEnd of sermonWhen they realized that that was all the reporters  looking very exasperated  gathered their cameras and tape recorders and left never to bother him again We human beings have long tongues you knowYou sit around and suddenly your tongue flicks out to sea You want to eat seafoodThen it flicks around the world You want to eat foreign cuisineYou have to train your tongue and shrink it down to sizeWhen you eat keep your mind on your breath and contemplate why youre eatingIf youre eating simply for the taste of the food then what you eat can harm youAfter his trip to America one of his students asked him if he had had a chance to eat pizza while he was thereHe mentioned that he had and that it was very goodThis surprised one of his students who had gone along on the tripYou ate only two bites he saidWe thought you didnt like itTwo bites were enough to fill me up he answeredWhy would you want me to eat moreOnce a woman who had been studying with him for only a short while decided to prepare some food to donate to himWanting to make sure it would be something he liked she asked him straight out What kind of food do you like Than PhawHis answer Food thats within reachIt was a Friday evening and a group of Ajaan Fuangs students were riding in the back of a pickup truck on their way from Bangkok to Wat DhammasathitAnother student had sent a bushel of oranges along with them to donate to the monks at the wat and after a while on the road one of the students decided that the oranges looked awfully goodSo he came up with the following argument Were Than Phaws children rightAnd he wouldnt want us to go hungry rightSo anyone who doesnt have an orange isnt a child of Than PhawSome of the group were observing the eight precepts which forbid eating food after noon so they were able to slip through the netEveryone else though helped him or herself to the oranges even though a few of them felt bad about eating food intended for the monksWhen they arrived at the wat they told Ajaan Fuang what had happened and he immediately lit into them saying that anyone who takes food intended for monks and eats it before it has been given to the monks is going to be reborn as a hungry ghost in the next lifeThis scared one woman in the group who immediately responded But I only ate one sectionAjaan Fuang replied Well if youre going to be a hungry ghost you might as well eat enough to fill yourself up while you canDuring the Rains Retreat in a couple from the town of Rayong came out to the wat almost every evening to practice meditationThe strange thing about them was that whatever happened in the course of their meditation would tend to happen to both of them at the same timeOn one occasion they both found that they couldnt eat because they were overcome by a sense of the filthiness of foodThis lasted for three or four days without their getting weak or hungry so they began to wonder what stage they had reached in their meditationWhen they mentioned this to Ajaan Fuang on their next visit to the wat he had them sit in meditation and then told themOkay contemplate food to see what its made ofElements rightAnd whats your body made ofThe very same elementsThe elements in your body need the elements in food in order to keep goingSo why get all worked up about the filthiness of foodYour body is even filthierWhen the Buddha teaches us to contemplate the filthiness of food its so that we can get over our delusions about it  not so that we wont be able to eatThat ended their inability to eat food One of Ajaan Fuangs students  a seamstress  was criticized by a customer You practice the Dhamma dont youThen why are you so greedy charging such high pricesPeople practicing the Dhamma should take only enough profit just to get byAlthough she knew her prices were fair she couldnt think of a good answer so the next time she saw Ajaan Fuang she told him what had happenedHe replied The next time they say that tell them  Look Im not practicing the Dhamma to be stupid When I first went to stay at Wat Dhammasathit the Bs from Utapao Air Force Base could sometimes be heard high overhead in the wee hours of the morning flying on their bombing missions into CambodiaEach time I heard them I began to wonder what business I had meditating when there were so many injustices in the world that needed to be foughtWhen I mentioned this to Ajaan Fuang he said If you try to straighten out the world without really straightening yourself out first your own inner goodness will eventually break down and then where will you beYou wont be able to do anybody  yourself or anyone else  any good at allAs soon as were born were sentenced to death  just that we dont know when our turn will comeSo you cant be complacentStart right in and develop all your good qualities to the full while you still have the chanceIf you want to be a good person make sure you know where true goodness really liesDont just go through the motions of being goodWe all want happiness but for the most part we arent interested in building the causes for happinessAll we want are the resultsBut if we dont take an interest in the causes how are the results going to come our wayWhen I first went to practice meditation with Ajaan Fuang I asked him if people really were reborn after deathHe answered When you start out practicing the Buddha asks you to believe in only one thing karmaAs for things aside from that whether or not you believe them isnt really importantOne year shortly before the Rains Retreat  a time when people traditionally make resolutions to step up their practice of the Dhamma  one of Ajaan Fuangs students approached him and said that she was thinking of observing the eight precepts during the Rains but was afraid that going without the evening meal would leave her hungryHe retorted The Buddha fasted until he didnt have any flesh at all  just skin and bones  so that he could discover the Dhamma to teach us but here we cant even stand going without one single mealIts because of this that were still swimming around in the cycle of birth and deathAs a result she resolved that shed have to observe the eight precepts on each Buddhist sabbath  the full moon the new moon and the halfmoon days  during the three months of the RainsAnd so she didAt the end of the Rains she felt really proud of herself for having kept to her resolution but on her next visit to Ajaan Fuang before she was able to broach the topic at all he commented Youre lucky you knowYour Rains Retreat has only twelve daysEveryone elses is three monthsOn hearing this she felt so embarrassed that she has observed the eight precepts every day throughout each Rains Retreat ever since Another student was meditating in Ajaan Fuangs presence when  in a spasm of mindlessness  she slapped a mosquito that was biting her armAjaan Fuang commented You charge a high price for your blood dont youThe mosquito asks for a drop and you take its life in exchangeA young man was discussing the precepts with Ajaan Fuang and came to number five against taking intoxicants The Buddha forbade alcohol because most people lose their mindfulness when they drink it rightBut if you drink mindfully its okay isnt it Than PhawIf you were really mindful he answered you wouldnt drink it in the first placeThere seem to be more excuses for breaking the fifth precept than for any otherOne evening another student was conversing with Ajaan Fuang at the same time that a group of people were sitting around them in meditationI cant observe the fifth precept he said because Im under a lot of group pressureWhen we have social occasions at work and everyone else in the group is drinking I have to drink along with themAjaan Fuang pointed to the people sitting around them and asked This group isnt asking you to drinkWhy dont you give in to their group pressure insteadThe seamstress saw her friends observing the eight precepts at Wat Dhammasathit and so decided to try it herselfBut in the middle of the afternoon as she was walking through the monastery she passed a guava treeThe guavas looked inviting so she picked one and took a biteAjaan Fuang happened to be standing not far away and so he remarked HeyI thought you were going to observe the eight preceptsWhats that in your mouthThe seamstress realized in a jolt that she had broken her precepts but Ajaan Fuang consoled her Its not all that necessary to observe the eight precepts but make sure you observe the one precept okayDo you know what the one precept isNo Than PhawWhat is itNot doing any evilI want you to hold onto this one for lifeA woman came to Wat Dhammasathit to observe the precepts and meditate for a week but by the end of the second day she told Ajaan Fuang that she had to return home because she was afraid her family couldnt get along without herHe taught her to cut through her worries by saying When you come here tell yourself that youve diedOne way or another your family will have to learn to fend for themselvesOn his first visit to Wat Dhammasathit a middleaged man was surprised to see an American monkHe asked Ajaan Fuang How is it that Westerners can ordainAjaan Fuangs answer Dont Westerners have heartsA Bangkok magazine once carried the serialized autobiography of a lay meditator who used his powers of concentration to treat diseasesOne installment mentioned how he had visited Ajaan Fuang who had certified that he had attained jhanaThis didnt sound like Ajaan Fuangs style but soon after the magazine came out unusual numbers of people came to the wat under the impression that Ajaan Fuang like the author of the autobiography could treat illnesses through meditationOne woman asked him if he treated kidney diseases and he answered I treat only one kind of disease diseases of the mindA student asked permission to keep a notebook of Ajaan Fuangs teachings but he refused saying Is that the sort of person you are always carrying food around in your pocket for fear therell be nothing to eat Then he explained If you jot everything down youll feel its okay to forget what youve written because its all there in your notebookThe end result is that all the Dhamma will be in your notebook and none in your heartThe texts say that if you listen well youll gain wisdomTo listen well your heart has to be quiet and stillYou listen with your heart not just with your earsOnce youve listened you have to put what youve heard into practice right then and thereThats when youll reap the benefitsIf you dont put it into practice what youve heard will never become real inside youOnce while the chedi at Wat Dhammasathit was being built some of the students working on the chedi got into a serious argumentOne of them became so upset that she went to tell Ajaan Fuang who was staying in Bangkok at the timeWhen she finished her report he asked her Do you know what gravel isTaken aback she answered YesDo you know what diamonds areYesThen why dont you gather the diamondsWhat good do you get out of gathering gravelEven in a Buddhist country like Thailand some young people who practice the Dhamma find that their parents are against it and feel that they should be spending their time in more practical waysOnce the parents of the seamstress tried to put a stop to her visits to Wat Makut and this got her very angryBut when she told her feelings to Ajaan Fuang he warned her You owe a huge debt to your parents you knowIf you get angry with them or yell at them youre stoking the fires of hell on your head so watch outAnd remind yourself If you wanted parents who would encourage your practice why didnt you choose to be born from somebody elseThe fact that theyre your parents shows that youve made past karma with themSo just use up your old karma debts as they comeTheres no need to create any more karma by getting into argumentsChanneling spirits has long been popular in Thailand and even some people who practice the Dhamma also like to attend seancesBut Ajaan Fuang once said If you want results from your practice you have to make up your mind that the Buddha is your one and only refugeDont go taking refuge in anything elseIf you practice the Dhamma you dont have to be amazed by anyone elses powers or abilitiesWhatever you do say or think let your heart take its stand on the principles of reasonThe truth lies within youIf youre true in what you do youll meet with the truthIf youre not youll meet only with things that are fake and imitationOne of Ajaan Fuangs students reports that the first time she met him he asked her Where do you usually go to make merit She answered that she had helped sponsor a Buddha image at that temple and contributed to a crematorium at this temple etcSo he asked further Why havent you made merit at your heartOnce Ajaan Fuang had one of his students cut away some of the grass and weeds that were threatening to overgrow the monasteryShe didnt really want to do the work though and all the while as she was cutting away she kept asking herself What kind of karma did I do that I have to work so hard like this When she had finished he told her Well you got some merit but not very muchWhatAfter all that work I still didnt get very muchIf you want your full measure of merit the merit has to go all the way to your heartTheres another story involving grassOne day Ajaan Fuang pointed out the overgrown grass near his hut and asked the same woman Dont you want the grass at the corral gateWhat do you mean grass at the corral gateThe opportunity to make merit right nearby that everyone else overlooksThats called grass at the corral gate Another time Ajaan Fuang took some of his Bangkok students up the hill to clean the area around the chediThey found a large pile of trash that someone had thrown away up there and one of the group complained How could anyone be so disrespectful as to do something like this But Ajaan Fuang told her Dont criticize whoever did itIf they hadnt thrown the trash here we wouldnt have the opportunity to earn the merit that comes from cleaning it upOne day after Ajaan Fuangs name had appeared in a magazine article a group of three men from Bangkok took a day off from work to drive to Rayong and pay their respects to himAfter bowing down and then chatting for a while one of them said Our country still has monks who practice rightly and well so that we can ask to have a share of their paramis isnt that true Than PhawIts true he answered but if we keep asking for a share of their paramis without developing any of our own theyll see that were simply beggars and they wont want to share with us any moreA woman in the town of Samut Prakaan just outside of Bangkok sent word through one of Ajaan Fuangs students that shed like to donate a large sum of money to help build the Buddha image at Wat Dhammasathit but she wanted him to come to her home to give a blessing as she handed over the checkHe refused to go saying If people want merit they have to go looking for itThey cant expect the merit to come looking for themAnother woman once telephoned the main office at Wat Makut saying that she was going to provide a meal for monks at her house and wanted to invite Ajaan Fuang to the meal because she had heard that he was a Noble DiscipleWhen the invitation was conveyed to him he refused it saying Is her rice so special that only Noble Disciples can get to eat itOne of Ajaan Fuangs students told him that shed like to do something special to make merit on her birthdayHe replied Why does it have to be on your birthdayDo you get less merit if you do it any other dayIf you want to make merit go ahead and do it on the day the thought occurs to youDont wait for your birthday because your deathday may get to you firstReferring to people who didnt like to meditate but were happy to help with the construction work at the wat Ajaan Fuang once said Light merit doesnt register with them so you have to find some really heavy merit for them to makeThats the only way to keep them satisfiedShortly after the chedi was finished a group of Ajaan Fuangs students were sitting and admiring it taking joy in all the merit in store for them because they had had a hand in building itAjaan Fuang happened to walk by and overhear what they were saying and so he commented as if to no one in particular Dont get attached to material thingsWhen you make merit dont get attached to the meritIf you let yourself get carried away thinking I built this chedi with my own hands watch outIf you happened to die right now all youd be able to think would be This chedi is mine its mine Instead of being reborn in heaven with everyone else youd be reborn as a hungry ghost to guard over the chedi for a week or so because your heart was fixated on material thingsIf when you do good you get stuck on your goodness youll never get freeWherever youre stuck thats where theres becoming and birthThere is an old tradition in Buddhism  based on the Apadana tales  that whenever you make a gift to the religion or perform some other meritorious deed you should dedicate the merit of the deed to a particular goalThere were times when Ajaan Fuang would tell his students to make similar dedications every time they meditated although the dedication hed recommend would depend on the individualSometimes hed recommend the dedication King Asoka made at the end of his life In my future lives may I have sovereignty over the mindOther times hed say Theres no need to make any long drawnout dedicationsTell yourself If I have to be reborn may I always encounter the Buddhas teachingsBut it wasnt always the case that he would recommend such dedicationsOnce a woman told him that when she made merit she couldnt think of any particular goal to dedicate the merit towardsHe told her If the mind is full theres no need to make any dedication if you dont want toIts like eatingWhether or not you express a wish to get full if you keep on eating theres no way you can help but get fullWhatever you do always think of your teacherIf you forget your teacher youre cutting yourself off at the rootA person who goes from teacher to teacher doesnt really have any teachers at allOn occasion people would present Ajaan Fuang with amulets and he would hand them out among his students  but only rarely among those who were especially close to himOne day a monk who had lived several years with him couldnt help but complain Why is it that when you get good amulets you never give any to me and always to everybody elseAjaan Fuang replied Ive already given you lots of things better than thatWhy dont you accept themMeditators who live close to their teacher but who dont understand him are like a spoon in a pot of curry Itll never know how sweet sour salty rich or hot the curry isAjaan Fuangs analogy for students who always have to ask their teachers for advice on how to handle even minor problems in everyday life Theyre just like baby puppiesAs soon as they defecate they have to run to their mother to have her lick them offTheyll never grow up on their ownStudents who get stuck on their teachers are like gnatsNo matter how much you chase them away they keep coming back and wont leave you aloneIf a teacher praises a student to his face its a sign that thats as far as the student will go  he probably wont be able to practice to any greater heights in this lifetimeThe reason the teacher praises him is so that hell be able to take pride in the fact that at least hes made it this farHis heart will have something good to hold on to when he needs it at deathMany of Ajaan Fuangs students were convinced that he was able to read their minds because time after time he would broach topics that happened to be going through their heads or weighing down their hearts at the momentI myself had many experiences like this and many were reported to me while I was compiling this bookIn most cases of this sort though what he had to say had special meaning only for those directly involved and so Ill ask to pass over them hereBut there are two cases Id like to mention since they strike me as being useful for all who practice the DhammaOnce one of his students  a young man  took the bus from Bangkok to Rayong to help work on the chediHe got off at the mouth of the road leading to the wat but didnt feel like walking the six kilometers it would take to get there so he sat at the noodle stand by the intersection and said to himself  as a challenge to Ajaan Fuang  If Than Phaw is really something special may a car come by and give me a lift to the wat One hour passed two three and not a single car or truck turned into the road so he finally had to walk the distance on footWhen he arrived at the wat he went to Ajaan Fuangs hut to pay his respects but as soon as Ajaan Fuang saw him approach he got up entered his room and closed the doorThis shook the student a little but still he bowed down in front of the closed doorThe moment he finished Ajaan Fuang opened the door a crack and said LookI didnt ask for you to come hereYou came of your own free willAnother time after the chedi was finished the same young man was sitting in meditation at the chedi in hopes that a voice would whisper the winning number of the next lottery in his earWhat he heard though was the sound of Ajaan Fuang actually walking past and saying as if to no one in particular Exactly what are you taking as your refugeAjaan Mun once said People are all alike but not at all alike but in the final analysis all alike You have to think about this for a good while before you can understand what he was getting atIf you want to judge other people judge them by their intentionsWhen you want to teach other people to be good you have to see how far their goodness can goIf you try to make them better than they can be youre the one whos being stupidNothing comes from focusing on the faults of othersYou can get more done by looking at your own faults insteadHow good or bad other people are is their own businessFocus on your own business insteadOne of Ajaan Fuangs students complained to him about all the problems she was facing at workShe wanted to quit and live quietly by herself but circumstances wouldnt allow it because she had to provide for her motherAjaan Fuang told her If you have to live with these things then find out how to live in a way that rises above themThats the only way youll be able to surviveAdvice for a student who was letting the pressure at work get her down When you do a job dont let the job do youAnother one of Ajaan Fuangs students was having serious problems both at home and in her work so he appealed to her fighting spirit Anyone whos a real live person will have to meet up with real live problems in lifeWhen you meet with obstacles you have to put up a fightIf you give up easily youll end up giving up all your life longTell yourself youre made out of heartwood and not out of sapwoodOne of Ajaan Fuangs students  a young nurse  had to put up with being the brunt of a lot of gossip at workAt first she tried to ignore it but as it happened more and more often her patience began to wear thinOne day when the gossip was really getting to her she went to meditate with Ajaan Fuang at Wat MakutWhile meditating she saw a vision of herself repeating back back back to infinity as if she were caught between two parallel mirrorsThe thought occurred to her that in her many previous lives she had probably had to endure an untold amount of the same sort of gossip and this made her even more fed up with her situationSo when she left meditation she told Ajaan Fuang of how tired she was of being gossiped aboutHe tried to console her saying This sort of thing is part and parcel of the world you knowWhere theres praise there also has to be criticism and gossipWhen you know this why let yourself get involvedHer mood was so strong though that she argued with him Im not getting involved with them Than PhawThey come and get involved with meSo he turned the tables on her Then why dont you ask yourself  who asked you to butt in and be born here in the first placeIf they say youre no good remind yourself that their words go only as far as their lipsTheyve never reached out and touched you at allOther people criticize us and then forget all about it but we take it and keep thinking about itIts as if they spit out some food and we pick it up and eat itWhen thats the case whos being stupidPretend you have stones weighing down your ears so that you dont get blown away by everything you hear saidOne day Ajaan Fuang asked as if out of the blue If your clothing fell down into a cesspool would you pick it back up againThe woman he asked had no idea what he was getting at but knew that if she wasnt careful about answering his questions shed come out looking like a fool so she hedged her answer It dependsIf it was my only set of clothing Id have to pick it upBut if I had other sets Id probably let it goWhat are you getting at Than PhawIf you like to hear bad things about other people then even though you have no part in the bad karma of their acts you still pick up some of the stenchIf any of his students were bearing a grudge about something he would tell them You cant even sacrifice something as minor as thisThink of it as making a giftRemember how many valuable things the Buddha sacrificed during his life as Prince Vessantara and then ask yourself This anger of mine has no value at allWhy cant I sacrifice it too Think first before you actDont be the sort of person who acts first and then has to think about it afterwardsBeware of fallinthewell kindness the cases where you want to help other people but instead of your pulling them up they pull you downWhen people say something is good its their idea of goodBut is it always whats really good for youIf people hate you thats when youre let off the hookYou can come and go as you like without having to worry about whether or not theyll miss you or get upset at your goingAnd you dont have to bring any presents for them when you come backYoure free to do as you likeTrying to win out over other people brings nothing but animosity and bad karmaIts better to win out over yourselfWhatever you lose let it be lost but dont ever lose heartIf they take whats yours tell yourself that youre making it a giftOtherwise there will be no end to the animosityTheir taking whats yours is better than your taking whats theirsIf its really yours itll have to stay with you no matter whatIf its not really yours why get all worked up about itTheres nothing wrong with being poor on the outside but make sure youre not poor on the insideMake yourself rich in generosity virtue and meditation  the treasures of the mindOne of Ajaan Fuangs students complained to him I look at other people and they seem to have such an easy lifeWhy is life so hard on me His answer Your hard life is ten twenty times the good life for a lot of peopleWhy dont you look at the people who have a harder time than you doSometimes when any of his students were facing hardships in life Ajaan Fuang would teach them to remind themselves How can I blame anyone elseNobody ever hired me to be bornI came of my own free willEverything that happens has its lifespanIt wont last foreverWhen its lifespan is up itll go away on its ownTo have a partner in life is to sufferTo have a good partner is really to suffer because of all the attachmentSensual pleasure is like a drug One taste and you get addictedThey say that with heroin its hard to break the habit but this is even worseIt goes deep right into the boneIts what made us get born in the first place and has kept us circling through birth and death for aeons and aeonsTheres no medicine you can take to break the habit to wash it out of your system aside from the medicine of the Buddhas teachingsWhen we see Hindus worshiping Siva lingas it looks strange to us but actually everyone in the world worships the Siva linga  ie they worship sex simply that the Hindus are the only ones who are open about itSex is the creator of the worldThe reason were all born is because we worship the Siva linga in our heartsOnce when one of Ajaan Fuangs students was being pressured by her parents to look for a husband so that she could settle down and have children she asked him Is it true what they say that a woman gains a lot of merit in having a child in that she gives someone else the chance to be bornIf that were true he answered her then dogs would get gobs of merit because they give birth to whole litters at a timeHe also told her Getting married is no way to escape sufferingActually all you do is pile more suffering on yourselfThe Buddha taught that the five khandhas are a heavy burden but if you get married all of a sudden you have ten to worry about and then fifteen and then twenty You have to be your own refugeIf youre the sort that has to take refuge in other people then youll have to see things the same way they do which means you have to be stupid the same way they areSo pull yourself out of all that and take a good look at yourself until things are clear within youYou may think my child my child but is it really yoursEven your own body isnt really yoursOne of Ajaan Fuangs students when she was suffering a serious liver disease dreamed that she had died and gone to heavenShe took this as a bad omen and so went to Wat Makut to tell her dream to Ajaan FuangHe tried to console her saying that it was really a good omen in disguiseIf she survived the disease shed probably get a promotion at workIf she didnt shed be reborn in good circumstancesAs soon as he said this though she got very upset But Im not ready to dieLook he told her when the time comes to go you have to be willing to goLife isnt a rubber band you can stretch out or shrink as you likeIf there are any sensual pleasures you really hunger for its a sign you enjoyed them before in a previous lifeThats why you miss them so much this time aroundIf you think about this long enough it should be enough to make you dispassionate and dismayedSome people say that monks dont do any work but actually the work of abandoning your defilements is the most difficult work in the worldThe work of the everyday world has its days off but our work doesnt have any time off at allIts something you have to do hours a daySometimes you may feel youre not up to it but still you have to do itIf you dont whos going to do it for youIts your duty and nobody elsesIf you dont do it what are you living off the donations of other people forWhatever work youre doing keep an eye on your mindIf you see that its going off the path stop whatever youre doing and focus all your attention on itThe work of looking after your mind should always come firstThe Buddhas Dhamma is akaliko  timelessThe reason we havent reached it yet is because we have lots of times time for this time for that time to work time to rest time to eat time to sleep Our whole life turns into times and as a result they dont give us a chance to see the truth clearly within ourselvesSo we have to make our practice timelessThats when the truth will appear in our heartsAjaan Fuang was very meticulous about keeping things clean and in their place and taught his students to be meticulous too for that was the way he was taught by his teachers and he knew that he had benefitted from itIn his words If you cant master obvious things like this how are you going to master the subtle things like the mindThe monk who attended to his needs  cleaning his hut boiling the water for his bath looking after him when he was sick etc had to be very observant for Ajaan Fuang used the teacherstudent relationship as an opportunity to teach by exampleInstead of explaining where things should be placed or when certain duties should be done he left it up to the student to observe for himselfIf he caught on Ajaan Fuang wouldnt say anythingIf he didnt Ajaan Fuang would give him a dressing down  but still wouldnt explain what was wrongIt was up to the student to figure things out for himselfAs Ajaan Fuang said If it gets to the point where I have to tell you it shows that were still strangersOne evening one of the monks at Wat Dhammasathit saw Ajaan Fuang working alone picking up scraps of lumber around the chedi construction site and putting them in orderThe monk ran down to help him and after a while asked him Than Phaw this sort of work isnt something you should be doing aloneThere are lots of other peopleWhy dont you get them to helpI am getting other people to help Ajaan Fuang answered as he continued to pick up pieces of woodWho the monk asked as he looked around and saw no one elseYouWhen I returned to Thailand in to be ordained Ajaan Fuang gave me two warnings Being a meditator isnt simply a matter of sitting with your eyes closedYou have to be sharp at everything you do If you want to learn you have to think like a thief and figure out how to steal your knowledgeWhat this means is that you cant just wait for the teacher to explain everythingYou have to notice for yourself what he does and why  for everything he does has its reasonThe relationship of a monk to his supporters is something of a balancing actOne of Ajaan Fuangs favorite reminders to his monk disciples was Remember nobodys hired you to become a monkYou havent ordained to become anybodys servant But if a monk complained that the monastery attendants werent doing as they were told hed say Did you ordain to have other people wait on youOur life depends on the support of others so dont do anything that would weigh them downMonks who eat the food that other people donate but then dont practice can expect to be reborn as water buffaloes next time around to till the fields and work off their debtsDont think that the small disciplinary rules arent importantAs Ajaan Mun once said logs have never gotten into peoples eyes but fine sawdust can  and it can blind youWestern women are often upset when they learn that monks arent allowed to touch them and they usually take it as a sign that Buddhism discriminates against womenBut as Ajaan Fuang explained it The reason the Buddha didnt allow monks to touch women is not that theres anything wrong with womenIts because theres something wrong with the monks They still have mental defilements which is why they have to be kept under controlFor anyone who tries to follow the celibate life the opposite sex is the biggest temptation to leave the pathIf Ajaan Fuang was teaching monks hed say Women are like vinesAt first they seem so weak and soft but if you let them grow on you they curl up around you until they have you all tied up and finally bring you downWhen teaching nuns hed warn them about menOnce a nun was thinking of disrobing and returning home knowing that her father would arrange a marriage for herShe asked Ajaan Fuang for advice and he told her Ask yourselfDo you want to live inside the noose or out As a result she decided shed rather stay out If you find yourself thinking about sex run your hand over your head to remind yourself of who you areAjaan Fuang had many stories to tell about his times with Ajaan LeeOne of my favorites was of the time a large group of Ajaan Lees Bangkok students arranged to go with him on a meditation trip into the forestThey agreed to meet at Hua Lampong the main train station in Bangkok and take the train north to LopburiWhen the group assembled at the station though it turned out that many of them had each brought along at least two large suitcases of necessities for the trip and even many of the monks from Bangkok monasteries had brought along large loadsOn seeing this Ajaan Lee said nothing but simply set out walking north along the railroad tracksSince he was walking everyone had to walk although it wasnt long before the members of the group most burdened down began complaining Than Phaw why are you making us walkWeve got so much heavy stuff to carryAt first Ajaan Lee said nothing but finally told them as he kept on walking If its heavy then why burden yourself with it It took a few moments for his message to sink in but soon the different members of the group had stopped to open their bags and throw everything unessential into the lotus ponds that lined either side of the railroad tracksWhen they reached the next train station Ajaan Lee saw that they had trimmed down their belongings enough that he could let them take the next train north When you live in a monastery pretend that youre living alone What this means is that once youve finished with the group activities  the meal the chanting the chores and so on  you dont have to get involved with anyoneGo back to your hut and meditateWhen you live alone pretend that youre in a monastery Set up a schedule and stick to itWhen I went to Wat Asokaram  a very large monastery  for my first Rains Retreat Ajaan Fuang told me If they ask you questions in Thai answer in EnglishIf they ask in English answer in ThaiAfter a while theyll get tired to talking to you and will leave you alone to meditateIts good to live in a monastery where not everyone is serious about the practice because it teaches you to depend on yourselfIf you lived only with people who were serious meditators youd get so that you wouldnt be able to survive anywhere elseWe keep disagreeable people around the monastery as a way of testing to see if our defilements really are all goneThe purpose of adhering to the ascetic practices is to wear down your defilementsIf you adhere to them with the thought of impressing other people youd do better not to adhere to them at allOn fasting as an aid to meditation For some people it works well for others it works just the opposite  the more they fast the stronger their defilements getIts not the case that when you starve the body you starve the defilements because defilements dont come from the bodyThey come from the mindTheres a passage where the Buddha asks Days and nights pass by pass byWhat are you doing right now So what answer do you have for himIf you go teaching others before your own practice is up to standard you do more harm than goodTraining a meditator is like training a boxer You pull your punches and dont hit him any harder than he can takeBut when he comes back at you he gives it everything hes gotThe first time I was going to give a sermon Ajaan Fuang told me Pretend you have a sword in your handIf any people in the audience think critical thoughts of you cut off their headsWhen I first went to Wat Dhammasathit the trip from Bangkok was an allday affair since the roads were much worse and more roundabout than nowOne evening a woman rented a cab and traveled all the way from Bangkok to get Ajaan Fuangs advice on the problems she was having in her family and after a couple of hours of consultation she took the cab all the way backAfter she left he said to me Theres one good thing about living way out here If we were living near Bangkok people with a lot of free time on their hands and no idea of how to spend it would come and waste our time chatting all dayBut here when people make the effort to come out it shows that they really want our helpAnd no matter how many hours it takes to talk things over with them its no waste of time at allWhen people come to see me I have them sit and meditate first so that they know how to make their minds quietOnly then will I let them bring up any other problems they may want to talk aboutIf you try discussing things with them when their minds arent quiet theres no way theyll understandIf people get it into their heads that theyre enlightened when they arent then you shouldnt waste any breath on trying to straighten them outIf they dont have faith in you  then the more you try to reason with them the more theyll get set in their opinionsIf they do have faith in you then all it takes is one sentence or two and theyll come to their sensesOnce the father of one of the monks living with Ajaan Fuang wrote his son a letter asking him to disrobe return home continue his studies get a job start a family and have a normal happy life like everyone else in the worldThe monk mentioned this to Ajaan Fuang who said He says his kind of happiness is something special but look at it  what kind of happiness is it reallyJust the same old smelly stuff you left when you ordainedIsnt there any happiness better than thatMany were the times when people would tell Ajaan Fuang that  with all the work and responsibilities in their lives  they had no time to meditateAnd many were the times hed respond And you think youll have time after youre deadAll you have to study is the meditationword buddhoAs for any other fields you might study they never come to an end and cant take you beyond sufferingBut once youre come to the end of buddho thats when youll come to true happinessWhen the minds not quiet  thats when its poor and burdened with difficultiesIt takes molehills and turns them into mountainsBut when the mind is quiet theres no suffering because theres nothing at allNo mountains at allWhen theres a lot to the mind its simply a lot of defilement making it sufferIf youre singleminded about whatever you think of doing youre sure to succeedWhen youre thinking buddho you dont have to wonder about whether or not youll do well in your meditationIf you put your mind to it youre sure to do wellThe things that come to disturb you are simply the forces of temptation come to put on a playWhatever the play all you have to do is watch  you dont have to get on stage with themWhats really essential is that you bring your views in line with the truthOnce your views are right the mind will immediately come to restIf your views are wrong everything is immediately wrongAll the things you need for the practice  the breath the mind  are already thereSo try to bring your views in line with the breath and you wont have to use a lot of force in your meditationThe mind will settle down and come to rest right awayThe mind is like a kingIts moods are like his ministersDont be a king whos easily swayed by his courtA group of laypeople who had studied the Abhidhamma together came to Ajaan Fuang to try out his version of mental training but when he told them to sit close their eyes and focus on the breath they immediately backed off saying that they didnt want to practice concentration for fear that theyd get stuck on jhana and end up being reborn in the Brahma worldsHe responded Whats there to be afraid ofEven nonreturners are reborn in the Brahma worldsAt any rate being reborn in the Brahma worlds is better than being reborn as a dogWhen Ajaan Fuang taught meditation he didnt like to map things out in advanceAs soon as he had explained the beginning steps hed have the student start sitting right in his presence and then take the steps back home to work on thereIf anything came up in the course of the practice hed explain how to deal with it and then go on to the next stepOnce a layman who had known more than his share of meditation teachers came to discuss the Dhamma with Ajaan Fuang asking him many questions of an advanced nature as a way of testing his level of attainmentAjaan Fuang asked him in return Have you had these experiences in your own meditation yetNo not yetThen in that case Id rather not discuss them because if we discuss them when theyre not yet a reality for you theyll just be theories and not the real DhammaOne meditator noticed that his practice under Ajaan Fuang was making quick progress and so he asked what the next step would beIm not going to tell you Ajaan Fuang saidOtherwise youll become the sort of amazing marvel who knows everything before he meets with it and masters everything before hes tried his handJust keep practicing and youll find out on your ownYou cant plan the way your practice is going to goThe mind has its own steps and stages and you have to let the practice follow in line with themThats the only way youll get genuine resultsOtherwise youll turn into a halfbaked arahantDont make a journal of your meditation experiencesIf you do youll start meditating in order to have this or that thing happen so that you can write it down in your journalAnd as a result youll end up with nothing but the things youve fabricatedSome people are afraid to meditate too seriously for fear that theyll go crazy but as Ajaan Fuang once said You have to be crazy about meditation if you want to meditate wellAnd as for whatever problems come up there are always ways to solve themWhats really scary is if you dont meditate enough for the problems to come out in the open in the first placeOther people can teach you only the outer skin but as for what lies deeper inside only you can lay down the law for yourselfYou have to draw the line being mindful keeping track of what you do at all timesIts like having a teacher following you around in public and in private keeping watch over you telling you what to do and what not to do making sure that you stay in lineIf you dont have this sort of teacher inside you the mind is bound to stray off the path and get into mischief shoplifting all over townPersistence comes from conviction discernment from being mindfulPersistence in the practice is a matter of the mind and not of your postureIn other words whatever you do keep your mindfulness constant and dont let it lapseNo matter what your activity make sure the mind sticks with its meditation workWhen you start out sitting in meditation it takes a long time for the mind to settle down but as soon as the session is over you get right up and throw it awayIts like climbing a ladder slowly step by step to the second floor and then jumping out the windowA woman army officer sat in meditation with Ajaan Fuang at Wat Makut until it seemed that her mind was especially blissful and brightBut when she returned home instead of trying to maintain that state of mind she sat around listening to a friends woes until she herself started feeling depressed tooA few days later she returned to Wat Makut and told Ajaan Fuang what had happenedHe responded You took gold and traded it in for excrementAnother student disappeared for several months and on her return told Ajaan Fuang The reason I didnt show up is that my boss sent me to night school for a semester so I didnt have any time to meditate at allBut now that the course is over I dont want to do anything but meditate  no work no study just let the mind be stillShe thought hed be pleased to hear how intent she still was on meditating but he disappointed herSo you dont want to work  thats a defilement isnt itWhoever said that people cant work and meditate at the same timeMeditating isnt a matter of making the mind empty you knowThe mind has to have work to doIf you make it empty then anything  good or bad  can pop into itIts like leaving the front door to your home openAnything at all can come strolling right inA young nurse practiced meditation with Ajaan Fuang several days running and finally asked him one day Why wasnt todays session as good as yesterdaysHe answered Meditating is like wearing clothesToday you wear white tomorrow red yellow blue whateverYou have to keep changingYou cant wear the same set of clothes all the timeSo whatever color youre wearing just be aware of itDont get depressed or excited about itA few months later the same nurse was sitting in meditation when a sense of peace and clarity in her mind became so intense that she felt she would never have a bad mood infiltrate her mind againBut sure enough bad moods eventually came back as beforeWhen she mentioned this to Ajaan Fuang he said Looking after the mind is like raising a childThere will have to be bad days along with the goodIf you want only the good youre in for troubleSo you have to play neutral Dont fall in with the good or the badWhen the meditation goes well dont get excitedWhen it doesnt go well dont get depressedSimply be observant to see why its good why its badIf you can be observant like this it wont be long before your meditation becomes a skillEverything depends on your powers of observationIf theyre crude and sloppy youll get nothing but crude and sloppy resultsAnd your meditation will have no hope of making progressOne day a young woman was sitting in meditation with Ajaan Fuang and everything seemed to go wellHer mind was clear and relaxed and she could contemplate the elements in her body as he told her step by step with no problem at allBut the next day nothing went rightAfter the session was over he asked her How did it go todayShe answered Yesterday I felt as if I were smart today I feel like Im stupidSo he asked her further Are the smart person and the stupid person the same person or notA student came to complain to Ajaan Fuang that she had been meditating for years and still hadnt gotten anything out of itHis immediate response You dont meditate to get anythingYou meditate to let goThe seamstress after practicing meditation with Ajaan Fuang for several months told him that her mind seemed more of a mess than it was before she began meditatingOf course it does he told herIts like your houseIf you polish the floor every day you wont be able to stand the least little bit of dust on itThe cleaner the house the more easily youll see the dirtIf you dont keep polishing the mind you can let it go out and sleep in the mud without any qualms at allBut once you get it to sleep on a polished floor then if theres even a speck of dust youll have to sweep it awayYou wont be able to stand the messIf you get excited by other peoples experiences in meditation its like getting excited by other peoples wealthAnd what do you gain from thatPay attention to developing your own wealth insteadGood will and compassion if they arent backed up by equanimity can cause you to sufferThats why you need the equanimity of jhana to perfect themYour concentration has to be Right Concentration just right on an even keel all the timeWhatever you do  sitting standing walking lying down  dont let it have any ups and downsConcentration You have to learn how to do it how to maintain it and how to put it to useOnce you catch hold of the mind itll stay in the present without slipping off to the past or futureThats when youll be able to make it do whatever you wantWhen you get so that you catch on to the meditation its like a kite that finally catches the windIt wont want to come downOne evening after a work party at Wat Dhammasathit Ajaan Fuang took his lay students up to the chedi to meditateOne woman in the group felt completely exhausted from all the work but joined in the meditation anyway out of deference to himAs she sat there her awareness got weaker and weaker smaller and smaller to the point where she thought she was going to dieAjaan Fuang happened to walk past and said Theres no need to be afraid of deathYou die with every in and out breathThis gave her the strength to fight off her exhaustion and to continue meditating To meditate is to practice dying so that youll be able to do it rightWhen my father came for a visit to Wat Dhammasathit I got him to sit and meditate with Ajaan Fuang while I acted as interpreterBefore starting my father asked if his being a Christian would be an obstacle to the meditationAjaan Fuang assured him that it wouldnt Were going to focus on the breathThe breath doesnt belong to Buddhism or Christianity or anyone elseIts common property all over the world and everyone has the right to look at itSo try looking at the breath until you can see your own mind and know your own mindThen the question of what religion you belong to wont be an issue because we can talk about the mind instead of discussing religionsThis way we can understand each otherWhen you do anything in meditation relate it to the breath for thats the basis of the entire skill were developingCatching the mind is like catching eelsIf you simply jump down into the mud and try to grab hold of them theyll slip off every which wayYou have to find something they like  as when people take a dead dog put it in a big clay jar and then bury it in the mudIn no time at all the eels come swimming into the jar of their own free will to feed off the dog and then all you have to do it put your hand over the mouth of the jar and there you are Youve got your eelsIts the same with the mindYou have to find something it likes so make the breath as comfortable as you can to the point where it feels good throughout the whole bodyThe mind likes comfort so itll come of its own free will and then its easy to catch hold of itYou have to know the breath at all times and then happiness will be yoursThe human state the heavenly state and nibbana are all here in the breathIf you get carried away with other things happiness will slip through your fingers so you have to learn how to observe the inandout breath at all timesPay attention to how its getting along  dont leave it to fend for itselfWhen you know its way of life  sitting standing walking everything  then you can get what you want from itThe body will be light the mind at ease happy at all timesThe breath can take you all the way to nibbana you knowThe first step is simply to look at the breath as it isYou dont have to go fiddling around with it a lotJust think bud with the inbreath and dho with the outBud in dho outDont force the breath or force the mind into a tranceSimply hold the mind carefully right there with each breathHow do you use your powers of observation to get acquainted with the breathAsk yourself Do you know the breathIs the breath thereIf you cant see whether the breath is for real look further in until its clearly thereTheres no great mystery to itIts always real right thereThe important thing is whether or not youre for realIf you are then simply keep at itThats all there is to itSimply keep being real being true in what you do and your meditation will make progressItll gradually grow stronger and the mind will grow calmJust be clear about what youre doingDont have any doubtsIf you can doubt even your own breath then there are no two ways about it Youll doubt everythingNo matter what happens youll be uncertain about itSo be straightforward and true in whatever you do for everything comes down to whether or not youre trueOnce the mind stays with the breath you dont have to repeat buddho in the mindIts like calling your water buffaloOnce it comes why keep calling its nameMake the mind and the breath one and the sameDont let them be twoDont be a post planted in the mudHave you ever seen a post planted in the mudIt sways back and forth and can never stand firmWhatever you do be firm and singleminded about itLike when you focus on the breath Make the mind one with it like a post planted firmly in solid rockHold onto the breath the way a red ant bites Even if you pull its body so that it separates from the head the head will keep on biting and wont let goWhen I first heard Ajaan Fuang talk about catching hold of the breath I didnt understand himId sit tensing up my body to catch hold of it but this simply made me feel tired and ill at easeThen one day as I was riding the bus to Wat Makut I sat in concentration and found that if I let the breath follow its natural course it felt a lot more comfortable and the mind wouldnt run away from itWhen I reached Wat Makut being a typical Westerner I took him to task Why do you say to catch the breathThe more you catch it the more uncomfortable it isYou have to let it go to flow naturallyHe laughed and said That isnt what I meantTo catch it means to stick with it to follow it and to make sure you dont wander away from itYou dont have to squeeze or force or control itWhatever its like just keep on watching itGet so that you really know the breath not just that youre simply aware of itObserving the breath is the cause the pleasure that arises is the resultFocus as much as you can on the causeIf you ignore the cause and get carried away with the result itll run out and youll end up with nothing at allWhen you focus on the breath measure things by how much pleasure you feelIf both the breath and the mind feel pleasant youre doing okayIf either the breath or the mind feels uncomfortable thats when you have to make adjustmentsThe main thing when you meditate is to be observantIf you feel ill at ease change the breath until you feel betterIf the body feels heavy think of spreading the breath so that it feels lightTell yourself that the breath can come in and out every pore of your skinWhen the book says to focus on the breath sensations in the different parts of the body it means to focus on whatever feelings are already there in the bodyThe breath can be a resting place for the mind or it can be what the mind actively contemplatesWhen the mind isnt willing to settle down and be still its a sign that it wants exerciseSo we give it work to doWe make it scan the body and contemplate the breath sensations in the different parts to see how theyre related to the inandout breath to see where the energy flows smoothly and where its blockedBut make sure that your mind doesnt wander outside of the bodyKeep it circling around inside and dont let it stop until it gets tiredOnce its tired you can find a place for it to rest and itll stay there without your having to force itMake the breath viscous and then think of it exploding to fill the whole bodyAjaan Fuang once told a student who liked to keep in shape with yoga and aerobic exercises every day Use the breath to keep in shape insteadSit in meditation and spread the breath throughout the body to every partThe mind will get trained and the body will be strong with no need to tie it into knots or make it jump aroundA nun who practiced meditation with Ajaan Fuang had had poor health since she was a child and was always coming down with one disease or anotherAjaan Fuang told her Every morning when you wake up sit and meditate to give yourself a physical examination to see where the aches and pains are and then use your breathing to treat themThe heavy pains will grow lighter the light ones will disappearBut dont make a big deal out of whether or not they disappearKeep on examining the body and dealing with the breath no matter what happens because the important point is that youre training your mindfulness to stay with the body to the point where its strong enough to go above and beyond painAdjust the breath until its perfectly evenIf you see a white light bring it into the body and let it explode out to every poreThe mind will be still the body weightlessYoull feel white and bright all over and your heart will be at easeWhen the breath fills the body its like water filling a jar to the brimEven though you may try to pour more into it thats all it can takeIts just right in and of itselfMeditation needs rapture  a feeling of fullness in body and mind  as its lubricantOtherwise it gets too dryWhen you meditate you have to let go in stagesLike when they go into outer space The space capsule has to let go of the booster rockets before it can reach the moonWhen the mind is really in place you can let go of the breath and it wont wander off anywhereIts like pouring cement If the cement hasnt set you cant remove the plywood forms but once its set itll stay where it is without any need for the forms at allSpread the breath until the body and mind are so light that theres no sense of body at all  just awareness itselfThe mind will be clear like crystal clean waterYou can look down into the water and see your own faceYoull be able to see whats going on in your mindWhen the breath is full and still you let go of itThen you think of each of the other elements in the body  fire water and earth  one by oneWhen theyre all clear you put them together ie balance them so that the body isnt too hot too cold too heavy too light just right in every wayNow you let go of that and stay with the space element  a feeling of emptinessWhen youre skilled at staying with space look at whats saying spaceThis is where you turn to look at awareness itself the element of consciousnessOnce the mind has become one like this you can then let go of the oneness and see whats leftAfter you can do this you practice going in and out of the various stages until youre skilled at it and you can notice the various modes of the mind as you do itThats where discernment will begin to appearIn contemplating yourself the six elements have to come firstYou take them apart and put them back together again as when you learn your ABCs and how to make them into wordsAfter a while you can make any word you wantTake your time to make sure that this foundation is solidOnce its solid then no matter how many storeys you want to build on top of it theyll go up quickly and stay in placeIf you were to say its easy well yes its easyIf you were to say its hard its hardIt all depends on youThe basic steps of breath meditation that Ajaan Lee describes in his Method are just the main outline of the practiceAs for the details you have to use your own ingenuity to work variations on his outline so that it fits your experiencesThats when youll get resultsIf youre having any problems in your concentration check what youre doing against the seven steps in MethodIve found that if anyone comes to me with problems in their concentration all I have to do is apply one of the seven stepsTheyre basic to all meditationThe texts say that breath meditation is right for everyone but thats not really the caseOnly if youre meticulous can you get results from focusing on the breathA famous meditation teacher once criticized Ajaan Lee Why do you teach people to look at the breathWhat is there to look atTheres just in and outHow are they going to gain discernment from looking at just that He answered If thats all they see thats all theyll get This is a question that comes from not knowing how to lookPeople of discernment can take anything at all and put it to good useOne year  when Ajaan Fuang was seeing a Chinese doctor in Bangkok for his skin disease and staying at Wat Asokaram  a group of nuns and laypeople came to practice meditation with him every nightSome members of the group would report having this or that vision in the course of their meditation and finally one of the nuns complained I know that my mind isnt slipping off anywhere its staying right with the breath all the time so why arent I having any visions like everyone elseAjaan Fuang answered her Do you know how lucky you areWith people who have visions this that and the other thing is always coming in to interfereBut you dont have any old karma to get in the way of your meditation so you can focus directly on the mind without having to get involved with any outside things at allDont be amazed by people with visionsVisions are nothing else but dreamsThere are true ones and false onesYou cant really trust themA Bangkok housewife who was practicing meditation with Ajaan Fuang heard some of his other students say that meditation without visions was the straight pathIt so happened that she had frequent visions in her meditation and so hearing this made her wonder why her path was so winding and convolutedWhen she asked Ajaan Fuang about this he told her Having visions in your meditation is like having lots of lush wild greens growing along the side of your pathYou can gather them as you go along so that youll have something to eat along the way and youll reach the end of the path just like everyone elseAs for other people they might see the greens without gathering them or may not even see them at all  because their path goes through arid landPeople who practice concentration fall into two groups those who have signs via the eyes when their minds settle down and those who have signs via the bodyPeople in the first group are the ones who see visions of people animals whateverThose in the second group dont have visions but when their minds settle down their bodies will feel unusually heavy or light large or small etcWhen these people focus on the elements in their body theyll notice them as feelings warmth coolness heaviness spaciousness and so forthIf Im teaching people like this how to meditate I dont have to worry about them too much because there arent many dangers in their path  aside from the danger of their getting discouraged because they dont see anything happening in their meditationThe ones I worry about are those in the first group because they have lots of dangersTheir visions can lead them to jump to all sorts of false conclusionsIf they dont learn the right way to deal with their visions theyll get stuck on them and never be able to reach any higher level than thatVisions  or whatever things appear in the course of your meditation Its not the case that you shouldnt pay any attention to them for some kinds of visions have important messagesSo when things like this appear you have to look into how theyre appearing why theyre appearing and for what purposePeople who have visions have a doubleedged sword in their hands so they have to be carefulThe things that appear have their uses and their dangersSo learn how to squeeze out their uses and leave the dangers behindUsually if any of Ajaan Fuangs students saw a vision of their own body in meditation hed have them divide it up in the vision into the four elements  earth water wind and fire  or into its basic parts and then set fire to it until it was nothing but ashesIf the same vision reappeared hed have them deal with it the same way again until they were quick at itOne of his students a nun was practicing this sort of meditation every day but as soon as she had divided the body into its parts and was getting ready to set fire to it another image of her body would appear right next to the firstAs soon as she was getting ready to cremate the second one another one would appear right next to it and then another and another like fish lined up on a platter waiting to be grilledAs she looked at them she felt fed up with the idea of continuing but when she mentioned this to Ajaan Fuang he told her The whole purpose in doing this is to get fed up but not fed up with the doingAnother technique Ajaan Fuang taught for dealing with an image of ones own body would be to focus on what it looked like the first week in the womb the second week the third and so on to the day of birth then the first month after that the second month the first year the second year and so on up until old age and deathOne woman was trying this technique but it seemed too slow to her so she focused on five and tenyear intervals insteadWhen Ajaan Fuang found out he told her Youre skipping over all the important parts and then made up a new set of rules Think of your head and then think of pulling out one hair at a time and placing it in the palm of your handSee how much you can pull out and then replant it one hair at a timeIf you havent finished dont leave your meditation until you doIf you want to pull it out in bunches okay but you have to replant it one hair at a timeYou have to go into the details like this if you want to gain anything good from itOne of Ajaan Fuangs students asked him Why is it that the intuitions I get from my concentration come in such short flashes without letting me catch the whole picture He answered When they put a record on a record player the needle has to keep bearing down continually if youre going to hear the whole storyIf you dont keep bearing down how can you expect to know anythingAnother student was sitting in meditation with Ajaan Fuang when she saw an image of a dead person in her concentration asking for a share of some of the merit from her practiceThis made her feel creepy so she told Ajaan Fuang Theres a ghost in front of me Than PhawThats not a ghost he respondedThats a personNo its really a ghost she insistedIf thats a ghost he said then youre a ghostIf you see it as a person then you can be a person tooAfter that he told her to spread thoughts of goodwill if she saw anything like that again and the image would go awaySo from that point on thats what shed do at the drop of a hat the minute she saw an image of a dead person in her meditationWhen Ajaan Fuang found out about this he taught her Wait a minuteDont be in such a hurry to get rid of themFirst look at what condition theyre in and then ask them what karma they did to become that wayIf you do this youll begin to gain some insight into the DhammaSeveral weeks later she had a vision of an emaciated woman holding a tiny childThe woman was wearing nothing but dirty rags and the child was crying without stopThe student asked the woman in her vision what she had done to be so miserable and the answer was that she had tried to have an abortion but both she and the child had died as a resultHearing this the student couldnt help feeling sorry for them but no matter how much she spread thoughts of goodwill to them it didnt seem to help them at all because their karma was so heavyThis had her upset so she told Ajaan FuangHe replied Whether or not they can receive your help is their business and none of yoursDifferent people have different karma and some are beyond help for the time beingYou give what you can but you dont have to go back and make an official inquiry into how things turned outDo your duty and leave it at thatThey ask for help you give them what you canThey appear for you to see so that youll learn more about the results of karmaThats enoughOnce youre finished go back to the breathShe kept following Ajaan Fuangs instructions until one day it occurred to her If I keep giving giving giving like this will I have anything left for myself When she told her doubts to Ajaan Fuang he gave her a blank look for a second and then said Boy you really can be narrowhearted when you want to be cant you Then he explained Goodwill isnt a thing like money that the more you give the less you haveIts more like having a lit candle in your handThis person asks to light his candle from yours that person asks to light hersThe more candles you light the brighter it is for everyone  including youTime passed and one day she had a vision of a dead man asking her to tell his children and grandchildren to make merit in such and such a way and to dedicate it to himWhen she left meditation she asked permission to go inform the dead mans children but Ajaan Fuang said What forYoure not a mailmanEven if you were he doesnt have any money to pay your wagesWhat kind of proof are you going to give them that what you say is trueIf they believe you youre going to get carried away and think that youre some special kind of psychicEverywhere you go youll keep smiling this little smile to yourselfAnd if they dont believe you you know what theyll say dont youWhat Than PhawTheyll say youre crazyThere are true visions and false visionsSo whenever you see one just sit still and watch itDont get pulled into following itYou should watch visions the same way you watch TV Just watch it without getting pulled inside the tubeSome of Ajaan Fuangs students would have visions of themselves or their friends in previous lifetimes and get all excited about what they sawWhen theyd report their visions to Ajaan Fuang hed warn them You arent still wrapped up in the past are youYoure foolish if you areYouve been born and died countless aeonsIf you took the bones of all your past bodies and piled them up theyd be taller than Mount SumeruThe water in all the oceans is less than the water of the tears youve shed over all the sufferings big and small youve been throughIf you reflect on this with real discernment youll feel disenchanted with states of being and no longer take pleasure in birthYour mind will aim straight for nibbanaIn Ajaan Fuang gained large numbers of new studentsOne of them wondered why this was the case and so asked herself about it in her meditationThe answer came to her that Ajaan Fuang had had many children in a previous lifetime and now they had been reborn as his studentsWhen she left meditation she asked him why this was so figuring that hed tell her that he had once been a king with a large harem but instead he said I was probably a fish in the sea laying who knows how many eggs at a timeOne evening a school teacher was meditating at home and began remembering her previous lives all the way back to the time of King AsokaIn her vision she saw King Asoka beating her father mercilessly over a trivial infraction of palace etiquetteThe next morning she went to tell Ajaan Fuang about her vision and it was obvious that she was still furious with King Asoka for what she had seen him doAjaan Fuang didnt affirm or deny the truth of her visionInstead he spoke to her anger in the present Here youve been carrying this grudge for over years and where is it getting youGo ask forgiveness of him in your mind and have done with itIts good that most people cant remember their previous livesOtherwise things would be a lot more complicated than they already areOne woman who at that point wasnt yet a student of Ajaan Fuang was practicing meditation at home on her own when she had a vision of a sentence  somewhat like Pali but not quite  appearing in her meditationSo she copied it down and went from wat to wat asking various monks to translate it for herNo one could until she met one monk who told her that it was in arahant language and only an arahant could understand what it saidThen he had the gall to translate it for her after which he told her to bring him any other sentences she got from her visions and hed translate them tooShe wasnt completely convinced of what he had said and happened to mention it to Ajaan Fuang when she first met himHis response WhatArahant languageThe minds of arahants are above and beyond conventionsWhat kind of language would a mind like that havePeople for the most part dont like the truthThey prefer makebelieve insteadThere were occasions when some of Ajaan Fuangs students would gain knowledge of one sort or another in their visions get carried away with it and yet he wouldnt take them to taskOne day the seamstress asked him why he didnt warn such people that their practice was going off course and he told her You have to look at how mature they areIf theyre really adults you can tell them straight outIf their minds are still infants you have to let them play for a while like a child with a new toyIf youre too harsh with them they might get discouraged and give up completelyAs they begin to mature theyre sure to start seeing for themselves whats proper and whats notDont have anything to do with the past or the futureJust stay with the present  thats enoughAnd even though thats where youre supposed to stay youre not supposed to latch onto itSo why do think you should latch on to things where youre not even supposed to stayYou know that you shouldnt believe even your own visions so why go believing the visions of othersIf you cant let go of your visions youll never gain releaseOne of Ajaan Fuangs students asked him When you see something in a vision how can you know whether its true or falseHis answer Even when its true its true only in terms of conventionYou have to get your mind beyond both true and falseThe purpose of the practice is to make the heart pureAll these other things are just games and entertainmentWhatever you experience simply be aware of itYou dont have to take after itThe primal heart has no characteristicsIts aware of everythingBut as soon as things make contact within or without they cause a lapse in mindfulness so that we let go of awareness forget awareness in and of itself and take on all the characteristics of the things that come laterThen we act out in line with them  becoming happy sad or whateverThe reason were this way is because we take conventional truths and latch on to them tightIf we dont want to be under their influence well have to stay with primal awareness at all timesThis requires a great deal of mindfulnessOne of Ajaan Fuangs students was feeling mistreated by the world and so went to him for consolationHe told her Whats there to feel mistreated aboutYoure the one thats swayed under the events that have hit you thats allContemplate whats happening and youll see that the mind is something separateEvents come passing in and then go passing bySo why be influenced by themKeep your mind right at the simple awareness that these things come and soon theyll be gone so why follow themWhat really is yoursWhen you die you wont be able to take any of these things with you so why waste time wanting anythingTheres nothing you have to want at allMake your mind quietMake it oneYou dont have to concern yourself with your own attainments or those of other peopleSimply be awareThats enoughWhenever anything hits you let it go only as far as awareDont let it go all the way into the heartAll you need to do is keep your sense of simple awareness solid and strong and nothing will be able to overwhelm youStay with awareness itself at all times  except when you sleepThe minute you wake up stay right at awareness and it wont be long before discernment arisesOne woman who practiced meditation with Ajaan Fuang came to feel that she had split into two people one person acting and one watchingShe felt this way both while sitting in meditation and while she wasnt  to the point where she didnt feel like sitting in meditation at all because she felt that sitting and not sitting were in no way differentShe asked him about this and he told her If you dont want to you dont have to sitJust keep this sense of the watcher going at all timesSitting with your eyes closed is simply an external conventionJust keep watchingWhen the mind and the body become separate like this the body cant press on the mindIf the body presses on the mind the mind will have to be under the influence of what goes on in the bodyRight awareness has to be paired with the breathTo be aware means to be aware as soon as defilement arises to see defilement and not act under its powerTheres no past here and no future only the presentNo man no woman no sign of any kind at allTheres nothing not even selfWhat self there is is only in a conventional senseOnce awareness is solid you have to get above and beyond itIn one of Ajaan Fuangs students had to move to Hong Kong and so he set up a small meditation center thereIn one of his letters he asked Ajaan Fuang to write out a short outline of the main points of the practice and this was the answer he receivedFocus on all six of the elements earth water wind fire space and consciousnessWhen youre acquainted with each of them meld them into one and focus on them until they grow stable and strongYour energy will gather together until both the body and the mind feel fullWhen the physical elements are balanced and in harmony theyll grow full and the mind will let go of them on its own and turn to onenessThe elements will be one the mind will be oneSo now you turn your attention to the mindFocus on the mind until you become fully aware of itThen let go of that awareness together with whatever knowledge youve gained and there wont be anything leftLet go even of the events in the present that youre aware ofThats when intuitive discernment will arise and meditation comes to an endOne night Ajaan Fuang took a group of his students up to sit in meditation at the chedi on top of the hill in Wat DhammasathitLooking out to the south in the inky darkness they could see the bright lights of the fishing boats far out at seaHe commented When youre up on a high place like this you can see everything For one woman listening this had special meaning because she knew he wasnt referring just to the view from the hill Everything that happens to you has its causesOnce you contemplate it skillfully until you know its causes youll be able to get past itOur defilements have made us suffer enough alreadyNow its our turn to make them sufferThere are two kinds of people those who like to think and those who dontWhen people who dont like to think start meditating you have to force them to contemplate thingsIf you dont force them theyll simply get stuck like a stump in concentration and wont get anywhere at allAs for those who like to think they really have to use force to get their minds to settle downBut once theyve mastered concentration you dont have to force them to contemplateWhatever strikes the mind theyre sure to contemplate it right awayThe discernment that can let go of defilement is a special discernment not ordinary discernmentIt needs concentration as its basis if its going to let goFor insight to arise you have to use your own strategiesYou cant use other peoples strategies and expect to get the same results they didWhen insights arise dont try to remember themIf theyre real insights theyll stay with youIf you try to memorize them theyll turn into labels and concepts and will get in the way of new insights arisingA meditator in Singapore once wrote a letter to Ajaan Fuang describing how he applied the Buddhas teachings to everyday life Whatever his mind focused on he would try to see it as inconstant stressful and not selfAjaan Fuang had me write a letter in response saying Do things ever say that theyre inconstant stressful and not selfThey never say it so dont go faulting them that wayFocus on what labels them for thats where the fault liesEven though your views may be right if you cling to them youre wrongThe wife of a Navy lieutenant was meditating at home when suddenly she had an urge to give Ajaan Fuang a good tonguelashingNo matter how much she tried to drive the thought out of her mind she couldntSeveral days later she went to ask his forgiveness and he told her The mind can think good thoughts so why cant it think bad thoughtsWhatever its thinking just watch it  but if the thoughts are bad make sure you dont act in line with themA high school student once said that in practicing meditation if his mind thought good thoughts hed let them pass but if it thought bad thoughts hed put a stop to them right awayAjaan Fuang told him Just watch themSee who it is thats thinking good thoughts and bad thoughtsThe good thoughts and bad thoughts will disappear on their own because they fall under the Three Characteristics of inconstancy stress and notselfIf the mind is going to think let it think but dont fall for its thoughtsThe defilements are like duckweedYou have to keep pushing them out of the way so that you can see the clear water underneathIf you dont keep pushing them aside theyll move in to cover the water again  but at least you know that the water underneath them is clearA woman complained to Ajaan Fuang that she had been meditating for a long time but still couldnt cut any of her defilementsHe laughed and said You dont have to cut themDo you think you canThe defilements were part and parcel of this world long before you cameYou were the one who came looking for themWhether or not you come they exist on their ownAnd who says that theyre defilementsHave they ever told you their namesThey simply go their own waySo try to get acquainted with themSee both their good and their bad sidesOne day Ajaan Fuang was explaining to a new student how to watch the arising and passing away of the defilementsIt so happened that she was a veteran reader of many Dhamma books so she offered her opinion Instead of just looking at them this way shouldnt I try to uproot themIf all you can think of is uprooting them he replied their fruit just might fall on the ground and start growing againOne of Ajaan Fuangs students told him that she had reached the point in her meditation where she felt indifferent to everything she encounteredHe warned her Sure you can be indifferent as long as you dont run into anything that goes straight to the heartEveryone lives with suffering suffering suffering but they dont comprehend suffering which is why they cant free themselves from itThose who know dont sufferThose who dont know are the ones who sufferTheres suffering in every life  as long as there are the five khandhas there has to be suffering  but if you really come to know you can live in easeWhen youre sick you have a golden opportunityYou can contemplate the pains that arise from your illnessDont simply lie thereMeditate at the same timeContemplate the behavior of the pains as they ariseDont let the mind fall in with themOne of Ajaan Fuangs students was taking cobalt treatments for cancer until she developed an allergic reaction to the anesthesiaThe doctors were at a loss as to what to do so she suggested that they try the treatment without the anesthesiaAt first they were reluctant to do so but when she assured them that she could use the power of her meditation to withstand the pain they finally agreed to give it a tryAfter the treatment Ajaan Fuang visited her at the hospitalShe told him that she had been able to concentrate her mind so as to endure the pain but it had left her exhaustedHe advised her You can use the power of concentration to fight off pain but it squanders your energyYou have to approach the pain with discernment to see that its not youIts not yoursYour awareness is one thing the pain is something separateWhen you can see it in this way things will be easierSeveral months later the same woman went to hear a famous Bangkok monk give a sermon on the cycle of life death and rebirth as an ocean of sufferingIt had a profound effect on her and afterwards she went to visit Ajaan Fuang and told him about itAs she was speaking the image of the ocean struck her as so overwhelming that tears came to her eyes so he said Now that you know its an ocean why dont you just cross over to the other side That was enough to stop her tears The Buddha didnt teach us to cure our painsHe taught us to comprehend themIts true that illness can be an obstacle to your meditation but if youre intelligent enough to take illness as your teacher youll see that the body is a nest of illnesses and that you shouldnt cling to it as yoursYou can then uproot the attachments that are concerned about the body  because nothing in it is yours at allIts simply a tool for you to use to make good karma and pay off your old bad karma debts as you are ableWhen you focus on seeing pain and stress you have to get to the subtle levels  to the point where you see that stress arises the instant you open your eyes and see thingsAdvice for a woman who had to live with one illness after another Use your mindfulness to contemplate the body until you can visualize it as bones falling down in a heap and you can set them on fire until theres nothing leftThen ask yourself Is that your selfThen why does it make you suffer and feel painIs there any you in thereKeep looking until you reach the true core of the Dhamma  until theres nothing of yours at allThe mind will then see itself as it really is and let go of its own accordTell yourself The reason I still feel suffering is because I still have an IThe day will arrive when death comes to you forcing you to let go of everything of every sortThats why you should practice letting go well in advance so that you can be good at itOtherwise  let me tell you  its going to be difficult when the time comesYou dont have to be afraid of deathYoud do better to be afraid of birthWhen you die dont get caught up on the symptoms of dying Lift the mind above what it knowsWhatever dies let it die but dont let the heart dieA taperecorded talk given to one of his students who had reached an impasse in her meditationOnce the mind is firmly established in the breath you then try to separate the mind from its object  from the breath itselfFocus on this The breath is an element part of the wind elementAwareness of the breath is something elseSo youve got two things that have come togetherNow when you can separate them  through realizing the breaths true nature as an element  the mind can stand on its ownAfter all the breath isnt you and you arent the breathWhen you can separate things in this way the mind gains powerIts set loose from the breath and is wise to the breaths every aspectWhen mindfulness is full its wise to all the aspects of the breath and can separate itself from themNow if it so happens that your mind is strong and your mindfulness sharp while youre doing this thats when insight occursThe knowledge will arise in that moment letting you know that youve really let goIf your mindfulness is still weak though you wont be able to let goOnly when your mindfulness is really resilient will you have mindfulness and insight arising togetherThis is something you have to keep contemplating whenever you have the chanceWhen you can separate the mind from its objects itll be freed from all its burdensSo focus your attention right down in the area of the heartKeep it focused there and then observe the breath and what it is thats aware of the breathBe as observant as you can and eventually youll see that they separate from each otherWhen theyve separated that gives you the chance to investigate further insideAnd once youve investigated this one element youll find that what you learn applies to everything elseWhen you investigate the breath youll find that its not a being not a person  so what is there to latch on toYou cant latch on to it as your self for it simply goes its own wayWhen you look at the breath youll see that it doesnt have a body  no head no legs no hands no feet nothing at allWhen you see this you let go of it in line with the way it really isThe texts say Cago patinissaggo mutti analayo You move out of the breathYou remove your concerns for itYou dont make it your home any longer  because its not yoursYou let it go in line with its original natureYou give it backWhatever its got you give it back to natureAll of the elements  earth water wind fire and space  you give back to natureYou let them return to what they originally wereWhen you examine all five of these things youll see that theyre not a being not a person not us not themYou let them all return to their original nature in every wayThis then brings us to the mind what it is thats aware of these five elementsWhat is it going to stay with nowTurn your powers of observation on this knowing element that is now standing on its own with nothing else leftExamine it to see whats what and thats when another level of insight will ariseIf you want to gain the insight that will let go of all things in line with their original nature there has to be a special realization that arises in the act of letting goIf there isnt this realization your letting go is simply an ordinary everyday label or perceptionIts mundane discernmentBut when this special realization arises in the act of letting go  the instant you let go the result comes right back at you verifying certifying whats happened for what it really is You knowYouve let goYou then experience the purity within youThis is called transcendent discernmentWhen the realization arises within you verifying what youve seen and what youve done thats called transcendent discernmentAs long as this realization doesnt arise your discernment is still mundaneSo you keep working at your investigation into things until all the conditions are ripeThen when theyre ripe theres nothing more you have to do for transcendent discernment penetrates things completely the very instant it arisesIts not like mundane discernment at allThe path we follow then is to be observant to investigate thingsKeep making a focused investigation until you reach the strategic pointWhen the mind reaches that point it lets go on its ownWhat happens is that it reaches a point of fullness  the Dhamma within it is full  and it lets goOnce it lets go the results will appear immediatelySoKeep on practicingTheres nothing to be afraid ofYoull have to reap results theres no doubt about itYou reap results all along the wayLike right now while youre sitting in meditation hereYou know that the breath and the mind are comfortable with each otherThats a result of the practiceEven though you havent yet reached the end of the path youre still gaining a sense of comfort and ease in your meditationThe mind is at peace with the inandout breathAs long as the mind and breath cant separate from each other they have to help each other alongThe mind helps the breath and the breath helps the mind until they can get fully acquaintedOnce the mind gets fully acquainted it can let goWhen it knows it lets goAs long as it doesnt really know it wont really let goWhat this means is that you have to associate with the breath spend time with it and gradually come to know itAs the mind gets more and more acquainted it will be able to unravel its attachments to body feelings perceptions thoughtconstructs and consciousnessIts identityviews  seeing these things as the self  will fall awayThis is the way to freedomThe moment this transcendent discernment arises youll be freeYoull be able to disentangle yourself from all the conventional truths of the world that say person self man woman us them and so onBut as long as you cant yet let go you still have to depend on these thingsTheyre your resting spots but not your refugeYou simply lean on each other and help each other along so that you can make progress on your wayYou cant abandon these things for theyre the path of your practiceAs long as you stick with the practice you wont fall backBut as soon as you let up on the practice youll start backsliding immediatelyYoull fall prey to doubts wondering whether or not the Dhamma is trueYou have to keep being observant of the mind awareness itselfIts not the case that the mind isnt aware you knowIts basic nature is awarenessJust look at itIts aware of everything  aware but it cant yet let go of its perceptions of the conventions it holds to be trueSo you have to focus your investigation on inFocus on in until the mind and its objects separate from each otherSimply keep at itIf youre persistent like this without letup your doubts will gradually fade away fade away and eventually youll reach your true refuge within you the basic awareness called buddha that sees clearly through everythingThis is the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha appearing within you as your ultimate refugeThis is when youll know whats actually within whats actually without whats actually a resting spot and whats really your refugeYoull be able to distinguish these thingsThings outside are simply resting spotsLike the body Its a resting spotFor the brief moment that the elements of earth water wind and fire stay balanced together you can rest with the bodyBut as for your true refuge youve already seen itIts this basic awareness itself within the mindYour awareness of the breath is a refuge on one levelWhen it separates from the breath its a refuge on another levelAnd as for your true refuge  buddha  thats the awareness that lies further withinOnce you realize this thats all there isIts sovereign in and of itselfIt knows clearly and truly all aroundThats the true refuge within youAs for things outside theyre just temporary supports things you can depend on for a little while like a crutchAs long as theres the breath to keep them alive you make use of themWhen theres no more breath thats the end of the problemThe physical elements separate and no longer depend on each other so the mind returns to its own true refugeAnd where is thatJust where is that buddha awarenessWhen weve trained the mind to be its own refuge there will be no sorrow at that moment in the meditating heartThe Buddhas own search was for this refugeHe taught all of his disciples to take refuge in themselves for we can depend on others only for a little whileOther people merely show us the wayBut if you want whats really true and good in life you have to depend on yourself  teach yourself train yourself depend on yourself in every wayYour sufferings come eventually from youYour happiness eventually from youIts like eating If you dont eat how are you going to get fullIf you leave it up to other people to eat theres no way youre going to get fullIf you want to be full you yourself have to eatIts the same with the practiceYou cant let yourself latch on to things outside youThings outside are inconstantImpermanentUndependableThey change with every inandout breathThis holds not only for you but for everyoneIf you dont part from one another while youre still alive you part when you dieYou part from things with every inandout breathYou cant base the meaning of your life on these things  and you dont have toYou can simply tell yourself that this is the way things are all over the worldThe world offers nothing lastingWe dont want things to be that way but thats the way they areThey dont lie under anyones control at allThis is true not only with things outside but also with things within youYou want the body to stay alive you dont want it to die but its going to dieYou dont want it to change but it changes constantlyThis is why you have to get your mind in shape so that it can take refuge in itself in line with the principles of the skill the Buddha taughtAnd you dont have to feel doubts about the practice for all the qualities you need to develop in the practice are already present within youAll forms of good and evil are present within youYou already know which path is the good one which path is the shoddy one so all you have to do is train your heart to hold onto the good pathStop and take a look at yourself right now Are you on the right pathWhatever is wrong dont latch onto itLet go of itPast future whatever let go of it leaving only the presentKeep the mind open and at ease in the present at all times and then start investigatingYou already know that things outside arent you or yours but inside you there are many levels you have to examineMany levels you have to examineEven the mind isnt really yoursThere are still inconstant and stressful things inside itSometimes it wants to do this sometimes to do that its not really yoursSo dont get too attached to itThoughtconstructs are the big issueSometimes they form good thoughts sometimes evil thoughts even though you know betterYou dont want to think those things and yet they keep appearing in the mind in spite of your intentionsSo you have to regard them as not being yoursExamine themTheres nothing dependable about themThey dont lastTheyre impersonal events so let them go in line with their own natureAnd what is there thats lasting solid dependable and trueKeep looking on inFocus your mindfulness on the breath and ask yourself right thereEventually youll come to see whats what within youWhenever you have any doubts or problems in the practice focus down on the breath and ask the mind right there and understanding will arise to loosen up your wrong views and help you past your impasseBut even this understanding is inconstant stressful and notselfSabbe dhamma anatta Everything that arises the Buddha said is inconstant and not selfEven the understandings that arise in the mind arent constantSometimes they arise sometimes they dontSo dont get too attached to themWhen they arise take note of them and then let them follow their own courseLet your views be Right Views ie just right not going overboardIf you go overboard with them you latch on tight to them and then they turn wrong on you for youve lost sight of what youre doingWhat this all boils down to is that the more mindfulness in your practice the betterAs your mindfulness gets more and more mature more and more complete it turns into something transcendentThe transcendent discernment we mentioned above arises from the power of your mindfulness as it becomes more and more completeSo keep training your mindfulness until its Great MindfulnessTry to keep it constant persistent and focused until you see all things for what they areThats how youll advance in the Buddhas teachings Our practice is to go against the stream against the flowAnd where are we goingTo the source of the streamThats the cause side of the practiceThe result side is that we can let go and be completely at easeThe stages of the practice Actually the different stages dont say what they areWe simply make up names for themAs long as you stay stuck on these madeup names youll never get freeWhen teaching people you have to teach them in line with their temperaments and aptitudes but eventually they all come to the same point letting goNibbana is subtle and takes a lot of discernmentIts not something that the force of desire can reachIf we could get there through the force of desire everyone in the world would have gotten there by nowSome people talk about temporary nibbana temporary nibbana but how can nibbana be temporaryIf its nibbana it has to be constantIf its not constant its not nibbanaWhen they say that nibbana is empty they mean that its empty of defilementRight where theres no one to be pained no one to dieRight thereIts in each and every personIts as if your hand were palmdown and you turn it palmup  but only people of discernment will be able to do itIf youre dense you wont see it you wont catch on to it you wont go beyond birth and deathThe heart when its released is like the fire element in the airWhen fire goes out it isnt annihilated anywhereIt still permeates space simply that it doesnt latch onto any kindling so it doesnt appearWhen the mind goes out from defilement its still there but when new kindling comes it doesnt catch fire doesnt latch on  not even to itselfThats whats called releaseFrom Keeping the Breath in Mind by Ajaan LeeThere are seven basic stepsBe clearly aware of each inandout breathObserve the breath as it goes in and out noticing whether its comfortable or uncomfortable broad or narrow obstructed or freeflowing fast or slow short or long warm or coolIf the breath doesnt feel comfortable change it until it doesFor instance if breathing in long and out long is uncomfortable try breathing in short and out shortAs soon as you find that your breathing feels comfortable let this comfortable breath sensation spread to the different parts of the bodyTo begin with inhale the breath sensation at the base of the skull and let it flow all the way down the spineThen if you are male let it spread down your right leg to the sole of your foot to the ends of your toes and out into the airInhale the breath sensation at the base of the skull again and let it spread down your spine down your left leg to the ends of your toes and out into the airThen let the breath from the base of the skull spread down over both shoulders past your elbows and wrists to the tips of your fingers and out into the airLet the breath at the base of the throat spread down the central nerve at the front of the body past the lungs and liver all the way down to the bladder and colonInhale the breath right at the middle of the chest and let it go all the way down to your intestinesLet all these breath sensations spread so that they connect and flow together and youll feel a greatly improved sense of wellbeingLearn four ways of adjusting the breathBreathe whichever way is most comfortable for youOr better yet learn to breathe comfortably all four ways because your physical condition and your breath are always changingBecome acquainted with the bases or focal points for the mind  the resting spots of the breath  and center your awareness on whichever one seems most comfortableA few of these bases areIf you suffer from frequent headaches or nervous problems dont focus on any spot above the base of the throatAnd dont try to force the breath or put yourself into a tranceBreathe freely and naturallyLet the mind be at ease with the breath  but not to the point where it slips awaySpread your awareness  your sense of conscious feeling  throughout the entire bodyUnite the breath sensations throughout the body letting them flow together comfortably keeping your awareness as broad as possibleOnce you are fully aware of the aspects of the breath you already know in your body youll come to know all sorts of other aspects as wellThe breath by its nature has many facets breath sensations flowing in the nerves those flowing around and about the nerves those spreading from the nerves to every poreBeneficial breath sensations and harmful ones are mixed together by their very natureTo summarize for the sake of improving the energy already existing in every part of your body so that you can contend with such things as disease and pain and for the sake of clarifying the knowledge already within you so that it can become a basis for the skills leading to release and purity of heart  you should always bear these seven steps in mind because they are absolutely basic to every aspect of breath meditationBhikkhus they do not savor the deathless who do not savor mindfulness of the body they savor the deathless who savor mindfulness of the bodyA skeleton wrapped up in skinThe body is thought to be most obviously me what I regard as the most tangible part of myselfAround it therefore are constructed many views all of them distorted to some extent which prevent insight arising into the body as it really isThis book is a small anthology relating to the body in various ways and presents material which if contemplated by the earnest and sincere student of Dhamma will eventually provide fruitful insight and thereby freedom from the many desires and fears centered on the bodySuch desires for pleasures in which the body is the instrument awaken and intensify greed of all kinds for food or sex for instanceGreed which is often accompanied by pleasurable sensations  and therefore desired  needs a rather bitter medicine to combat it hence the number of pieces here on the unattractiveness of the body its decay and death  all unpleasant mattersSome of the material concerned with bodily unattractiveness is like a medicine which need only be taken while the disease of greedlust is active and afterwards may be discontinuedIt is important to understand this and not to form the mistaken impression that the Buddha advocated viewing all beauty as loathsomeIt is only that there is a hook in beauty which tangles with the greed in ones own heart and leads to more and more complications and difficultiesFears center around agingdecay disease and deathThey are not overcome by pretending they do not exist as the ostrich is said to bury its head in the sand at the approach of enemiesOnly resolutely facing these inevitable features of life can bring insight and relief from fearThe Buddhas instructions on contemplation of the body are addressed to those who are able through their lifestyle to practice themThis means in effect monks and nuns together with dedicated lay peopleThe former group have this contemplation given to them by their Teachers at the time of Goingforth from home to homelessness and they need such a medicine to combat lust which is destructive to the celibate Holy LifeLay people keeping the Five Precepts have contentment with their partners as an important part of their practiceSex is a natural part of their life but should still be restrained and kept within the bounds of the Third PreceptIf not how much trouble followsBut some of them may wish to live without sexual attachment and this cannot be done in the way of Dhamma by ignoring the power of the sexual drive or by suppressing itOnly when it is treated with mindfulness can it be transcendedThe aspect of mindfulness which is needed for this is the subject or rather the interrelated subjects of this bookIn the world today people are subjected to a bombardment of sensuality by way of the mass mediaSex especially is used as a bait to sell things and as a titillation of sensory experienceWhen this subjection is continued the defilements of the mind notably lust greed and attachment are sure to be strengthenedThen when this has happened the result is not more happiness only an increase of dukkha suffering trouble and difficultiesThe medicine for such overindulgence and overstimulation is given in this bookIt is said that this subject of meditation is unique to the Buddhas Teachings and that elsewhere it is not clearly taughtThis is not surprising as we find that desire is sometimes accepted as being natural Wherever desires are viewed as natural that is inherent in ones nature or self nothing much can be done about themBut the Buddha analyzed desires into those which are wholesome  to practice Dhamma for instance  and the unwholesome ones among which are greed and lustThey may not be gross either as in the case of the meditator who is greedy for bliss or visions and attached to such thingsThe Buddha has provided the medicine for all unwholesome desires and according to our various ways of life we can use it to effect partial or complete curesWhen the emphasis is so much on sensuality youth and beauty as we find now the darker sides of life get pushed away and attempts are made always unsuccessful to sweep them under the carpetThose who try to do so will not be pleased with the exercises contained in the Buddhas contemplation of the bodySuch things will appear to them as morbid and unnaturalYet they are also a part of this life and should not be ignoredAnd if the effort is made to ignore what is unpleasant about the body sooner or later one will be jolted into the recognition of these thingsSuch jolts are not pleasantRather than leave it until one is forced to know the bodys unpleasant sides it is better to acquaint ones emotions with this knowledge graduallyIn this spirit Bag of Bones is being publishedUnfortunately being only a book it cannot give persontoperson advice on special problemsIt can only offer some general guidelines to people who are interested in reducing their greed and lustA word of warning meditation on the unattractiveness of the body can be very potent and should only be practiced with moderation and care especially if one has no personal contact with a Teacher of Buddhist meditationIf fear and anxiety or other extreme unwholesome emotional states arise after practice of it then it will be better to lay it down and take up Lovingkindness or Recollection of the Buddha as ones meditation insteadThis book therefore is not so much for beginners in Buddhism but rather for those who have already practiced for some timeMay it inspire many people to practice the Dhamma more intentlyTranslations which have no ones name after them are by the compilerAnd all other reflections dialogues and poems too are his work and have been jotted down as they occurred to him mostly in the peaceful Forest Hermitage of VenNyanaponika Mahathera outside KandyMay I also here acknowledge the venerable Mahatheras kind advice and help in bringing this collection to printBhikkhus when one dhamma is developed and cultivated it leads to a great sense of urgency to great benefit to great safety from bondage to great mindfulness and full awareness to obtainment of knowledge and insight to a pleasant abiding here and now to realization of the fruit of true knowledge and deliveranceWhat is that one dhammaIt is mindfulness occupied with the body A transVenanamoli M Mindfulness of the BodyWhen anyone has developed and repeatedly practiced mindfulness of the body he has included whatever wholesome dhammas there are that partake of true knowledgeJust as anyone who extends his mind over the great ocean has included whatever streams there are that flow into the ocean so too when anyone has developed and repeatedly practiced mindfulness of the body he has included whatever wholesome dhammas there are that partake of true knowledge M transVenanamoli This my body consists of the four great elements is procreated by a mother and father is built up out of boiled rice and bread is of the nature of impermanence of being worn and rubbed away of dissolution and disintegration and this my consciousness has that for its support and is bound up with it M transVenanamoliNow this body that has material form consists of the four great elements it is procreated by a mother and father and built up out of boiled rice and bread it has the nature of impermanence of being worn and rubbed away of dissolution and disintegrationIt must be regarded When a man regards it thus he abandons his desire for the body affection for the body and his habit of treating the body as a basis for his inferences M transVenanamoliYou live by following the bodyEating when its hungry resting when its tired dressing when necessary urinating defecating going to work to get money  all for whatFor this bodyThen what about the time when its end comesWhat was it all forHow much time do you spend on your body How much time do you spend on your mindThree things we never forget to do for the bodyThree things we usually forget to do with the mindThe mind gets dirty and needs washing it becomes hungry and needs nutriment and it is most of the time diseased and needs curingWhy are we so forgetful of our own goodAnd what is gratification in the case of formSuppose there were a girl of warriornoble cast or brahmin caste or householder stock in her fifteenth or sixteenth year neither too tall nor too short neither too thin nor too fat neither too dark nor too fair is her beauty and loveliness then at its heightYes venerable sirNow the pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on that beauty and loveliness are the gratification in the case of formAnd what is danger in the case of formLater on one might see that same woman here at eighty ninety or a hundred years aged as crooked as a roof doubled up tottering with the aid of sticks frail her youth gone her teeth broken grey haired scantyhaired bald wrinkled with limbs all blotchy how do you conceive this bhikkhus has her former beauty and loveliness vanished and the danger become evidentYes venerable sirBhikkhus this is the danger in the case of form M The Mass of Suffering transVenanamoliNBWomen reading this should change the sex of the person in the above Verses of the Elder Bhikkhunis Come bhikkhus abide contemplating ugliness in the body perceiving repulsiveness in nutriment perceiving disenchantment with all the world contemplating impermanence in all formations M transVenanamoliDirectly counter goes this to the worlds way which is to see beauty in the body or at any rate disguise the ugliness to delight in food both physical and mental to be enchanted with the world and to regard mental formations as a basis for a permanent self or soulRohitassa a devaLord the worlds end where one is neither born nor ages nor dies nor passes away nor reappears is it possible to know or see or reach that by traveling thereThe BuddhaFriend that there is a worlds end where one is neither born nor ages nor dies nor passes away nor reappears which is to be known or seen or reached by traveling there  that I do not sayYet I do not say that there is ending of suffering without reaching the worlds endRather it is in this fathomlong carcass with its perceptions and its mind that I describe the world the origin of the world the cessation of the world and the way leading to the cessation of the world S A trans VenanamoliThe current rash of so much porn has the effects we see increased and open expression of greed and lustThe meditation techniques which can cure these diseases are all the different aspects of mindfulness concerned with the body  for they cut the body down to size without harming it while emphasizing the importance of the mindContemplation of the bodys unattractiveness is not a popular meditationPeople are happy to try to rid themselves of anger and hatred because they are painfulThis can be done by the wellknown meditations developing lovingkindnessBut meditating upon the nature of this body dulls the appetites rooted in greed  and greed is often associated with pleasureAnd isnt pleasure what this lifes all aboutSafely bagged by Mara  Death and Lord of the sensual realmWhen the body is not washed it attracts flies and vermin which feed on itWhen the mind is not purified but is full of lust hate and delusion what does it attractThe body is so near yet like an unexplored continentLarge areas in it are a blankWhile this is so greed lust and craving dwell safely in the jungles of ignorancePeoples attitudes to the body are liable to swing from the extreme of indulging the desires connected with the body to the other extreme of mortifying itThe Middle Way of mindfulness regarding the body is unknown to themWhen desires connected with bodily pleasures can be indulged which means that greed rules the mind aversion only arises if ones aims are thwarted but when a person has undertaken some method of selfdiscipline not guided by wisdom then suppressed desires find their outlet not only by aversion but also by bodily mortificationAs though the body was responsibleSo having no wisdom people subject their bodies to disciplines and rigors of various kinds in order they think to control strong desiresThen aversion that is selfhatred in a more or less subtle form reigns supreme and sufferings are increasedDesires can never be understood in this way only suppressedThe only way to understand desires is through mindfulness and the various exercises on mindfulness of the body are for this purposeThere are very few beings who do not suffer from lust in this world of sensuality at any rateIt is a great sickness of the mind an epidemic with no beginning and no end in sight for most beingsWise men want to be cured of this disease and the Buddha offers for this the medicine of contemplating the unattractive in ones own bodyOne should not try to see the ugly or foul in othersThis could turn to hatred  even if not it could result in a sour grapes attitude to themTowards others maintain one of the Divine Abidings lovingkindness compassion joywithothers or equanimity but towards ones own selfish desires for pleasure develop the seeing of unattractivenessTrue love which is cool unattached metta and compassion for others sorrows do not grow when people are bound up with greed and sensualityWhen lust arises in the mind which leads to more defilements more burning desires in future just take a look at this butchers shop of a bodyAnything attractive about red meatAre white bones specially lovableOr coiled innards desirableLust soon disappears when the body is regarded in this wayRepeating this practice lust becomes weaker and arises less oftenno one who searches earnestly throughout the whole of this fathomlong carcass starting from the soles of the feet upwards starting from the top of the hair downwards and starting from the skin all round ever sees even the minutest atom of pureness in it such as a pearl or a crystal or a beryl or aloes or sandalwood or saffron or camphor or talcum powder etc on the contrary he sees nothing but various very malodorous offensive drablooking sorts of impurity consisting of headhair bodyhairs and the rest MR iii transVenanamoliThe practice of this mindfulness attending to the body can begin by reciting this passageIn this very body from the soles of the feet up from the crown of the head down surrounded by skin full of these various mean impurities he reviews thusThere are in this bodyIn this very body from the soles of the feet up from the crown of the head down surrounded by skin full of these various mean impurities he reviews thus M Satipatthana Sutta transVenanamoliThere is no unhealthy selfdisgust or aversion here just seeing what is unattractive as it really isBut in later times some teachers went to extremes in this matterOne must suspect in such a case not the proper dispassion with the body but rather perverted passionLust can switch to aversion and hatred quicklyIt is a remarkable thing that the first five parts on this list  the person we see  are all deadHair of the head and body lives only at its roots we see dead hairNails that we see are dead nails the quick is painful and hiddenThe teeth all that is visible are dead and their tender living roots we only experience painfully from time to timeOuter skin is dead  horrible if it was not for it is sensitive enough alreadyThe living skin below is more painfulSo when we get excited about a visual form  someone elses body  we are stimulated by impressions of what has died alreadyStrange to be excited by what is dead on the outside and dying withinHowever the real lure is in our own minds the thoughts of lust that arise there and embellish the corpse before usApart from this live bodies and dead ones differ only in degreeLust fastens only on the bodyBut lovingkindness and compassion are concerned with the wellbeing of peoples minds and bodiesWhen we see a person we see just the first five of the parts headhair bodyhair nail teeth and skinWhen headhair is of certain colors and forms bodyhair present or absent according to sex and race nails cut and cleaned teeth white polished and with none missing and skin well washed and unblemished by scars or wrinkles and covering flesh of certain shapes  then with all these conditions fulfilled desire arisesWhat about grey or white hair on the head or body  thin and straggly nails cracked dirty and broken teeth yellow or mostly missing and skin wrinkled and blotchyWho gets excitedStaring at corpses as recommended by commentarywriter Buddhaghosa in his Path of Purification is not really to the pointOne has inwardly to stare at this corpse to accomplish anythingAnd he gets much too complicated in his descriptions of how to do the actual practice which does not require a lot of categories and analysis or things to be learnt by heartThis applies to both the meditation of corpses and to the parts of the bodyIn the latter case just a few parts are needed for repetition and inspection and even one will be sufficient if ones mind wandersSimplicity and directness cut out the clutter of thoughts  and clearing those out is the way to get into meditation MR iii Again a bhikkhu judges this same body as though he were looking at bodily remains thrown on a charnel ground bones without sinews scattered in all directions here a hand bone there a foot bone there a shin bone there a thigh bone there a hip bone there a back bone there a rib bone there a breast bone there an arm bone there a shoulder bone there a neck bone there a jaw bone there a tooth bone there the skullThis body too is of such a nature it will be like that it is not exempt from thatIn this way he abides contemplating the body as a body in himself or he abides contemplating the body as a body externally or he abides contemplating the body as a body in himself and externallyOr else he abides contemplating in the body its arising factors or he abides contemplating in the body its vanishing factors or he abides contemplating in the body its arising and vanishing factorsOr else mindfulness that There is a body is simply established in him to the extent of bare knowledge and remembrance while he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world from M transVenanamoliWhen the mind is calm look into this bony frame to see its emptiness how the wind blows through itWho owns these bonesIt seems that as the Elder was on his way from Cetiyapabbata to Anuradhapura for alms a certain daughterinlaw of a clan who had quarreled with her husband and had set out early from Anuradhapura all dressed up and tricked out like a celestial nymph to go to her relatives home saw him on the road and being lowminded she laughed a loud laughWhat is that the Elder looked up and finding in the bones of her teeth the perception of foulness he attained arahatshipBut her husband who was going after her saw the Elder and asked Venerable sir did you by any chance see a woman The Elder told him The Path of Purification I A mound of about five feet high of bones skulls long bones and vertebrae all mixed upNo knowing where one persons bones ended and anothers beganOver them all the hot sun beat down and bleached them the rains lashed down and washed them these remains of unknown poor people waiting to be cremated in a Chinese graveyard in BangkokA rare and stirring sight in these days of windowdressingSuppose that during meditation this bony frame appeared to ones minds eye but when one opened the eyes at the meditations end the bones of the hand or other parts were still visible without their covering of decent flesh  how upsetting for oneself  and others if they too could see itHow very odd to be so fearful of a part of ones own bodyOnce there was a man who had charge of a hothouse in which a great variety of tropical waterlilies and gourds were growingOn this particular afternoon it was cold and raining outside so that a continuous stream of visitors entered to warm themselves and admire the exotic plantsHaving sprayed the plants over with water from a hose the man bent down to turn off the tapWhen he raised his eyes he saw not people but a procession of skeletonsThe vision lasted a moment and was goneAn indication of what sort of meditation he should practice perhapsBhikkhus the bones of a single person journeying on wandering on for an eon would make a cairn a pile a mound as great as Mount Vepulla were there a collector of those bones and if the collection were not destroyed Itivuttaka Just as when a space is enclosed by timber and creepers grass and clay there comes to be the term house so too when a space is enclosed by bones and sinews flesh and skin there comes to be the term form M para transVenanamoli MRagain MR quoting Questions of Milinda Monks it is just like an ulcer that had been growing for many years having nine gaping wounds nine lesions and whatever discharged and oozed out of it would be foul and stinking it would be loathsomeUlcer monks is a name for this body consisting of the four great elements procreated by mother and father and built up out of rice and breadIt is subject to impermanence to breaking up and wearing away to dissolution and to disintegration having nine gaping wounds nine lesionsWhatever discharges and oozes out of it is foul and stinks it is loathsomeTherefore monks turn away from this bodyA mans body is structurally simply a hollow ringA hollow ring elongated into a hollow cylinder with the inner portion further lengthened and coiled and above the upper orifice there bulges a head and between the upper and lower orifices the limbs stick outThe world passes in small portions through the ring helped in by spoon and gulping and out by pressure and paper A Thinkers Notebook by Venanamoli March A woman infatuated came to a bhikkhu and stripped off her clothesThe bhikkhu without batting an eyelid said Now take off your skinBeauty is skindeep  how true this saying isWho wants a beautiful body without skinHow fragile is skin but how strong is lustAnother view of the bodyOn this subject we have alsoAs to sharing the body with many This body is shared by manyFirstly it is shared by the eighty families of wormsThere too creatures live in dependence on the outer skin on the inner skin on the flesh on the sinews on the bones on the marrow feeding on these thingsAnd there they are born grow old and die evacuate and make water and the body is their maternity home their hospital their charnel ground their privy and their urinalThe body can also be brought to death with the upsetting of these wormsAnd just as it is shared with the eighty families of worms so too it is shared by the several hundred internal diseases as well as by such external causes of death as snakes scorpions and what not The Path of Purification Chapter VII  SuttaNipata Vijaya Sutta Verses  Verses of the Elder Bhikkhus  Verses of the Elder Bhikkhus  Verses of the Elder Bhikkhus His family tried to snare him with the bait of his former wives and good food into returning to the household life at which he said M transVenanamoliThe vast array of beauty products for both male and female should make people thinkIf it is so necessary to beautify the body what is it really like Wijayasiri AmaratungaThe body is like a leaky barrel oozing all the timeBut a barrel can be bunged up while the body must continue oozing its whole lifeA drum has four characteristics  it is round in section covered by hide is beaten frequently and emits soundIn the same way the body has four characteristics it is round in section or fairly much so it also is covered by hide it is beaten by the many sorts of physical and mental dukkha and emits sound  that is the sounds indicating pleasure which is unreliable and impermanent and those which accompany sufferings such as weeping and lamentationAnd who is the beaterHis name is CravingThe Buddha saidBirth is dukkha disease is dukkha decay is dukkha death is dukkha  all this is dukkha related to this bodyIt is interesting that each sort of dukkha has special institutions in Western society to screen it off from the generality of people who are in between these events so to speakBirth takes place in maternity wards and nursing homesOther parts of the same hospital take care of disease For decay we have old peoples homes and the geriatric wards while death may occur in all such places the corpse then going on to the undertakers chapels and to religious ritesThings hidden away are unhealthyLook at the dukkhaLook at itWhen one considers how many things afflict this body it is a wonder that it keeps going so well and for so longMany many kinds of dukkhaThere is so much dukkha connected with this body which people never notice due to shifting around from one position to anotherWhen tired of walking or standing they sit down when tired of sitting they stand or lie down when they have enough of lying down they get upWalking an unexpectedly long distance is dukkhaStanding long in queue is dukkhaSitting in even a comfortable chair for hours is dukkhaLying in a hospital bed for days or weeks is dukkhaBy changing position we evade the dukkha or make it less obviousBut when someone starts to meditate spending hours on walking meditation hours on sitting meditation  then this bodily dukkha can be felt and investigatedThe uninstructed ordinary person bhikkhu has a saying There is a bottomless abyss in the great ocean But the uninstructed ordinary person speaks of what does not exist of what cannot be found that is that there is a bottomless abyss in the great oceanA designation for painful bodily feeling bhikkhus is this term bottomless abyss When an uninstructed ordinary person experiences painful bodily feeling he grieves is afflicted laments beats his breast cries out loud and becomes distraughtSo it is said bhikkhus the uninstructed ordinary person has not emerged from the bottomless abyss has not obtained a firm footholdBut bhikkhus when an instructed Noble Disciple experiences painful bodily feeling he does not grieve is not afflicted does not lament nor beat his breast nor cry out loud nor become distraughtSo it is said bhikkhus the instructed Noble Disciple has emerged from the bottomless abyss and has obtained a firm foothold SXXXVI transVenNyanaponikaWhy does one say formIt is deformed that is why it is called form Deformed by whatBy cold and heat and hunger and thirst by contact with mosquitoes flies wind sunburn and creeping things SXII transVenanamoliOne could play similar word games in English Why is it called a bodyBecause it is ones abode therefore it is a body or again because it bodes no good therefore it is a body  though this is rather pessimistic perhapsTo balance up one could etymologize thus It is called a body since depending on it bodhi is discoveredLook at it like thisTheres a wardrobe with lots of clothes to cover your bodyAre they all neededThere is a pantry stacked with foodIs all that variety and quantity neededTheres the house one lives in with its furnishingsIs it too large or too luxuriousTheres that medicine chest of pills and creams and whatnotCan you use them allAre they all neededThen read these verses The Path of Purification ChXI para Pansa Food arranged nicely on plates is attractive to the eyes and noseIt looks good  It smells goods  people sayWhen it reaches the mouth it is attractive to the tongue and touchThey say How good it tastes or Real crunchyBut just spit it out  attractive to the eyes now or notGreed can only arise if conditions are right for itAnd how attractive is the same food spewed up after a few hours in the bellyIt becomes even less desirable when after a day or two its remains are expelledThree stages for contemplationAs the meditator finds out without food the body becomes weak with much food it is heavy and disturbed two kinds of dukkhaThe only way is to know moderation in food neither altogether abstaining which can easily become the extreme of selfmortification nor overeating which is just the other extreme of sensual pleasure Translated from a traditional Pali recollection Yatha paccayam At one time the Lord was staying at Ayojjhaya on the bank of the river GangesThere the Lord addressed the bhikkhus as follows Suppose bhikkhus a large fleck of foam were floating on this river Ganges and a clearsighted man were to see it observe it and properly examine itHaving done this it would appear to him to be empty insubstantial without essence  for what essence could there be in a fleck of foamIn the same way bhikkhus whatever body past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near that a bhikkhu sees observes and properly examines It would appear to him to be empty insubstantial without essence  for what essence could there be in a body The Kinsman of the Sun made clear from SXXII BWhose is that bodyRIts mine of courseBBetter be careful with that of course Anyway how do you know its your bodyRWell I see it  every day for yearsBSo its yours because you see itRYesBesides I feel its mineBOKSo thats another reason why it belongs to youYou feel it  rightRSureIt feels like meBAny other evidence that its yoursWhat about the other sensesRI suppose you could say that I hear it tooMy guts gurgle and my feet thump the deckOf course it smells like me tooTasteOh I dont think that helps identify it very muchSo thats all the senses and they tell me that it is mineBYouve left out the most important sense  the mindThat tells you this is my body all the timeRYes if you want to call mind a senseYes it identifies what is mine and what is notBWell I dont think it is so easy to tell what is ones own and what is notROh thats easyI have power over what is mine  like my own bankaccountI can do what I like with itBI see that you have a bandaged fingerShow me how much power you have over it by healing it instantlyRCant do that you knowIts not naturalBWell now what is naturalAnd does power over a thing signify ownershipFor instance that bit of dead wood over thereIs it myselfROh come on of course notBBut its quite natural and one can do nothing about making it live againWhen it lived that life was conditioned by many factors now its dead because of those factors changeYet you say my bodyTIt is mineIt has belonged to me since I was bornBRightoThen your body which you cant heal  at least you know when it is going to dieRNo Ive no idea butBBut its your body and you cant cure it cant stop it getting old cant stop it dying you dont even know when that bodys going to dieBut still its your bodyHow much yoursBAnd who is the owner anywayThis body bhikkhus is not yours nor is it othersIt should be seen as produced by past kamma volitions and feelingsRegarding this the learned noble disciple thoroughly and systematically attends to dependent origination This being that is from the arising of this that arises this not being that is not from the cessation of this that ceasesThat is to say Unknowing conditions kammaformationsThe brain proclaimed Im the boss hereGet up instantly lazy bonesGroans from the bones Im brokenIm smashedWho are you ordering around anywayYeah who is heGarnWe boss the lot unless we are whole the contraption cant standOutcry from the tendons You bonesll stand up by yourselves will

bag to go shopping and it gets filled up with what we want if we pay the priceIn the same way this skin bag gets filled up according to our desiresAnd we pay the price old age and deathThe BuddhaHere lifes for mortals wretched and brief unknown its end incalculable and tis to dukkha joinedThat those who are born will never die no means are there indeedHaving reached decay theres death thus is the law for beingsAs for fruit that is ripe theres always fear of falling so for mortals who are born theres always fear of deathJust as vessels made of clay by a maker of pots all end by being broken so death is of lifeThe young and those whore great in age the fools together with the wise all go under the sway of death for all death is the goalThose who are overcome by death and going to another world the father cannot protect his son nor relatives their kinWhile relatives are watching weeping and lamenting see mortal beings one by one led as an ox to slaughterAs the world is thus afflicted by death and by decay therefore the wise grieve not knowing the nature of the worldTheir path you do not know by which they come by which they goNeither end is seen by you useless your lamentIf then by lamenting benefits were obtained then the wise would do so a fool just hurts himselfNot by crying nor by grief the mind attains to peace but still more dukkha is produced the body as well is harmedOne becomes both pale and thin  one merely hurts oneself not thus are the dead protected its useless to lamentBy not forsaking grief one goes to greater dukkha bewailing those whove died ones in the sway of griefSee other men who go along go according to kamma so beings tremble here with fear come under the sway of deathHowever they conceive it its quite other than that just so is separation  see the nature of the worldThough one lived for hundred years or even more such a man is separated from his kin and here he leaves his lifeSo having heard the arahats give up your lamentationSeeing the corpse Hell not be met by me againAs a burning house with water should be extinguished so one wise and steadfast a man whos wise in wholesomeness quickly is rid of arisen grief as wind a tuft of downOne who desires his own happiness let him pull out his own arrow  lamentations and longings the grief thats in himselfArrow withdrawn unattached the mind attains to peace passed beyond all grief griefless and extinguished Salla Suttas Suttanipata verses  Jara Sutta Suttanipata verses  From the Dhammapada commentary story of the Weavers daughterAs soon as evening comes or when the night vanishes and day is breaking a bhikkhu reflects in this way Truly there are many possibilities for me to die  I may be bitten by a snake or stung by scorpion or centipede  and thereby lose my lifeBut this would be an obstacle for meOr I may stumble and fall down or food eaten may not agree with meOr bile phlegm and piercing bodily winds may upset me  and thereby I may lose my lifeThen men or ghosts may attack me  and thereby I may lose my lifeBut this would be an obstacle for me Then the bhikkhu should consider thus Are there still found in me unsubdued evil unwholesome factors which if I should die this day or night might lead me to dukkha Now if he understands that this is the case he should use his utmost resolution energy effort endeavor steadfastness attentiveness and clearmindedness to overcome these evil unwholesome factors A transafter VenNyanatiloka in Buddhist Dictionary P From Middle Length Discourses No transVenanamoli TheraShort indeed is this life of men

emptiness and no me perceiving it what thenInteresting that religions concern themselves so much with the dead bodiesCeremonies of various sorts are all conducted round the lifeless lumps of decaying fleshYet each religion is concerned really with whatever is thought of as continuingIt shows that attachment to the body as the person is very strongAnd in English we talk of the dead as opposed to the living But for a Buddhist there are no dead people only decaying bodiesParadoxically a person while not rid of the concept of personality never diesVillagers in Buddhist countries are often better schooled in the body and its end than are educated WesternersThe former have plenty of chances to go to the local temple or to see the nearest meditation teacherAnd what do they hearAgain and again they hear the sound of ANICCA DUKKHA ANATTA of all parts of the human being mind and bodyBy hearing frequently it sinks in so that even if people never penetrate these Three Marks of Existence in themselves at least they have an attitude of accepting them to some extentIt helps with decay disease and deathAnd they see friends and kin cremated not in a posh chapel with soft music solemn colors and concealed oven but on top of a pile of logs in the forestThats the body burning  theres that smell of meatand this body too will go the same wayThese things are good to seeThey are healthy wholesomeThere is no false solemnity things are just the way they areUndisguisedPeople in Buddhist lands who have so often heard teaching about ANICCA impermanence are more ready to accept the common end than a great many WesternersOld age disease and death are better accepted by Buddhists as just as natural a part of life as birthOne does not bewail the birth of a child  though painful enough for both mother and child  so why bewail the naturally succeeding eventsBuddhists who know the Dhamma well talk naturally and calmly about their old age and death as they have contemplated as ANICCA everything in this worldThere is nothing like living in a little hut in the tropical forest to make one realize how vulnerable this body is to all sorts of attackHow very small creatures can make life difficult if not precarious for this bodyA citydweller misses most of this and may easily get a false sense of securityAnother thing which life in the wilds makes really necessary is mindfulnessMindfulness where one puts ones feet specially in the darkAnd then one cannot get on without lovingkindness too since all sorts of other beings are so near to oneself near to this body which one fears forLovingkindness rids one of such fears and hatredsWe have so many fears  all things out there  ghosts darkness unknown people loneliness and so onThe really fearful things this mindandbodys precarious state we never seeThe body has a side which most of us dont want to see and knowWe wish to hush up its dirt stinks belches and farts to disregard and overlook themYet finally when laid low and near to death these stenches and filths can be disguised no longerIt is a salutary lesson if one gets the chance to go to an autopsy and watch the doctors and nurses pulling a body to piecesOnes eyes are not prepared for this sight even if one has watched a butcher chopping up meatAnd ones nose can well be assaulted too by the overpowering stench of decay if the corpse is just a few days oldTo see this is to experience for oneself some Dhamma how the body is just conditioned and decaying bits and piecesAs this body is so that body was as that body is so this body will beLists like the following ten stages of the bodys decay are often illustrated in traditional Buddhist art in ancient books and on temple walls as often seen in ThailandThese are like special prescriptions for the disease of lust Francis Story from The Buddhist Outlook Verses of the Elders Bhikkhus The Knowing and Seeing  insight  that this thera saw in himself is firstSeeing no difference between the living and the dead bodies  only time makes a differenceThen seeing the dead body as totally foul  not attracted to this or repelled by that and applying this to his own bodyThen seeing that all the time day or night the body has the same qualities  not that it is desirable at some times but not at othersThe enjoyments that most get from sensespleasures  here the example of a quintet is given  this thera has found far more abundantly in seeing Dhamma rightlySpiritual objectorAll this pondering over corpses and looking into the bodys parts is just morbidOne should look at the body as a pure temple of the spiritPractical UpasakaIt goes against the grain to gaze at the bits and pieces in this body and see that they have nothing attractive about themBut this way lies LiberationTo glorify the body is to be bound by craving for itDoctorI cannot understand you when you say that the body is unbeautiful to me it is such a wonderful machineThe trouble with that view of the wonderfulness of the body is that it is near delight and delighting in the body is another name for craving the root of dukkhaSeeing the bodys unattractiveness is opposed to cravingYoure wrong man sex is just natural like breathing  just something youve got to doJust like eatingIts a beautiful natural functionNot trueYour comparisons are not aptHow comeYou mean its not naturalYes sex is natural for people with desire that means sexdesire or lust in their heartsBut lust is a hindrance to the development of mentalemotional purityBut your comparisons to breathing and eating dont stand examinationBreathing is an automatic body functionNo kamma good or bad is made because no intention is needed to decide to breatheEating is different because though necessary for the bodys life it is connected with intention so kamma is madeWhen greed for food is present bad kamma is made which will fruit as sufferingBut when food is eaten mindfully and just to keep the body going then good kamma is made  of mindful reflectionSex is different from both theseNo sex takes place without desire or lust this is among the unwholesome mental factors  it can never be karmically wholesome  so unwholesome kamma is made which has the nature to limit the mind to sensual thingsThats painting sex too blackNo thats being realisticOf course states of mind will vary while one has sex  more or less lust and more or less of lovingkindnessMore lust means more bad kammaMore lovingkindness as between two people deeply attached to each other less bad kamma and more good kammaIn the latter case it is called kamma which is dark and bright with a dark and bright resultMIts all the work of Satan  this foul bodyWe agree with you Buddhists about thatBWell the body is certainly not pleasant when examined but we do not say that it has been created by SatanMBut all matter is evil foul dragging the soul into darkness as our Mani saysBThats not what the Buddha says thoughMatter is just earth water fire and air elements which are quite neutral neither good nor evilThey form bodies due to kamma made by beings good or evil kammas both lead to the formation of bodiesMYou must admit though that your body is a hindrance to the attainment of spiritual statesYou have to feed it and rest it dose it with medicine when it gets sickBecause of its wretchedness the soul is weighed downBNo I do not admit thatThe body is the basis and vehicle for practice so one should take care of it without pampering itThough it has to eat sleep excrete and it gets sick too at these times we should be mindful which is possible at all times when not asleepEven the difficulties of the body can be used in DhammapracticeAnd what is this about a soul being weighed downMWell that is the pure aspirations the pure thoughts the still states of contemplation  that is the beginning of discovering the soulBOh then the impure aspirations thoughts and confused states of mind must be not soulYou should investigate all mental states pure and impure calm and distracted and find out whether any of them are substantial or permanentWhat would you find do you thinkMAll right theyre changingBut behind them all is the pure tranquil soul eternally unchangingBBut have you experienced this or are you just telling me some dogma or beliefMYes I think I have experienced itThen one is free from the trammels of this bodyBReally you need to examine all mental states as I mentioned before and the body too in the same lightTheyre all Anicca Dukkha AnattaMWhatBSorryI get so used to using those words that they have slipped off my tongue unmindfully I am afraidThey mean impermanent unsatisfactory and no selfWhen you look at them like this you neither love the soul nor hate the bodyThat is put in a Buddhist way you dont cling to pure tranquility and identify it as your soul or self neither do you reject this bodyDont lay the blame on this poor old bodyIts not to blameMBut Mani says that it isBWell then I shall ask you a questionWhat makes decisions and choices is it the body or the mindMThe mind decides of courseBThen how can the body be blamedIt is not evil nor is matter darknessPoor old body just gets dragged along by the decisions the mind makesMBut you Buddhists practice contemplation of the body as foulI have read about itBYes but that does not mean it is evilThat kind of meditation is just to break up the attachment to the beauty of bodiesIt is the attachment in ones own mind not any Satan or evil creator that is responsible for keeping the mind tied down to sensual pleasuresLook inside for the evil creator  his name is attachment greed desire lust  and he is put out of business by contemplating the unattractiveThe good creator is in there too the mind that creates pure mental states the experience of jhana and so onBut all this creating keeps one in the round of rebirth you knowAHey manWhy you cut your hair and beardHairs natural to have but you monks cut it offWe should keep it its natural its beautifulBhikkhu Its cut off for two reasonsFirst it decorates this bodyYou people like decorationThats what lay life is all aboutBut bhikkhus like the body plain without distractions so that they can see what its really likeAWell whats it really likeBIf you like it as it is naturally you should try not washing not brushing the teeth or cleaning the nails not combing the hair  and so onBody and its parts are only beautiful if washing is also naturalASo you said that hair decorates whats your other reasonBIts a disguise that beard and moustache  its something to hide behind a maskWhen you have no hair on the head and face you have no mask behind which to retireIs it natural or beautiful to hide thingsIsnt it better to open upWho solves problems by hiding them awayShaving hair and beard is also an outer token of the shaving off of conceit and pride which has to be done steadily and carefully over years of practiceThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThere are two things beginning meditators should search for as external aids to their practiceSuitable companions Be judicious in choosing people to associate withSearch only for companions who have peace of mindThis can be any group at all as long as the group as a whole is aiming for mental peaceA suitable location Choose a quiet place with an agreeable atmosphere far from human societyPlaces of this sort providing physical seclusion are conducive to the practice of meditationExamples listed in the Canon include caverns and caves the shade of an overhanging cliffface the forest wilderness and empty houses or buildings where not too many people will come passing byPlaces like this are an excellent aid and support for a beginning meditatorWhen you go to stay in such a place dont let your thoughts dwell on topics that will act as enemies to your peace of mindFor example dont preoccupy yourself with magic spells or the black artsInstead call to mind and put into practice those principles and qualities that will be to your benefitFor exampleSantutthi Be content with the possessions you already haveViveka Aim solely for peace quiet and seclusionAsansagga Dont entangle yourself with human companionshipViriyarambha Be singleminded and persistent at making the mind still and at peaceSilanussati Reflect on your own conduct to see if youve overstepped any of your precepts and  if you have  immediately purify your behavior through your own intentionSamadhikatha Focus on calling to mind the meditation theme on which your mind can become firmly establishedPaññakatha Focus exclusively on those topics that will give rise to discernment and clear insightVimutti Make the mind welldisposed toward the search for release from all defilementsVimuttiñanadassana Focus on contemplating how to come to the realizations that will enable you to gain release from the fermentation of all defilementsThese principles are guidelines for meditators of every sort and will direct the mind solely to the path leading beyond all suffering and stressWhat follows is a shorthand list of essential principles selected to help prevent meditators from getting tied up in the course of their practiceThese principles though should be viewed merely as incidental to the DhammaThe reality of the Dhamma has to be brought into being within ourselves through our own energies This is called practicing the DhammaIf we go no further than the lists well end up with only concepts of the DhammaOur ultimate aim should be to make the mind still until we reach the natural reality that exists on its own within us that knows on its own and lets go on its ownThis is the practice of the Dhamma that will lead us to the realization of the Dhamma  the true taste and nourishment of the Dhamma  so that we will no longer be caught up on the ropesIn other words conceptualized Dhamma is like a rope bridge for crossing over a riverIf we take the bridge down and then carry it with us it will serve no purpose other than to weigh us down and get us all tied upSo no matter how much conceptualized Dhamma you may have memorized when you come to the point where youre practicing for real you have to take responsibility for yourselfWhether you are to win or lose let go or cling will depend on how much quality youve built into your own mindThis is why we are taught not to cling to the scriptures and texts to meanings and conceptsOnly when we train ourselves to get beyond all this will we be heading for purityAttahi attano nathoNothing can help us unless we can rely on ourselvesOnly when we realize this will we be on the right trackThe Buddha attained all of the truths he taught before he put them into wordsIt wasnt the case that he came up with the words first and then put them into practice laterHe was like the scientists who experiment and get results before writing textbooksBut people who simply read the textbooks know everything  for example they may know every part in an airplane  but they cant produce one out of their own knowledgeTo be a consumer and to be a producer are two different thingsIf we cling merely to the concepts of the Dhamma simply memorizing them were no more than consumersOnly if we make ourselves into producers so that others can consume will we be acting properlyTo be successful producers we have to accept responsibility for ourselvesIf theres any area where we dont succeed we should make use of our own ingenuity until we doIf we rely merely on the ingenuity of others then we cant depend on ourselvesAnd if we cant depend on ourselves why should we let other people think that they can depend on usThis is why I have compiled this list of principles merely as a brief beginning guide for meditatorsTecivarikanga the practice of using only

sympathy pity aspiring to find a way to be truly helpfulMudita appreciation for the goodness of other people and for our own when we are able to help themUpekkha When our efforts to be of help dont succeed we should make the mind neutral  neither pleased nor upset by whatever it focuses on  so that it enters the emptiness of jhana centered and tranquil to the point where it can disregard acts of thinking and evaluating as well as feelings of rapture and ease leaving only oneness and equanimity with regard to all objects and preoccupationsViññanancayatana being absorbed in boundless consciousness as ones preoccupation with no form or figure acting as the sign or focal point of ones concentrationAkiñcaññayatana focusing exclusively on a fainter or more subtle sense of cognizance that has no limit and in which nothing appears or disappears to the point where one almost understands it to be nibbanaNevasaññanasaññayatana being absorbed in a feeling that occurs in the mind that isnt awareness exactly but neither is it nonawareness ie there is awareness but with no thinking no focusing of awareness on what it knowsThese four formless absorptions are merely resting places for the mind because they are states that the mind enters stays in and leavesThey are by nature unstable and inconstant so we shouldnt rest content simply at this levelWe have to go back and forth through the various levels many times so as to realize that theyre only stages of enforced tranquillityOne resolution into elements ie regarding each part of the body simply in terms of physical properties or elementsOne perception of the filthiness of food ie viewing food as something repugnant and unclean  with regard to where it comes from how its prepared how its mixed together when its chewed and where it stays in the stomach and intestinesWith one exception all of the meditation themes mentioned here are simply gocara dhamma  foraging places for the mindTheyre not places for the mind to stayIf we try to go live in the things we see when were out foraging well end up in troubleThus there is one theme thats termed vihara dhamma or anagocara Once youve developed it you can use it as a place to stayWhen you practice meditation you dont have to go foraging in other themes you can stay in the single theme thats the apex of all meditation themes anapanassati keeping the breath in mindThis theme unlike the others has none of the features or various deceptions that can upset or disturb the heartAs for the others The ten foul objects can give rise after a while to visions and sometimes to sense of alienation and discontent that turns into restlessness and distress your mind being unable to fashion anything on which it can come to rest to the point where you cant eat or drink The ten kasina after youve stared at them a long while can give rise to visions that tend to pull you out of your sense of the body as you become enthralled by their color and features to the point where you may become completely carried away As for the resolution into elements when you become more and more engrossed in contemplating the elements everything in the world becomes nothing more than elements which are everywhere the sameYou come to believe that you no longer have to make distinctions Youre nothing more than elements members of the opposite sex are nothing more than elements food is nothing more than elements and so you can end up overstepping the bounds of morality and the monastic discipline As for the perception of the filthiness of food as you become more and more caught up in it everything becomes repulsiveYou cant eat or sleep your mind becomes restless and disturbed and you inflict suffering on yourself As for the four sublime abodes if you dont have jhana as a dwelling for the mind feelings of good will compassion and appreciation can all cause you to sufferOnly if you have jhana can these qualities truly become sublime abodes that is restful places for the heart to stayThus only one of these themes  anapanassati keeping the breath in mind  is truly safeThis is the supreme meditation themeYou dont have to send your awareness out to fix it on any outside objects at allEven if you may go foraging through such objects dont go living in them because after a while they can waver and shift just as when we cross the sea in a boat When we first get into the boat we may feel all right but as soon as the boat heads out into the open bay and were buffeted by wind and waves we can start feeling seasickTo practice keeping the breath in mind though is like sitting in an open shelter at dockside We wont feel queasy or sick we can see boats as they pass by on the water and people as they pass by on landThus keeping the breath in mind is classed as anagocara an exercise in which you focus exclusively on the breath while you sit in meditation without having to compound things by sending your awareness out to grab this or get hold of that and as dhammathiti ie all you have to do is keep your mind established firm and in placeThe beginning stage is to think buddho  bud with the inbreath and dho with the outFixing your attention on just this much is enough to start seeing resultsTheres only one aim and thatsIf there is anything youre unsure of or if you encounter any problems then consult the following pagesThis handbook on keeping the breath in mind has had a number of readers who have put it into practice and seen results appearing within themselves in accordance with the strength of their practiceMany people have come to me to discuss the results theyve gained from practicing the principles in this book but now its out of printFor this reason Ive decided to enlarge it and have it printed again as an aid for those who are interested in the practiceNow if youre not acquainted with this topic have never attempted it or arent yet skilled  if you dont know the techniques of the practice  its bound to be hard to understand because the currents of the mind when theyre written down as a book simply wont be a bookThe issues involved in dealing with the mind are more than manyIf your knowledge of them isnt truly comprehensive you may misunderstand what you come to see and know and this in turn can be destructive in many waysYou may lose whatever respect you had for the practice deciding that theres no truth to itYou may gain only a partial grasp of things leading you to decide that other people cant practice or are practicing wrongly and in the end youre left with no way to practice yourselfSo you decide to let go simply through conjecture and speculationBut the truth is that this simply wont workTrue and complete letting go can come only from the principles welltaught by the Buddha virtue concentration and discernment which are a synopsis of the eightfold path he taught in his first sermonSo in our practice we should consider how virtue concentration discernment and release can be brought into beingVirtue forms the basis for concentration concentration the basis for discernment and discernment the basis for release from ignorance craving and attachmentThus in this book which is a guide to developing Right Concentration I would like to recommend to other meditators a method that in my experience has proven safe and productive so that they can test it for themselves by putting it into practice until they start seeing resultsThe main concern of this book is with the way to mental peaceNow the word peace has many levels A mind infused with virtue has one level of peace and happiness a mind stilled through concentration has another level of peace and happiness a mind at peace through the power of discernment has still another level of happiness and the peace of a mind that is released is yet another level with a happiness completely apart from the restIn these matters though meditators tend to prefer the results to the causesThey arent as interested in abandoning their own defilements through the principles of the practice as they are in standing out among society at largeThey appropriate the ideas and observations of other people as being their own but by and large their wisdom is composed of bahira pañña  remembered outsights not true insightSo when you want the reality of the principles taught by the Buddha you should first lift your mind to this principle  Right Concentration  because its an excellent gathering of the energies of your mindAll energy in the world comes from stopping and restingMotion is something that destroys itself  as when our thinking goes all out of boundsTake walking for instance When we walk energy comes from the foot at restOr when we speak energy comes from stopping between phrasesIf we were to talk without stopping without resting between phrases not only would it waste energy but the language wed speak wouldnt even be humanSo it is with practicing the Dhamma Release comes from concentration and discernment acting togetherRelease through the power of the mind requires more concentration and less discernment release through discernment more discernment and less concentration  but there is no way that release can be attained without the stillness of concentrationThus resting the mind provides the strength needed to support all the qualities developed in the practice which is why its such an essential part of Right ConcentrationIt forms a wellspring and a storage place for all knowledge whether of the world or of the DhammaIf you arent acquainted with this basic principle skilled awareness wont ariseAnd if you dont have skilled awareness how will you be able to let goYoull have to go groping around in unskilled awarenessAs long as the mind is in the grips of unskilled awareness its bound to be deluded by its fashioningsUnskilled awareness is a brine in which the mind lies soaking a mind soaked in its juices is like wet sappy wood that when burned gives off smoke as its signal but no flameAs the smoke rises into the air you imagine it to be something high and exaltedIts high all right but only like smoke or overcast cloudsIf theres a lot of it it can obscure your vision and that of others so that you cant see the light of the sun and moonThis is why such people are said to be groping Those who train their own hearts though will give rise to skilled awarenessWhen skilled awareness penetrates the heart youll come to realize the harmful potency of mental fashioningsThe arising of skilled awareness in the heart is like the burning of dry sapless wood that gives off flame and lightEven though there may be some smoke you dont pay it any mind because the firelight is more outstandingThe flame of skilled awareness gives rise to five sorts of resultsThe heart becomes purifiedThe heart becomes radiant in and of itselfThe heart develops majestyThe three skills the eight skills and the four forms of acumen will ariseAll of these things arise through the power of the mindThe nature of the mind is that it already has a certain amount of instinctive intuition  the times when it knows on its own as when you happen to think of a particular person and then he or she actually shows upAll good qualities from the mundane to the transcendent are always present in each of usThese qualities  the Dhamma  arent the exclusive possession of any particular group or personWe all have the right to develop them and put them into practiceFor these qualities to yield results we have to develop them in conjunction with the following four principlesViriya being persistent in the practiceCitta being intent on the practiceVimansa being circumspect in what we do ie circumspect before we do it circumspect while were doing it and circumspect with regard to the results that arise from what weve doneThese four principles form the foundation for success in all areas whether in matters of the world or of the DhammaOnce theyre actualized within us and focused together on a single goal were bound to succeed in line with our aspirationsThe results they yield briefly put are of two sortsPuññariddhi power in terms of the Dhamma that will accrue to meditators providing means for settling issues that relate to the world and the heart or for liberating the mind from all mundane influencesThis is termedThus I would like to invite all Buddhists  all who hope for peace and wellbeing  to reflect on the principles of practice dealing with Right Concentration presented here as a guide for those who are interestedIf you have any questions dealing with this book or any problems arising from the practice of training the mind I will be glad to give whatever advice I canMay you prosper and be wellWhoever feels that this book

easeGood will acts as a support for purity of virtue and so is an appropriate way of preparing the heart for the practice of tranquillity and insight meditationIe remove all befouling mental states from the mindThe things that befoul and darken the mind are the five Hindrances Byapada ill will malevolence hatred Thinamiddha torpor lethargy drowsiness listlessness Uddhaccakukkucca restlessness and anxiety Vicikiccha doubt uncertaintyWhen any of these unskillful states occupy the heart its not flourishing blooming or brightFor the heart to bloom it has to be free from all five of the Hindrances and for it to be free in this way we have to develop concentration or absorption which is composed of directed thought evaluation rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupationThe heart will then be clear bright and resplendentIn Pali this is called sobhanacitta Thus in this section we will discuss how to develop concentration as a means of eliminating the Hindrances as followsSit in a halflotus position your right leg on top of your left your hands palmup in your lap your right hand on top of your leftKeep your body comfortably erect and your mind on what youre doingDont let your thoughts go spinning forward or backBe intent on keeping track of the present the present of the body or the inandout breath and the present of the mind or mindfulness and allround alertnessThe present of the body and the present of the mind should be brought together at a single pointIn other words make the object of the mind single and oneFocus your attention on the breath keeping watch over it until youre clearly aware that This is the inbreath and This is the out Once you can see clearly in this way call to mind the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha gathering them into a single word Buddho Then divide Buddho into two syllables thinking bud with the inbreath and dho with the out at the same time counting your breaths Bud in dho out one bud in dho out two bud in dho out three and so on up to tenThen start counting again from one to nine then one to eight one to seven six five four three two one zeroIn other wordsKeep three points  the breath your mindfulness and your awareness  together in a single streamIf when youve finished counting you find that your mind still wont stay with the breath start by counting again from one to ten and so on to zeroKeep this up until you feel that your mind has settled down and then stay with zeroIn other words you no longer have to count you no longer have to think Buddho Simply keep careful watch over your breath and your awarenessKeep your awareness focused on a single point being mindful and watchfulDont send it in and out after the breathWhen the breath comes in you knowWhen it goes out you know but dont make your awareness go in or outKeep it neutral and stillKeep watch only on the presentWhen you can do this the five Hindrances wont be able to find entry into the mindThis is called parikamma bhavana repetition meditationAt this point the mind becomes light and can put aside its heavy burdensWhen the mind is light so is the bodyIn Pali this is called kayalahuta cittalahuta The mind is peaceful and solitary  free from agitation and unrest  clear and calm with the refined sense of the breathWhen the mind reaches this state its in the sphere of directed thought which is the first factor of jhanaNow survey and examine the characteristics of the breathTry adjusting the breath in four different ways Breathe in long and out long and see whether your mind is at ease with that sort of breathThen breathe in short and out short to see whether you feel comfortable and at ease that wayThen see whether you feel at ease breathing in long and out short or in short and out longContinue breathing in whichever of these four ways feels most comfortable and then let that comfortable breath spread throughout the different parts of the bodyAt the same time expand your sense of mindful awareness along with the breathWhen the breath runs throughout the body and the sensations of breath in the various parts of the body are coordinated they can be put to use for example to relieve feelings of painYour sense of mindfulness at this point is broad your alertness complete and matureWhen mindfulness is spread throughout the body this is called kayagatasati  mindfulness immersed in the bodyYour frame of reference is large and expansive and so is called mahasatipatthana Your alertness is present throughout aware both of the causes  ie what youre doing  and of the results coming from what youve doneAll of these characteristics are aspects of evaluation the second factor of jhanaNow that the body and mind have received nourishment  in other words now that the breath has provided for the body and mindfulness has provided for the mind  both body and mind are bound to reap results ie raptureThe body is full and refreshed free from restlessnessThe mind is full and refreshed free from anxiety and distraction broad and bloomingThis is called rapture which is the third factor of jhanaOnce fullness arises in this way body and mind settle down and are stillIn Pali this is termed kayapassaddhi cittapassaddhi This feeling of stillness leads to a sense of relaxation and ease for both body and mind termed pleasureThese are the beginning steps in dealing with the mindOnce you are able to follow them you should make a point of practicing them repeatedly back and forth until youre skilled at entering concentration staying in place and withdrawingEven just this much can form a path along which the mind can then progress for it has to some extent already reached the level of upacara bhavana threshold concentrationThese include the tip of the nose the middle of the head the palate the base of the throat the tip of the breastbone the center two inches above the navelIn centering the breath at any of these points people who tend to have headaches shouldnt focus on any point above the base of the throatCoordinate the various aspects of breath in the body such as the upflowing breath the downflowing breath the breath flowing in the stomach the breath flowing in the intestines the breath flowing along every part of the body hot breath cool breath warm breath Mesh these various sorts of breath so that theyre balanced even and just right so as to give rise to a sense of ease and comfort throughout the bodyThe purpose of examining and coordinating the breath is to expand your sense of mindfulness and awareness so that they are sensitive throughout the entire bodyThis will then benefit both body and mindThe enlarged sense of the body is termed mahabhutarupa expanded awareness is termed mahaggatam cittamThis sense of awareness will then go on to reap the benefits of its beauty that will arise in various ways leading it to the level of appana bhavana fixed penetrationThe characteristics of the inandout breath as they interact with the properties of the body can cause the properties of water and earth to be affected as followsThere are three types of blood in the human bodyThese different types of blood as they nourish the nerves in the body can cause people to have different tendenciesWarm breath can cause a person to have moderate tendencies as far as affection is concerned but strong tendencies toward a quick and violent temper  tendencies associated with angerCool breath causes weak tendencies toward affection but strong tendencies toward greed craving material objects more than anything elseIf we know clearly which physical properties are aggravating greed anger or delusion we can destroy the corresponding properties and these states of mind will weaken on their ownRemove the fuel and the fire wont blazeTo adjust these properties skillfully gives rise to discernment which lies at the essence of being skillfulAdjust the property of warmth so that the blood is clear and light red and your discernment will be quick your nerves healthy your thinking perceptive subtle and deepIn other words to make heavier use of the nerves in the physical heart is the way of the DhammaAs for the nerves of the brain to use them a great deal leads to restlessness distraction and heavy defilementsThese are just a few of the issues related to the breathThere are many many more that people of discernment should discover on their ownanadhatuvijja knowledge of the subtleties of all elements the preeminent qualities the six sense media acute insight into the qualities of the mind expertise in concentrationConcentration gives rise to liberating insight acquaintance with the process of fashioningThese are of two sortsImages of either sort can appear at certain mental moments or with certain peopleWhen the mind becomes still uggaha nimittas can appear in either of two waysUggaha nimittas of both sorts can be either beneficial or harmful true or false so we shouldnt place complete trust in themIf were thoroughly mindful and alert they can be beneficialBut if our powers of reference are weak or if we lack strength of mind were likely to follow the drift of whatever images appear sometimes losing our bearings to the point where we latch on to the images as being realUggaha nimittas are of two sortsbThoughtimages When the breath is subtle and the mind is still and unoccupied things can occur to itSometimes we may think of a question and then immediately know the answerSometimes we dont even have to think The knowledge pops into the mind on its ownThings of this sort are also classed as uggaha nimittasSometimes they may be true sometimes false sometimes mixedYou cant trust them to be absolutely trueSometimes theyre true and that truth is what leads us to fall for themFor example they may be true about three things and false about sevenOnce weve placed our confidence in them even the false things will appear true to usThis is one way of giving rise to the corruptions of insightSo when sensationimages or thoughtimages arise in one way or another you should then practice adjusting and analyzing themIn other words when a visual image arises if its large make it small far near large small appear and disappearAnalyze it into its various parts and then let it goDont let these images influence the mindInstead have the mind influence the images as you willIf you arent able to do this then dont get involved with themDisregard them and return to your original practice with the breathIf a thoughtimage arises by way of the mind stop take your bearings and consider exactly how much truth there is to the knowledge it givesEven if its true you shouldnt latch onto what you know or seeIf you latch onto your knowledge itll become a corruption of insightIf you latch on to your views theyll become a form of attachment and conceit in which you assume yourself to be this or thatThus you should let go of these things in line with their true natureIf you arent wise to them they can skew your practice so that you miss out on the highest goodana knowledge enabling you to know in an uncanny way things you never before knew such as pubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember previous lifetimesEven knowledge of this sort though can mislead youIf you learn good things about your past you may get pleasedIf you learn bad or undesirable things about your past you may get displeasedCutupapatañana Sometimes you may learn how people and other living beings die and are reborn  knowing for instance where they are reborn when they have died from this world  which can cause you to become engrossed in the various things you come to know and seeAs you become more and more engrossed false knowledge can step in and yet you still assume it to be truePiti a sense of physical and mental fullness and satisfaction full to the point of infatuation  physically satisfied to the point where you dont feel hunger or thirst heat or cold mentally satisfied to the point where you become engrossed and oblivious lazy and lethargic perhaps deciding that youve already achieved the goalWhats actually happened is that youve swallowed your mood down wholePassaddhi The body is at peace and the mind serene to the point where you dont want to encounter anything in the worldYou see the world as being unpeaceful and you dont want to have anything to do with itActually if the mind is really at peace everything in the world will also be at peacePeople who are addicted to a sense of peace wont want to do any physical work or even think about anything because theyre stuck on that sense of peace as a constant preoccupationSukha Once theres peace theres a sense of physical and mental pleasure and ease and once theres a great deal of pleasure you come to hate pain seeing pleasure as something good and pain as something badYour view of things falls into two partsPain is the same thing as pleasure When pleasure arises pain is its shadow when pain arise pleasure is its shadowAs long as you dont understand this you give rise to a kind of defilement  again you swallow your mood down wholeWhen a deep and arresting sense of relaxation stillness ease or freedom from disturbance arises you get engrossed in that feelingWhat has happened is that youre simply stuck on a pleasing mental stateAdhimokkha being disposed to believing that your knowledge and the things you know are trueOnce true takes a stance false is bound to enter the pictureTrue and false go together ie theyre one and the same thingFor example suppose we ask Is Nai Daeng at home and someone answers No he isnt If Nai Daeng really exists and hes really at home then when that person says Hes not at home hes lyingBut if Nai Daeng doesnt exist that person cant lieThus true and false are one and the samePaggaha excessive persistence leading to restlessnessYoure simply fastened on your preoccupation and too strongly focused on your goalUpatthana being obsessed with a particular item youve come to know or see refusing to let it goUpekkha indifference not wanting to meet with anything be aware of anything think about anything or figure anything out assuming that youve let go completelyActually though this is a misunderstanding of that very mental momentNikanti being content with your various preoccupations simply attached to the things you experience or seeAll of these things if we arent wise to them can corrupt the heartSo as meditators we should attend to them and reflect on them until we understand them thoroughlyOnly then will we be able to give rise to liberating insight clear knowledge of the four truthsThe factors that enable these forms of stress to arise are threebBhavatanha desire for things to be this way or that at times when they cant be the way we want them wanting things to be a certain way outside of the proper time or occasionThis is called being hungry  like a person who hungers for food but has no food to eat and so acts in a way that shows Im a person who wants to eat Bhavatanha is another factor that enables stress to arisecVibhavatanha not wanting things to be this way or that eg having been born not wanting to die not wanting to be deprived of the worldly things weve acquired for example having status and wealth and yet not wanting our status and wealth to leave usThe truth of the matter is that theres no way it can be avoidedAs soon as the change comes we thus feel stress and painDifferent states of becoming arise first in the mind then giving rise to birthThus people of discernment let go of these things causingNirodha  cessation or disbanding  to appear in the heartIn other words the mind discovers the limits of craving and lets it go through the practice of insight meditation letting go of all fashionings both good and badTo be able to let go in this way we have to developMagga  the Path  so as to make it powerfulIn other words we have to give rise to pure discernment within our own minds so that we can know the truthStress is a truth its cause is a truth its cessation and the Path are truths To know in this way is liberating insightAnd then when we let all four truths fall away from us so that we gain release from true thats when well reach deathlessnessTruths have their drawbacks in that untrue things are mixed in with themWherever real money exists theres bound to be counterfeitWherever there are rich people there are bound to be thieves waiting to rob themThis is why release has to let go of truths before it can reach nibbanaMeditators then should acquaint themselves with the enemies of concentration so as to keep their distance from all five of the Hindrances the two sorts of uggaha nimittas and the ten corruptions of insightThe mind will then be able to gain release from all things defiling dirty and dampWhat this means is that the mind doesnt hold onto anything at allIt lets go of supposings meanings practice and attainmentAbove cause and beyond effect Thats the aim of the Buddhas teachingsThose who want to get rid of kamatanha  desire and attraction for the six types of sensory objects  have to develop virtue thats pure all the way to the heart This is termed heightened virtueThose who are to get rid of bhavatanha  thoughts that stray out choosing objects to dwell on  first have to develop Right Concentration pure and circumspect This is termed heightened mindThose who are to get rid of vibhavatanha  attachment to knowledge and viewpoints attainments and states of becoming theories and conceits  will first have to develop clearseeing discernment cognitive skill thats pure and fully developed This is heightened discernmentThus the threefold training  virtue concentration and discernment  is a group of truths that can let go of the causes of stressOther than this theres no way to releaseIe keep death in mindThis is where the mind advances to the development of liberating insight taking death as its themeDeath here refers to the death occurring in the present  physical sensations arising and passing away mental acts arising and passing away all in a moment of awarenessOnly when youre aware on this level can you be classed as being mindful of deathNow that weve brought up the topic of death we have to reflect on birth seeing how many ways sensations are born and how many ways mental acts are bornThis is something a person with a quiet mind can knowASensations have up to five levels of refinementPanitarupa exquisite sensations that make the body feel pleasurable light and refinedFocus on what causes them until they disappearSukhumalarupa delicate sensations tender yielding and agileWhen they arise focus on what causes them until they disappearOlarikarupa physical sensations that give a sense of grandeur exuberance brightness and exultation Mukhavanno vipassidati When they arise focus on finding out what causes them until they disappearAll four of these sensations arise and disband by their very nature and its possible to find out where they first appearAn explanation of this sort of sensation When the mind is quiet and steadily concentrated it has the power to create images in the imaginationWhatever images it thinks of will then appear to it and once they appear the mind tends to enter into them and take up residenceIf the mind fastens onto these sensations it is said to take birth  simply because it has no sense of deathThese sensations can appear in any of five waysbarising from thoughts imbued with greed hatred or delusion  arising taking a stance and then disbandingcarising with an inbreath and disbanding with the following outbreathdarising from the cleansing of the blood in the lungs  appearing and disbanding in a single instantearising from the hearts pumping blood into the various parts of the body the pressure of the blood causing sensations to arise that correspond to sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensationsSensations of this sort are arising and disbanding every momentAnother class of sensation is termed gocararupa  sensations that circle around the physical bodyThere are five sorts  light sound smells tastes and tactile sensations  each having five levelsFor instance common light travels slowly in the flash of an eye it runs for a league and then dies awayThe second level subtle light goes further and the third level goes further stillThe fourth and fifth levels can travel the entire universeThe same holds true for sounds smells tastes and tactile sensationsThe relationships between all the potentials in the universe are interacting at every moment differing only as to whether theyre fast or slowThis is the inequality that has been termed aniccalakkhana  inherent inconstancyWhoever is ignorant is bound to think that all this is impossible but actually this is the way things already are by their natureWell come to know this through vijja  cognitive skill  not through ordinary labels and conceptsThis is called true knowing which meditators who develop the inner eye will realize for themselves knowing the arising of these sensations their persisting and their disbanding in terms of their primary qualities and basic regularityBAs for mental acts that arise and die their timespan is many thousands of times faster than that of sensationsTo be able to keep track of their arising and dying away our awareness has to be stillThe four kinds of mental acts are Sañña recognizing and labeling the objects of the mind Sankhara mental fabrications or fashionings of good and bad Viññana distinct consciousness or cognizance of objectsOne class of these mental acts stays in place arising and disbanding with reference to the immediate presentAnother class is termed gocara vedana gocara sañña etc which go out to refer to the worldEach of these has five levels differing as to whether theyre common refined or subtle slow or fastThese five levels connect with each other running out in stages and then circling back to their starting point disbanding and then arising again  all without endWhen we dont have the skill to discern the primary sensations and mental acts that stay in place we cant see into the gocara sensations and mental acts that go flowing aroundThis is termed avijja the unawareness that opens the way for connecting consciousness giving rise to the act of fashioning which is the essence of kammaThis gives fruit as sensations and feelings that are followed by craving and then the act of labeling which gives rise to another level of consciousness  of sensory objects  and then the cycle goes circling onThis is termed the khandhavatta the cycle of the aggregates circling and changing unevenly and inconsistentlyTo see this is called aniccanupassanañana the knowledge that keeps track of inconstancy as it occursThis is known through the inner eye ie the skill of genuine discernmentThus those who practice the exercises of insight meditation should use their sensitivities and circumspection to the full if they hope to gain release from unawarenessFashionings in this context are like waves on the oceanIf were out in a boat on the ocean when the waves are high our vision is curtailedOur senses of hearing smell taste touch and ideation are all curtailedWe wont be able to perceive far into the distanceWhat this means is that when our minds are immersed in the Hindrances we wont be able to perceive death at allBut once weve been able to suppress the Hindrances its like taking a boat across the ocean when there are no wavesWell be able to see objects far in the distanceOur eyes will be clearseeing our ears clearhearing our senses of smell taste touch and ideation will be broad and wide openThe water will be clear and the light brilliantWell be able to know all around usIn the same way those who are to know death clearly have to begin by practicing concentration as a foundation for developing liberating insightHow do the five sorts of abovementioned sensation ariseWhat are their causesHow do they disappearHow do physical and mental feelings ariseHow do they disappearWhat are their causesHow do labels and concepts ariseWhat are their causesHow do they disappearHow do mental fashionings ariseWhat are their causesHow do they disappearHow does consciousness arise by way of the senses of sight hearing smell taste touch and ideationWhat are its causesHow does it disappearAltogether there are four levels to each of the five aggregates external and internal staying in place and streaming outwardThese can be known at all times but only people who have the discernment that comes from training the mind in tranquillity and insight meditation will be able to know death on this levelThe discernment that arises in this way has been termed pubbenivasanussatiñana ie understanding past sensations future sensations and sensations in the presentThese sensations differ in the way they arise and pass awayTo know this is to have mastered one cognitive skillCutupapatañana With discernment of this sort were able to keep track of the states of our own mind as they arise and disappear sometimes good as they arise and good as they disappear sometimes bad as they arise and bad as they disappear sometimes good as they arise and bad as they disappear sometimes bad as they arise and good as they disappearTo be able to keep track in this way is to know states of being and birthAsavakkhayañana When the discernment of this skill arises it leads to disenchantment with the way sensations and mental acts arise and disappear and then arise again simply circling about coarser sensations going through the cycle slowly more refined sensations going quickly coarser mental acts going slowly more refined mental acts going quicklyWhen you can keep track of this you know one form of stressNow focus attention back on your own mind to see whether or not its neutral at that momentIf the mind approves of its knowledge or of the things it knows thats kamasukhallikanuyoga  indulgence in pleasureIf the mind disapproves of its knowledge or of the things it knows thats attakilamathanuyoga indulgence in selfinflictionOnce youve seen this make the mind neutral toward whatever it may know That moment of awareness is the mental state forming the PathWhen the Path arises the causes of stress disbandTry your best to keep that mental state goingFollow that train of awareness as much as you canThe mind when its in that state is said to be developing the Path  and at whatever moment the Path stands firm disbanding and relinquishing occurWhen you can do this you reach the level where you know death clearlyPeople who know death in this way are then able to reduce the number of their own deathsSome of the Noble Ones have seven more deaths ahead of them some have only one more others go beyond death entirelyThese Noble Ones are people who understand birth and death and for this reason have only a few deaths left to themOrdinary people who understand their own birth and death on this level are hard to findCommon ordinary birth and death arent especially necessary but people who dont understand the Dhamma have to put up with birth and death as a common thingSo whoever is to know death on this level will have to develop the cognitive skill that comes from training the mindThe skill here is knowing which preoccupations of the mind are in the past which are in the future and which are in the presentThis is cognitive skillLetting go of the past letting go of the future letting go of the present not latching onto anything at all This is purity and releaseAs for unawareness its the exact opposite ie not knowing whats past not knowing whats future not knowing whats present  that is the arising and falling away of sensations and mental acts or body and mind  or at most knowing only on the level of labels and concepts remembered from what other people have said not knowing on the level of awareness that weve developed on our ownAll of this is classed as avijja or unawarenessNo matter how much we may use words of wisdom and discernment it still wont gain us releaseFor instance we may know that things are inconstant but we still fall for inconstant thingsWe may know about things that are stressful but we still fall for themWe may know that things are notself but we still fall for things that are notselfOur knowledge of inconstancy stress and notself isnt trueThen how are these things truly knownLike thisKnowing both sides means knowing whats constant and whats inconstant whats stress and whats ease whats notself and whats selfLetting go both ways means not latching onto things that are constant or inconstant not latching onto stress or ease not latching onto self or notselfShedding everything means not holding onto past present or future Awareness doesnt head forward or back and yet you cant say that its taking a stanceSimply mindful and aware the mind remains independent not attached to anything in the worldThere are three sets of results arising from the practiceCutupapatañana the ability to know how the living beings of the world die and are rebornAsavakkhayañana understanding how to put an end to the defilements of the heartManomayiddhi psychic power making things appear in line with your thoughts  for example thinking of a visual image that then appears to the physical eyeThose who are to develop this skill must first become expert at uggaha nimittasIddhividhi the ability to change such images as you likeThose who are to develop this skill must first become expert in patibhaga nimittasDibbacakkhu clairvoyance the ability to see great distancesOnly people with good optic nerves  and who understand how to adjust the physical properties in the body so as to keep the nerves charged and awake  will be able to develop this skillDibbasota clairaudience the ability to hear sounds at great distancesOnly people whose auditory nerves are good  and who understand how to adjust the properties in the body so that they act as a conducting medium  will be able to develop this skillCetopariyañana knowing the thoughts and mental states of other peopleTo do this you first have to adjust the fluids nourishing your heart muscles so that theyre clean and purePubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember previous lives knowing by means of mental images or intuitive verbal knowledgeTo remember past lives you first have to understand how to interchange the physical properties in the bodyAsavakkhayañana knowing the causes for mental defilement knowing the means for putting an end to mental fermentationsDhammapatisambhidañana acumen  acquired by means of your own heart  with regard to all fashioned properties and qualitiesNiruttipatisambhidañana the ability to understand by means of the heart the affairs and languages of people and other living beings in the worldPatibhanapatisambhidañana the intuitive ability to respond promptly and aptly in situations where youre called on to speak the ability to respond to an opponent without having to think Simply by focusing the mind heavily down the right response will appear on its own just as a flashlight gives off light immediately as we press the switchTaken together all of these skills arise exclusively from training the heart and are called bhavanamayapañña  discernment developed through training the mindThey cant be taughtYou have to know them on your ownThus they can be called paccattavijja personal skillsIf youre astute enough they can all become transcendentIf not they all become mundaneThus the principles of discernment are twoMundane discernment studying and memorizing a great deal thinking and evaluating a great deal and then understanding on the common level of labels and conceptsTranscendent discernment knowledge that comes from practicing Right Concentration intuitive understanding that arises naturally on its own within the heart beyond the scope of the world clear insight release from all views conceits defilements and fermentations of the mindUpakara dhammaThere are three sets of qualities that are of help in giving rise to cognitive skillIndriyasanvara being constantly mindful of the six gateways  the senses of sight hearing smell taste touch and ideation  making sure they dont give rise to anything that would disturb your own peace or that of othersBhojane mattannuta having a sense of moderation in the amount of food you eat  not too much not too little eating only food thats compatible with your physical makeup making sure that its light food Otherwise youll have to eat only halffull or on the small sideAs far as food is concerned if you can get by on only one meal a day youll find it much easier to train the mindThere are three ways of eatingbEating just enough to keep the body goingThis is termed being content with what you haveEating no more than half fullThis is termed being a person of few wants who has no worries associated with food and whose body weighs lightlyJust as a tree with light heartwood wont sink when it falls in the water so the meditation of such a person is not inclined to lead to anything lowThe senses of such a person  the nerves of the eyes ears nose tongue and body  tend toward peacefulness and are wellsuited for helping the mind to attain peaceJagariyanuyoga awakening the physical properties of the body by developing the factor that fashions the body ie adjusting the inandout breath so that its thoroughly beneficial to the properties of earth water wind and fire within the bodyThis is termed developing mindfulness immersed in the body as in the verseThe disciples of the Buddha Gotama are always well alert their mindfulness constantly by day and by night immersed in the body their mindfulness charging the body whether their eyes are open or closedAt the same time we have to understand how to keep the mind wide awake through developing jhana starting with directed thought evaluation rapture pleasure and singleness of objectThe mind will then awaken from its forgetfulnessWith regard to forgetfulness the Buddha taught that when the mind gets drawn in by its objects it faints for a spellIf this happens often enough to become a habit it gives rise to delusion leaving us no way to give rise to the discernment of liberating insightHiri inner shame at the thought of doing evil not daring to do evil either openly or secretly because we realize that there are no secret places in the worldEven if other people dont see us doing evil we ourselves are sure to seeOttappa fear of evil not being attracted to the idea of doing evil viewing bad kamma as a poisonous cobra raising its head and spreading its hood and thus not daring to go nearBahusacca studying and training yourself constantly seeking advice from those who are knowledgeable and expert in the practiceDont associate with people who have no knowledge of the matters in which you are interestedViriya persistence in abandoning the defilements of the mind  ie the Hindrances perseverance in giving rise to good within the mind by developing such things as the first jhanaBriefly put there are three ways to do this being persistent in giving rise to the good in maintaining the good and in constantly developing the good that has already arisenSatipatthana giving your powers of reference a frame and a focal point by developing mindfulness immersed in the body or mindfulness of breathing etcPañña discernment circumspection thats allencompassing and fully reasonable in doing good in maintaining the good and in using the good so as to be of benefit at large  for lowlevel benefits intermediate benefits and ultimate benefits with regard to this life lives to come and the ultimate benefit nibbanaThis is what is meant by discernmentThe second jhanaDirected thought and evaluation disappear awareness settles in on its sense of ease and raptureThe body is relaxed the mind quiet and sereneThe body feels full like the earth saturated with rain water to the point where puddles formThe mind feels brighter and clearerAs awareness focuses more heavily on its one object it expands itself even further letting go of the sense of rapture and entering the third jhanaThe third jhana has two factorsbEkaggatarammana Awareness is firm and fixed in a snug fit with its objectAs it focuses strongly and forcibly expands itself a bright sense of light appearsThe mind seems much more open and blooming than beforeAs you focus in with complete mindfulness and alertness the sense of pleasure begins to waver and as the mind adjusts its focus slightly it enters the fourth jhanaThe fourth jhana has two factorsbEkaggatarammana The mind is solitary its mindfulness full and bright  as if you were sitting in a brightlylit empty room with your work finished free to relax as you likeThe mind rests its energy strong and expansiveNow withdraw from this level back out to the first and then enter in againAs you do this repeatedly liberating insight will arise on its own just like a light connected to a battery When we press down on the switch the light flashes out on its ownAnd then we can use whatever color of bulb we want and put it to use in whatever way we like depending on our own skill and ingenuityIn other words the skills mentioned above will appearPeople who develop jhana fall into three classesThose who develop jhana to the fourth level there gaining liberating insight into the Noble Truths are said to excel in convictionThey develop a moderate number of skills and their Awakening occurs at a moderate rateTheir release is the first level of cetovimutti release through concentrationThose who become skilled at the four levels of jhana  adept at entering staying in place and withdrawing  and then go all the way to the four levels of arupajhana after which they withdraw back to the first jhana over and over again until finally intuitive knowledge the cognitive skills and liberating discernment arise giving release from mental fermentation and defilement These people are said to excel in persistencePeople who practice jhana a great deal developing strong energy and bright inner light can Awaken suddenly in a single mental instant as soon as discernment first arisesTheir release is cetopariyavimutti release through mastery of concentrationThese are the results to be gained by meditatorsBut there have to be causes  our own actions  before the results can come fully developedThe Seven Important Sets of Principles listed in the prologue to Basic Themes are common to all schools of BuddhismIn the Pali canon they appear in a number of discourses as the Buddhas own summary of the essential points of his teachingMany of these principles are discussed in connection with various aspects of the practice at different points in this bookWhat follows is a selection of excerpts from Ajaan Lees other writings and talks dealing with these principles as they relate directly to the practice of keeping the breath in mindThe four frames of reference when we sit in meditation The breath is body comfort and discomfort are feeling purity and clarity are states of mind and steadiness of mind is mental qualityChanda being content to focus on the breathViriya trying to adjust the breath so that its comfortableCitta paying attention to how the breath is flowingVimansa knowing how to use the breath to benefit every part of the bodyIf we follow these four paths to success they will lead us to liberating insightIn order to divest our hearts of sights sounds smells tastes etc we have to develop concentration which is composed of seven basic qualitiesDhammavicayasambojjhanga We let the breath spread throughout the body making an enlarged frame of referenceWe know how to adjust improve choose and use our breaths so that they give us comfortWe throw out whichever breaths are harmful and foster whichever ones are beneficialViriyasambojjhanga We dont abandon or forget the breathWe stick with it and it sticks with us as we keep warding the Hindrances from the heartWe dont fasten on or become involved with distracting perceptionsWe keep trying to make our stillness of mind stronger and strongerPitisambojjhanga When the mind is quiet the breath is full and refreshingWe are free from the Hindrances and from every sort of restlessness like a white cloth thats spotlessly cleanWhen the mind is clear in this way it feels nothing but comfort and fullness which gives rise to a sense of satisfaction termed rapturePassaddhisambojjhanga The breath is solid throughout the bodyThe elements are at peace and so is the mindNothing feels troublesome or arousedSamadhisambojjhanga The breath is firm steady and unwaveringThe mind takes a firm stance in a single preoccupationUpekkhasambojjhanga When body feelings mind and mental qualities are fully snug with one another in these two types of breath  when the mind stays with these aspects of the breath  it doesnt have to fashion anything at allIt doesnt latch onto any manifestation of good or badNeutral and unperturbed it doesnt approve or disapprove of anythingWhen mindfulness saturates the body the way flame saturates every thread in the mantle of a Coleman lantern the elements throughout the body work together like a group of people working together on a job Each person helps a little here and there and in no time at all  almost effortlessly  the job is doneJust as the mantle of a Coleman lantern whose every thread is soaked in flame becomes light white and dazzling so if you soak your mind in mindfulness until its aware of the entire body both the body and mind become buoyantWhen you think using the power of mindfulness your sense of the body will immediately become thoroughly bright helping to develop both body and mindYoull be able to sit or stand for long periods of time without getting tired to walk for great distances without getting fatigued to go for unusually long periods of time on just a little food without getting hungry or to go without food and sleep altogether for several days running without losing energyAs for the heart it will become pure open and free from blemishThe mind will become bright energetic and strongSaddhabalam Your conviction will run like a car running without stop along the roadViriyabalam Your persistence will accelerate and advanceSatibalam Your mindfulness will be robust and vigorousSamadhibalam Your concentration will become unwavering and resilientNo activity will be able to kill itIn other words no matter what youre doing  sitting standing walking talking whatever  as soon as you think of practicing concentration your mind will immediately be centeredWhenever you want it just think of it and you have itWhen your concentration is this powerful insight meditation is no problemPaññabalam Your discernment will be like a doubleedged sword Your discernment of whats outside will be sharp your discernment of whats inside will be sharpWhen these five strengths appear in the heart the heart will be fully matureYour conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment will all be mature and preeminent in their own spheresIts the nature of mature adults that they cooperateWhen they work together on a job they finish itSo it is when you have these five adults working together for you Youll be able to complete any taskYour mind will have the power to demolish every defilement in the heart just as a nuclear bomb can demolish anything anywhere in the worldWhen your concentration has strength it gives rise to discernment the ability to see stress its cause its disbanding and the Path to its disbanding all clearly within the breathWe can explain this as follows The inandout breath is stress  the inbreath the stress of arising the outbreath the stress of passing awayNot being aware of the breath as it goes in and out not knowing the characteristics of the breath This is the cause of stressKnowing when the breath is coming in knowing when its going out knowing its characteristics clearly  ie keeping your views in line with the truth of the breath This is Right View part of the Noble PathKnowing which ways of breathing are uncomfortable knowing how to vary the breath knowing That way of breathing is uncomfortable well have to breathe like this in order to feel at ease This is Right IntentionThe mental factors that think about and properly evaluate all aspects of the breath are Right SpeechKnowing various ways of improving the breath breathing for example in long and out long in short and out short in short and out long in long and out short until you come across the breath thats most comfortable for you This is Right ActionKnowing how to use the breath to purify the blood how to let this purified blood nourish the heart muscles how to adjust the breath so that it eases the body and soothes the mind how to breathe so that you feel full and refreshed in body and mind This is Right LivelihoodTrying to adjust the breath so that it comforts the body and mind and to keep trying as long as you arent fully at ease This is Right EffortBeing mindful of the inandout breath at all times knowing the various aspects of the breath  the upflowing breath the downflowing breath the breath in the stomach the breath in the intestines the breath flowing along the muscles and out to every pore  keeping track of these things with every inandout breath This is Right MindfulnessA mind intent only on matters of the breath not pulling any other objects in to interfere until the breath is refined giving rise to fixed absorption and then liberating insight This is Right ConcentrationWhen all of these aspects of the Noble Path  virtue concentration and discernment  are brought together fully mature within the heart you gain insight into all aspects of the breath knowing that Breathing this way gives rise to good mental states breathing that way gives rise to bad mental states You let go of the factors  ie the breath in all its aspects  that fashion the body the factors that fashion speech the factors that fashion the mind whether good or bad letting them be as they truly are in line with their own inherent nature This is the disbanding of stressApaya States of deprivation ie the four lower realms of existence rebirth in hell as a hungry ghost as an angry demon or as a common animalIn Buddhism none of these states are regarded as eternal conditionsArahant A worthy one or pure one ie a person whose heart no longer has any defilements and is thus not destined for further rebirthA title for the Buddha and the highest level of his Noble DisciplesAriyadhana Noble Wealth ie qualities that serve as capital in the quest for liberation conviction virtue conscience fear of evil erudition generosity and discernmentAyatana Sense media ie the six senses and their corresponding objectsBhavanga The minds underlying preoccupation or resting state which determines its state of being and to which it reverts in between its responses to stimuliBrahma An inhabitant of the higher heavens a position earned  but not forever  through the cultivation of virtue and meditative absorption along with the attitudes of limitless love compassion appreciation and equanimityDhamma Event phenomenon the way things are in and of themselves quality  both in its neutral and in its positive senses the basic qualities into which natural phenomena  mental and physical  can be analyzed the terms in which things are known by the sense of ideationAlso any teaching that analyzes phenomena into their basic termsThis is one sense in which the Buddhas doctrine is his Dhamma The quality of ones heart and mind as manifest by the rectitude fairness compassion composure discernment etc revealed in ones actionsThe manifestations can be enumerated and prescribed as principles that can then be put into practice and developed as means of removing shoddiness from the heart so that its genuine unchanging quality can become fully apparent from within This is the Buddhas Dhamma in its ultimate senseDhatu Element property potentialBasic forces that when aroused out of their latent state cause activity on the physical or psychological levelIn traditional Thai physics which is based on the physics of the Pali canon the four dhatu of earth water fire and wind are said to permeate all matter in latent or potential formTo become manifest they have to be arousedThus for example the act of starting a fire is explained as the arousal of the firedhatu which already exists in the air and in the object to be ignitedOnce this is seized it clings to the fuel and the object will be on fireThe fire will continue burning as long as tejas has sustenance to cling toWhen it runs out of sustenance or is forced to let go it will grow quiet  returning to its normal latent state  and the individual fire will go outOn the level of the human body diseases are explained as resulting from the aggravation or imbalance of any of these four physical propertiesDiseases are classified by how they feel Fevers are attributed to the fire property dizziness and faintness to the wind property constipation to the earth property etcWellbeing is defined as a state in which none of these properties is dominantAll are quiet unaroused balanced and stillThere are a number of lists of dhatus given in the Pali canonThe six dhatus are the four physical properties plus space and consciousnessThe dhatus are the six senses their respective objects and the acts of consciousness associated with eachGotarabhuñana Change of lineage knowledge  the glimpse of nibbana that changes one

translations in this book are based on the editions printed during Ajaan Lees lifetime that seem most definitive and completeAt certain points these editions differ from those currently availableIn particular I was able to locate a copy of the essay Basic Themes containing corrections in Ajaan Lees own handThese have been incorporated in the translationIf these translations are in any way inaccurate or misleading I ask forgiveness of the author and reader for having unwittingly stood in their wayAs for whatever may be accurate  conducive to the aims intended by the author  I hope the reader will make the best use of it translating it a few steps further into the heart so as to attain those aims The translatorOver the years Pali and Buddhist scholars have used a bewildering array of numbering schemes to refer to suttas and other passages in the TipitakaOn this website I use the following convention to identify texts within the Sutta PitakaReaders who are accustomed to other numbering systems or who wish to compare Access to Insights translations against the original Pali texts may refer to the alternative reference numbers that appear in braces on the pages that contain the short summaries of the suttasThese alternate references consist either of the corresponding volume and starting page number in the PTS printed Pali edition the verse numbers the nipata and sutta number or some combination thereofThe braces may also contain additional notes concerning a texts location within the Tipitaka especially in cases where the numbering varies between editions of the TipitakaSome books and articles on Access to Insight contain substantial amounts of Pali textMany of them use the Velthuis method to represent romanized Palis accented characters that are not part of the standard roman and ASCII alphabetsIn this scheme two basic rules are observed For example paanaatipaataa veramanii sikkhaapadam samaadiyaami and itihidam aayasmato kondannassa annakondannotveva

article on the selected topicThe Tipitaka or Pali canon is the collection of primary Pali language texts which form the doctrinal foundation of Theravada BuddhismThe Tipitaka and the paracanonical Pali texts together constitute the complete body of classical Theravada textsThe Pali canon is a vast body of literature in English translation the texts add up to thousands of printed pagesMost of the Canon has already been published in English over the yearsAlthough only a small fraction of these texts are available on this website this collection can be a good place to startThe three divisions of the Tipitaka areThese pages invite you to explore some of the Buddhas basic teachings as they are presented in the Pali canonEach page in this section contains a selection of short passages from the suttas that introduce or illustrate different aspects of a single topicIf you encounter a particularly meaningful or interesting passage you can in most cases read the full text of the sutta from which it came by simply following the link at the end of that passageMany of the passages are crossreferenced to other pages allowing you to pursue a theme to whatever depth or breadth you desireThis is by no means an exhaustive tutorialA number of the topics introduced here are explored more thoroughly in the Study GuidesThe General Index also has many references to additional

concerning the practice and study of Theravada Buddhism as it has been handed down to us through both the written word of the Pali canon and the living example of the SanghaEverything available at Access to Insight is offered in full cooperation with the authors translators and publishers concerned with the clear understanding that none of it is to be soldPlease help yourself to whatever you find usefulThe name Access to Insight refers to the collection of files that reside on the Internet domain wwwaccesstoinsightorgThe domain name is owned by the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies which also manages the websiteIn early with the help of the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies John Bullitt set up a dialup computer bulletin board service in his home in an effort to see if networked computers might be useful as a support for other students and practitioners of BuddhismInitially dubbed BCBS OnLine the BBS soon joined Fidonet an international network of dialup BBSs and adopted the name Access to InsightBy the end of it joined DharmaNet Barry Kapkes Californiabased Buddhist BBS networkIn early DharmaNet launched the Dharma Book Transcription Project of which Bullitt served as librarian and under whose auspices about a hundred highquality books on Buddhism were transcribed to computer through the dedicated efforts of an international team of volunteer transcribers and proofreadersThese books were soon distributed via DharmaNet to scores of BBSs around the worldIn mid a dialup Internet email connection was installed that allowed anyone on the Internet to retrieve these books via an email file serverThis proved to be a popular serviceBy late the BBS  now independent of BCBS  spent far more of its time serving file requests from around the world via the Internet than in handling the requests of local callersInternet users from far and wide were coming to depend on Access to Insights now rickety and overworked  computer as their link to information  both the timely and the timeless  about BuddhismIn March this website was born the following November the BBS was closed downOver the next eighteen years Access to Insight steadily grew from a modest collection of two or three suttas and a handful of articles into an extensively indexed and crossreferenced library of more than one thousand suttas and several hundred articles and booksBy the end of this growth subsided and it settled into retirement as a static websiteIn Bullitt transferred ownership of the domain name and management of the website to BCBSTo explore ATIs history in detail see

accesstoinsightfeedbackgmailcomOne overarching principle guided my choice of what to include in these pages and what to leave out a conviction that the teachings found in the Pali canon are just as relevant today as when they were first put into practice years agoDespite all the obvious material advances in the human world since the Buddhas time the Four Noble Truths appear to be as vital today as ever suffering and stress still pervade our lives the cause still appears to be craving in all its insidious manifestations and there is no reason to suspect that the Noble Eightfold Path is any less effective today at bringing an end to all that suffering and stressThe emphasis here is on practiceFor the most part I selected books articles and sutta translations that I personally found helpful to develop a better understanding of the Buddhas teachings rather than texts that tend to fuel intellectual debates on abstract philosophical conceptsBeyond these basic principles it all comes down to a matter of personal tasteIf you are looking for authors or teachers who are not represented on Access to Insight a simple Google search may be fruitfulThis website aims to be selective rather than comprehensiveIt was never my goal to publish translations of every single one of the Tipitakasplus suttasWhat you see here is a selection of suttas that meet three criteria they are in my opinion good translations I personally found them useful and their copyright holders have provided them for free distributionThere are many other fine translations of important suttas available in print today and I encourage you to support their continued publication by purchasing copiesSomeday perhaps these publishers will make those translations available freely to allUntil then however we must learn to make do with what we haveHappily what we already have is pretty darn wonderfulThe same criteria applied to my selection of books articles and other materials on the siteYears ago I decided to limit Access to Insights content exclusively to the English language simply because I am fluent only in EnglishI prefer not to put anything on the website that I cant understand myselfMy role in assembling Access to Insight was primarily that of facilitator and librarian helping to bring together under one virtual roof the fruits of the hard work of many people authors translators publishers transcribers and proofreadersThe unstinting generosity and commitment to the Dhamma demonstrated by these many contributors continues to amaze and inspire meIf you have found anything of value at

in Thailand inThe amulet depicts an image of the Buddha meditating under the arch of a protective deity or naga in a design popularized by Somdet TohThe reverse contains the Pali text of the Jinapañjara Gatha a traditional protective chant that describes a person surrounded on all sides by a field of extraordinary purity and goodness the Triple Gem all the past Buddhas all the Buddhas elder arahant disciples and  as if that werent enough  all the suttasIn a dangerous and frightening world it is hard to imagine a safer place in which to dwellBut of course it is the purity and goodness of the mind that offers the only true protectionBy seeking out the company of a kalyanamitta and by training oneself to infuse the mind only with what is good and noble progress on the path of Dhamma is assuredThe Victors Cage  and the amulet on which it appears  thus serves as metaphor and reminder of the admirable qualities of mind that the practicing Buddhist strives to developAs with the ten recollections reflecting on the Victors Cage offers encouragement when the chips are down I am not alone in this endeavor I can do thisIn times of anxiety and stress when the mind is most susceptible to wandering off into unskillful states a recollection like this is sometimes all thats needed to restore the mind to balance and to steer it onwards down the pathAnd sometimes the familiar feel of a wellworn amulet between ones fingers is enough to do the trickMy hope is that this website may serve its visitors in much the same wayMost Thai amulet collectors view the arch as a bellSomdej Toh was abbot of Wat Rakang ie Bell Temple and the bell has given its name to the archThe arch is invariably referred to as a rakang in any amulet of this iconographyThe nagaovertheBuddha amulets typically feature a headed Mucalinda and are not known to be stylised into an abstract archI suspect the amulet is issued by one of temples closely associated with Somdet Toh ie Wat Rakang Wat Inn and Wat Bangkhunpom where he made many of these amuletsThe Jinapanjara Katha began to be featured on these amulets some years ago because Somdet Toh was supposed to have used that katha to consecrate all of his amuletsA more likely reason is that the minting technology finally caught up and permitted the katha to be squeezed onto the small surface area from an email received on

Roman Cyrillic Klingon etcWriting Pali in nonIndic languages however often requires the addition of special accents or diacritics to signify certain sounds not represented in the standard alphabetSo if you are looking for a handwritten version of the word mettā for a tattoo or a painting its very easy you can write it out yourself in any alphabet you likeThe Pali texts were first written down several centuries after the Buddhas death at the Fourth Buddhist CouncilTo see what those early  and beautiful written transcriptions look like visit the Fragile Palm Leaves Foundation lthttpechompiwgberlinmpgdecontentbuddhismfplfgtTo find a particular word or passage within those ancient manuscripts youll have to find a scholar who specializes in themIf youre thinking of purchasing your own printed copy of the Tipitaka be forewarned the Pali canon is huge owning a complete set is a serious commitmentThe Pali Text Societys edition of the Tipitaka fills over pages in approximately fifty hardbound volumes taking up about five linear feet of shelf space and costing about USMoreover a few of the more obscure books in the Tipitaka are simply unavailable in English translation so if you really must read the entire Tipitaka youll just have to learn PaliThe PTS has for over a century been the leading publisher of the Tipitaka both in romanized Pali and in English translation but many of their translations are now badly out of dateMuch better translations of several portions of the Canon are now available from other publishersHere are my recommendations for printed translations that add up to a useful  if incomplete  version of the Tipitaka the Venerable Ananda in ThagThe one disciple of the Buddha most often mentioned in his discourses is AnandaAmongst all those great monks around the Buddha he occupies a unique position and this in many respects as will be mentioned in these pagesHis unique position had already begun before his birthHe came to earth just as the Buddha did from the Tusita heaven and was born on the same day as he and in the same caste namely the warrior caste of the royal family of the SakyasTheir fathers were brothers so that Ananda was the Buddhas cousinHe had three brothers Anuruddha Mahanama Pandu and one sister RohiniAnuruddha entered the Sangha together with Ananda and became an arahant a fully enlightened oneMahanama the prince of the Sakyas became a oncereturner as a householder while the only thing known about Pandu is the fact that he survived the nearextinction of the Sakya clan during the Buddhas th yearAnandas only sister Rohini had a skin disease as a result of former jealousy and lived in seclusion at home until the Buddha talked to her about the karmic cause of her affliction and paved the way to streamentry for herRohini recovered and was later reborn in the heaven of the gods of the thirtythree as the wife of Sakka the king of the godsWhen he was years old Ananda joined his brother Anuruddha and his cousin Devadatta and also many other Sakyan nobles to become a homeless one a monkThe venerable Belatthassa an arahant  a fully liberated saint  became his teacher in the SanghaOnly one verse by the venerable Belatthasisa has survived to this dayUnder the guidance of this holy one Ananda was introduced into the monks disciplineHe was a willing and diligent pupil and was able to attain the fruit of streamentry already during his first rains retreatLater Ananda told his fellow monks that the venerable Punna Mantaniputta had been of great help to him during his learning periodHe had taught Dhamma to the new monks and had explained to them that the I am conceit does not arise without a cause  namely it is brought about through form feeling perceptions mental formations and consciousnessFor a better understanding of this the venerable Punna had given a fitting analogyIf somebody should want to see his reflection or image he could do so only through a cause namely a mirror or a clear body of waterIn the same way do the five aggregates reflect the image of I am As long as one depends on them and is supported by them so long will an I be reflectedOnly when one does not rely on them any longer will the image of I disappearAnanda thought about this analogy again and again and ever more deeply until he penetrated the suffering impermanence and noself aspects of the five aggregates and no longer relied upon them as his supportHe then began to reap the benefits of monkhood beginning with the fruit of streamentryAnanda was always well content with his life as a monkHe understood the blessings of renunciation and had entered upon the Path which is a joy to tread if one can cross the stream in company with likeminded friendsDuring the first years of his life as a monk Ananda was fully occupied with the purification of his own mind he blended easily into the Sangha and slowly developed more and more resilience and mental strengthWhen the Buddha and Ananda were both years of age the Buddha called a meeting of the monks and declared In my years as a monk as Father of the Sangha I have had many different attendants but none of them has really filled the post perfectly as again and again some willfulness has become apparentNow I am years old and it is necessary for me to have a trustworthy and reliable attendant At once all the noble disciples offered their servicesBut the Buddha did not accept themThen the great monks looked at Ananda who had held back modestly and asked him to come forward voluntarilyDue to his impeccable behavior as a monk he seemed predestined for the postWhen he was asked why he was the only one who had not offered his services he replied that the Buddha knew best who was suitable as his attendantHe had so much confidence in the Blessed One that it did not occur to him to express his own wishes although he would have liked to become the attendant of the BuddhaThen the Buddha declared that Ananda would be pleasing to him and that he wanted him as his attendantAnanda was in no way proud that the Master had preferred him to his greatest disciples but instead asked a favor of having eight conditions fulfilledFirst of all the Master should never pass a gift of robes on to him second he should never give him any almsfood which he himself had received third having received a dwelling place he should never give it to him fourth never to include him in any personal invitationBesides these four negative conditions he also had four positive wishes namely if he was invited to a meal he asked for the right to transfer this invitation to the Buddha if people came from outlying areas he asked for the privilege to lead them to the Buddha if he had any doubts or inquiries about the Dhamma he asked for the right to present these to the Buddha at any time and if the Buddha gave a discourse during his absence he asked for the privilege to have the Buddha repeat it to him privatelyHe explained his reasons for these requests in this way if he did not pose the first four conditions then people could say that he had accepted the post of attendant only because of material gainBut if he did not express the other four conditions then it could rightly be said that he fulfilled the duties of his post without being mindful of his own advancement on the Noble PathThe Buddha granted him these very reasonable requests which were quite in accordance with the teachingFrom then on Ananda was the constant companion attendant and helper of the Blessed One for twentyfive yearsIn those twentyfive years of his fame he continued with the same incessant striving for purification as in the first eighteen years of his monkhood as an unknown discipleHe said of himselfThe twentyfive years mentioned in this verse refer to the period during which he was the Buddhas attendant and not to the whole of his life as a monkDuring this period though he was still a learner one in the higher training no thoughts of lust or hate arose in him the implication being that his close connection with the Buddha and his devotion to him gave no room for theseOnly such a man could fill the post of a constant companion for the BuddhaAdded to that were Anandas special positive qualitiesHow Ananda attained arahantship and survived the Buddha will be related in due courseAnandas praise has been voiced on many occasions in the Pali CanonThe greatest recognition for a monk would surely have been when the Buddha asked him to substitute for him as a teacher and then later confirmed that he himself would not have presented the teachings in any other wayThis praise was given by the Exalted One to Sariputta and to AnandaA similarly high esteem is shown in the fact that monks to whom the Buddha had given a short discourse would ask an experienced monk to explain the teaching more fullyThe venerable Maha Kaccana was a master in this and so were Sariputta and AnandaBesides the equal status Ananda had in these respects with Sariputta the disciple who was most similar to the Master there were occasions when the Buddha specially praised AnandaHe said for instance to the monks that King Pasenadi to whom Ananda had given a discourse was very blessed because he had been given the boon of the sight and company of AnandaFurther just as the multitude of aristocrats brahmans ordinary folk and ascetics found joy in seeing a world ruler equally joyful were the monks nuns and male and female disciples about AnandaIf a party of these goes to Ananda to see him his presence alone gives them joyWhen he speaks Dhamma to them there will be joy for them because of his wordsAnd they are still not satisfied when Ananda reverts to silenceIn answer to the question of a lay disciple how he could honor the Dhamma after having honored the Buddha and Sangha the Buddhas reply was the third praise If you householder wish to honor the Dhamma go and honor Ananda the Guardian of the Dhamma whereupon the lay disciple invited Ananda to a meal and gave him a gift of valuable clothBut Ananda turned it over to Sariputta because he had the greatest mastery of the Teaching Sariputta however gave it to the Buddha because he alone was the cause of all blissAnother time the Master praised him thus after Ananda had answered a question of the Buddha and had left the Buddha said to the other monksA layman who had been following another teaching was converted to the Dhamma after a talk with AnandaAt the end he exulted how amazing it had been that Ananda had neither elevated his own teaching into the heavens nor dragged the other into the dirtTotally straightforward was the exposition of the Dhamma the inner meaning was explained and he himself was not carried awayA second time he was praised by King Pasenadi after having given a good explanation to the crown prince of KosalaTruly he looks like Ananda because the word means esteemed loveable agreeableAnd King Pasenadi said that Anandas words had been wellfoundedIn view of this abundance of praise recognition and privileges mutterings of envy and resentment could have been expectedBut this was not the case at allHe was a man who had no enemiesThis rare advantage had not come to him without a cause but had been enjoyed by him not only in this life but also in many previous existencesAnanda was so much taken up by subordinating his entire life to the Dhamma that fame could not touch him and make him proudHe knew that all that was good in him was due to the influence of the TeachingWhen seen in this way there can be no prideOne who cannot be proud has no enemies and such a one does not meet with envyIf someone turns inward completely and keeps away from any social contact as Anandas brother Anuruddha did then it is easy to be without enemiesBut if someone like Ananda who had daily contact with a large number of people with regard to diverse matters lives without enemies without rivals without conflict and tensions it borders on a miracleThis quality is truly a measure of Anandas uniquenessAlthough Ananda did experience justified criticism and was occasionally admonished that was something entirely differentA friendly reminder a warning or even a substantial reproach to change ones behavior are aids towards more intense purificationSuch criticism if taken to heart leads to more inner clarity and higher esteem by othersThe instances in which Ananda was admonished mostly referred to points of social behavior points of the Vinaya hardly ever to points of selfpurification and were never related to his understanding of the DhammaThe instances were as followsOnce when the Buddha was suffering from wind in the stomach Ananda cooked a rice gruel for him which had helped the Enlightened One when he had previous complaints of this sortThe Buddha admonished him thus It is not the proper way for ascetics it is not proper monks behavior to prepare meals in the house After the incident it was decreed an offense for a monk to cook for himselfAnanda adhered to this rule from then on with full insight into its necessity as a part of true homelessnessOnce Ananda went on almsround without his double robeFellow monks drew his attention to the rule established by the Buddha that a monk should always wear his three robes when going to the villageAnanda agreed wholeheartedly and explained that he had simply forgotten itSince this and the former case concerned a simple disciplinary rule the matter was thereby settledThat someone like Ananda who had a most extraordinary memory could also forget something was due to the fact that even a streamwinner is not yet perfectThe Buddha however required of the monks that they pay diligent attention to the small everyday things of a monks life and that they base their higher spiritual exertions on the foundation of the disciplineThis served to eliminate purely intellectual understanding and conceitA different kind of criticism was leveled at Ananda in two instances by the venerable Maha KassapaThirty disciples of Ananda had left the SanghaKassapa reproached Ananda that he had not guarded the young men sufficientlyHe had gone on walking tours with them without their having the senses well restrained without having learned to be moderate in eating and not having trained themselves in wakefulnessTherefore he was a destroyer of corn a spoiler of the families His followers crumbled awayThis youngster is still uncontrolled So did the venerable Maha Kassapa reprove himTo this rather strong reproach Ananda only replied that the gray hair had grown on his head in the service of the Sangha and yet Kassapa still called him a youngster It may be that in this instance Ananda had overrated his own strength and underrated the worldliness of his pupilsAnanda did not argue about the objective justification of the censure for his failureAfter all he was not yet an arahant and was still subject to some defilementsHe only objected to the generalization implied by the criticismOne may however assume that a saint an arahant like Kassapa would have known which form of criticism would be most helpful to AnandaThe second incident with Kassapa had a different backgroundAnanda had asked Kassapa to accompany him to a nunnery and to teach thereAfter initial hesitation Kassapa had agreedAfter the discourse was over a headstrong nun accused Kassapa that only he had been talking and had not let the wise Ananda utter a single wordIt was she said as if the needle salesman had tried to sell his wares in the presence of the needle manufacturerAnanda begged Kassapa to forgive herBut Kassapa replied that Ananda should show restraint lest an inquiry into his behavior should be initiatedThis was meant by Kassapa to be a reproach that Ananda had been overzealous in his teaching and had overlooked the danger of personal attachmentThis criticism also will have benefited Ananda in the futureIn any case Kassapa blamed Ananda in both instances because of his love for him there was always an excellent relationship between these two monksAnother monk Udayi once criticized Ananda in the following incidentAnanda had asked the Blessed One how far his voice would reach in the universeThe Lord had answered that the Enlightened Ones were immeasurable and could reach further than a thousandfold world system even further than a threethousandfold world systemThey could penetrate all those worlds with their shining splendor and reach all beings living there with their voiceAnanda was delighted with this description so allencompassing and transcending all horizons and he exclaimed How fortunate I am that I have such an almighty powerful masterUdayi objected What good does it do to you brother Ananda that your master is almighty and powerful With these few words a strong reproach was utteredNamely that Ananda always looked at the person of the Buddha only and thereby forgot his real benefit namely his own enlightenmentThe Buddha immediately took sides with Ananda with the following wordsNot so Udayi not so UdayiShould Ananda die without being fully liberated he would be king of the gods seven times because of the purity of his heart or be king of the Indian subcontinent seven timesBut Udayi Ananda will experience final liberation in this very lifeThat the Buddha made this prophecy in the presence of Ananda showed his confidence in himHe knew that his wide knowledge of the Buddhaword would not make Ananda negligent in his practiceThis utterance also indicated that the Buddha found it useful to shield Ananda from reproach  selfinflicted and by others  by consoling him that his efforts and strivings would result in the highest attainment still in this lifetimeThe Tathagata could make such a declaration only in the case of one who inclined rather towards being extremely conscientious than too negligentThe only time that the Buddha admonished Ananda on his own accord was also the most important incidentThe Buddha had instructed Ananda to oversee the distribution of cloth for robes to the monksAnanda had accomplished this task very satisfactorilyThe Buddha praised him for his circumspection and told the other monks that Ananda was very skilled in sewing he was able to make several different kinds of seamsFor a good monk it was necessary that he hemmed his robes so that they did not fray at the edges and one could not accuse him of carelessly handling and wasting the offerings of the laityLater when the Buddha was residing near his hometown he saw numerous seats prepared in a monastery and asked Ananda whether many monks lived thereAnanda confirmed this and added It is now time to prepare our robes venerable sir Ananda referred here to the Buddhas instructions that a monk should care for his robes properlyHowever Ananda seemed to have arranged a sort of sewing circle maybe to teach his fellow monks that commended art of making seamsThis was probably how it came to the communal evening sewing hoursAnanda had not considered that from this a homelike conversational hour would result after the days efforts and hardshipsTherefore the Buddha gave this very emphatic injunction concerning the danger of mundane gregariousness for the monkA monk does not deserve praise who enjoys socializing who finds contentment in it enjoys togetherness is pleased with itThat such a monk should attain at will the bliss of renunciation the bliss of solitude the bliss of tranquility the bliss of awakening in their totality that is impossibleWhosoever finds his whole happiness in togetherness has no access to the bliss which exists independent of the desire for togethernessEven if one who is still attached to others attains meditative absorption it will not be fully controlled nor will it be completeSuch absorption can in this case only be a result of forceful suppressionStill greater will be the difficulty of attaining final liberation for a person who makes himself dependent on companionshipTherefore the Buddha ends his explanation with the statement that he cannot find any form the attachment to which would not produce dukkha because of the inherent impermanence in it even if it were the highest divine form of a brahmaThis is the universal aspect of the DhammaSubsequently the Buddha expounded the Path of Practice which he explained solely with reference to Ananda not mentioning the first seven steps of the Noble Eightfold Path but starting with the eighth stepThis was because Ananda had the faculty for deep meditation and as one in the higher training was as deeply imbued with the Dhamma as anyone outside sainthood could beHe only needed a few hints which put the right perspective on the community work mentioned aboveTherefore the Buddha expounded here the highest goal  total voidness of concepts objects and names  and showed the last stepsFurthermore he appealed to Anandas love for him as the Master and emphasized that this love could only be proven if Ananda followed him into the highest attainmentOne could say that he made use of both approaches factual and personal to help Ananda cut off all remaining worldliness once and for all and he concluded with this analogyTherefore Ananda bear amity towards me not hostility long shall that be for your benefit and happinessI shall not treat you Ananda as the potter treats his unfired potsRepeatedly admonishing I shall speak to you Ananda repeatedly testingHe who is sound will stand the testThis analogy will be easier to understand if one takes a look at the th Jataka storyIt tells of a past life of AnandaHe had abdicated from a kings throne and had become an ascetic just like the Buddha did when a bodhisattaOne day it transpired that the ascetic  who later became Ananda  had a small store of salt to flavor his food which went against the ascetic rule of povertyThe Bodhisatta reprimanded him thus he had let go of all the riches of his kingdom but now he had started to store provisions againThe ascetic became illhumored because of thatHe replied that one must not hurt the other person when reprimanding him one must not be rough with ones reproach as if cutting with a blunt knifeThe Bodhisatta replied amongst friends it was not necessary to speak like a potter handling his unfired ie very delicate potsA friend could also utter words of blame because only through repeated exhortation and constant constructive criticism could one give a person that solidity which was like fired clayThen the ascetic asked the Bodhisattas pardon and requested that the Bodhisatta should out of compassion always guide him furtherThe analogy of the clay pots  easily understandable in those days because it was a common trade  referred to sensitivity and touchinessFor a potter takes the raw not quite dry clay pot gently with both hands lest it should breakThen after firing he would repeatedly test it for flaws such as cracks or splits and use it only if it were well bakedHe would tap it again and again and only a sound one would stand the testIn the same way only a sound person one with excellent qualities would reach path and fruit of sainthoodJust as in that past life the reproach of the Bodhisatta was fruitful and brought Ananda  the ascetic  to brahma realms so it was also fruitful this time because Ananda accepted the criticism happily was content with it took it to heart and followed it until he attained the total destruction of suffering in this lifeOne of the virtues of Ananda which established his fame was his conduct as the Buddhas attendantThe Buddha said of him that he was the best of all attendants was the foremost of all those monks who had ever filled this postThe term attendant is actually not comprehensive enoughThere is hardly an English word which can do full justice to his positionIf we were to choose designations such as secretary or adjunct then we would not express the most intimate aspects of his attendance extending to many little items of personal assistance given to the MasterIf we called him a servant then we would omit the organizational and directing aspects which manifested on many occasionsAnd if we looked for examples in the worlds literature of a confidante of a great man who accompanied him constantly we would not find his likenessThis loving attention for years consisted of the following services Ananda brought water for washing to the Buddha and toothwood he arranged his seat washed his feet massaged his back fanned him for coolness swept his cell and mended his robesHe slept nearby at night to be always on handHe accompanied him on his rounds through the monastery and after meetings he checked to see whether any monk had left anything behindHe carried the Buddhas messages and called the monks together even sometimes at midnightWhen the Buddha was sick he obtained medicine for himOnce when monks neglected a very sick fellow monk the Buddha and Ananda washed him and together carried him to a restingplaceIn this way Ananda performed the many daily tasks and cared for the physical wellbeing of his enlightened cousin like a good mother or a caring wifeBut above all he also had the duties of a good secretary namely the smooth communication between the thousands of monks and the MasterTogether with Sariputta and Moggallana he tried to sort out and attend to the manifold problems of human relationships turning up in a communityIn a case of dispute of the monks of Kosambi and in the case of a schism in the Sangha through DevadattaAnanda played an important role in clarifying and keeping orderOften he was the gobetween for the monks getting an audience with the Master for them or he brought the Buddhas words to members of other sectsHe refused no one and felt himself to be a bridge rather than a barrierOn several occasions the monks made a great deal of noise so that the Buddha asked Ananda about the reason for thisAnanda was always able to explain it fullyThe Buddha then took care of it accordinglyThe last of these three occasions is significantOn behalf of the Buddha Ananda called the large group of noisy monks together and reproached them for their behavior and sent them awayThereupon the group went into solitude and worked so diligently on the purification of their hearts that all of them attained the three knowledges during one rains retreatThe Master called them together once moreWhen they arrived at the Awakened One he dwelt in imperturbable meditationThe holy monks realized the depth of their masters meditation sat down and entered in the same absorptionAfter they had thus passed the first four hours of the night  truly the kind of greeting fit for holy ones  Ananda got up and requested the Buddha to greet the monks who had arrivedBecause all of them were in imperturbable meditation no one could hear himAfter a further four hours Ananda repeated his requestAgain total silence answered himAnd a third time at dawn Ananda got up prostrated before the Buddha put his hands together and requested a greeting for the monksThereupon the Buddha came out of his meditation and answered Ananda If you were able to attain supersensual experiences then you would have known that all of us had entered into imperturbable absorption where words cannot penetrateThis account serves to show the unerring patience Ananda possessed as well as his limitationsSuch an occurrence may have contributed to Anandas determination to practice meditation again and again despite his many dutiesThe traditional texts speak of two occasions when he asked the Buddha for a meditation subject which he could practice in solitudeThe Master told him on one occasion to concentrate on the five aggregates and the other time to contemplate the six sensespheresAmongst the many things which Ananda requested from the Buddha for others the following may be mentioned when the monk Girimananda and the monk Phagguna were sick Ananda asked the Exalted One to visit them and strengthen them by teaching them DhammaIt was also Ananda who asked the Buddha  upon Anathapindikas suggestion  to have a shrine erected in the monasteryIn these and many other ways Ananda showed himself as a solicitous monk who combined maternal and paternal qualitiesHis ability for organization negotiation and arrangements had already been manifested earlier when  in a past life  he fulfilled a similar function for the king of the gods SakkaIn the few instances when Anandas past lives in the deva and brahma worlds are mentioned it always related to those lives in which he held the position of a main helper and adjutant of Sakka particularly as the heavenly charioteer Matali or as a deva such as the heavenly architect Vissakamma or the raingod Pajjuna or the fivecrested celestial musician PañcasikhaEspecially Anandas willingness to sacrifice himself is worth mentioningWhen Devadatta let loose a wild elephant to kill the Buddha Ananda threw himself in front of the Buddha rather to die himself than to see the Exalted One killed or injuredThree times the Buddha asked him to step back but he did not complyOnly when the Enlightened One moved gently from the spot through supernatural powers could he be dissuaded from his intention to sacrifice himselfThis action of Ananda spread his fame even furtherThe Buddha told the other monks that already in four former lives Ananda had shown himself equally willing to sacrifice himselfEven in long bygone times as an animal as a swan or a gazelle he had stayed with the Bodhisatta when he had been caught in a trapIn another case the Bodhisatta first sacrificed himself for his monkey mother then Ananda And in three other recorded cases Ananda  in his former rebirths  saved the Buddhatobes life through his care and skillThese stories amplify the virtues of Ananda and his ageold association with the BuddhaAmongst the distinctions which gave Ananda a special place amongst the Buddhas disciples one of the most noteworthy was that he was the only monk who was not yet an arahant amongst those whom the Buddha called preeminent in specific abilitiesThis means that he had qualities which equaled those of the arahantsWhile others were mentioned only because of one superior quality Ananda was the one amongst the seventyfive preeminent disciples who excelled in five abilitiesHe was preeminent among those who had heard much who had a good retentive memory who mastered the sequential order who were energetic and among those who attendedUpon close examination one can see that these five qualities belong to the vast complex of virtues which give sati its strength and powerThe quality of mindfulness is power of the mind power of memory mastery over recollections and ideasIt is the faculty to use the tool of the mind at any time at will and not be driven by itIn short mindfulness is circumspection and orderliness selfrestraint control selfdisciplineIn a narrower sense sati or mindfulness is the ability to rememberAnanda had this ability to a phenomenal degreeHe could immediately remember everything even if he had heard it only onceHe could repeat discourses of the Buddha flawlessly up to words without leaving out a single syllableHe was able to recite fourline stanzas of the BuddhaIt may sound like a miracle to us to be able to accomplish such a featBut the miracle is solely that we encumber our minds with a hundredthousand useless things which hinder us from becoming master over our memoryThe Buddha said once that the only reason why one forgets anything is the presence of one of the five hindrancesBecause Ananda was one in the higher training he was able to let go of these hindrances at will and so could concentrate completely on what he heardBecause he did not want anything for himself he absorbed the discourses without resistance or distortion arranged them properly knew what belonged together recognized within different expressions the common denominator and like a faithful and skilled registrar could find his way around in his own mindThis is the quality of having heard much He who has heard much in this sense has discarded willfulness from his own mind and has become a vessel of truthHe has heard much truth and that means that he has erased all untruth in himselfSuch a one is born from the mouth of the teacher is truly trained because he let himself be shaped by the teaching of the Exalted OneHence he who has heard much is the one who is most humble and a most sincere champion of truthEverything good which he carries in his mind and upon which he acts he does not ascribe to his own ability but to the Dhamma which he has heard from his teacherSuch a person is truly humble Rainer Maria RilkeThis could rightly be said of AnandaWhen he came to the Buddha he was still ignorant thinking in a wrong wayEach teaching of the Awakened One forced him to correct his outlookConstantly losing his old concepts he totally yielded to the truthThis quality of listening well and training the mind is named as the first of the five specific abilities of Ananda and it is recorded that all of his disciples too were well versed in this respectBut the Buddha said it would not be easy to find one who equaled Ananda in thisThe question as to which monk lent radiance to the Gosinga Forest was answered by Ananda in this wayThe monk who has heard much is guardian of the word treasurer of the teaching and of what is good in the beginning good in the middle and good at the end and transmits word by word and in the right way the completely purified life of the homeless ones all this he knows remembers ably explains keeps in his heart and understands completelyHe discourses on Dhamma to the four kinds of listeners in completeness in part and in the right context to bring them to final eradication of desiresThe second quality is the retention in mind and making use of the discourses heard and their application to ones own selfinquiryFor the third quality widely differing renderings have been given by translatorsAccording to the ancient commentary it refers to Anandas capacity to perceive in his mind the internal connection and coherence of a discourseThis he was able to do by understanding well the meaning and significance of the teaching concerned with all its implicationsHence even when his recitation was interrupted by a question he was able to resume the recital where he had left offThe fourth quality was his energy his unflagging dedication to his task in studying memorizing and reciting the Buddhas words and in personally attending on the MasterThe fifth and last quality was that of a perfect attendant which was described earlierIf one looks at these five qualities one receives a vivid picture of AnandaThe central quality however is that of a guardian of the Dhamma which can also be seen in the following chaptersBecause of his key position among the Buddhas entourage of monks Ananda was naturally the focus of much attention and he had to deal with a very large number of peopleTo all those who came into contact with him he was a model in his blameless conduct in his untiring solicitude for the Master and for the community of monks in his unperturbable friendliness his patience and his readiness to helpSome potential conflicts did not even arise in his presence and those which did arise became mitigated and resolved through his influenceAnanda as a man without enemies had a strong and deep impact upon others through his exemplary conduct as well as through his instructionsHis image as the Buddhas faithful companion left particularly strong traces in the minds of his contemporariesAnanda was always master of a situation and like a king he had a sovereign comprehension of affairsTherefore thanks to his circumspection he could handle and organize whatever occurred in the daily life of the Buddha and the communityThrough the extraordinary power of his memory he was able to learn from his experiences and never repeat the same mistakes as most people are liable to do again and again due to their weak memoryHence he could remember people well though he may have met them only once and he could therefore deal with them suitably without leaving the impression that he manipulated themHis circumspection accorded with the facts of a situation so naturally that all reasonable people could only agree with himBoth brothers Anuruddha and Ananda were no longer in need of female companionship in any way or form because of their inner detachment from worldliness and their strong spirit of renunciationTo both however the other sex presented a challenge in different waysIf one has much contact with people one has to take the difference of the sexes into accountWith Ananda this showed as special care and effort to look after all four kinds of disciples not only monks and laymen but also nuns and laywomenWithout Ananda there would have been only three kinds of disciples because it was he who was instrumental in the founding of the nuns orderThis happened as followsWhen many nobles of the Sakya clan had become monks their wives sisters and daughters also had the wish to live a life of purification under the Awakened OneA large number of Sakya ladies under the guidance of the Buddhas stepmother MahaPajapati followed the Exalted One and tried in vain to gain permission to establish an order of nunsAnanda saw the Buddhas stepmother with swollen feet covered with dust eyes full of tears at the gate of the monastery of VesaliWhen he asked her compassionately for the reason of her sorrow she replied that the Master had three times rejected her request for the establishment of an order of nunsAnanda decided out of compassion to intercede himselfHe went to the Master but his request was also denied three timesThen he asked Is a woman able to gain the fruit of streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship if she leaves the household life and enters into homelessness and follows the teaching and discipline of the Exalted OneThe Buddha affirmed thisThereupon Ananda rephrased his requestIf a woman is able to do this Master  and moreover MahaPajapati Gotami has rendered great service to the Master she is his aunt his governess and nurse nourished the Exalted One with her own milk after his mother died  therefore it would be well if the Blessed One would allow women to leave home for the homeless life to follow the teaching and discipline of the MasterAnanda here brought two arguments to bearFirst the fact that a woman in the Order could gain the highest fruit become a saint an arahant in this very life which goal can be attained only very rarely in the household lifeSecond he brought up the very personal element of gratitude for the particularly meritorious services of MahaPajapati for the Buddha which would be a good reason for him to help his stepmother now to gain final liberationIn response to these arguments the Buddha agreed to the establishment of an order of nuns provided certain cautions and rules were followedOne might gain the impression from this account that it needed Anandas intense and clever arguments to change the Buddhas mindBut an awakened ones mind cannot be changed because he is always in touch with absolute realityWhat happened here was solely the same event which all Buddhas encounter because all of them have established an order of nunsThe whole incident was not meant to prevent the founding of the female branch of the Order but only to strengthen by that hesitation the message that this brought great dangers with itFor this reason the Buddha stipulated eight conditions which were so selected that only the best women would agree to abide by themThey also served to bring about a separation of the sexes in the Order in the best possible mannerIn spite of this the Exalted One declared that because of the founding of the Order of Nuns the dispensation would last only five hundred instead of a thousand yearsFollowing the Buddhas proclamation of the rules and regulations for nuns Ananda asked him about the qualities a monk should have to be a teacher of nunsThe Buddha did not reply that he had to be an arahant a saint but indicated eight practical and concrete qualities which also someone like Ananda who was not yet an arahant could possessThese eight qualities were the teacher of nuns must be virtuous second have comprehensive knowledge of the Dhamma third he must be well acquainted with the Vinaya especially the rules for nuns fourth he must be a good speaker with a pleasant and fluent delivery faultless in pronunciation and intelligibly convey the meaning fifth he should be able to teach Dhamma to the nuns in an elevating stimulating and encouraging way sixth he must always be welcome to the nuns and liked by them  that is they must be able to respect and esteem him not only when he praises them but especially when there is an occasion for reproach seventh he must never have committed sexual misconduct with a nun eighth he must have been a fully ordained Buddhist monk for at least yearsSince Ananda had been instrumental in the founding of the Order of Nuns he now also wanted to help them to advance on the Noble PathThis brought about some difficulties for himThere were two occasions in which nuns stood up for him without justification against KassapaOne of them has been mentioned in Section Anandas Renown Both nuns left the Order they showed thereby that they were no longer able to sustain the necessary impersonal and purely spiritual relationship with their teacher AnandaEven more extreme was the case of the nun in Kosambi whose name is not knownShe sent a messenger to Ananda asking him to visit her as she was sickIn reality she had fallen in love with Ananda and wanted to seduce himAnanda mastered the situation with complete aplombIn his sermon to her he explained that this body had arisen because of nutrition craving and prideBut one could use these three as means for purificationSupported by nutrition one could transcend nutritionSupported by craving one could transcend cravingSupported by pride one could transcend prideThe monk took in such nutriment as would enable him to lead the holy lifeHe sublimated his craving and was supported by his longing for holinessAnd pride spurred him on to reach that which others had already attained namely the realization of Dhamma in himselfIn this way he could in due course transcend nutrition craving and prideBut there was a fourth cause for the arising of the body namely sexual intercourse but this was an entirely different matterThis had been called the destruction of the bridge to Nibbana by the Blessed OneIn no way could its sublimation be used as a path to holinessThereupon the nun got up from the bed prostrated before Ananda confessed her offense and asked for forgivenessAnanda accepted the confession and declared that in the Order it was an advantage to confess ones faults and to restrain oneself thereafterThis incident is an excellent example of Anandas great skill to give a suitable Dhamma discourse on the spur of the moment to find the right word at the right timeAnother incident happened with regard to the wives of King PasenadiThey had pondered over three things seldom does a Buddha appear in the world seldom is one reborn as a human being and seldom is one healthy in mind and bodyYet in spite of the existence of these favorable conditions they could not go to the monastery and hear the DhammaAs the kings women they were confined to the harem like birds in a cage and that was really a disaster for themThey went to the king and asked him to request the Buddha to send a monk to the palace to teach them the DhammaThe king promisedThe lay disciple praised by the Buddha  a nonreturner  declined to do it because it was a monks dutyThereupon the king asked his wives which monk would be most acceptable to them They discussed it among themselves and unanimously requested the king that he should ask Ananda the guardian of the Dhamma to come and teach themThe Blessed One complied with the request presented to him by the king and from then on Ananda taught Dhamma to the womenOne day during this period one of the crown jewels was stolenEverything was searched and the women felt very troubled because of the unrest occasioned therebyBecause of this they were not as attentive and eager to learn as usualAnanda asked them for the reason and when he heard it out of compassion he went to the king and advised himIn order to make an end to the anxiety and unrest he told the king to summon everyone who could possibly be the thief and to give them an opportunity to return the jewel unobtrusivelyHe should have a tent erected in the courtyard of the palace put a large pot of water inside and have everyone enter aloneSo it was done and the jewel thief alone in the tent let the jewel drop into the potThereby the king regained his property the thief went unpunished and peace reigned once again in the palaceThis incident increased Anandas popularity even more and thereby the popularity of the Sakya monksThe monks also praised Ananda that he had restored peace through gentle meansShortly before the Buddha died Ananda asked him a question concerning women How shall we relate to women Master  Do not look at them  But if one sees one Master  Do not address her  But if one talks to us  Keep mindfulness and selfcontrolThis question was posed by Ananda in view of the imminent death of the Buddha just before the preparations for the funeralThis problem must therefore have been an important one for himFor himself he did not need an admonition to practice selfcontrol sensual desire had been overcome by him for yearsBut during the years he had seen how the problem of the relationship between the sexes again and again stirred the emotionsThe question may have been asked by him for this reason but also on account of the warning of the Buddha that the Order was endangered through the foundation of the Nuns Order and its lifespan shortenedHe wanted to give his contemporaries and his successors a last word of the Buddha on this topicOf all the monks Sariputta was Anandas closest friendThere does not seem to have been a close relationship between Ananda and his brother Anuruddha because the latter preferred solitude while Ananda was fond of peopleSariputta was the disciple who most resembled the Master and with whom he could talk in the same way as with the BuddhaIt is remarkable that of all the monks only Sariputta and Ananda received an honorary title from the Buddha Sariputta was called the CommanderinChief of the Dhamma and Ananda its GuardianOne can see their complementary roles in thisSariputta the lion was the active teacher Ananda more the preserver and treasurerIn certain aspects Anandas methods resembled more those of MahaMoggallana whose inclinations were also motherly and preservingAnanda and Sariputta often worked together twice visited the sick Anathapindika together dealt with the dispute of the monks of Kosambi and had many Dhamma discussions with each otherWhen Ananda received the message one day that Sariputta had died he was deeply affectedHe felt physically quite wretched and even the Dhamma was not alive in him at that moment such was the impact of the death messageThen the Buddha afforded him great consolationHe asked Ananda to reflect whether Sariputta had taken with him virtue or meditation wisdom liberation or the purity of liberationAnanda had to agree that these the only important aspects had not changedBut he added Sariputta had been such a helpful companion and friend for him and othersAgain the Buddha directed the conversation onto a higher level by reminding Ananda of what he the Buddha had always taught that nothing that has arisen can remain foreverThe death of Sariputta was for the other disciples like cutting off the main branch of a large treeBut that should only be another reason for relying on oneself on no one else and be ones own light and refugeMany discussions which Ananda had with other monks are also recordedOnly a few can be related hereOne day the Venerable Vangisa accompanied Ananda on his alms roundOn the way Vangisa was overcome by dissatisfaction the most dangerous illness of asceticsHis heart was flooded by sensual desireAll of a sudden a monks life seemed senseless and a waste to him but house and family life attractive and wholesomeThe Venerable Vangisa asked Ananda for helpWhen Ananda became aware of what was going on in his companion he spoke to him in verse because Vangisa the poet in the Sangha had voiced his request also in verseAnanda saidAnanda showed him that he constantly refueled sensual desire because his perception was not controlled and so he became captivated by feminine charmWhen the feeling of deprivation became too strong it would manifest as weariness of mind and dissatisfaction as a kind of aversion towards the ascetic lifeTherefore Vangisa had to contemplate soberly those things which seemed beautiful and desirable then he would understand that the body was not beautifulThis would be wholesome practiceThe monk Channa was plagued with doubts about the DhammaHe understood that the five aggregates are impermanent but he was afraid of Nibbana thought it to be the destruction of the egoSo he came for advice to AnandaAnanda consoled him he would understand the teaching he was already beginning to break through the hard shellChanna was delighted and listened with undivided attention to Anandas exposition of the Buddhas discourse on being and notbeingThereupon Channa exclaimed how wonderful it was to have such wise brothers as teachersNow he was firm in the Dhamma againIf one considers as conversation also the silent inner rapport with a Dhamma discourse then the whole of the Pali Canon actually consists of Anandas conversations with the BuddhaHe was almost always present when the Buddha gave a discourse and not only during the time he was his attendantAnd those few discourses which the Blessed One had given in Anandas absence he repeated for him afterwardsWe cannot repeat here all the dialogues between the Buddha and Ananda mentioned in the Pali CanonSome have already been mentionedThe Buddha often addressed Ananda with a question or teachings which were either meant for Anandas spiritual growth or gave the occasion for a discourse to all the monks presentIt is always more stimulating for the listeners when two experts discuss a subject with each other rather than only one speakingIn this way many of the conversations between the Buddha and Ananda are discourses for the instruction of othersOne special occasion for a discourse was that the Buddha had smiled when he had came to a certain localityAnanda knew that a fully enlightened one does not smile without cause and understood immediately that here was reason for a questionSo he asked the Awakened One why he had smiledThereupon the Master gave detailed explanation of an incident in the past a Jataka story which had taken place at that localityThe conversations in which Ananda asked the question and took the initiative are far more numerous than the ones the Buddha startedFor instance Ananda asked whether there was a fragrance which went against the wind different from that of flowers and blossomsThe answer was the fragrance of him who has taken the triple refuge is virtuous and generousAnother time Ananda asked how one could live happily in the OrderThe answer was if one is virtuous oneself but does not blame others for lack of virtue if one watches oneself but not others if one does not worry about lack of fame if one can obtain the four meditation absorptions without difficulty and finally if one becomes a holy one an arahantSo here the first step on the path to holiness is mentioned as not criticizing or watching others but only making demands on oneselfAnanda asked what were the purposes and blessings of virtueThe answer was to be free of selfreproach free of guilt feelings with a clear conscienceBut Ananda asked further what were the purposes and blessings of a clear conscienceThe Buddha replied that it would bring joy in wholesome thoughts and actions happiness with progress made and incentive for further strivingAnd what would result from thatOne would experience exaltation in ones heart being drawn towards the good and perfect bliss and from that would further result deep calm and insightIn this way Ananda inquired about many aspects of the DhammaSometimes Ananda reported certain views of his to the Buddha so that the Buddha could either accept or correct themFor instance he said that good friendship was half of the holy lifeUnexpectedly the Buddha disagreed noble friendship was more than half it was all of itWhat would the holy life be like if they had not all come to the Buddha as their best friend to be shown the right wayThe bestknown remark of Ananda must surely be the one where he said that causal arising was very profound but it seemed quite clear to himAgain the Buddha disagreed it was profound but very difficult to penetrateBecause it was not properly understood there was no liberation for beings caught in the wheel of life and deathAnd then the Buddha explained to Ananda causal arising in its manifold aspectsOnce Ananda saw an archer perform extraordinary featsHe told the Buddha how he had admired thatThe Buddha used this statement to draw an analogyHe said it was more difficult to understand and penetrate the Four Noble Truths than to hit and penetrate with an arrow a hair split seven timesAnother report says that Ananda once saw the famous Brahman Janussoni a disciple of the Buddha driving along in his glorious white chariotHe heard the people exclaim that the chariot of the priest of King Pasenadis court was the most beautiful and best of allAnanda reported this to the Buddha and asked him how one could describe the best chariot according to DhammaThe Buddha explained in a detailed analogy what the vehicle to Nibbana had to consist of the draftanimals had to be faith and wisdom moral shame the brake intellect the reins mindfulness the charioteer virtue the accessories jhana the axle energy the wheels equanimity the balance renunciation the chassis the weapons were love harmlessness and solitude and patience its armorA summary of Anandas former lives shows that he was only seldom a god seldom an animal and mostly a humanOne can see that his most important aspect was as a human while his brother Anuruddha had almost always been a god and Devadatta very often an animalHis close connection with the Buddha is shown in the fact that he was often his brotherThe examples of former lives given here will be mainly those which exemplify that he too had to exert himself to attain virtueJatakaHe and the Bodhisatta were born as cousins among the outcastes or CandalasTheir job was the fumigation of malodorous placesIn order to escape the contempt they were held in they disguised themselves as young men of the Brahman caste and went to the University at Takkasila to studyTheir deceit was discovered and they were beaten up by their fellow studentsA wise and kindly man ordered the students to stop and advised the two Candalas to become asceticsThey followed this advice and in due course died as punishment for their deceit they were reborn as animals namely as offspring of a doeThey were inseparable and died together by the arrow of a hunterIn the next life they were sea hawks and again died together because of a hunterWith this their existences below the human level came to an endAnanda was born as the son of a king and the Bodhisatta as the son of the priest at courtWhile Ananda held the higher position in a worldly sense the Bodhisatta had more inner abilities because for one thing he could remember all the above three livesBut Ananda could only remember his life as a CandalaAt the age of sixteen the Bodhisatta became a sincerely striving ascetic while Ananda became kingLater on the Bodhisatta visited the kingHe praised the happiness of asceticism and explained the unsatisfactoriness of the world of the sensesAnanda admitted that he realized this but that he could not let go of his desires that he was held fast like an elephant in a swampThereupon the Bodhisatta advised him that even as a king he could practice virtue such as not levying unjust taxes and supporting ascetics and priestsBut when hot passions arose in him he should remember his motherHow he had been completely helpless as a baby and if his mother had not brought him up he would never have become kingThereupon Ananda resolved to become an ascetic and both attained to the brahma realmJatakaThe Bodhisatta had been born as a poor laborer and endeavored to keep the fast daysHis longing to be reborn as a king was fulfilledAnanda lived in his kingdom as a poor watercarrierHis whole fortune was a coin which he had hidden under a stone in a certain placeWhen a festival was observed in the city the watercarriers wife urged him to enjoy himself too and asked him whether he had any money at allHe said he had this coin but it was twelve miles awayShe replied he should get it and that she had saved up the same amountThey could buy garlands incense and drinks with thatAnanda set out in spite of the midday heat happy in the expectation of the festivalWhen he passed through the courtyard of the kings palace he sang a songThe king saw him and asked the reason for his joyfulnessHe answered that he did not notice the heat as he was being driven by hot desire and told his storyThe king asked how much his treasure amounted to maybe one hundred thousand piecesWhen he finally heard that it was only one coin he exclaimed that Ananda should not walk through the heat but that he would give him a similar coinAnanda replied that he was very grateful because then he would have two coinsThe king then offered him two coins but Ananda said he would fetch his own one neverthelessThe king now became excited and raised his offer to millions to the post of viceroy but Ananda would not let go of his coinOnly when the king offered him half his kingdom did he agreeThe kingdom was divided up and Ananda was called King One CoinOne day the two of them went huntingWhen they became tired the Bodhisatta put his head in the lap of his friend and fell asleepThen the thought came to Ananda to kill the king and to rule the whole kingdom by himselfHe was drawing his sword when he remembered how grateful he  a poor yokel  should be to the king and how wicked it was of him to have such a wish ariseHe put his sword back in its sheath but even a second and a third time he was overcome by the same desireFeeling that this thought might rise in him again and again and could lead him on to very evil deeds he threw away his sword woke the king prostrated before him and asked his forgivenessThe Bodhisatta forgave him and said he could have the whole kingdom and he would be satisfied to serve as viceroy under himBut Ananda replied that he was finished with his lust for power he wanted to become an asceticHe had seen the cause of desire and how it grew now he wanted to pull it out by the rootsHe went to the Himalayas and reached perfect insightThe Bodhisatta remained in the worldJatakaThe Bodhisatta was a righteous king of Benares who practiced the ten royal virtues so that he gave alms practiced the moral rules and observed sacred daysNow one of his ministers carried on an intrigue in his haremThe gentle king waived the death penalty only banished him and allowed him to take his family and fortune alongThe minister then went to live at a neighboring kings court became his confidant and told him one could easily occupy Benares because its king was much too gentleBut the neighboring king Ananda was suspicious because he was well acquainted with the strength and power of the State of BenaresThe minister advised him to experimentHe should destroy one village of BenaresIf any of his men were caught the king would probably even reward the prisonersTrue enough when the marauders were brought before the Bodhisatta and lamented they had plundered out of hunger he gave them moneyThis served to convince Ananda of the truth of the treacherous ministers words and he marched into the State of BenaresThe commanderinchief of the Bodhisatta wanted to defend the kingdom but the latter said that he did not want to be the cause of harm for othersIf the other king wanted his kingdom he should have itHe let Ananda capture him and put him into prisonThere he practiced lovingkindness meditation towards the rapacious King Ananda who was struck down by a fever and plagued by a guilty conscienceAnanda asked the Bodhisattas pardon returned his kingdom to him and swore to be his ally foreverThe Bodhisatta returned to his throne and spoke to his ministers about the virtues and rewards of harmlessness saying that because he had made peace with the invaders hundreds were spared death on the battlefieldThen he renounced his throne became an ascetic and attained to the brahma realmAnanda however remained kingA welcome addition to Anandas conversations with the Awakened One is the account concerning the last events in the life of the Buddha in which Ananda played a leading roleIt is the MahaParinibbana Sutta the discourse on the Buddhas passing away his ultimate entrance into NibbanaThese records convey a special mood namely that of parting which was especially painful for AnandaIt is also the first small beginning of the decline of the Dhamma which will slowly disappear with increased distance from the Buddhas lifetime until a new Buddha arisesThis entire text gives as it were voice to the admonition to practice Dhamma while there is still chanceIt reflects once more Anandas whole character and therefore we will follow its course and emphasize those points which are important as far as Ananda is concernedThe first section of the MahaParinibbana Sutta starts at Rajagaha the capital of the State of MagadhaDevadattas attempt to create a schism in the Sangha had happened seven years earlierKing Ajatasattu reigned in MagadhaKing Pasenadi of Kosala had just been overthrown and the Sakya clan had come to its tragic end in which Anandas brother Prince Mahanama was killedAt that time three famous warrior clans lived north of the Ganges near the HimalayasThey were the Koliyas the Mallas and the Vajjians all of which had retained relative independence from the Maharaja AjatasattuHe had the intention of destroying the Vajjians and to incorporate their land in hisWhile the Buddha could not prevent the ruin of those Sakyans who had not entered the Order because they had to pay a kammic debt he did help the Vajjians and later indirectly also the MallasThis is the external political background of the last years of the Buddhas lifeIn detail this incident happened as followsThe king gave orders to his minister Vassakara to go to the Buddha and to announce his intention to go into battle against the VajjiansWhile Vassakara delivered his message Ananda stood behind the Buddha and fanned himThe Awakened One turned to Ananda and put seven questions to him about the life style and conditions of the VajjiansAnanda declared that they often had council meetings in which they deliberated harmoniously did not repeal their old laws followed the advice of their elders did not rape women honored their temples and shrines did not revoke gifts to religious places and that they gave protection and hospitality to all true priests and asceticsWith these seven qualities said the Buddha one could expect prosperity for the Vajjians not declineSome time earlier the Buddha had given these seven rules to themThe kings minister replied that even one of these qualities would be enough for their continued existence as a clanAs long as the Vajjians kept to these seven rules it would be impossible for the king to conquer them except through inner dissension or treacheryHe left with this conviction in mind and reported to the king that it would be useless to start a war against the VajjiansIndians in those days had so much confidence in the spiritual strength of a people that the hint of moral superiority was sufficient to prevent a warOnly much later after the death of the Buddha was it possible for the king to overrun the Vajjians and this only because they had meanwhile forsaken their moral integrityThis highly political discussion was used by the Buddha as an occasion to request Ananda to call all monks of the area togetherHe would give them an exhortation about seven things which would serve for the continued existence of the SanghaThe monks should assemble frequently should conduct their affairs amicably should not make new rules but obey the old ones should honor the elders of the Sangha and give heed to their advice should resist craving enjoy solitude and practice mindfulness at all times so that likeminded persons would be attracted and those who were already living the holy life would be happyAfter the Buddha had spoken in this way to the monks he gave them the following terse summary of the teaching which recurs many times throughout this narrativeThat is virtue that is concentration that is wisdomConcentration fortified with virtue brings great benefits and great fruitsWisdom fortified with concentration brings great benefits and great fruitsThe mind fortified with wisdom becomes liberated from all taints namely from the taint of sensual desire the taint of being and the taint of ignoranceAfter this exhortation the Buddha commenced his last journeyHe always went to places where there were people ready to understand Dhamma or where misunderstandings needed to be sorted out or where brute force could be preventedOn this last journey he went first in the direction of the Ganges river to Nalanda which later became a famous Buddhist teaching centerThis town was Sariputtas birthplace and here he took leave of the BuddhaHe wanted to stay there and teach Dhamma to his mother before he diedWhen saying farewell this great disciple voiced once more the Buddhas praise It is clear to me Lord that there is no one more distinguished in wisdomThen the Awakened One went with a large company of monks to VesaliThis town was the capital of the Vajjians whose virtue he had praised and from whom he had averted the threat of King Ajatasattus attackWhy did the Buddha go to the capital of the Vajjians and spend the last of the fortyfive rains retreats of his life in that vicinityIt is not too farfetched to think that this was meant as a nonaggressive warning to King Ajatasattu to keep the peace and to the Vajjians to keep up their virtueAt Vesali he became ill with a deadly diseaseHe overcame it by willpower as he did not want to die without having assembled the disciples once moreThat a Buddha can become ill is due to the imperfection of the body but that he can master the illness at will is due to the perfection of the Awakened OneAnanda had been extremely grieved about the Buddhas illnessHe was so worried that he could not think properlyHe related to the Buddha that he had found consolation in the fact that surely the Awakened One would not attain final Nibbana without having given regulations about the Community of monksBut the Buddha rejected thisWhat was there left to pronounce for the disciplesHe had taught the Dhamma in all its aspects and kept nothing secretOnly one who believed that it was he who had to guide the monks one who was still possessed of the I am conceit could believe himself to be so importantFurthermore the Buddha declared that he was now eighty had reached old age and could move the body only with difficulty just like an old cartHis body was only at ease when he entered upon and dwelled in the signless deliverance of the mindWith this he implied that a Buddhas body is also subject to the law of impermanenceBut he immediately gave Ananda an antidote for the sadness caused by these words So Ananda each of you should be an island unto himself with himself and no other as his refuge each of you should make the Dhamma his island have the Dhamma and no other as his refugeThe third chapter of the Discourse is located at Vesali where the Buddha dwelled for the rains retreatOne day he requested Ananda to take a sitting mat and to go with him to the Capala Shrine and pass the day there in meditationWhen they were seated the Blessed One looked at the peaceful landscape before him and reminded Ananda of the many beautiful spots in the vicinityThe reason for this seemingly unmotivated description of the countryside becomes clear laterThe Buddha said that anyone who had developed the Four Bases to Success had made them his vehicle and his foundation could if he wished live out the ageThe Exalted One had done all that and he could if requested live to the end of this ageAlthough Ananda was given such a plain and broad hint which certainly coincided with his longing he did not beg the Buddha to stay alive out of compassion for all beingsNot only once but a second and third time the Buddha addressed Ananda in this wayBut Ananda did not take these hints in his confusion he was not himself being ensnared by MaraMara had power over him as he had not yet fully purified himselfAt this moment Ananda who usually was so circumspect had lost his mindfulness which previously had happened only in negligible mattersOtherwise our whole aeon would have taken quite a different turnCould it be that Ananda was too much absorbed in the pleasant feeling of being at that moment in so close companionship with the Buddha in that enchanting evening hour in the peaceful scenic environment of the sala forestWas it perhaps just this very attachment to the Buddhas company that prevented a response which properly should have issued out of that very attachment  a response that would have accorded with his deepest wishes for a longer life for the Exalted OneIf Mara had not intervened Ananda would have asked the Buddha to accept the burden of a prolonged life out of compassion for the worldBut Mara prevented it because innumerable beings would have escaped his clutches in such an eventThis scene belongs to the mysteries of the Pali Canon and one could puzzle about it endlesslyOne can only accept the fact that it is our own doing which brought us into an age in which the person who could have kept the Awakened One alive to this day was blinded by Mara and remained silentLet us continue the account The Buddha dismissed Ananda who seated himself under a nearby tree and started meditatingThen Mara appeared before the Buddha and reminded him of a promise made fortyfive years before immediately after his enlightenment Mara had then requested the Buddha to enter final Nibbana and not to teachBut the Buddha had replied that he would not die until he had established and well taught the four kinds of disciples and until the holy life was well advancedBut now that had been accomplished Mara declared and it was time to fulfill his promiseThe Buddha replied that he would attain final Nibbana in three months from that timeOne might wonder why the Buddha even gave Mara a promise and also why it was Mara the Evil One to whom he first announced the time of his deathBut just here the supreme detachment of an Awakened One becomes apparentHe considered this mortal body which he carried around as belonging to MaraImmediately after enlightenment the Awakened One had determined for himself how long he wanted to keep this bodyThere is no reason for a Buddha to go back on such a resolve and only Mara would understand it is a promise rather than a freely arrived at voluntary endingIn any case the Buddha now dismissed the idea of remaining alive throughout the aeonHe had to specifically let go of this possibility as it seems to have been the norm for a Buddha to continue livingWhen the Awakened One relinquished the will to live there was a great earthquake and thunder resounded such was the powerful effect on the natural elements when he renounced them as a basis for lifeWhen Ananda became aware of the quake and thunder he asked the Buddha for their causeThe Buddha replied that there were eight reasons for earthquakes there are occasions when great forces move this was the first reason or a monk or Brahman may possess supernormal power and have reached a certain kind of meditation that was the second reason while the last six concerned the conception birth enlightenment the start of the teaching of the Dhamma relinquishing the will to live and final Nibbana of a BuddhaOne can see from this how deeply connected a Buddha the highest of all beings is with the whole cosmosThe expositions that follow on eight kinds of assemblies eight fields of mastery and eight liberations seem quite unmotivated in this contextIt appears to be one of those occasions for a spontaneously arisen discourseScholars speak about insertions into the text because at first there were eight reasons for earthquakes then three other eights were brought inIn reality there is a deeper connection designed to bring Ananda from the superficial to the profound and to let him know the quickly approaching death of the Buddha in such a way that it would not disturb himAfter the Buddha had helped to direct Ananda on the path towards enlightenment he related how he had told Mara fortyfive years ago that he would not attain final Nibbana until the Dhamma was well establishedNow Mara had appeared before him and he had told him he would live only for another three monthsTherefore he had now relinquished the will to liveThat had been the reason for the earthquakeThereupon Ananda begged the Awakened One three times that he should remain for the whole aeonBut the Buddha replied that the appropriate time for this had lapsedWhen Ananda asked for the third time the Buddha inquired whether he had faith in the Perfect Ones enlightenmentWhen Ananda affirmed this he asked why then was he urging him three timesAnanda replied that his reason was because the Awakened One had said he could remain for an aeon due to his practice of the four bases to successThe Buddha asked whether Ananda had believed thisAnanda affirmed itThen the Buddha made it clear to him that he had let the opportunity slip by  what you missed in this hour no eternity can return and told him that if Ananda had then requested him he would have complied the third timeAnd he also reminded him that not only now but already fifteen times previously he had made this statement to Ananda that due to the four bases to success he could remain for a whole aeonFive of the places where he had said it were near Vesali and it was in this respect that the Buddha had referred to them in the beginning of these accountsBut Ananda had always remained silentFinally the Buddha added the admonition that he had always spoken about the impermanence of all phenomena and that it was unthinkable that a perfect one should go back on his wordIn three months time he would attain final NibbanaThereupon he requested Ananda to assemble the monks of the areaHe then addressed the assembly with the exhortation always to practice insight so that this holy life may endure long for the welfare and happiness of manyAt the end of the discourse he made it known that he would pass away in three monthsHe gave them some stanzas for contemplation amongst them are theseThe fourth chapter of this account tells of the Buddha resuming his journeys after the rains retreat and declaring that he would not return to VesaliOn the way he spoke to the monks on the same topics he had expounded earlier that they had to travel through this long round of rebirths because they had not penetrated four thingsBefore he had named them as the four truths but now he spoke on the four stages of the fourth truth a noble ones virtue a noble ones concentration a noble ones wisdom and a noble ones deliveranceAnd again as so often on his last journey he emphasized concentration fortified by virtueAt the next resting place he explained to the monks how they should act if someone purported to quote his wordsOne should remember these sentences and look for verification in the Vinaya or confirmation in the suttasIf one could not find them there then one would have to come to the conclusion that it had been wrongly learned by that person and should reject itThis admonition was extremely important for the faithful transmission of his words and has been the reason why to this day one can distinguish between the Buddhas own words and postcanonical or unauthentic textsAfter this the Buddha journeyed to the province of the Mallas the warrior clan nearest to the HimalayasIt is possible that meantime he had also been in nottoodistant Savatthi because it was there that the news of Sariputtas death reached himIn the land of the Mallas the neighbors of the Sakyas he became seriously ill after taking food from the goldsmith CundaHe had asked the goldsmith to give the mushroom dish only to him and to offer the monks something elseThen he asked that the remainder of the dish be buried because only a Buddha could digest it and no one elseAlso this second illness cholera was born by the Buddha with equanimity and he was not deterred from his journeyHe had difficulty speaking thoughOn the way he asked Ananda to spread his robe as he was exhausted and wished to restAnanda should bring him some water from the nearby streamAnanda would have preferred to bring water from the river because the stream had been churned up by many cartsAfter the Buddha had repeated his request three times however the obedient Ananda went to the stream and saw that the water had become quite clear in the meantimeHe was delighted about his Masters magical powersA similar incident had happened earlier in the land of the Mallas where a well had been stopped upOn the way the Buddha met Pukkusa a prince of the Mallas a disciple of Alara KalamaPukkusa had been together with that ascetic some fifty years earlierPukkusa started his conversation with the statement how astounding it was what a deep peace those could achieve who had gone forth into homelessnessOnce his master had been so deeply concentrated that he did not see nor hear fivehundred carts passing by him and yet there was no question of his being asleepThe Buddha countered this with the question whether it was more difficult to be so deeply concentrated while there was thunder and lightning and rain torrents coming downPukkusa agreed with thisThereupon the Buddha related that he had abided once like that while all around him oxen and plowmen were killed by lightningThis account sufficed for Pukkusa to declare that the Buddha had thereby expounded the Dhamma in its manifold aspects he took refuge and became a lay disciple the last one in the Buddhas lifetimeThen he presented two sets of goldenhued robes to the BuddhaThe Buddha asked that he give one to him and the other one to AnandaOn this occasion Ananda did not reject the giftHe remarked that the golden hue of the robe was almost without brilliance compared to the bright radiance of the Buddhas skinThe Exalted One said that there are two occasions when the complexion of the Perfect One becomes exceptionally clear and bright on the day of enlightenment and on the day of his deathIn the last hours of the following night he would attain final NibbanaAfter he had taken a bath in the vicinity the Buddha turned to Ananda and said that no one should reproach the goldsmith Cunda that the Buddha had died after taking a meal from himThere were two offerings in the world that are best the almsfood after which the Bodhisatta becomes enlightened and the almsfood after which he attains final NibbanaCunda would gain much merit from his gift his life would be prolonged and his wellbeing heightenedHe would gain much influence fame and a heavenly rebirthThe fifth chapter starts with the Buddhas request to Ananda to accompany him to the region of Kusinara to the salatree grove of the MallasWhen they arrived Ananda arranged a couch for him with the head to the north between two large sala treesAlthough it was not the right season the trees were in flower and sprinkled their blossoms over the body of the BuddhaAnd blossoms of the heavenly mandarava tree fell from the sky together with heavenly scents and there was music of the spheresThis peaceful idyllic picture of the last hours of the founder of Buddhism has been compared with the death of Jesus Christ by a Japanese Buddhist DTSuzukiIn both cases the deaths of the founders have become symbols for those who follow their teachingsThe Awakened One then said that veneration for him through heavenly music scents and blossoms was not honoring him the right way who as a disciple of the Master enters upon the proper way and practices the Dhamma he honors the Perfect One with the highest reverenceJust then the Venerable Upavana was fanning the Blessed OneWhen the Buddha requested Upavana to stand aside Ananda wanted to know why he was so summarily dismissedThe Buddha explained that innumerable deities had come from all directions of the world to have a last glance at a fully enlightened one who so seldom can be seenBut since Upavana an eminent monk was standing in front of him they could not see himUpavanas spiritual radiance must have been more powerful than the penetrative ability of the godsAnanda inquired further into details about the gods and learned that some were weeping and wailing but that those free from sense desire were resigned and calmThe Buddha gave Ananda another directive there were four places in the world worthy of veneration which would inspire a faithful follower  the birthplace of the Buddha the place of enlightenment the place where he taught the Law for the first time and the place of final NibbanaAll those who would travel to visit these shrines with confident hearts would attain a heavenly rebirthSeemingly out of context Ananda asked the question already narrated how one should act towards womenFollowing that he asked how to deal with the body of the Blessed OneThat was a matter for lay people the Buddha replied the monks should be concerned with striving for their own deliveranceThen Ananda wanted to know how the lay people should carry out the funeral ceremonyThe Buddha gave detailed instructions about the cremation and the erection of a stupaThere were four beings worthy of a stupa a perfect Buddha an enlightened one who does not teach a disciple who is an arahant  fully enlightened and a universal monarchHe who worships there would also attain good resultsThen Ananda overpowered by grief went aside clasped the door jamb and weptHe knew he still had to battle and conquer and the Master who had compassion on him would soon be no moreWhat remained as the fruit of his twentyfive years of serviceThis famous scene is often depicted in Buddhist art and is reminiscent of the weeping Christians beneath the crossWhen the Buddha did not see Ananda near him and inquired where he was he had him summoned and said to him Do not sorrowHave I not told you many times that everything changes and vanishesHow could something that came to being and was formed not be destroyedFor a long time Ananda you have attended the Perfect One gladly sensitively sincerely and without reserve with bodily acts of lovingkindness as well as with speech and thoughtsYou have made great merit Ananda keep on endeavoring and soon you will be free from all taintsFollowing this he told him an incident of long ago in which Ananda already served him and made much worldly meritAfter the Awakened One had foretold a second time that Ananda would soon attain arahantship he turned to the monks and once more proclaimed the praise of Ananda all the Buddhas of the past had had such excellent attendants and all Buddhas of the future would have them tooHis skill in dealing with people was admirableEach assembly of monks who were taught by Ananda were always overjoyed and everyone wanted to listen to him furtherAnanda had such remarkable extraordinary popularity as one otherwise only finds in a universal monarchHere too as so often in the texts one can find the two ways he addressed Ananda on the one hand great praise for him and a summons to the monks to appreciate his greatness on the other hand however always the reminder to overcome the last defilementsAfter this praise Ananda turned the conversation to another topicHe suggested that it might be better if the Buddha did not die here in the backwoods but in one of the great capitals such as Savatthi Rajagaha Kosambi or BenaresIt is noteworthy that he did not propose the Buddhas hometown of KapilavatthuIt would have been the most appropriate with respect to distance as well as suitabilityBut Kapilavatthu had been ransacked and almost destroyed recently by the son of King PasenadiSo Ananda did not mention it just as he did not mention Vesali because the Buddha had said that he would not return thereAnanda thought that the funeral ceremony could be performed better in one of the large cities by the lay followers living thereBut the Buddha lying on his deathbed explained to him in great detail why Kusinara was not an unimportant place at allThe Buddha had lived there a long time ago as the universal monarch MahaSudassana and he had left his body there no less than six times as the universal monarch this was the seventh and last timeThe splendor and magnificence of that kingdom had been destroyed had disappeared and vanishedThis indeed was enough to make one weary of all conditioned things as one of the most famous stanzas of the Dhamma taughtThe Buddhas discourse about MahaSudassana was the last great teaching he gaveSubsequently he let Ananda summon the Mallas of Kusinara so that they could bid farewell to himAt that time a wanderer called Subhadda was in Kusinara and heard about the forthcoming final Nibbana of the BuddhaHe thought that it was rare that a Buddha appeared in the worldTherefore it would be well if he could have a doubt resolved by him before it was too lateHe begged Ananda to let him approach the BuddhaAnanda refused him saying that the Master should not be troubled any moreAnanda refused permission three times out of love for his masterBut the Buddha told Ananda to let the wanderer approach him because he wanted to inquire for the sake of knowledge and not to cause troubleSubhadda then asked him a question about which teaching was actually correct as some of the teachers of different sects contradicted each otherThe Buddha replied that he would rather teach him the Dhamma wherever one follows the Noble Eightfold Path there one can find the true holy life there the four fruits of the homeless life would be foundIf monks live in the right way then the world will never be devoid of arahants or true saintsOver fifty years he has been a monk and had expounded the Dhamma  and apart from adherence to Dhamma there could be no holy lifeThis short discourse was sufficient for Subhadda just as it had been for Pukkusa to realize the Dhamma in its manifold aspects and to go for refuge to the Buddha and ask for admission into the order of monksThe Buddha remarked about the rule according to which wanderers of other sects had to be put on probation for four monthsSubhadda agreed readily he even wanted to be put on probation for four yearsThereupon the Buddha accepted him immediately making a last exception and this very last monk disciple of the Buddha soon became an arahantThe sixth part of this narrative which now follows begins with the last instructions of the Buddha first of all the monks should never think after his death that they now did not have a teacher anymore because now the Dhamma and Vinaya would be their teacherTo this day the word of the Buddha laid down in the texts is decisive for the followers of his teachingSecond after his death the monks should no longer address each other indiscriminately as friend The senior monks senior in years in the Order could address the junior ones as friend or with their names while the junior ones should use Venerable Sir This rule also served as an affirmation of the tradition which was now to be lived by the senior monks as an example and which should be honored in them instead of honoring the BuddhaThis is the way of reverence according to seniority in the Order and does not depend on any qualities that monks or nuns may haveThe third rule gave the monks permission to abolish the lesser and minor rules and all they entailed according to their own judgmentAfter his death some details would be difficult to understand and might be considered pettyAs a guarantee that at least the main rules would be followed the assembly of monks might decree that minor rules would no longer be bindingWhoever wanted could keep them but there would be no compulsion any moreThe fourth and last instruction was to impose the higher penalty on the monk ChannaAnanda asked how that was to be understoodThe Buddha explained that Channa was not to be spoken to or advised or instructed no matter what he didAfter these primarily external directions which Ananda was to fulfill the Buddha once more turned to the whole assembly of monks and asked them whether they had any doubt or problem concerning actions or teachings of the Enlightened One the content and meaning of the Dhamma the order of monks and above all about the Path or the way of practiceThose were the four important points for questionsThey should consider them so that they would not regret it later when the voice of the Teacher had been silencedBut upon being asked three times the group did not respondThereupon Ananda said it was amazing that not even one monk had any doubtsThe Buddha corrected him once again because Ananda could not know for sure that really no one had any doubtsIt was possible that a monk did not want to voice his doubt or that he was not conscious of it in this last hourOnly with such total knowledge could one speak in this mannerBut in reality it was exactly as Ananda had saidThe Buddha showed in this way the difference between Anandas confidence and his own the Perfect Ones insightThe least of the fivehundred monks present was a streamwinner because the absence of doubt is one of the signs of this attainmentAnd once more the Master turned to the assembly of monks to give them his final words of farewellNow monks I declare this to you It is the nature of all formed things to dissolveStrive with diligenceAfter the Exalted One had spoken these last words he entered into the four jhanas and the formless spheres of meditation absorption until he attained the stage of cessation of perception and feelingHe thus went once more through the whole sequence of meditation states up to that of cessationWhile the Master was reclining on the couch and going through the jhanas Ananda said to his brother Anuruddha The Exalted One has attained final Nibbana Venerable Sir He no longer addressed him as friend but as a senior monk although both had been ordained on the same dayAnuruddha however had the divine eye and corrected him the Buddha was absorbed in the state of cessation but had not yet passed awayTo recognize this last subtle difference of a state of mind was only possible for an arahant who was  like Anuruddha  skilled in clairvoyanceSubsequently the Buddha entered the nine stages of concentration in reverse order back to the first jhanaThen he attained again to the four jhanas and during his absorption in the fourth jhana his body diedAs soon as his body ceased to live an earthquake and thunder occurred just as he had predictedThe Brahma Sahampati who had induced the Buddha to teach and who himself was a nonreturner spoke a stanza which pointed to the impermanence of even a Buddhas bodyThe king of the gods Sakka also spoke a stanzaHe who was also a streamwinner recited once more the famous lines which the Buddha had proclaimed during his own discourse Conditions truly they are transient As a third Anuruddha gave voice to two verses Peaceful had been the death of the Master without mortal pangs gentle like a lamp he was extinguishedBut Ananda lamentedAnd all those of the fivehundred monks who had not yet attained full liberation from passions lamented like AnandaAnuruddha however consoled them allHe pointed to the immutable law of impermanence and turned their attention to the presence of invisible deities amongst whom there were also those who lamented and those who were free of passions fully enlightenedHe passed the rest of the night talking to his brother about the DhammaIn the fortythree years of their lives as homeless ones not a single conversation about the Dhamma seems to have taken place between these two very dissimilar brothersBut now Anuruddha devoted himself to his brother who was in need of consolationTowards morning Anuruddha asked him to take the message of the final Nibbana of the Buddha to the MallasOut of the circle of close disciples Anuruddha seems to have naturally taken over the role of the one who gives the directivesAnd Ananda went to the town and informed the MallasThereupon the Mallas gathered all the requisites for a great funeral ceremony such as flowers and incense and went in a procession to the salatree forestThere they paid homage to the body of the Buddha with festive dance singing and music with banners and flags with flowers and incense until the seventh dayOne may wonder why they thought of festivities at such a timeBut why should they grieveThat would change nothingThey showed respect and veneration for the Master with their dancing and singingThey exulted that a Buddha had appeared in the world that they had heard more or less of his Dhamma that he had wandered through India for such a long time teaching the multitudes and that he had founded the Sangha to preserve the DhammaIn the seventh day they erected a pyre for the cremationAt this time MahaKassapa who had not been with the Buddha during his last days was on his way to Kusinara with a group of monksHe met a naked wanderer on the road and asked him about the MasterThe wanderer replied that he had attained final Nibbana seven days beforeThen the monks in his company who had not become holy ones yet grieved and lamentedOne of the monks present however declared that it was a good thing that the stern ascetic had died because now one could do again what one pleasedSo soon the voice of the world the voice of craving had made itself heardThis monk whose name also happened to be Subhadda just as the last disciple of the Buddha expressed what ignoble beings feel towards a Buddha he is a troublesome reproach for them a disturber of their superficial waysWhen the Mallas wanted to light the funeral pyre they were unable to do soAnuruddha said that the deities were preventing them because they wanted to wait for the arrival of the venerable KassapaThe venerable Kassapa soon arrived and together with his company of monks he circumambulated the corpse as a last mark of respect towards the Giver of the Deathless Then the funeral pyre ignited itselfThe corpse burned until only the bones remained no ashes were to be seenWhen the neighboring clans heard the news of the Masters death they all sent messengers to ask for relics so that they could erect stupas for themHowever the Mallas requested the relics for themselves because the Buddha had died on their landOnly when a Brahman urged them not to have a dispute about the relics of the greatest peacemaker and suggested that they divide everything unto eight parts did they relentSo it came about that the bones of the Buddha were divided into eight partsThe Brahman asked for the urn and another clan received the ashes of the coalsIn this way ten stupas were erected as memorialsAnanda said in verse about himselfAfter the funeral ceremonies were over Ananda saw only one duty left to him namely to attain to total liberation as prophesied to him by the BuddhaKassapa advised him to live in the forest in the province of the Kosala which was near the Mallas and the SakyansWhen it became known that the Buddhas cousin was living in solitude in the forest nearby he was inundated with visitorsThe lay disciples wanted to be consoled about the death of the Buddha and also about the death of Sariputta and Moggallana as well as the death of their just and beloved King PasenadiAll four had died within the yearDay and night in the village and in the forest Ananda had to console the lay disciples and was never aloneThereupon a deity who lived in the forest appeared to himHe was concerned about Anandas spiritual progress and advised him as followsThe venerable Ananda exhorted by the deity was stirred again to a sense of urgencyIn the meantime the venerable MahaKassapa had decided to call a council of monks together to strengthen the Teaching and the DisciplineBecause of unsafe conditions in the country of Kosala the council was to take place in Rajagaha under the protection of King AjatasattuAll living arahants almost five hundred were to take part and in addition Ananda the only one who was a nonarahantAnanda knew most of the discourses of the Buddha and therefore was indispensable to the councilWhen the date set for the council came closer Anuruddha suggested that his brother Ananda should only be admitted if he had overcome the last taints and had become an arahantHe knew the power of such an incentiveWhen Ananda heard this he decided to employ every bit of strength and ability he possessed to realize NibbanaHe practiced the four foundations of mindfulness a way which came most natural to him according to his tendenciesIn the early hours of the morning when he wanted to rest after his exertion he knew without a doubt the he had attained release from all passionsThe next day the council beganA place had been kept for himAnanda appeared through the air through supernatural power and sat down at his placeWhen Anuruddha and Kassapa became aware that he had become an arahant they expressed their brotherly joy with him and opened the council which took place during the rains retreatOther monks could not come to Rajagaha at this timeDuring the council Kassapa questioned the Keeper of the discipline Upali about each rule and its origin so that the Vinaya was laid down firstThe next item on the agenda was the DoctrineKassapa asked Ananda first about the longest discourses then about the middlelength ones and then the other collectionsAfter the recitation of the Dhamma and Discipline Ananda mentioned those matters which the Buddha had left as a legacy with him to settleHe told the assembly that the Master had allowed the lesser rules to be abolishedThe holy monks could not agree what was meant by lesser rules Thereupon Kassapa suggested the lay people would say that the monks had become slothful after the death of the Master if now they abolished rulesSince it was not known which rules were meant it would be best not to abolish any of themIn that case one would be sure not to act against the Masters wishesAnd so it was doneThe elder monks present said it had been a breach of the training rules that Ananda had not asked which rules were meant and he should confess this as a wrongdoingSecond he was accused of having sewn a robe for the Exalted One after having stepped on itHe replied that nothing had been further from his mind than disrespect for the Blessed OneNevertheless if the venerable ones considered it a wrongdoing he would acknowledge it as suchThird he was criticized for the fact that he had allowed women to salute the remains of the Blessed One firstHe replied that at the time of the funeral arrangements he had thought it would not be an unsuitable time for them and therefore he had allowed them to pay their homage firstBut here too he would accept their verdictThe fourth accusation which the monks leveled at Ananda referred to the time when he had neglected to beg the Blessed One to remain for an aeonAnanda defended himself by saying he had been possessed by Mara at the time and therefore had not been responsible for his actions  how could he have otherwise failed to make this requestAnandas behavior in the face of these accusations was exemplary he submitted to the judgment of the other holy ones although he himself could not see any wrongdoing a fact which he did not fail to mentionSubsequently Ananda reported the second instruction which the Buddha had given immediately before his death namely imposing the higher penalty on the monk ChannaThe present assembly requested Ananda to present this decision to Channa himselfAnanda objected that Channa was a violent and unruly personThe assembly advised him to take a number of monks alongLeading a large group he journeyed to Kosambi where Channa was living and informed him of the last will of the Buddha that he had been declared dead in the OrderThis penalty had been explained by the Buddha to the horse trainer KesiHe would use it against monks who could not be changed to wholesomeness either through admonition or disciplineWhoever could not be trained in this way would be considered as dead in the Order he would not be spoken to whatever he didWhen Channa heard this he became so horrified that he lost consciousnessWhen he regained his sense he was deeply ashamed that the Master had proclaimed this penalty against him as his last instruction given to the OrderThis gave him the impetus to put forth his most strenuous effort within a short time he became an arahantSo this penalty showed itself to be the Buddhas last act of compassion for the benefit and happiness of the monk Channa being effective even after the Buddhas deathWhen Channa had become a holy one he went to Ananda and begged him for a repeal of the penaltyAnanda replied that as soon as he had attained release from the passions the penalty was no longer operative in any caseAfter the death of the Buddha the venerable MahaKassapa as the most respected disciple had taken over the guidance of the OrderHe had however not the status of being a refuge as the Buddha had been nor was he his deputyHe was simply the foremost of the monks with the ten higher qualitiesHe was so to say the symbol for the observance of Dhamma and DisciplineEveryone turned to him for all questions regarding the OrderIn this way he became the Elder of the SanghaAfter him Ananda became the second leading elder the second most venerated holy one who was designated to look after the OrderAfter he had already been a monk for over forty years he survived the Buddha another fortyAnd after having been the personal attendant of the Buddha for twentyfive years he became the foremost of the holy ones for a similar length of timeAt the time of the second council one hundred years after the final Nibbana of the Buddha a personal disciple of Ananda was still aliveHe was a very old monk by name of Sabbakami who  it was said  had been in the Order for one hundred and twenty yearsWhen Ananda reached one hundred and twenty years he felt that his death was nearHe went from Rajagaha on a journey to Vesali just as his master had doneWhen the king of Magadha and the princes of Vesali heard that Ananda would soon die they hurried to him from both directions to bid him farewellIn order to do justice to both sides Ananda chose a way to die in keeping with his gentle nature he raised himself into the air through his supernormal powers and let his body be consumed by the fire elementThe relics were divided and stupas erectedThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThis index can help you locate sutta translations articles transcribed talks books and other things on this websiteThis is not an exhaustive index not every text is indexed here nor have I included references to each and every occurrence of a given topic in the textsNevertheless I hope you find it helpful in steering you in the right directionThe tilde stands for the headword in a given entryShort essays and individual chapters from books are shown in quotation marksBooks and longer works are shown in italicsLinks to terms listed elsewhere in this index are shown in bold faceThere are more than web pages on this site containing hundreds of books articles sutta translations and more  all of which may be a bit overwhelming if youre new to the site or to the teachings of Theravada BuddhismHere are some starting points to help you get orientedThus you should train yourselves We will listen when discourses that are words of the Tathagata  deep deep in their meaning transcendent connected with emptiness  are being recitedWe will lend ear will set our hearts on knowing them will regard these teachings as worth grasping  mastering Thats how you should train yourselvesThe Pali canon contains many thousands of suttas of which more than one thousand are now available in English translation here at Access to InsightWhen faced with such a vast store of riches three questions naturally spring to mind Why should I read the suttasWhich ones should I readHow should I read themThere are no simple cookiecutter answers to these questions the best answers will be the ones you discover on your ownNevertheless I offer here a few ideas suggestions and tips that Ive found to be helpful over the years in my own exploration of the suttasPerhaps youll find some of them helpful tooThe short answer is Whichever ones you likeIt can be helpful to think of the Dhamma as a multifaceted jewel with each sutta offering a glimpse of one or two of those facetsFor example there are teachings of the four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path of dana and sila of mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness of death of living skillfully as a layperson or as an ordained monkNo single sutta says it all each one depends upon all the others to paint a complete picture of the Buddhas teachingsThe more widely you can read in the suttas the more complete your picture of this jewel becomesAs a starting point every student of Buddhism should study reflect upon and put into practice the Five Precepts and the Five Subjects for Daily ContemplationFurthermore we should take to heart the Buddhas advice to his young son Rahula which concerns our basic responsibilities whenever we perform an intentional act of any kindFrom there you can follow along with the Buddhas own stepbystep or graduated system of teachings that encompasses the topics of generosity virtue heaven drawbacks of sensuality renunciation and the four Noble TruthsIf youre interested in a solid grounding on the basics of the Buddhas teachings three suttas are widely regarded as essential reading Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion The Discourse on the Notself Characteristic and The Fire SermonTogether these suttas  the Big Three of the Sutta Pitaka  define the essential themes of the Buddhas teachings that reappear in countless variations throughout the CanonIn these suttas we are introduced to such fundamental notions as the Four Noble Truths the nature of dukkha the Eightfold Path the middle way the wheel of the Dhamma the principle of anatta and the analysis of ones self into the five aggregates the principle of shedding ones enchantment with sensual gratification and the many planes of being that characterize the vast range of Buddhist cosmologyThese basic principles provide a sturdy framework upon which all the other teachings in the Canon can be placedFurthermore these three suttas demonstrate beautifully the Buddhas remarkable skill as teacher he organizes his material in clear logical and memorable ways by using lists he engages his listeners in an active dialogue to help them reveal for themselves the errors in their understanding he conveys his points by using similes and imagery that his listeners readily understand and most significantly time and again he connects with his listeners so effectively that they are able to realize for themselves the transcendent results that he promisesSeeing the Buddha for the extraordinarily capable teacher that he is encourages us to proceed even deeper into the Canon confident that his teachings wont lead us astrayA few other fruitful points of departureWhen you find a sutta that captures your interest look for others like itFrom there wander at will picking up whatever gems catch your eye along the wayTo get the most from your sutta studies it can be helpful to consider a few general principles before you actually begin reading and once youve begun reading a sutta to bear in mind a few questions as you readIt is probably best not to let yourself get too comfortable with any one particular translation whether of a word or of an entire suttaJust because for example one translator equates suffering with dukkha or Unbinding with nibbana doesnt mean that you should accept those translations as truthTry them on for size and see how they work for youAllow plenty of room for your understanding to change and mature and cultivate a willingness to consider alternate translationsPerhaps over time your own preferences will changeRemember that any translation is just a convenient  but provisional  crutch that you must use until you can come to your own firsthand understanding of the ideas it describesIf youre really serious about understanding what the suttas are about youll just have to bite the bullet and learn some PaliBut theres an even better way read the translations and put the teachings they contain into practice until you get the results promised by the BuddhaMastery of Pali is thankfully not a prerequisite for AwakeningTo facilitate this slow ripening process allow yourself plenty of room for the suttasDont cram your sutta reading in among all your other activitiesDont read too many suttas all at onceMake sutta study a special contemplative activityIt should be a pleasant experienceIf it becomes dry and irritating put it all aside and try again in a few days weeks or monthsSutta study calls for more than simply reading it once or twice and telling yourself ThereIve done the Satipatthana SuttaWhats next After you finish reading a sutta take a little time out afterwards for some breath meditation to give the teachings a chance to settle down into the heartAs you read a sutta keep in mind that you are eavesdropping on the Buddha as he teaches someone elseUnlike many of the Buddhas contemporaries from other spiritual traditions who would often adhere to a fixed doctrine when answering every question the Buddha tailored his teachings to meet the particular needs of his audienceIt is therefore important to develop a sensitivity to the context of a sutta to see in what ways the circumstances of the Buddhas audience may be similar to your own so you can gauge how best to apply the Buddhas words to your own life situationAs you read it can be helpful to keep certain questions circulating gently in the back of your mind both to help you understand the context of the sutta and to help you tune in to the different levels of teaching that are often going on at onceThese questions arent meant to make you into a Buddhist literary scholar theyre simply meant to help each sutta come alive for youTheravada the Doctrine of the Elders is the school of Buddhism that draws its scriptural inspiration from the Tipitaka or Pali canon which scholars generally agree contains the earliest surviving record of the Buddhas teachingsFor many centuries Theravada has been the predominant religion of continental Southeast Asia and Sri LankaToday Theravada Buddhists number well over million worldwideIn recent decades Theravada has begun to take root in the WestThe Buddha  the Awakened One  called the religion he founded Dhammavinaya  the doctrine and discipline To provide a social structure supportive of the practice of Dhammavinaya and to preserve these teachings for posterity the Buddha established the order of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis  the Sangha  which continues to this day to pass his teachings on to subsequent generations of laypeople and monastics alikeAs the Dhamma continued its spread across India after the Buddhas passing differing interpretations of the original teachings arose which led to schisms within the Sangha and the emergence of as many as eighteen distinct sects of BuddhismOne of these schools eventually gave rise to a reform movement that called itself Mahayana and that referred to the other schools disparagingly as HinayanaWhat we call Theravada today is the sole survivor of those early nonMahayana schoolsTo avoid the pejorative tone implied by the terms Hinayana and Mahayana it is common today to use more neutral language to distinguish between these two main branches of BuddhismBecause Theravada historically dominated southern Asia it is sometimes called Southern Buddhism while Mahayana which migrated northwards from India into China Tibet Japan and Korea is known as Northern BuddhismThe language of the Theravada canonical texts is Pali which is based on a dialect of Middle IndoAryan that was probably spoken in central India during the Buddhas timeVenAnanda the Buddhas cousin and close personal attendant committed the Buddhas sermons to memory and thus became a living repository of these teachingsShortly after the Buddhas death five hundred of the most senior monks  including Ananda  convened to recite and verify all the sermons they had heard during the Buddhas fortyfive year teaching careerMost of these sermons therefore begin with the disclaimer Evam me sutam  Thus have I heardAfter the Buddhas death the teachings continued to be passed down orally within the monastic community in keeping with an Indian oral tradition that long predated the BuddhaBy BCE the Sangha had systematically arranged and compiled these teachings into three divisions the Vinaya Pitaka the Sutta Pitaka and the Abhidhamma PitakaTogether these three are known as the Tipitaka the three baskets In the third century BCE Sri Lankan monks began compiling a series of exhaustive commentaries to the Tipitaka these were subsequently collated and translated into Pali beginning in the fifth century CEThe Tipitaka plus the postcanonical texts together constitute the complete body of classical Theravada literaturePali was originally a spoken language with no alphabet of its ownIt wasnt until about BCE that the Tipitaka was first fixed in writing by Sri Lankan scribemonks who wrote the Pali phonetically in a form of early Brahmi scriptSince then the Tipitaka has been transliterated into many different scriptsAlthough English translations of the most popular Tipitaka texts abound many students of Theravada find that learning the Pali language  even just a little bit here and there  greatly deepens their understanding and appreciation of the Buddhas teachingsNo one can prove that the Tipitaka contains any of the words actually uttered by the historical BuddhaPracticing Buddhists have never found this problematicUnlike the scriptures of many of the worlds great religions the Tipitaka is not regarded as gospel as an unassailable statement of divine truth revealed by a prophet to be accepted purely on faithInstead its teachings are meant to be assessed firsthand to be put into practice in ones life so that one can find out for oneself if they do in fact yield the promised resultsIt is the truth towards which the words in the Tipitaka point that ultimately matters not the words themselvesAlthough scholars will continue to debate the authorship of passages from the Tipitaka for years to come the Tipitaka will quietly continue to serve  as it has for centuries  as an indispensable guide for millions of followers in their quest for AwakeningShortly after his Awakening the Buddha delivered his first sermon in which he laid out the essential framework upon which all his later teachings were basedThis framework consists of the Four Noble Truths four fundamental principles of nature that emerged from the Buddhas radically honest and penetrating assessment of the human conditionHe taught these truths not as metaphysical theories or as articles of faith but as categories by which we should frame our direct experience in a way that conduces to AwakeningBecause of our ignorance of these Noble Truths because of our inexperience in framing the world in their terms we remain bound to samsara the wearisome cycle of birth aging illness death and rebirthCraving propels this process onward from one moment to the next and over the course of countless lifetimes in accordance with kamma the universal law of cause and effectAccording to this immutable law every action that one performs in the present moment  whether by body speech or mind itself  eventually bears fruit according to its skillfulness act in unskillful and harmful ways and unhappiness is bound to follow act skillfully and happiness will ultimately ensueAs long as one remains ignorant of this principle one is doomed to an aimless existence happy one moment in despair the next enjoying one lifetime in heaven the next in hellBecause the roots of ignorance are so intimately entwined with the fabric of the psyche the unawakened mind is capable of deceiving itself with breathtaking ingenuityThe solution therefore requires more than simply being kind loving and mindful in the present momentThe practitioner must equip him or herself with the expertise to use a range of tools to outwit outlast and eventually uproot the minds unskillful tendenciesFor example the practice of generosity erodes the hearts habitual tendencies towards craving and teaches valuable lessons about the motivations behind and the results of skillful actionThe practice of virtue guards one against straying wildly offcourse and into harms wayThe cultivation of goodwill helps to undermine angers seductive graspThe ten recollections offer ways to alleviate doubt bear physical pain with composure maintain a healthy sense of selfrespect overcome laziness and complacency and restrain oneself from unbridled lustAnd there are many more skills to learnThe good qualities that emerge and mature from these practices not only smooth the way for the journey to Nibbana over time they have the effect of transforming the practitioner into a more generous loving compassionate peaceful and clearheaded member of societyThe individuals sincere pursuit of Awakening is thus a priceless and timely gift to a world in desperate need of helpThe Eightfold Path is best understood as a collection of personal qualities to be developed rather than as a sequence of steps along a linear pathThe development of right view and right resolve facilitates the development of right speech action and livelihoodAs virtue develops so do the factors identified with concentrationLikewise as concentration matures discernment evolves to a still deeper levelAnd so the process unfolds development of one factor fosters development of the next lifting the practitioner in an upward spiral of spiritual maturity that eventually culminates in AwakeningThe long journey to Awakening begins in earnest with the first tentative stirrings of right view  the discernment by which one recognizes the validity of the four Noble Truths and the principle of kammaOne begins to see that ones future wellbeing is neither predestined by fate nor left to the whims of a divine being or random chanceThe responsibility for ones happiness rests squarely on ones own shouldersSeeing this ones spiritual aims become suddenly clear to relinquish the habitual unskillful tendencies of the mind in favor of skillful onesAs this right resolve grows stronger so does the heartfelt desire to live a morally upright life to choose ones actions with careAt this point many followers make the inward commitment to take the Buddhas teachings to heart to become Buddhist through the act of taking refuge in the Triple Gem the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaWith ones feet thus planted on solid ground and with the help of an admirable friend or teacher to guide the way one is now wellequipped to proceed down the Path following in the footsteps left by the Buddha himselfRight view and right resolve continue to mature through the development of the path factors associated with sila or virtue  namely right speech right action and right livelihoodThese are condensed into a very practical form in the five precepts the basic code of ethical conduct to which every practicing Buddhist subscribes refraining from killing stealing sexual misconduct lying and using intoxicantsEven the monks complex code of rules and the nuns ultimately have these five basic precepts at their coreHaving gained a foothold in the purification of ones outward behavior through the practice of sila the essential groundwork has been laid for delving into the most subtle and transformative aspect of the path meditation and the development of samadhi or concentrationThis is spelled out in detail in the final three path factors right effort by which one learns how to favor skillful qualities of mind over unskillful ones right mindfulness by which one learns to keep ones attention continually grounded in the present moment of experience and right concentration by which one learns to immerse the mind so thoroughly and unwaveringly in its meditation object that it enters jhana a series of progressively deeper states of mental and physical tranquillityRight mindfulness and right concentration are developed in tandem through satipatthana a systematic approach to meditation practice that embraces a wide range of skills and techniquesOf these practices mindfulness of the body is particularly effective at bringing into balance the twin qualities of tranquillity and insight or clearseeingThrough persistent practice the meditator becomes more adept at bringing the combined powers of samathavipassana to bear in an exploration of the fundamental nature of mind and bodyAs the meditator masters the ability to frame his immediate experience in terms of anicca dukkha and anatta even the subtlest manifestations of these three characteristics of experience are brought into exquisitely sharp focusAt the same time the root cause of dukkha  craving  is relentlessly exposed to the light of awarenessEventually craving is left with no place to hide the entire karmic process that fabricates dukkha unravels the eightfold path reaches its noble climax and the meditator gains at long last his or her first unmistakable glimpse of the Unconditioned  NibbanaThis first enlightenment experience known as streamentry is the first of four progressive stages of Awakening each of which entails the irreversible shedding or weakening of several fetters the manifestations of ignorance that bind a person to the cycle of birth and deathStreamentry marks an unprecedented and radical turning point both in the practitioners current life and in the entirety of his or her long journey in samsaraFor it is at this point that any lingering doubts about the truth of the Buddhas teachings disappear it is at this point that any belief in the purifying efficacy of rites and rituals evaporates and it is at this point that the longcherished notion of an abiding personal self falls awayThe streamenterer is said to be assured of no more than seven future rebirths before eventually attaining full AwakeningBut full Awakening is still a long way offAs the practitioner presses on with renewed diligence he or she passes through two more significant landmarks oncereturning which is accompanied by the weakening of the fetters of sensual desire and illwill and nonreturning in which these two fetters are uprooted altogetherThe final stage of Awakening  arahatta  occurs when even the most refined and subtle levels of craving and conceit are irrevocably extinguishedAt this point the practitioner  now an arahant or worthy one  arrives at the endpoint of the Buddhas teachingWith ignorance suffering stress and rebirth having all come to their end the arahant at last can utter the victory cry first proclaimed by the Buddha upon his AwakeningBirth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this worldThe arahant lives out the remainder of his or her life inwardly enjoying the bliss of Nibbana secure at last from the possibility of any future rebirthWhen the arahants aeonslong trail of past kamma eventually unwinds to its end the arahant dies and he or she enters into parinibbana  total UnbindingAlthough language utterly fails at describing this extraordinary event the Buddha likened it to what happens when a fire finally burns up all its fuelBuddhism is sometimes navely criticized as a negative or pessimistic religion and philosophySurely life is not all misery and disappointment it offers many kinds of happiness and sublime joyWhy then this dreary Buddhist obsession with unsatisfactoriness and sufferingThe Buddha based his teachings on a frank assessment of our plight as humans there is unsatisfactoriness and suffering in the worldNo one can argue this factDukkha lurks behind even the highest forms of worldly pleasure and joy for sooner or later as surely as night follows day that happiness must come to an endWere the Buddhas teachings to stop there we might indeed regard them as pessimistic and life as utterly hopelessBut like a doctor who prescribes a remedy for an illness the Buddha offers both a hope and a cureThe Buddhas teachings thus give cause for unparalleled optimism and joyThe teachings offer as their reward the noblest truest kind of happiness and give profound value and meaning to an otherwise grim existenceOne modern teacher summed it up well Buddhism is the serious pursuit of happinessUntil the late th century the teachings of Theravada were little known outside of southern Asia where they had flourished for some two and onehalf millenniaIn the past century however the West has begun to take notice of Theravadas unique spiritual legacy in its teachings of AwakeningIn recent decades this interest has swelled with the monastic Sangha from various schools within Theravada establishing dozens of monasteries across Europe and North AmericaIncreasing numbers of lay meditation centers founded and operated independently of the monastic Sangha strain to meet the demands of lay men and women  Buddhist and otherwise  seeking to learn selected aspects of the Buddhas teachingsThe turn of the st century presents both opportunities and dangers for Theravada in the West Will the Buddhas teachings be patiently studied and put into practice and allowed to establish deep roots in Western soil for the benefit of many generations to comeWill the current popular Western climate of openness and crossfertilization between spiritual traditions lead to the emergence of a strong new form of Buddhist practice unique to the modern era or will it simply lead to confusion and the dilution of these priceless teachingsThese are open questions only time will tellSpiritual teachings of every description inundate the media and the marketplace todayMany of todays popular spiritual teachings borrow liberally from the Buddha though only rarely do they place the Buddhas words in their true contextEarnest seekers of truth are therefore often faced with the unsavory task of wading through fragmentary teachings of dubious accuracyHow are we to make sense of it allFortunately the Buddha left us with some simple guidelines to help us navigate through this bewildering floodWhenever you find yourself questioning the authenticity of a particular teaching heed well the Buddhas advice to his stepmotherthe qualities of which you may know These qualities lead to passion not to dispassion to being fettered not to being unfettered to accumulating not to shedding to selfaggrandizement not to modesty to discontent not to contentment to entanglement not to seclusion to laziness not to aroused persistence to being burdensome not to being unburdensome You may categorically hold This is not the Dhamma this is not the Vinaya this is not the Teachers instructionthe qualities of which you may know These qualities lead to dispassion not to passion to being unfettered not to being fettered to shedding not to accumulating to modesty not to selfaggrandizement to contentment not to discontent to seclusion not to entanglement to aroused persistence not to laziness to being unburdensome not to being burdensome You may categorically hold This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instructionThe truest test of these teachings of course is whether they yield the promised results in the crucible of your own heartThe Buddha presents the challenge the rest is up to youThis description of the unified role of samatha and vipassana is based upon the Buddhas meditation teachings as presented in the suttasThe Abhidhamma and the Commentaries by contrast state that samatha and vipassana are two distinct meditation pathsIt is impossible to reconcile these divergent views from studying the texts alone any doubts about the roles of samatha and vipassana are best resolved through the actual practice of meditationThe suttas listed below are available here at Access to InsightA handful of suttalike passages from the Vinaya Pitaka are also listed hereSutta references are either to sutta number samyutta and sutta number nipata and sutta number verse number vagga and sutta number or vagga

AttributionNonCommercialInternational LicenseTo view a copy of the license visit creativecommonsorglicensesbyncAccording to the Buddhist monastic code monks and nuns are not allowed to accept money or even to engage in barter or trade with lay peopleThey live entirely in an economy of giftsLay supporters provide gifts of material requisites for the monastics while the monastics provide their supporters with the gift of the teachingIdeally  and to a great extent in actual practice  this is an exchange that comes from the heart something totally voluntaryThere are many stories in the texts that emphasize the point that returns in this economy  it might also be called an economy of merit  depend not on the material value of the object given but on the purity of heart of the donor and recipientYou give what is appropriate to the occasion and to your means when and wherever your heart feels inspiredFor the monastics this means that you teach out of compassion what should be taught regardless of whether it will sellFor the laity this means that you give what you have to spare and feel inclined to shareThere is no price for the teachings nor even a suggested donation Anyone who regards the act of teaching or the act of giving requisites as a repayment for a particular favor is ridiculed as mercenaryInstead you give because giving is good for the heart and because the survival of the Dhamma as a living principle depends on daily acts of generosityThe primary symbol of this economy is the alms bowlIf you are a monastic it represents your dependence on others your need to accept generosity no matter what form it takesYou may not get what you want in the bowl but you realize that you always get what you need even if its a hardearned lesson in doing withoutOne of my students in Thailand once went to the mountains in the northern part of the country to practice in solitudeHis hillside shack was an ideal place to meditate but he had to depend on a nearby hilltribe village for alms and the diet was mostly plain rice with some occasional boiled vegetablesAfter two months on this diet his meditation theme became the conflict in his mind over whether he should go or stayOne rainy morning as he was on his alms round he came to a shack just as the morning rice was readyThe wife of the house called out asking him to wait while she got some rice from the potAs he was waiting there in the pouring rain he couldnt help grumbling inwardly about the fact that there would be nothing to go with the riceIt so happened that the woman had an infant son who was sitting near the kitchen fire crying from hungerSo as she scooped some rice out of the pot she stuck a small lump of rice in his mouthImmediately the boy stopped crying and began to grinMy student saw this and it was like a light bulb turning on in his headHere you are complaining about what people are giving you for free he told himselfYoure no match for a little kidIf he can be happy with just a lump of rice why cant you As a result the lesson that came with his scoop of rice that day gave my student the strength he needed to stay on in the mountains for another three yearsFor a monastic the bowl also represents the opportunity you give others to practice the Dhamma in accordance with their meansIn Thailand this is reflected in one of the idioms used to describe going for alms proad sat doing a favor for living beingsThere were times on my alms round in rural Thailand when as I walked past a tiny grass shack someone would come running out to put rice in my bowlYears earlier as lay person my reaction on seeing such a bare tiny shack would have been to want to give monetary help to themBut now I was on the receiving end of their generosityIn my new position I may have been doing less for them in material terms than I could have done as a lay person but at least I was giving them the opportunity to have the dignity that comes with being a donorFor the donors the monks alms bowl becomes a symbol of the good they have doneOn several occasions in Thailand people would tell me that they had dreamed of a monk standing before them opening the lid to his bowlThe details would differ as to what the dreamer saw in the bowl but in each case the interpretation of the dream was the same the dreamers merit was about to bear fruit in an especially positive wayThe alms round itself is also a gift that goes both waysOn the one hand daily contact with lay donors reminds the monastics that their practice is not just an individual matter but a concern of the entire communityThey are indebted to others for the right and opportunity to practice and should do their best to practice diligently as a way of repaying that debtAt the same time the opportunity to walk through a village early in the morning passing by the houses of the rich and poor the happy and unhappy gives plenty of opportunities to reflect on the human condition and the need to find a way out of the grinding cycle of death and rebirthFor the donors the alms round is a reminder that the monetary economy is not the only way to happinessIt helps to keep a society sane when there are monastics infiltrating the towns every morning embodying an ethos very different from the dominant monetary economyThe gently subversive quality of this custom helps people to keep their values straightAbove all the economy of gifts symbolized by the alms bowl and the alms round allows for specialization a division of labor from which both sides benefitThose who are willing can give up many of the privileges of home life and in return receive the free time the basic support and the communal training needed to devote themselves fully to Dhamma practiceThose who stay at home can benefit from having fulltime Dhamma practitioners around on a daily basisI have always found it ironic that the modern world honors specialization in almost every area  even in things like running jumping and throwing a ball  but not in the Dhamma where it is denounced as dualism elitism or worseThe Buddha began the monastic order on the first day of his teaching career because he saw the benefits that come with specializationWithout it the practice tends to become limited and diluted negotiated into the demands of the monetary economyThe Dhamma becomes limited to what will sell and what will fit into a schedule dictated by the demands of family and jobIn this sort of situation everyone ends up poorer in things of the heartThe fact that tangible goods run only one way in the economy of gifts means that the exchange is open to all sorts of abusesThis is why there are so many rules in the monastic code to keep the monastics from taking unfair advantage of the generosity of lay donorsThere are rules against asking for donations in inappropriate circumstances from making claims as to ones spiritual attainments and even from covering up the good foods in ones bowl with rice in hopes that donors will then feel inclined to provide something more substantialMost of the rules in fact were instituted at the request of lay supporters or in response to their complaintsThey had made their investment in the merit economy and were interested in protecting their investmentThis observation applies not only to ancient India but also to the modernday WestOn their first contact with the Sangha most people tend to see little reason for the disciplinary rules and regard them as quaint holdovers from ancient Indian prejudicesWhen however they come to see the rules in the context of the economy of gifts and begin to participate in that economy themselves they also tend to become avid advocates of the rules and active protectors of their monasticsThe arrangement may limit the freedom of the monastics in certain ways but it means that the lay supporters take an active interest not only in what the monastic teaches but also in how the monastic lives  a useful safeguard to make sure that teachers walk their talkThis again insures that the practice remains a communal concernAs the Buddha saidMonks householders are very helpful to you as they provide you with the requisites of robes almsfood lodgings and medicineAnd you monks are very helpful to householders as you teach them the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle and admirable in the end as you expound the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely complete surpassingly pureIn this way the holy life is lived in mutual dependence for the purpose of crossing over the flood for making a right end to suffering and stressPeriodically throughout the history of Buddhism the economy of gifts has broken down usually when one side or the other gets fixated on the tangible side of the exchange and forgets the qualities of the heart that are its reason for beingAnd periodically it has been revived when people are sensitive to its rewards in terms of the living DhammaBy its very nature the economy of gifts is something of a hothouse creation that requires careful nurture and a sensitive discernment of its benefitsI find it amazing that such an economy has lasted for more than yearsIt will never be more than an alternative to the dominant monetary economy largely because its rewards are so intangible and require so much patience trust and discipline in order to be appreciatedThose who demand immediate return for specific services and goods will always require a monetary systemSincere Buddhist lay people however have the chance to play an amphibious role engaging in the monetary economy in order to maintain their livelihood and contributing to the economy of gifts whenever they feel so inclinedIn this way they can maintain direct contact with teachers insuring the best possible instruction for their own practice in an atmosphere where mutual compassion and concern are the medium of exchange and purity of heart the bottom lineTwo remarkable stories from the MahavaggaAn anthropologist once questioned an Eskimo shaman about his tribes belief systemAfter putting up with the anthropologists questions for a while the shaman finally told him LookWe dont believeWe fearIn a similar way Buddhism starts not with a belief but with a fear of very present dangersAs the Buddha himself reported his initial impetus for leaving home and seeking Awakening was his comprehension of the great dangers that inevitably follow on birth aging illness death and separationThe Awakening he sought was one that would lead him to a happiness not subject to these thingsAfter finding that happiness and in attempting to show others how to find it for themselves he frequently referred to the themes of aging illness death and separation as useful objects for contemplationBecause of this his teaching has often been called pessimistic but this emphasis is actually like that of a doctor who focuses on the symptoms and causes of disease as part of an effort to bring about a cureThe Buddha is not afraid to dwell on these topics because the Awakening he teaches brings about a total release from themThis study guide provides an introduction to the Buddhas teachings on aging illness death and separationThe passages included here  all taken from the Pali canon  are arranged in five sectionsThe first section presents medical metaphors for the teaching showing how the Buddha was like a doctor and how his teaching is like a course of therapy offering a cure for the great dangers in lifeThe second section diagnoses the problems of aging illness death and separationThis section touches briefly on the Buddhas central teaching the four noble truthsFor more information on this subject see A Path to Freedom and the study guide The Four Noble TruthsThe third section contains passages that use aging illness death and separation as reminders for diligence in the practiceThe central passage here is a set of five recollections in which recollection of aging illness death and separation forms a background for a fifth recollection the power of ones actions to shape ones experienceIn other words the first four recollections present the dangers of life the fifth indicates the way in which those dangers may be overcome through developing skill in ones own thoughts words and deedsUseful articles to read in conjunction with this section are Affirming the Truths of the Heart Karma and The Road to Nirvana is Paved with Skillful IntentionsThe fourth section contains passages that give specific advice on how to deal with problems of aging etcThe Buddhas teachings on kamma provide an important underpinning for how problems of pain and illness are approached in this sectionGiven the fact that the experience of the present moment is shaped both by past and by present intentions it is possible that  if an illness is the result of present intentions  a change of mind can effect a cure in the illness but if the illness is the result of past intentions a change of mind may have no effect on the illness but can at least protect the mind from being adversely affected by itThus some of the passages focus how practicing the Dhamma can cure a person of illness whereas others focus on how the Dhamma can ensure that even though a person may die from an illness the illness will make no inroads on the mindThe fifth section gives examples of how the Buddha and his disciples skillfully negotiated the problems of aging illness death and separationFrom the Anguttara Nikayaand an appeal for your helpThese Wheel Publications are also now available for online readingHere are some of the new URLs to be aware ofFrom Ajaan LeeSome more gems from the Therigathaand from the Theragathaand finallyAnd one other suttaMastery of Dhamma sometimes

old KassapaYour robes made of castoff hemp rags are heavy for youSo wear robes donated by householders eat invitational meals and live close by meLord for a long time I have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wildernessI have been an almsgoer and have extolled being an almsgoerI have worn cast off rags and have extolled wearing cast off ragsI have worn only one set of the triple robe and have extolled wearing only one set of the triple robeI have been modest and have extolled being modestI have been content and have extolled being contentI have been reclusive and have extolled being reclusiveI have been unentangled and have extolled being unentangledI have kept my persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence arousedBut Kassapa what compelling reason do you see that you for a long time have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness that you have kept your persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence arousedLord I see two compelling reasons that for a long time I have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness that I have kept my persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused seeing a pleasant abiding for myself in the here  now and feeling sympathy for later generations Perhaps later generations will take it as an example It seems that the disciples of the Awakened One and those who awakened after him lived for a long time in the wilderness and extolled living in the wilderness were almsgoers and extolled being almsgoers wore cast off rags and extolled wearing cast off rags wore only one set of the triple robe and extolled wearing only one set of the triple robe were modest and extolled being modest were content and extolled being content were reclusive and extolled being reclusive were unentangled and extolled being unentangled kept their persistence aroused and extolled having persistence aroused Good KassapaVery goodIt seems that you are one who practices for the happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of beings human  divineSo continue wearing your robes of cast off hemp cloth go for alms and live in the wildernessThen when the Blessed One had entered the Rains Retreat there arose a severe illness within himSharp  deadly were the pains but he bore them mindfully alert  unperturbedThe thought occurred to him It would not be proper for me to enter total Unbinding without addressing my attendants  without taking leave of the community of monksWhy dont I suppressing this illness with persistence remain resolved on the fabrication of life So he suppressed the illness with persistence  remained resolved on the fabrication of lifeHis illness abatedThen he recovered from the illnessSoon after his recovery he came out of his dwelling  sat down in the shade of the building on a seat prepared for himThen VenAnanda approached him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One What a happy sight to see the Blessed One in comfortWhat a happy sight to see the Blessed One at easeBecause of the Blessed Ones sickness my own body felt as if it were druggedI lost my bearingsThings were unclear to meYet I still took a measure of comfort in the thought that the Blessed One would not enter total Unbinding as long as he hadnt given at least some pronouncement concerning the community of monksWhat more does the community of monks want from me AnandaI have taught the Dhamma without an inner or an outer versionThe Tathagata has no closed fist with regard to teachingsWhoever has the thought I will rule the community of monks or The community of monks is dedicated to mehe should give some pronouncement concerning the community of monksBut the Tathagata has no such thoughtsSo why should he give some pronouncement concerning the community of monksI am old now Ananda  agedMy years have turned eightyJust as an old cart is kept going with the help of bamboo strips it seems to me as if the Tathagatas body is kept going with the help of bamboo stripsThe only time the Tathagatas body feels at ease is when not attending to any theme at all and with the cessation of certain feelings he enters  remains in the themeless concentration of awarenessTherefore each of you should remain with your self as an island your self as your refuge without anything else as a refugeRemain with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as your refuge without anything else as a refugeAnd how does a monk remain with his self as an island his self as his refuge without anything else as a refugeHow does he remain with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as his refuge without anything else as a refugeThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is how a monk remains with his self as an island his self as his refuge without anything else as a refuge with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as his refuge without anything else as a refugeFor those who  now or after I am gone  remain with their self as an island the Dhamma as their refuge without anything else as a refuge they will be the highest of the monks who desire trainingI have heard that on one occasion VenAnuruddha was staying near Savatthi in the Dark Forest  diseased in pain severely illThen a large number of monks went to VenAnuruddha and on arrival said to him What dwelling are you dwelling in so that the pains that have arisen in the body do not invade or remain in the mindWhen I dwell with my mind wellestablished in the four frames of reference the pains that have arisen in the body do not invade or remain in the mindWhich fourThere is the case where I remain focused on the body in

occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha at the Maddakucchi Deer ReserveNow at that time his foot had been pierced by a stone sliverExcruciating were the bodily feelings that developed within him  painful fierce sharp wracking repellent disagreeable  but he endured them mindful alert  unperturbedHaving had his outer robe folded in four and laid out he lay down on his right side in the lions posture with one foot placed on top of the other mindful  alertThen Mara the Evil One went to the Blessed One and recited this verse in his presenceThen Mara the Evil One  sad  dejected at realizing The Blessed One knows me the One WellGone knows me  vanished right thereOn that occasion Citta the householder was diseased in pain severely illThen a large number of garden devas forest

Buddha Dhamma  Sangha having exhorted them to undertake generosity Citta the householder passed away ThagXVIOnce VenSariputta and VenUpasena were staying near Rajagaha in the Cool Forest at Snakeshood GrottoThen it so happened that a snake fell on VenUpasenas bodyThen VenUpasena said to the monks Quick friends lift this body of mine onto a couch and carry it outside before it is scattered like a fistful of chaffWhen this was said VenSariputta said to VenUpasena But we dont see any alteration in your body or change in your facultiesThen VenUpasena said Quick friends lift this body of mine onto a couch and carry it outside before it is scattered like a fistful of chaffFriend Sariputta in anyone who had the thought I am the eye or The eye is mine I am the ear or The ear is mine I am the nose or The nose is mine I am the tongue or The tongue is mine I am the body or The body is mine I am the intellect or The intellect is mine in him there would be an alteration in his body or a change in his facultiesBut as for me the thought does not occur to me that I am the eye or The eye is mine I am the tongue or The tongue is mine I am the intellect or The intellect is mine So what alteration should there be in my body what change should there be in my facultiesNow VenUpasenas Imaking mymaking  obsession with conceit had already been well rooted out for a long time which is why the thought did not occur to him that I am the eye or The eye is mine I am the tongue or The tongue is mine I am the intellect or The intellect is mineThen the monks lifted VenUpasenas body on a couch and carried it outsideAnd VenUpasenas body was scattered right there like a fistful of chaffVenRevatas FarewellI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen VenDabba Mallaputta went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Now is the time for my total Unbinding O OneWellGoneThen do Dabba what you think it is now time to doThen VenDabba Mallaputta rising from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and circling him on the right rose up into the air and sat crosslegged in the sky in spaceEntering the fire property and emerging from it he was totally unboundNow when Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and sitting crosslegged in the sky in space entered the fire property and then emerged from it and was totally unbound his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discernedJust as when ghee or oil is burned and consumed neither ashes nor soot can be discerned in the same way when Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and sitting crosslegged in the sky in space entered the fire property and then emerged from it and was totally unbound his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discernedThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks repliedThe Blessed One said When Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and sitting crosslegged in the sky in space entered the fire property and then emerged from it and was totally unbound his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discernedJust as when ghee or oil is burned and consumed neither ashes nor soot can be discerned in the same way when Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and sitting crosslegged in the sky in space entered the fire property and then emerged from it and was totally unbound his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discernedThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedThen the Blessed One went with a large number of monks to the Black Rock on the slope of IsigiliFrom afar he saw VenVakkali lying dead on a couchNow at that time a smokiness a darkness was moving to the east moved to the west moved to the north the south above below moved to the intermediate directionsThe Blessed One said Monks do you see that smokiness that darknessYes LordThat is Mara the Evil OneHe is searching for the consciousness of Vakkali the Clansman Where is the consciousness of Vakkali the Clansman established But monks it is through unestablished consciousness that Vakkali the Clansman has attained total UnbindingVenSariputta said Friends just now as I was withdrawn in seclusion this train of thought arose to my awareness Is there anything in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair Then the thought occurred to me There is nothing in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair When this was said VenAnanda said to VenSariputta Sariputta my friend even if there were change  alteration in the Teacher would there arise within you no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despairEven if there were change  alteration in the Teacher my friend there would arise within me no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despairStill I would have this thought What a great being of great might of great prowess has disappearedFor if the Blessed One were to remain for a long time that would be for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human  divine beings Surely its because VenSariputtas Imaking  minemaking and obsessions with conceit have long been well uprooted that even if there were change  alteration in the Teacher there would arise within him no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despairThen the Blessed One went to the audience hall and on arrival sat down on the seat prepared for himWhen he was seated he addressed the monks The qualities I have pointed out having known them directly You should grasp them thoroughly cultivate them develop them  pursue them so that this holy life may long endure  remain steadfast for the benefit welfare  happiness of the multitude out of sympathy for the world for the benefit welfare  happiness of human  celestial beingsAnd what are those qualitiesThe four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for Awakening the noble eightfold pathThese are the qualities I have pointed out having known them directly that you should grasp thoroughly cultivate develop  pursue for the benefit welfare  happiness of human  celestial beings Then the Blessed One addressed the monks I exhort you monks All fabrications are subject to decayBring about completion by means of heedfulnessIt will not be long before the Tathagatas total UnbindingHe will attain total Unbinding in three months timeThat is what the Blessed One saidThen he said furtherThen the Teacher said furtherThen the Blessed One with a large community of monks went to the far shore of the Hiraññavati River and headed for Upavattana the Mallans salgrove near KusinaraOn arrival he said to VenAnanda Ananda please prepare a bed for me between the twin saltrees with its head to the northI am tired and will lie downResponding As you say lord VenAnanda prepared a bed between the twin saltrees with its head to the northThen the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lions sleeping posture with one foot on top of the other mindful  alertNow at that time the twin saltrees were in full bloom even though it was not the time for floweringThey showered strewed  sprinkled on the Tathagatas body in homage to himHeavenly coraltree blossoms fell from the sky showering strewing  sprinkling the Tathagatas body in homage to himHeavenly sandalwood powder fell from the sky showering strewing  sprinkling the Tathagatas body in homage to himHeavenly music was playing in the sky in homage to the TathagataHeavenly songs were sung in the sky in homage to the TathagataThen the Blessed One said to VenAnanda Ananda the twin saltrees are in full bloom even though its not the flowering seasonThey shower strew  sprinkle on the Tathagatas body in homage to himHeavenly coraltree blossoms are falling from the sky Heavenly sandalwood powder is falling from the sky Heavenly music is playing in the sky Heavenly songs are sung in the sky in homage to the TathagataBut it is not to this extent that a Tathagata is worshipped honored respected venerated or paid homage toRather the monk nun male lay follower or female lay follower who keeps practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma who keeps practicing masterfully who lives in accordance with the Dhamma that is the person who worships honors respects venerates  pays homage to the Tathagata with the highest homageSo you should train yourselves We will keep practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma we will keep practicing masterfully we will live in accordance with the Dhamma Thats how you should train yourselvesThen VenAnanda going into a building stood leaning against the door jamb

Wanderer was staying in KusinaraHe heard Tonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take place Then the thought occurred to him I have heard the elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathagatas  worthy ones rightly selfawakened  appear in the worldTonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will occurNow there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubtSo he went to Upavattana the Mallans salgrove and on arrival said to VenAnanda I have heard the elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathagatas  worthy ones rightly selfawakened  appear in the worldTonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will occurNow there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubtIt would be good VenAnanda if you would let me see himWhen this was said VenAnanda said to him Enough friend SubhaddaDont bother

to him Enough friend SubhaddaDont bother the Blessed OneThe Blessed One is tiredNow the Blessed One heard the exchange between VenAnanda  Subhadda the Wanderer and so he said to VenAnanda Enough AnandaDont stand in his wayLet him see the TathagataWhatever he asks me will all be for the sake of knowledge and not to be bothersomeAnd whatever I answer when asked he will quickly understandSo VenAnanda said to Subhadda the Wanderer Go ahead friend SubhaddaThe Blessed One gives you his leaveThen Subhadda went to the Blessed One and exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord these brahmans  contemplatives each with his group each with his community each the teacher of his group an honored leader wellregarded by people at large  ie Purana Kassapa Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakambalin Pakudha Kaccayana Sañjaya Belatthaputta  the Nigantha Nataputta Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim or do they all not have direct knowledge or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them notEnough SubhaddaPut this question asideI will teach you the DhammaListen and pay close attentionI will speakYes lord Subhadda answered and the Blessed One said In any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found no contemplative of the first second third fourth order is foundBut in any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is found contemplatives of the first second third fourth order are foundThe noble eightfold path is found in this doctrine  discipline and right here there are contemplatives of the first second third fourth orderOther teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplativesAnd if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahantsAnd no contemplative of the second third fourth orderOther teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplativesAnd if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahantsThen Subhadda the Wanderer said Magnificent lordMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the community of monksLet me obtain the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence let me obtain admissionAnyone Subhadda who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth  admission in this doctrine  discipline must first undergo probation for four monthsIf at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth  admit him to the monks stateBut I know distinctions among individuals in this matterLord if that is so I am willing to undergo probation for four yearsIf at the end of four years the monks feel so moved let them give me the going forth  admit me to the monks stateThen the Blessed One said to VenAnanda Very well then Ananda give Subhadda the going forthYes lord Ananda answeredThen Subhadda said to VenAnanda It is a gain for you Ananda a great gain that you have been anointed here in the Teachers presence with the pupils anointingThen Subhadda the Wanderer received the going forth  the admission in the Blessed Ones presenceAnd not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenSubhadda became another one of the arahants the last of the Blessed Ones facetoface disciplesThen the Blessed One said to VenAnanda Now if it occurs to any of you  The teaching has lost its authority we are without a Teacher  do not view it in that wayWhatever Dhamma  Vinaya I have pointed out  formulated for you that will be your Teacher when I am goneThen the Blessed One addressed the monks If even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practice askDont later regret that The Teacher was facetoface with us but we didnt bring ourselves to crossquestion him in his presence When this was said the monks were silentA second time a third time the Blessed One said If even one of the monks has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practice askDont later regret that The Teacher was facetoface with us but we didnt bring ourselves to crossquestion him in his presence A third time the monks were silentThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Now if its out of respect for the Teacher that you dont ask let a friend inform a friendWhen this was said the monks were silentThen VenAnanda said to the Blessed One Its amazing lordIts marvelousIm confident that in this community of monks there is not even a single monk who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practiceYou Ananda speak out of confidence while there is knowledge in the Tathagata that in this community of monks there is not even a single monk who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practiceOf these monks the most backward is a streamwinner not destined for the planes of deprivation headed to selfawakening for sureThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Now then monks I exhort you All fabrications are subject to decayBring about completion by means of heedfulness Those were the Tathagatas

having come to the last stage of life years old  went to the Blessed OneOn arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to him Master Gotama we are brahmans  feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years oldAnd we have done no admirable deeds no

Nakulapita went to VenSariputta and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there VenSariputta said to him Your faculties are clear  calm householder your complexion pureHave you had the opportunity today of listening to a Dhamma talk in the presence of the Blessed OneHow could it be otherwise venerable sirI have just now been sprinkled by the Blessed One with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talkAnd how were you sprinkled by the Blessed One with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talkJust now I went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs I was sitting there I said to him Lord I am a decrepit old man aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of lifeI am afflicted in body  ailing with every momentAnd it is only rarely that I get to see the Blessed One  the monks who nourish the heartMay the Blessed One teach me may the Blessed One instruct me for my longterm benefit  happinessWhen this was said the Blessed One said to me So it is householderSo it isThe body is afflicted weak  encumberedFor who looking after this body would claim even a moment of true health except through sheer foolishnessSo you should train yourself Even though I may be afflicted in body my mind will be unafflicted That is how you should train yourself Thats how I was sprinkled by the Blessed One with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talkBut why didnt it occur to you to question the Blessed One further In what way is one afflicted in body  afflicted in mindAnd in what way is one afflicted in body but unafflicted in mindI would come from a long way away to hear the explication of these words in VenSariputtas presenceIt would be good if VenSariputta himself would enlighten me as to their meaningThen in that case householder listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say venerable sir the householder Nakulapita respondedVenSariputta said Now how is one afflicted in body  afflicted in mindThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe is seized with the idea that I am form or Form is mine As he is seized with these ideas his form changes  alters and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair over its change  alterationHe assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or

Consciousness is mine As he is seized with these ideas his consciousness changes  alters and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair over its change  alterationThis householder is how one is afflicted in body and afflicted in mindAnd how is one afflicted in body but unafflicted in mindThere is the case where a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe is not seized with the idea that I am form or Form is mine As he is not seized with these ideas his form changes  alters but he does not fall into sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair over its change  alterationHe does not assume feeling to be the selfHe does not assume perception to be the selfHe does not assume fabrications to be the selfHe

alterationThis householder is how one is afflicted in body but unafflicted in mindThat is what VenSariputta saidGratified the householder Nakulapita delighted in VenSariputtas wordsA sick person endowed with five qualities is easy to tend to he does what is amenable to his cure he knows the proper amount in things amenable to his cure he takes his medicine he tells his symptoms as they

uninstructed runofthemill person makes the statement There is a bottomless chasm in the ocean he is talking about something that doesnt exist that cant be foundThe word bottomless chasm is actually a designation for painful bodily feelingWhen an uninstructed runofthemill person is touched by a painful bodily feeling he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraughtThis is called an uninstructed runofthemill person who has not risen up out of the bottomless chasm who has not gained a footholdWhen a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones is touched by a painful bodily feeling he does not sorrow grieve or lament does not beat his breast or become distraughtThis is called a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones who has risen up out of the bottomless chasm whose foothold is gainedMonks an uninstructed runofthemill person feels feelings of pleasure feelings of pain feelings of neitherpleasurenorpainA wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones also feels feelings of pleasure feelings of pain feelings of neitherpleasurenorpainSo what difference what distinction what distinguishing factor is there between the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones and the uninstructed runofthemill personFor us lord the teachings have the Blessed One as their root their guide  their arbitratorIt would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statementHaving heard it from the Blessed One the monks will remember itIn that case monks listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said When touched with a feeling of pain the uninstructed runofthemill person sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraughtSo he feels two pains physical  mentalJust as if they were to shoot a man with an arrow and right afterward were to shoot him with another one so that he would feel the pains of two arrows in the same way when touched with a feeling of pain the uninstructed runofthemill person sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraughtSo he feels two pains physical  mentalAs he is touched by that painful feeling he is resistantAny resistanceobsession with regard to that painful feeling obsesses himTouched by that painful feeling he delights in sensual pleasureWhy is thatBecause the uninstructed runofthemill person does not discern any escape from painful feeling aside from sensual pleasureAs he is delighting in sensual pleasure any passionobsession with regard to that feeling of pleasure obsesses himHe does not discern as it actually is present the origination passing away allure drawback or escape from that feelingAs he does not discern the origination passing away allure drawback or escape from that feeling then any ignoranceobsession with regard to that feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain obsesses himSensing a feeling of pleasure he senses it as though joined with itSensing a feeling of pain he senses it as though joined with itSensing a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he senses it as though joined with itThis is called an uninstructed runofthemill person joined with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairsHe is joined I tell you with suffering  stressNow the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones when touched with a feeling of pain does not sorrow grieve or lament does not beat his breast or become distraughtSo he feels one pain physical but not mentalJust as if they were to shoot a man with an arrow and right afterward did not shoot him with another one so that he would feel the pain of only one arrowIn the same way when touched with a feeling of pain the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones does not sorrow grieve or lament does not beat his breast or become distraughtHe feels one pain physical but not mentalAs he is touched by that painful feeling he is not resistantNo resistanceobsession with regard to that painful feeling obsesses himTouched by that painful feeling he does not delight in sensual pleasureWhy is thatBecause the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones discerns an escape from painful feeling aside from sensual pleasureAs he is not delighting in sensual pleasure no passionobsession with regard to that feeling of pleasure obsesses himHe discerns as it actually is present the origination passing away allure drawback and escape from that feelingAs he discerns the origination passing away allure drawback and escape from that feeling no ignoranceobsession with regard to that feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain obsesses himSensing a feeling of pleasure he senses it disjoined from itSensing a feeling of pain he senses it disjoined from itSensing a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he senses it disjoined from itThis is called a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones disjoined from birth aging  death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairsHe is disjoined I tell you from suffering  stressThis is the difference
