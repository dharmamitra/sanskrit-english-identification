Moreover thus thoroughly knowledgeable about meaning thoroughly knowledgeable about the teaching cultivates twelve ideations for the generation of all supernatural faculties The twelve ideations are as follows The ideation of lightness is that by means of which becomes convinced of his own body being light as a tūlacotton tuft or a karpāsacotton tuft in the whirlwind Namely from the bed to the stool from the stool to the bed in the sam way ffom the bed to the grassseat from the grassseat to the bed er The ideation of softness is that by means of which becomes convinced of body being soft like silk or raw silk or woven silk  This ideation of softness thus is nourishing and facilitating for the ideation of lightness in such a way that being faciliated by it the ideation of lightness becomes extensive developed and abundant Ideation of the space realm The ideation of the space realm is the ideation by means of which becomes convinced of the lightness and softness of his own body The ideation of the mindbody fusion is that by means of which the mind is fused into the body or the body into the mind due to which his body becomes lighter softer more malleable brighter obedient to the mind comnected to the mind operates depending upon the mind The ideation of conviction is the ideation by means of which becomes convinced that what is remote is near what is near is remote what is subtle is coarse what is coarse is subtle earth is water water is earth having been one he manifests himself magical creations then having manifested himself as many becomes one to wit by means of the ideation of conviction which makes the creations disappear with body pass unhindered through walls mountains ramparts emerges from and plunges into the ground as if into water he walks on water without sinking as if on ground ascends into the sky crosslegged as if a winged bird or rubs strokes with hand the Sun the Moon have such great majesty potence wields power with body up to Brahmas World does all this by means of the ideation of conviction assisted by the ideations of lightness softness space realm mindbody fusion should be understood in due order four elements and a part of the derived matter beneath Brahmas World by means of conviction according to wish and noises of different kinds The ideation of sound combinations and noises of different kinds consists in the cultivation of ideation after having grasped the characteristic of what noise arises mixed divers of various groups of people sitting meeting together in a village or a town or a guild or a townsmens assembly or gathering or a spacious house or an inner chamber or the noise of a flowing river By means of this  keeps thought towards sounds noble ignoble divine human remote human whether they are remote or near The ideation of the visible characteristic of light  having grasped the characteristic of light as previous directs aṭtention to this very characteristic And having grasped the characteristic from a variety of sentient beings directs attention to this very characteristic by distinguishing between the performace of wholesome unwholesome acts etc This is the ideation of the visible characteristic of light Due to the cultivation of this  pure divine eye in full detail up to after the destruction of the body are born in a good destination a heavenly world amongst deities determined by defilements The ideation of the specific changes in physical appearance determined by defilements is that by means of which observes ascertains the peculiar physical condition of the sentient beings Such is the peculiar physical condition the specific change in the physical appearance of one who is passioned to wit senses are agitated senses are excited has a smiling face Such is the peculiar physical condition the specific change in the physical appearance of one who is hateful to wit face is pale speaks in convulsive utterances has a frown Due to the assiduous practice of this  there arises the knowledge of the others ways of thought the fruit of cultivation through which employing mind fully knows the mind the rough thinking the subtle thinking of other sentient beings of other persons as in reality whatever thing transforms whatever magical creation produces of whatever becomes convinced by means of the noble miraculous power it actually becomes so not otherwise And all the can fulfil function It should be known that in such a way generates the five supernatural faculties by means of these twelve ideations due to assiduous practice according to what is suitable in each case and according to what is suitable in each case the noble qualities not in common with ordinary people in accordance with the meditation level intermediately intensely is accordingly born in the community intermediately intensely is accordingly porn in the commnunity of the Small Light deities of the Boundless Light  and of the Radiant Brightness intermediately intensely is accordingly ḷborn in the community of the Small Splendour deities of the Boundless Splendour  and of the Splendid Perfection intermediately intensely is accordingly born in the community of the Unclouded deities of the MeritAbundance  and of the Great Reward If furthermore a NonReturner practises the contaminated has practised this  slightly intermediately intensely more intensely most intensely is accordingly born in the community of the deities of the five Pure Abodes to wit amongst the NotProsperous ones the Untormented ones the GoodLooking ones the GoodAppearing Ones the Highest Ones of space of consciousness of nothing whatsoever of neither ideation nor nonideation slightly intermediately intensely is space of consciousness of nothing whatsoever of neither ideation nor nonideation And these deities are immaterial there exists therefore no difference caused by dissimilarity in the place but there is community of the deities beings without ideation detached from sensual pleasures What are the characteristics of one who is detached from sensual pleasures He has calm bodily actions immovable senses and his position does not quickly come to an end Having seen with eyes visible objects he perceives visible objects does not experience passion for visible objects And he is fearless has profound understanding is possessed of an allembracing ease in mind and body is uncovetous not agitated patient and no thoughts sensual pleasures etc The characteristics of one who is detached from sensual pleasures should thus be known as such features At one time the five qualities of Sakra Lord of the Gods left him He knew that his life would end and that he would descend to be born in the world conceived in the womb of an ass in a pottery What do they say are the five qualities First the light about the person is extinguished Second the flowers above the head wither Third one wants to leave ones seat Fourth the perspiration un der the armpits is strongsmelling Fifth defilement sticks to the body Because of these five things he knew that his merit had ended and he felt utterly dejected He recalled that only the Buddha might save people from their hardship in the three realms so he hastened to where the Buddha dwelled At that time the Buddha was sitting in meditation in a cave on Mount Grdhrakuta having entered the samadhi of universal rescue When the Lord of the Gods saw the Buddha he kowtowed did obeisance and prostrated himself and earnestly took the triple refuge in the Buddha in his D octrine  and in his Community  Before he could stand up his life suddenly ended He then arrived in a pottery as the young in the belly of a sheass The ass then pulled herself loose and ran around in the pottery breaking the earthenware Her owner beat her and as a result injured her pregnant womb Sakras spirit immediately returned to his old body Endowed anew with the five qualities he was the Lord of the Gods again The Buddha awoke from his samadhi and he said in praise Excellent it is Lord of the Gods when you can take refuge in the Three Honorable Things the Buddha Dharma and Sangha when you are about to die When the retribution for your evil is over you will not suffer again  Then the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas nature to arise and to pass away When they have come into being they suddenly pass away Their allayment means happiness diluted earth it will all break It is the same with a mans life When Lord Sakra heard the stanzas he knew that impermanence was inevitable He recognized that evil and merit change he un derstood that arising and passing away are fundamental and he followed the path of tranquility He acknowledged this with joy and attained the path of the streamenterer  The Buddha once was in a pure abode in the land of SravastI and expounded the Doctrine to gods men dragons and demons The queen mother of Prasenajit the ruler of the land was more than ninety years old then and she suddenly fell seriously ill Medici nal herbs did not make her better and so she died The king and the ministers of the land held a funeral according to the rules They moved her spirit to a grave When the funeral was over they passed by the Buddha on their way back They took off their garments removed their stockings and did a deep obeisance in front of the Buddha The Buddha told them to sit down and he asked them The clothes are coarse where you come from  King and they look different Why this behavior The king kowtowed and said The queen mother of the land was more than ninety years old when she recently fell seriously ill She soon passed away We have escorted her spirit and her coffin to her grave We are just now on our way back and while passing by we visit you O Noble Reverend The Buddha informed the king From of old to this day there have been four great fears to be born and grow old and wither to lose ones spiritual brightness through illness to lose the spirit after death and to be separated from ones loved ones These are said to be the four They do not give man any fixed time As all things are impermanent it is difficult to achieve per manence Everything passes in a day Mans life is like that As the five rivers ceaselessly flow day and night just so is the rapid passing of mans life Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza return so is mans life Those who are gone do not return The Buddha informed the great king that this applies to the whole world None stays long All must die and none escapes death The kings of the past the Buddhas and the saints the seers with the five superknowledges they have all gone too None could stay It is useless to grieve for any harm that befalls the body If one mourns the deceased as a pious son one performs merits and one does what is meritorious One is followed by the merits as provisions someone on a long journey When the Buddha had said this the king and his ministers all rejoiced They forgot their sorrow and gave up suffering All who had come attained the Path Once the Buddha was in the Venuvana in Rajagrha He entered the city with his disciples After he had ex pounded the Doctrine upon request he left the city in the afternoon On his way he met someone driving a big herd of wellfed cows back to the city Bobbing up and down and twisting they bumped into each other Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas cattle to the pasture to feed them that would be like old agedeath They also sustain life and thousands of people who amass possessions yet all will perish When the Buddha arrived in the Bamboo Garden he washed his feet stepped back and sat down Ananda came forward kowtowed and asked  Worldhonored One a while ago you expounded on these three stanzas along the way I still do not know their mean ing Did you see a man driving a herd of cattle Yes I saw him The Buddha informed Ananda The herd of this butcher used to number a thousand head Every day the butcher sent some one out of the city to look for fine water and grass feeding them so that they would become fat and tall Every day he would pick out the fat ones lead them away and have them killed After he had killed more than half of them the remaining ones still did not take any notice They just kept bumping into each other bobbed up and down and mooed  But why only these cattle The same applies to people Counting on their selves they do not know about impermanence They nourish themselves in a gluttonous way with the five objects of desire Cheerfully and utterly gratified they then destroy each other Because of imper manence retribution for their past is suddenly upon them when they do not expect it Is this any different Among those who were sitting there at the time there were two hundred monks who coveted honors Hearing the Doctrine and having encouraged themselves they achieved the six superknowledges and became arhats All those who were seated there felt compassion and joy and they did obeisance to the Buddha Once the Buddha was in Sravasti in the Anathapindada Grove in the Jetavana expounding the Doctrine to his disciples She was fourteen or fifteen years old beautiful and clever of speech Her father loved her very much She suddenly fell seriously ill and died immediately It was as though there were ripe wheat in the field that was consumed by fire He heard people say that the Buddha was a great sage and that as a teacher of gods and men he expounded the path of the scriptural texts making them forget their sorrow and doing away with their suffering Please Worldhonored One have pity on me and instruct me  The Buddha informed the brahman thusly There are four things in the world that cannot last long What are these four What is constant will certainly be impermanent wealth will certainly become poverty meeting will certainly become separation the strong will certainly die Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza nevertheless come down Any coming together implies separation The living will die When the brahman heard the stanza his mind suddenly opened up and he wished to become a monk As his beard and his hair fell off of themselves he became a monk Again reflecting upon the nature of impermanence he entered the path of an arhat Once the Buddha was on Mount Grdhrakuta in Rajagrha At that time there was a luscious lady in the city She was called Padma Her beauty was unparalleled in the land High officials and young people all sought her company and held her in high esteem I should follow the times and enjoy my personal passion With this in mind she returned But the Buddha knew that Padma should be saved He changed into a woman a paragon of beauty excelling even Padma tens of thou sands of times Seeking Padma out she came toward her So she asked the transformed person where she came from where her husband and children her father and brothers all were whether at home or away and why she was walking all alone without any attendants The transformed person replied I come from town and I want to return home Although I do not know you it would be nice to re turn together Shall we both rest and talk at the spring Padma agreed and they both went back to the spring together If this is the case even for this person how could I be preserved for a long time I must go to the Buddha and zealously apply myself to the Path She then went to the Buddha and prostrated herself Having done obeisance she explained everything she had seen to the Buddha The Buddha informed Padma Man has four things on which he cannot de pend Which four dripping and smelly It is worn out by illness and suffers the calamities of old agedeath increases One does not see the changes but life is imper manent Oppressed by death one does not have any relative on whom to rely Indeed having the quality of the Path nirvana is eternal happiness The Buddha said Excellent  Her hair fell off and she became a nun She cultivated right contemplation and became an arhat When all who were sitting there had heard the Buddhas explanation there was none who was not happy Once the Buddha was in the city of Rajagrha expounding the Doctrine in the Venuvana  Seven days later each ones life would end They talked it over among themselves and said  There is nothing we cannot do with the power of our five superknowledges reversing heaven and earth stopping the sun and moon moving mountains and stopping cur rents How can we not escape from this retribution of death One said I shall enter the ocean Invisible from above and not on the bottom underneath I shall stay right in the middle How could the murderous demon of impermanence know my whereabouts Another said I shall enter Mount Sumeru and close its surface again so that I shall never be visible How could the murderous demon of impermanence know my whereabouts An other said How would the murderous demon of impermanence know my whereabouts An other said We calculate that we have seven days left to live We want to flee for our lives now and we hope we will be able to escape After our return we shall personally visit you  Thereupon they parted and each went to his own place When the period of seven days was over the life of each one ended like fruit that is ripe and falls The market supervisor informed the king that there was a brahman who had suddenly died in the market The king understood and said  The four men were going to escape from their retribution One is already dead I wonder if they can still avoid it The Buddha said to the great king that human beings have four things from which they cannot escape What are the four being in an intermediate state one cannot but experience birth Second being born one cannot but experience old age having grown old one cannot but experience illness Fourth being ill one cannot but experience death Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas mountain cave is there a place on earth where one might escape and not experience death bring about what is right People fret about this and they go through the sorrows of old age and death the end of birth O monks reject Maras soldiers and be delivered from the birth and death cycle When the king heard the Buddhas words he said in admiration Excellent This is truly in accord with your teaching O Rever end The four men were going to escape from their retribution but one has already died The same will happen to the others sharing their fate Among the ministers and officials there was none who did not have faith Training Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti in the pure abode of the Jetavana The Buddha informed the monks Diligently culti vate the Path and avoid the rise of any hindrance When your mind is clear and your spirit is concentrated you can escape any suffering There was a monk whose determination was not fully clear Having eaten his fill he went to his room closed the door and quietly went to sleep Fond of his own self and light in mind he could not contemplate impermanence Because he was dull and lazy day or night meant nothing to him anymore After seven days his life would surely end The Buddha had pity on him He feared that he would fall into an evil path So he entered the monks room snapped his fingers to wake him up and said oyster or worm you are covered with impurity In your delusion you assume you are a person with ailments Meeting with any hardship all you do is resort to sleep apply yourself to a path of benevolence As a result you will not know sorrow Always keep it in mind to extin guish your intentions them stands out brightly in the world The merit he produces is thousandfold and he will never fall into an evil path When the monk heard the stanzas he immediately woke up startled Seeing that the Buddha himself was admonishing him his respect increased and he gasped with fright So he rose kowtowed and did obeisance to the Buddha The Buddha said to the monk Would it be that you know your former lives The monk answered I am beset by hindrances Once in the time of the Buddha Vipasyin you went forth but you coveted personal honors and you were not mindful of the disciplinary prescriptions in the scrip tural texts Having eaten to the full you withdrew to sleep not mindful of impermanence Your life ended and you were reborn among gadflies You accumulated fifty thousand years and your life ended You later became a conch and an oyster and a worm in a tree for fifty thousand years each These four kinds of insects live in lasting obscurity They are egoistic and long for life They like to stay in seclusion Obscurity is their home and they do not see any light Waking up follows after a sleeping time of a hun dred years You were bound in the net of evil and did not seek that which was essential to leave it Why do you not get enough of sleeping Thereupon the monk again heard about his previous causality and he felt mortified and reproved himself The clouds of the five hindrances dissipated and he immediately attained arhatship Once the Buddha was in the land of SravastI in the Anathapindada Grove in the Jetavana together with gods and men expounding the Doctrine with the four classes  While meditating he thought It is my penis He returned to his quarters shut the door and took off his clothes He sat down upon a wooden board with the intention of chopping off his penis Just because of this penis I am made to suffer passing through the birth and death cycle for countless eons The three depraved destinations and the six crea tures all result from lust If I do not cut this off I shall not have any way of obtaining the Path The Buddha knew what was on his mind and how foolish he was  The Path results from restraining the thoughts Thoughts are the foundation Ig norant of his mortality he hurts himself  The monk greeted the Buddha and stated I have been applying myself to the Path for a long time but I do not understand the way of the Doctrine yet Every time I sit in meditation I am steeped in desire just when I am about to obtain the Path My virility is so potent that I am confused and remain in darkness That is why I borrowed a hatchet wanting to do away with it The Buddha informed the monk How foolish you are You do not understand the principle If one wants to seek the Path one must first eliminate ones foolishness and then control ones thoughts Thoughts are the basis of good and evil If you want to do away with your roots you must first of all control your thoughts When your thoughts are calmed and your mind clear you will obtain the Path Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza his mother if he guides the rulers two ministers and if he gives up all attendants he is a superior man of the Path The Buddha informed the monk Delusion is the basis of the twelve causes  Delusion is the source of all evil Only when you have first elimi nated delusion will your mind be settled After the Buddha had said this the monk was ashamed and so he reproved himself and said Ever since I was misled by my foolishness I have never un derstood the old scriptures so that I am like this Your explana tion just now O Buddha is truly w onderful He internally considered right concentration and breathing while counting  Guarding his mind and restraining his thoughts he subdued his affections and shut out all desire and so his mind was settled Once the Buddha was on Mount Grdhrakta in the land of Rjagrha explaining the doctrine of immortality to gods and men to the king and his high officials There was one monk who was willful and reckless The Buddha knew how he was and sent him to a valley of spirits in the mountains He had him sit down under a tree to count his breaths and practice concentration Knowing the length and brevity of the breaths npna breath ing exercise guards the mind There are only demons who frequently come to frighten people While he was thinking in this way and before he went back the Worldhonored One went to his side He sat down under a tree and asked himYou are alone here Arent you afraid The monk kowtowed and said I have never been in the mountains before I was really worried here After a while there was a wild elephant king who came by He lay down against a tree happy all by himself think ing  How pleasant to be away from the other elephants The Buddha knew what was on the elephants mind and he said to the monk Would you know where this elephant comes from  He replied I do not know The Buddha informed the monk  The size of this elephants herd is more than five hundred head Wea ried by the small elephants he left them and came here Lying down against a tree he is thinking how pleasing it is to have left the prison of love An elephant may be an animal but he thinks about a solitary abode How much more must you leave your fam ily and seek salvation But in fact because of your loneliness you seek companionship One is often hurt by foolish companions One who stays alone has no antagonists and is free from schem ing It is better to develop the Path all alone There is no need for a foolish companion Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas good friend one had better safeguard ones own good conduct rather than associate with a fool living why would one need the doings of a companion Be virtuous on your own and free from grief like the elephant in the open wilderness When the Buddha expounded this the monk understood He in ternally considered the noble teaching and became an arhat The spirits in the valley all understood too and became the Buddhas disciples They accepted the precepts and did not frighten people any more The Buddha returned to the pure abode together with the monks Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti in the pure abode of the Jetavana expounding the scriptural Doctrine to gods and men In the land of Rajagrha there were two novice monks who wanted to meet the Buddha Between the two countries however there was a desert without any people At that time there was a drought and the springs were dry The two monks were starving and thirsty gasping feverishly In an old spring they found plenty of water but tiny insects made it impossible for them to drink it We did not imagine that we would die here today One said Let us drink some water to save our lives When we go and see the Buddha how will he know the circumstances The other responded However one should keep the precepts and die rather than violate the precepts and live So the first one stood up quickly drank with utmost eagerness and then continued on his way The other one did not drink and consequently brought about his own death but he was immediately reborn in the Trayastrimsa heaven After consideration and selfexamination he knew that in his previous life he had kept and not violated the precepts As I am reborn here now truly a meritorious retribu tion is not far off  Holding fragrant flowers he de scended to the Buddha He greeted the Buddha stepped back and stood aside The one who had drunk some water arrived a few days later exhausted by the journey He saw that the Buddhas spiritual qualities were utterly venerable and imposing He kow towed and having greeted him he stated with tears in his eyes My one companion has died yonder I want you O Buddha to know that The Buddha said I already know The Buddha pointed with his finger and said Well this heavenly person was your companion He kept the pre cepts intact was reborn in heaven and arrived here first  There upon the Worldhonored One bared his breast and showed it to him You see my appearance but you do not keep my precepts Even though you may say that you see me I do not see you That person who has followed the precepts of the scriptures though ten thousand miles away from me is here before my eyes  Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas keeps the precepts and does not break them he is praised in both worlds His wishes will be fulfilled not completely keep the precepts he experiences suffering in both worlds His wishes will not be fulfilled to the learned and dwelling in the truth he understands the meaningful Then when the monk heard the stanzas he felt mortified and kowtowed He repented his error and silently thought about what he had done When the heavenly person heard the stanzas his mind was pleased and he obtained the eye of the Doctrine There was none in the crowd of gods and men who did not follow the instructions The Very Learned Once there was a poor family in the land of Sravasti Husband and wife were stingy and they did not believe in the virtue of the Path The Buddha felt pity for their foolishness Looking like a poor ascetic he went to their gate to beg for food The husband was not in at the time but his wife scolded him beyond reason The ascetic said to her I am a man of the Path and I live on alms You do not have to scold me I am just looking forward to some food The masters wife said If you stood there dying you still would not get any food How much less so if you want my food now that you are healthy You had bet ter go away at once The ascetic then kept standing in front of her He stared gave his last breath and appeared to be dead His body was swollen and out of his nose and mouth came worms His belly burst and his bowels were in a state of decomposition and impurities flowed forth When the wife saw him she was alarmed and lost her voice She ran away and left him Thereupon the man of the Path was suddenly gone Some miles away from her home she sat down underneath a tree to rest The husband met his wife while he was on his way back home and he wondered why she was afraid The wife told him that there was this ascetic whose appearance terrified her Upon seeing him she was so afraid The husband became angry and asked where the ascetic might be He is gone but I think he is not yet far away The husband took his bow and girded on his sword Looking for tracks he went after the ascetic Flexing his bow and with drawn sword he ran straight ahead with the intention of chopping down the man of the Path The man of the Path then magically created a wall of lapis lazuli and surrounded himself with it The husband ran several times along the wall but could not get through So he asked the man of the Path why he did not open the gate The man of the Path replied If you want me to open the gate throw away your bow and sword The husband thought to himself I must follow his words I have thrown away my bow and sword Why doesnt the gate open The man of the Path said I want you to throw away the bow and sword stem ming from the evil intentions in your mind  The man of the Path is a supernaturally noble one who knows my thoughts He immedi ately kowtowed and repented his mistake I have a wicked wife who does not recognize a man of truth She is the instigator of my wickedness Please have compassion and do not abandon us now I would like you to exhort her to train in the Path So he stood up and went back to his wife who asked him Where is the ascetic Her husband gave a full explanation of his miraculous power and replied He is back there now You should reform yourself by extinguishing your evil Which qualities of the Path did you practice to bring about such wondrous excellence The man of the Path answered My extensive learning is insa tiable and I unremittingly follow the Doctrine because of these one opens the Path and brings about nirvana Thereupon the man of the Path spoke the stanzas pursues the Dharma one becomes like a hard wall ones zeal then does not break down At that point morality and wisdom are accomplished wisdom increases As wisdom sets in one widely under stands the essence of things Perceiving the essences one is happy following the Dharma tion promote joyfulness Explaining the law of immortal ity well one brings about the gaining of nirvana He who as a result of his learning rejects what is improper arrives at the state of immortality When the man of the Path had spoken the stanzas he showed the bright appearance of the Buddha His ample radiance was glori ous illuminating heaven and earth The husband and wife were frightened and their spirits were terrified They abandoned their evils and cleansed their thoughts beating their heads on the ground Once the Buddha was in the pure abode of Ghosila in Kausambi together with the four classes explaining the great Dharma One day he was walking in the marketplace carrying a torch and someone asked him Why are you walking with a torch in your hand in the daytime The brahman answered  The people in this world are blind They do not see anything so I carry a torch in order to illu minate them The Buddha knew that the brahman should be saved because of his previous merits Still his behavior was haughty seeking dominance and fame He did not take imperma nence into account His selfconceit and arrogance were such that he would fall into the hell of Mount Tai for countless eons and to escape it would be very difficult So the Buddha trans formed himself into a worthy and sat down in the marketplace Then he asked the brahman why he was acting in this way The brahman replied Because people are in darkness and cannot dis tinguish clearly between night and day I illuminate them with the flame of my torch The worthy again asked the brahman Among the scriptural texts are the four Vedas Do you know their essential teachings He replied I have no clear idea What are their four essential teachings One harmoni zation of the four seasons through knowledge of astronomy and geography Two distinction of the five elements through knowl edge of the constellations Three being able to pacify the country through knowledge o f government Four unfailing firmness through knowledge of military affairs Dont you possess these teachings of the four Vedas The brahman was ashamed He threw away his torch and crossed his hands His thoughts were not up to it The Buddha knew what was on his mind and transformed himself back into his own self His light shone brightly on both heaven and earth With a divine voice he then spoke this stanza to the brahman great as to be arrogant toward others then the one who holds the torch is the blind one After the Buddha had spoken the stanza he said to the brahman No one is in more complete darkness than you but you have en tered a great country with a torch in your hand during the daytime He immediately kowtowed and wished to be his disciple The Buddha accepted him and let him become an ascetic His thoughts were resolved his foolishness ended and he became an arhat Once there was an important elder in the land of Sravasti His name was Sudatta and he had obtained the status of a streamenterer He had a friend an elder called Haoshih who did not believe in the Buddhas path or in any therapeutic technique He happened one day to fall seriously ill Failing in energy he had to keep to his bed His relatives and friends all went to ask how he was They insisted that he seek treatment but he would not agree at all He replied to everyone I have served the sun and moon and been loyal and pious toward the ruler and my father Even if my life were to end here I shall never change my mind Sudatta said to him The teacher I serve is called the Buddha His divine qualities spread far and wide Those who see him gain good for tune Be cause your illness will last and will not get better soon I insist that you invite the Buddha and I hope you will receive his good fortune As the day was auspicious Haoshih You may invite the Buddha and his disciples for me Sudatta immediately invited the Buddha and his Sangha As he went to the elders home the Buddha emitted a bright light that penetrated everywhere When the elder saw the light he felt happy and relieved The Buddha went to him and sat down He asked the elder how his illness was which spirits he had served before and which therapy he had applied Since my forefathers time we have followed these practices until we die The Buddha said to the elder When one is born into the world there are three kinds of untimely death To have a disease that does not heal is the first untimely death To heal but not to be cautious is the second un timely death Such illnesses cannot be done away with by the sun or the moon by heaven or earth or by serving forefathers ones ruler or ones father It will be relieved in time through the path of knowledge First the temperature of the four elements requires healing herbs Second the evil demons of any heresy require the precepts of the scriptures Third serving the noble relieves misery virtue affects the spirits and merit helps beings  Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas ones father out of gratitude One serves ones ruler because o f his power One serves a man of the Path because of his learning one leaves ones companion in case of urgency One looks on ones wife when happy in the bedchamber If one wants to know knowledge lies in the discourses that one may commend clear learning He also cleanses the foundations of purity ably maintaining the store house of the Doctrine what is meaningful With understanding the precepts will not be broken He who has received the Doctrine and maintains it will accordingly quickly achieve tranquility away with ominous decay If you wish to secure tranquil ity and prosperity you must serve the learned There were once vast mountains in the south o f the land of Rajaghra two hundred miles away from the city The roads to every country in the south passed through these mountains They were treacherous and deep and infested by five hundred bandits who robbed the people traveling through the passes Afterwards the spoils were freely scattered about The merchants were ru ined and the kings way blocked The king pursued the bandits to punish them but he could not capture them The Buddha was in the land then and felt pity for the people considering that those bandits did not know evil from good  The Tathagata is in the world but their eyes do not see him The drum of the Dharma is beaten every day but their ears do not hear it If I do not go to save them they will fall like rocks into an abyss He changed into a man wearing splendid clothes He rode a horse and had a sword on his waist and a bow and arrows in his hands His saddle and bridle were decorated adorned with gold and silver and he let bright moonpearls hang down from his horse Making music on horseback he went into the mountains When bandits saw him they thought the job was as good as done They had been bandits for many years but had not yet had such an opportunity as this Would this be any different from throwing eggs at a rock The whole band of bandits got together and surrounded the trav eler They pulled their bows and drew their swords While they were arguing about which one would strip him clean the trans formed person raised his bow and shot once with the result that the five hundred bandits were all hit by arrows He pointed at them with his sword and all of them were wounded Their wounds were serious the arrows struck deep and they all fell down All five hundred bandits lay twisting on the ground They kowtowed and submitted What spirit are you that you have such super natural powers Please quickly pull out the arrows so that the wounds may heal Our wounds now hurt unbearably The transformed person answered  These wounds do not hurt The arrows are not deep No wound is more serious in the world than sorrow There is no injury worse than foolishness So long as you cherish the sorrows of greed and injurious thoughts your sword wounds and poisonous arrow wounds can never heal The roots of these two things are much deeper The valiant and the strong cannot pull them out Only when one possesses the moral pre scripts of the scriptures and becomes learned in the meaningful ness of wisdom can this path of insight cure mental diseases These prescripts remove sorrowful craving foolishness and haughtiness They suppress violence luxury and covetousness darkness obtains a candle It leads people in the world just as someone who sees leads those who do not see pride and the joy of luxury who applies himself and serves the learned he is called the one who has accumu lated virtues When the five hundred men saw the Buddhas shining appearance and had also heard these stanzas they kowtowed and took refuge in him They subdued their thoughts and repented Meanwhile the swords wounds and poisonous arrows were removed by themselves They were happy and their minds opened up to accept the five pre cepts Earnest Faith There was once a big river southeast of the city of Sravasti Its waters were deep and wide More than five hundred families lived along its banks They had not yet heard about the qualities of the Path or the way of salvation from the worldly The Worldhonored One constantly thought he should go there to save those among them who should be saved He knew that these families should be saved by their merits Thereupon the Worldhonored One went to the riverbank and sat down under a tree When the villagers saw the Buddhas bright appearance they found it ex traordinary and there was none who was not impressed They all went to pay their respects Some saluted and some bowed asking how he was The Buddha told them to sit down and he expounded the Doctrine of the scriptural texts The crowd heard it but they did not believe in it because they were used to fraud and were skep tical of any true words The Buddha then magically caused some one to appear coming from the south of the river Walking on the water just wet to his ankles he came to the Buddha He kow towed and greeted the Buddha When the crowd saw this there was none who was not astonished They asked the transformed person From the time of our ancestors we have lived on these shores yet we have never heard of anyone walking on water Who are you sir What kind of magic do you have that you are able to tread on water and not drown Please explain it to us The transformed person answered I am a foolish person from south of the river When I heard that the Buddha was here I wanted to enjoy the virtues of the Path but when I arrived at the southern shore I could not cross in time I asked someone on the shore whether the water was deep or shallow He said T he water may reach up to your ankles Why do you not wade across I trusted his words and just crossed over like that  The Buddha then said in praise Excel lent Excellent If you have faith you may truly cross the abyss of birth and death Why be astonished about walking across a river that is a few li w ide Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas One who enjoys the unconditioned is delivered from any bond engenders cessation Through learning wisdom is ob tained In what is attained there is clearness When the villagers heard the Buddhas exposition their faith was realized Their minds opened up and their faith was firm They all received the five precepts and became people of pure faith As their pure faith was developed the teaching of the Doctrine was spread throughout the world Long ago when the Buddha was in the world there was an impor tant elder called Hsiuloto  His wealth was immea surable and he was devoutly attuned to the qualities of the Path He had vowed that he would always invite the Buddha and his Sangha on the eighth day of the twelfth month and that after his death his son and grandson would always honor the vow When the elder was dying he ordered his son not to abandon the prac tice His son was called Piloto  Later he became poorer and poorer and had nothing in the house When the twelfth month arrived he had nothing to offer He was sad and unhappy The Buddha sent Maudgalyayana to go and ask Viradha The month of your fathers obligation is coming what plans do you have Viradha answered On the eighth day at noon he may radiate his brightness and have a closer look Maudgalyayana then returned and reported everything Viradha then took his wife to his fatherinlaw to borrow a hundred taels of gold On his returning home he provided for everything The Buddha went to his house with one thousand two hundred fifty monks When they had taken their seats they passed the water around and ate Having cleansed themselves they returned to their pure abode Viradha was glad and did not feel any contrition On that day in the middle of the night precious objects replenished his storehouse filling it as in the past When Viradha and his wife saw this the next morning they were glad but also afraid They were afraid that officials might see the treasures and ask where they had come from Husband and wife discussed the matter and decided that he should go and ask the Buddha So he went to the Buddha and explained the whole situation The Buddha told Viradha Put your mind at rest and feel free to use these trea sures Do not be suspicious By your devout conduct you did not offend against your fathers instructions When a wise person can develop  no matter whether one is a man or a woman or where ones place of birth is a meritorious reward follows by itself Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas one is a man or a woman one is never poor The wise know this to be true When Viradha heard the Buddhas explanation his earnest faith increased He kowtowed at the Buddhas feet and returned home with joy He made a complete analysis of the Buddhas teaching and instructed his wife and children They then carried it out and all attained the Path Morality Long ago there were mountains in the land of Benares about forty or fifty li away from the city Five ascetics lived in the mountains applying themselves to the Path At dawn they left the moun tains to beg for food After they had eaten they returned to the mountains arriving at dusk Going and returning was so very wearisome that they were not able to sit in meditation and de velop right concentration For years it was like that and they could not obtain the Path The Buddha felt compassion for their fruit less efforts He changed into a man of the Path and went to them He asked these men aspiring for the Path if it was not too hard to develop the Path dwelling in seclusion It will be just like that all our lives The man of the Path said Well he who considers the Path should take morality as its basis and mental restraint as its practice but if you despise the body while valuing the truth you will reject your corporal life So sustain your body with food and guard your mind in right concentration If you internally apply yourself to tranquility and insight you will appease your mind and attain the Path Please men aspir ing for the Path do not go tomorrow I shall give you nourishment so that you may rest one day So the five ascetics were very happy marveling at this wonder With appeased thoughts and a settled mind they did not worry about going to beg any more At noon the next day the transformed man of the Path came to bring them food After their meal they were content their minds tranquil Thereupon the transformed man expounded the stanzas faculties Knowing temperance in eating he applies himself with an alert mind proper concentration of mind Internally practicing tran quility and insight he is free from forgetfulness and has right knowledge izes right knowledge When he practices the Path accord ingly he purifies himself and removes suffering When the transformed man of the Path had spoken these stanzas he manifested the bright characteristics of the Buddhas body Thereupon the five ascetics were spiritually moved Grateful for his kindness they kept the precepts and obtained arhatship Mindfulness When the Buddha was once in the world King Pukkasati and King Bimbisara were friends Upon receiving them King Bimbisara in turn presented them to the Buddha He said to the Buddha King Pukkasati is a good friend of mine and he has sent me these flowers I now present them to you O Buddha With what shall I respond to what he has sent m e The Buddha informed King Bimbisara Copy the scriptural text on the twelve causes and present it to him Upon receiving the scriptural text his mind is sure to turn to zealous devotion He then copied the scriptural text and added a letter saying You sent me precious flowers I now present you this bouquet of the Doctrine Carefully reflect on its meaning If one exam ines current customs there is nothing to enjoy So he summoned his ministers entrusted the state to the crown prince shaved his head and became an ascetic Donning the robe of the Dharma and with alms bowl in hand he went to a potters home outside the city of Rajagrha to spend the night The following day he went to the city to beg and after he had eaten he went to the Buddha to receive the precepts The Buddha knew with supernatural knowl edge that Pukkasatis life would end the following day at meal time and that he therefore should not come from so far away to meet with him Furthermore it would be a great pity if he did not hear the scriptures Thereupon the Worldhonored One trans formed himself into an ascetic He went to the potter and asked permission to spend the night You may stay with him in the pottery there He took some straw entered the pottery and sat down to one side I have not met the Buddha yet When I learned about the twelve causes I became an ascetic Tomorrow I shall enter the city and after my meal of alms food I shall go to meet the Buddha The transformed ascetic said Mans life is hazardous with changes occurring from morning till night In its impermanence the retribution of past deeds emerges all of a sud den and not at any fixed time Just observe your body as a coming together of the four great elements It is the result of their combi nation as well as their dissipation each returning to its origin Develop an awakened mind characterized by emptiness purity and thoughtlessness Be especially mindful of the three respectful doctrines and of giving and the quality of morality To know impermanence is no different from meeting the Buddha Your thinking of tomorrow is a profitless thought The transformed ascetic then spoke the stanzas refuge in the Buddha he must day and night constantly be mindful of the Buddha his Dharma and his Sangha the disciples of the Buddha mindful of morality and the virtue of giving Day and night be mindful of emptiness aimlessness and signlessness When the Buddha knew that the king understood he manifested the splendor and auspicious luminous marks of his Buddha body King Pukkasati was surprised and in rapture The following day when it was time to eat King Pukkasati entered the city to beg for alms food At the gate of the city he encountered a cow that had just borne her young Protecting her calf she butted against King Pukkasati to kill him The Buddha sent his disciples to cremate him and erect a stupa  It is impossible not to heed the basis of the retribution of evil Kindness Once the Buddha was in Rajagrha and mountains existed five hundred li away In the mountains there was a family of one hun dred twentytwo members whose occupation was hunting in the marshes of the mountains They wore furs and ate meat and had never cultivated the land With noble insight the Buddha knew that they could be saved He went to the family and sat down under a tree The men had gone off to hunt and only the women were there When they saw the Buddhas bright appear ance illuminating heaven and earth and the trees and rocks in the mountains changing to gold the young and old were ecstatic Knowing that the Buddha was a supernatural person they all went to pay their respects brought offerings and sat down The Buddha explained to the mothers the wrong of killing living beings the merit of practicing kindness and that any affection between two persons is momentary and any union will soon end in parting Upon hearing the scriptural text the mothers rejoiced and said to the Buddha We mountain people are eager to take life in order to have meat to eat We want to present some to you as a small offering We hope you will accept it The Buddha informed the mothers It is the rule of any Buddha not to eat meat As I have already had my meal you need not provide anything else He then instructed them When man is born in the world he has food without limit Why does he not make use of beneficial food but instead does away with living things to stay alive himself When he dies he falls into a woeful destination and being hurt he gains no benefit When man eats the five cereals he feels pity for living beings and the wriggling species There is no creature that does not want to live When one kills others to keep oneself alive calamitous evil does not end When one is compassionate and does not kill one is without calamity from generation to generation Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the following stanzas constantly control himself dwells in immortality He is in a place where there is no calamity cautious in his speech and guards his thoughts dwells in immortality He is in a place where there is no calamity living beings and who does not annoy anyone deserves the brahma heaven He transcends birth and death When the Buddha had spoken the stanzas the men returned from their hunting Their women were listening to the scriptures and did not go to welcome them as was the custom The husbands were suspicious and they wondered why things were not as usual They abandoned the meat and came back thinking that something strange was going on They came back and saw that all the women were sitting in front of the Buddha listening to the scriptures with folded hands They became angry and drew their bows intent on destroying the Buddha But the women remon strated saying He is a supernatural person Do not give rise to any evil thoughts  Therefore each repented his sins and did obei sance to the Buddha The Buddha again explained to them the merit of not killing and the evil of doing harm The husbands understood knelt deeply and said to the Buddha We grew up deep in the mountains maintaining ourselves by hunting Our evil misdeeds have accumulated Which rule should we follow in order to escape grave misfortune Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas with universal love one gains the eleven praises and good fortune always follows These are the eleven  When the Buddha had spoken the stanzas the one hundred twentytwo men and women young and old were glad and devoutly accepted them They all subscribed to the five precepts The Buddha told King Bimbisara to give them land and to present them with cereals The conversion to benevolence was widespread and throughout the land there was peace Then the kings mother fell ill Failing in energy she had to keep to her bed He sent for doctors but he did not receive any medical drafts He sent for wise women seeking for them everywhere He again summoned the brahmans in the land and some two hundred people came He invited them in had them sit down offered them food and drink and informed them My mother has been ill for a long time I do not know what brought this about You have great knowledge and clear understanding of the principles of physiognomy and of heaven and earth and its constellations Why is it that you are unable to tell me what to do The brahmans said The constellations stand in the wrong position and yin and yang are not in harmony That is why this has occurred The king said What is the right thing to do so that she may recover The brahmans said In a peaceful and pure place outside of the city you should sacrifice to the four mountains and to the sun and moon and the constellations You should obtain a hundred ani mals of all kinds including a boy kill them and offer them to heaven O king you should personally lead your mother there and kneel and do obeisance and beg for her life Only then will she recover So the king provided them as instructed As the boy and a hundred head of elephants horses cows and sheep were driven they cried out sadly along the way moving heaven and earth Leaving through the eastern gate the king was going to the sacrificial altar to kill and offer them to heaven As the Worldhonored Ones great compassion saves all beings he pitied this kings utter foolishness  How can he give rise to evil by killing many beings in order to save one person Thereupon the Worldhonored One led his great assembly to this land At the eastern gate of the city he met the king and the brahmans on their way out The animals they were driving came out crying sadly The king saw the Buddha in the distance like the sun that has just risen or the full moon His radiance brightly lit up heaven and earth When the people saw him they were all filled with love and reverence They all wanted to rid themselves of the animals they were driving as well as the sacrificial implements The king then advanced and descended from his carriage He removed his para sol and did obeisance to the Buddha He crossed his fingers knelt and made inquiries to the Worldhonored One The Buddha told him to rise and asked him where he was going He folded his hands and answered  The queen mother has been ill for a long time I have consulted the finest physicians and the spirits everywhere Now I only want to go and allay the constellations the four moun tains and the five sacred peaks If you want to obtain cereals to eat you must plow and sow If you want to obtain great wealth you must practice giving If you want to obtain a long life you must show great compassion If you want to obtain wisdom you must apply yourself to learning If you practice these four things you will gain their fruits as they are sown A wealthy and honor able family does not covet the food of the humble The gods take the seven precious things for their abode Their clothing and food come naturally Sacrificing to licentiousness is like considering what is wrong to be right If one kills life to seek life one is far from the path of life If one kills the life of many in order to save one person how could one succeed that way Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza spirits in the world the sacrifice of elephants and horses would not be the same as one act of compassion When the Buddha had spoken the stanza he cast a bright glow that illuminated heaven and earth All in the three woeful desti nations and in the eight inopportune births were happy each one in his place King Homo heard the exposition of the wonderful Doctrine and he saw the bright glow He was overjoyed and ob tained the Path When his sick mother heard the Doctrine her five feelings lit up and her ailment disappeared When the two hundred brahmans had seen the Buddhas bright appearance and once again heard his words they felt shame and regret and they desired to become his disciples The Buddha accepted them all and they became ascetics each one obtaining his wish The king and his ministers invited the Buddha When they had worshiped him for a month he left The kings rule was just according to the Doctrine and therein the land flourished Words Once King Pukkasati entered the city of Rajagrha to beg for alms At the gate of the city he was butted to death by a cow that had recently brought forth young The owner of the cow was alarmed and he sold the cow and turned it over to someone else When that man was pulling the cow to water it the cow again butted its mas ter to death from behind That owner had a son who became ex tremely angry He took the cow to be killed and sold the meat in the market There was a farmer who bought the head of the cow He carried it with a rope over his shoulder and took it home Fur ther than a li from his home he sat down under a tree to rest and hung the head of the cow from a branch After a while the rope broke and the cows head fell right on top of him In one day the cow had killed a total of three people When King Bimbisara heard this he wondered why So he went with his ministers to where the Buddha was After he had done obeisance upon arrival he sat apart on the kings throne He folded his hands and said to the Buddha Very odd it is O Worldhonored One that one cow kills three people  The Buddha informed King Bimbisara  The retribution of a misdemeanor has an origin It does not hap pen just now The king said I would like to hear the reason The Buddha said Long ago there were three merchants who went to another country to make a living They stayed in the house of an aged widow They had to pay rent but when they saw that the old woman was a widow they cheated her and they did not want to pay When the old woman returned and did not see the merchants she asked her neighbors who said they had all gone The old woman was furious So she went looking for them and after a wearisome pursuit she caught up with them and demanded the rent for the house The three merchants scolded her instead saying We already paid you Why do you ask again They all as one contradicted her and they did not want to pay the rent The old woman was alone and weak and could not do anything Cursing them angrily she said to the three merchants I may be in distress now but why should I bear your cheating rebuttal As for me I vow that if I shall meet you in the place where I shall later be reborn I shall certainly kill you so that you may obtain the right path I shall never forget you I shall rest when I have killed you Until then I will not stop  The Buddha said to King Bimbisara The old woman at that time is now this cow The three merchants are the three people Pukkasati and the others who were butted to death by the cow Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas rejects the bonds and bears the harshness hatred is naturally appeased reason why he destroys himself is because of his evil words When the Buddha had explained this all those in King Bimbisaras official retinue were full of respect and vowed to dedicate them selves to good conduct They did obeisance and departed Fundamentals in Pairs Once the king of the land of Sravasti called Prasenajit came to where the Buddha was He descended from his carriage withdrew his parasol removed his sword took off his footwear folded his hands and came forward He prostrated himself kowtowed at his feet knelt deeply and said to the Buddha I wish to arrange for a trifling meal tomorrow at the four thoroughfares Well as the state sovereign you should have intelligent leadership and lead your people along the Path seeking future blessedness The king said With utmost sincer ity I ask leave to make strict preparations He prepared delicacies with his own hands and went by himself to receive the Buddha and his monks When they had all arrived at the four thorough fares the Buddha came there and took his seat passed around water so that they could cleanse themselves and he poured it with his own hands When the Buddha had finished his meal he expounded the Doctrine to the king at the four crossroads Among the countless onlookers at that time were two merchants One thought This king is foolish He is the king of the land What more could he want The Buddha is like an ox and his disciples are like a cart The ox pulls the cart in all four directions The Buddha is ju st like that W hat reason would you have to subm it to and serve him  Both men went away and after a journey of thirty li they stopped and lodged for the night Buying some wine they drank together and discussed their affairs The four kings protected the one who had had wholesome thoughts but the evil spirits on Mount Tai let the wine enter the belly of the one who had had unwholesome thoughts burning him like fire He left the inn and lay down on the road He sprawled out in the wheel tracks but in the morning five hundred merchant carts rode over him there and he died When his companion looked for him the next day he found him dead He said When I return to my country I shall be suspected of having killed him to take away his belong ings There is no sense in taking this lightly So he abandoned the riches and went to another country The king of this land had died without a crown prince In the Book of Prophecies it says In the central region there is a humble person who will rule this land The former king has a divine horse which is sure to bend its knees when a new king is appointed They immediately prepared a stately carriage the divine horse and the ribbon for the official seal and they went looking for the sovereign of the land He has a yel low cloud cover this is the aura of a ruler The divine horse bent its knees and licked the feet of the merchant The officials pre pared fragrant hot water bathed him and saluted him as their king Thereupon he occupied the throne and tended to the affairs of the state It must be the Buddhas kindness that has brought this about He then went to the land of SravastI with his officials He kowtowed from a distance and said I do not have any merit to receive your kindness O Worldhonored One or to rule over this land I wish to be kind to the multitude of worthies tomorrow and to look after them Once in the third month the Buddha informed Ananda and ordered his monks  Tomorrow you are invited by that king You must all transform yourselves so that the king and his people will rejoice They each used the foundations of their supernatural power to go to that country They all took their seats in the proper order dignified and according to the rules After they had eaten they washed their hands and expounded the Doctrine to the king The king said I am actually an insignificant person I never had any virtue to speak of Once that great king gave food to me to the Buddha at the four thoroughfares You O King thought The Buddha is like a king His disciples are like his ministers You O King sowed this seed Now you obtain its fruition The other person said that the Buddha was like an ox and that his disciples were like a cart He sowed the calamity of being run over by a cart Now he is in the hell of Mount T ai run over by a blazing chariot and obtaining his deserts It is not your vigor O King that could bring this about If one does something wholesome merit follows If one does something evil misfortune follows This is ones own doing and it cannot be given by gods dragons or spirits Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas the mind is caused by the mind If one thinks of evil either of word or deeds the suffering of sin naturally follows as a wagons wheels leave their tracks the mind is caused by the mind When the Buddha had spoken the scriptural stanzas those who had heard them the king and his subjects were innumerable They were all very glad and obtained the eye of the Doctrine Long ago the elder Sudatta bought some land from the crown prince Together they built a pure abode and presented it to the Worldhonored One Each invited the Buddha and his Sangha and made offerings for one month The Buddha gave an extensive exposition of the luminous Doctrine to both men and they both attained the Path The crown prince Jeta was glad and he re turned to his eastern palace Praising the Buddhas qualities he made music and rejoiced Jetas younger brother Virudhaka was always at the kings side The king then dressed up in plain clothes and with his courtiers and ladies in waiting went to where the Buddha was After he had kowtowed and done obeisance he in tently listened to the scriptures Virudhaka stayed behind and was in charge of the throne His deceitful ministers Asraddha and others then hatched a treacherous plot and they said  Try to wear the great kings ribbon with his official seal and sit on the throne Would you not be just like the king  Thereupon Virudhaka agreed with their words He donned the robe and mounted the throne The deceitful ministers all congratulated him You are just like the great king  Virudhaka immediately took the leadership over his followers put on his armor drew his sword and went to the pure abode of the Jetavana He deposed the great king blocking his return to the pal ace He battled the king s subjects in the Jetavana and killed more than five hundred of the kings courtiers The king fled with his la dies At the earliest dawn they reached the country of the Sakyas They became hungry along the way and the king ate radishes His belly swelled and he died Thereupon Virudhaka became tyrannical He drew his sword and entered the eastern palace to behead his elder brother Jeta Jeta knew his own impermanent nature He was not afraid and his countenance did not change color He expressed gratification with a smile and he willingly submitted to the sword Before his life ceased he heard natural music in the sky welcom ing his spirit The Buddha then spoke the stanzas in the Jetavana gooddoer rejoices in both cases He will rejoice indeed be glad Experiencing his merits his mind is content Receiving his merits he is delighted King Virudhaka then raised an army to attack the land of the Sakyas and he killed the men of the Path of the Sakya family In his cruelty and immorality he committed all five fatal transgres sions The Buddha predicted to Virudhaka that as he was not filial and loyal and his sins were very grave he would seven days later be burned by the fire of hell The prediction of the chief prophesier further agreed with that of the Buddha The king panicked He boarded a ship and went to sea I am on water now How could fire consume m e At noon on the seventh day there was a spontaneous fire coming out of the water It burned the ship and sank it The king was burned too Consumed by the vicious heat he suddenly perished Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas The evildoer grieves in both cases He will grieve indeed be full of anxiety Experiencing his sins his mind is disturbed Experiencing his sins he is tormented After the Buddha had expounded this he informed the monks Crown prince Jeta did not covet a glorious position He cherished the Path till death He was reborn high in heaven and his happi ness came of itself King Virudhaka was foolish and he readily gave in to his desires After his death he fell into hell and the suffering he experienced was immeasurable The powerful and the poor throughout the world are subject to impermanence There is none who stays long And so even the superior being died His whole conduct was a spiritual treasure When the Buddha had said this there was none who did not accept it in faith Beyond Mount Grdhrakuta there once were more than seventy brahmans and their families who deserved to be saved because of their previous merits The Buddha went to their village and ap peared showing his supernatural power of the Path When they all saw the majesty of the Buddhas bright appearance they all respectfully bowed down The Buddha sat down under a tree and asked the brahmans For how many generations have you lived in these mountains What do you do to provide for your living They replied We have been living here for more than thirty gen erations We farm and raise cattle He further asked What practices do you observe with the aim of leaving birth and death They replied We serve the sun and moon water and fire If someone has died young and old gather and pray for his rebirth in the brahma heaven so that he may leave birth and death The Buddha said to the brahmans Farming and raising cattle sacrificing to the sun and moon and to water and fire and pray ing for rebirth in heaven are not the right ways to long life or to escape from the birth and death cycle The highest merit does not go beyond the twentyeight heavens Without the wisdom of the Path one falls back into the three woeful destinations Only if one goes forth develops his determination for purity and practices what is meaningful for tranquility may one attain nirvana Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas real have wrong thoughts and will not obtain real gain the unreal know it to be unreal will have right thoughts and will certainly obtain real gain Although the gods are happy they too will die when their merits have been exhausted produced that will not come to an end Wanting to leave the cycle of birth and death one must practice the true Path When the seventy brahmans had heard the Buddhas explana tion they understood and were glad and they wished to become ascetics The Buddha said Welcome monks Their hair fell off of itself and they all became ascetics The Buddha and the ascetics set out for the pure abode When they were halfway there they longed for their wives and children and each wanted to withdraw It happened to rain then and they became even more depressed The Buddha knew what was on their minds He magically created several tens of huts along the way They entered them to get out of the rain but the huts were leaking Because the huts were leak ing the Buddha spoke the stanzas the mind does not reflect on ones actions it will be penetrated by lust Even though upon hearing the exposition o f these stanzas the seventy ascetics did their best to pull themselves together they still felt darkness in their hearts The rain stopped and they went on their way On the ground there was some old paper The Buddha told a monk to pick it up Being told so he picked it up The Buddha asked the monks What kind of paper is th is The monks said to the Buddha This is paper to wrap incense It may be thrown away now but it still retains its fragrance The Buddha continued on his way On the ground there was a broken string The Buddha told a monk to pick it up Being told so he picked it up The Buddha further asked What kind of string is this The monks said  That string is foul smelling This is a string to tie up fish The Buddha said to the monks These things are fundamentally pure but they all depend on a cause to bring about what is wrong or meritorious It is like that paper or that string When close to fragrance it is fragrant When used to tie up fish it stinks They are gradually tainted and become accustomed to it without being aware of it  Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas putrid thing Gradually being deluded they practice what is wrong and being unaware of it they accomplish what is bad near incense Advancing in knowledge they practice what is good and bring about a clear scent When the seventy ascetics had heard these stanzas they knew that the desire for home was a foul marsh and that wife and chil dren were fetters and handcuffs With earnest faith they went to the pure abode Reflecting on their actions with an attentive mind they obtained the path of the arhat Negligence Long ago when the Buddha was in the world there were five hun dred merchants who had traveled the seas They returned to their country carrying the seven precious things in large quantities While passing deep through the mountains they were misled by evil spirits and they could not find their way out Their provisions were all used up and placed in a distressing situation they all subsequently died from hunger There was an ascetic then in the mountains who was applying himself to the Path Upon seeing this situation he thought to himself I have been diligent in my application to the Path for seven years but I can not attain it Furthermore I am poor without any means to sus tain myself These valuable goods do not have any owner I shall take them back and establish a home Thereupon he descended from the mountains and took precious things with him After he had stored them away somewhere he left the mountains He asked his brothers to help him carry them back home Just when he was halfway the Buddha remembered that this monk would surely obtain deliverance The Buddha then changed into a nun with shaved head and the robe of the Doctrine but with powdered face and painted eyebrows and strung with necklaces of gold and sil ver She entered the mountains through a valley and met the as cetic on her way She made a deep bow and asked how he was doing The man of the Path scolded the nun saying Is this the way to attain the Path But why still powder your face paint your eyebrows and wear necklaces on your person The nun answered He leaves his relatives applies himself to the Path dwells in the mountains and appeases his mind Why then take what is not yours In your greed you are forgetful of the Path and quick to leave your noble intentions behind Your birth in the world is like a jour ney but the retribution for your evil is longlasting Thereupon the nun expounded to him the stanzas ing the precepts however results in fearful thoughts When one can do away with the impurities of the three worlds one is close to nirvana Then after the nun had spoken these stanzas showed the brightness of the primary and secondary marks of his Buddha body When the ascetic saw this his hair stood on end with fear He kowtowed at the Buddhas feet repented his mis take and pleaded A fool makes mistakes acting contrary to the right teaching When he goes on without redeeming himself what will happen to him  Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas later restrained himself well he illuminates the world Mindfulness to concentration is the proper attitude turns it by means of what is wholesome he illuminates the world cultivates the Buddhas teaching illuminates the world as the moon does after the clouds have parted offend he illuminates the world as the moon does after the clouds have parted When the monk had heard these stanzas his fetters were removed and his covetousness ceased He kowtowed at the Buddha s feet and he went to sit under a tree As his counting of breaths contin ued his tranquility and insight became pure He attained the re alization of the fruition of the Path and became an arhat The Mind Once when the Buddha was in the world there was a man of the Path He sat under a tree on the bank of a river and applied him self to the Path but in twelve years his covetousness had not been conquered Letting go his thoughts and with a distracted mind he only held dear the six desires beauty for his eyes sounds for his ears fragrances for his nose flavors for his mouth tactility for his body and dharmas for his mind He transformed himself into an as cetic and went to where the man was They both lodged under a tree On one occasion by the light of the moon a tortoise came out from the river to the tree There also was a hungry otter looking for food He saw the tortoise and wanted to eat it but the tortoise drew in its head tail and four legs and hid them in its shell It couldnt be eaten When the otter was some distance away the tortoise stuck out its head and feet and walked away Nothing could be done about it and so it got away Thereupon the man of the Path said to the transformed ascetic This tortoise has an armor to protect its life The otter could not gain advantage The transformed ascetic replied I think that people in the world are inferior to this tortoise Ignorant of their impermanence they give rein to their six senses When the external Mara gains advantage the body is destroyed and the spirit leaves Birth and death cycles are endless and revolve in the five destinations Suffering is too immeasurable all caused by the mind If one has much viciousness in mind one only provokes evil for himself parents You may direct it toward what is right Do what is meritorious and do not turn back When wisdom is victorious in the battle with Mara there will be no ailment When the monk had heard the exposition of these stanzas his covetousness ceased and his desire ended and he attained the Path of an arhat He knew that the transformed ascetic was the Buddha the Worldhonored One He reverentially adjusted his clothes and kowtowed at the Buddhas feet All gods dragons and spirits were delighted The Fragrance of Flowers Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti In the sea southeast of the country there was a terrace On the terrace there were flowers and fragrant trees The trees were pleasant There were five hundred female brahmans who although serving a heterodox path were very diligent and zealous of the mind They did not however know about the Buddhas existence The women then said to each other When we received our forms we were born as women From our youth until our old age we are in the custody of three things and we cannot be free Furthermore our life is brief It would be better if we all went to the terrace with fragrant flowers to gather the fragrant flowers If we are strenuous when fasting and let Brahmadeva descend he will comply with our wishes We wish to be reborn in the brahma heaven and to have a long life without death We also free without any bondage freed from any retribution and without any more sorrow So they took their offerings and went to the terrace They gathered fragrant flowers and served Brahmadeva They held their fast wholeheartedly wishing to let the venerable spirit descend Thereupon the Worldhonored One saw these women Even though they held a lay fast their minds were resolved and they deserved to be saved So he flew up in the air with a great multi tude of disciples bodhisattvas gods nagas and spirits went to the terrace and sat down under a tree The women were glad and they thought he was Brahmadeva They comforted each other that they had obtained their wish Then one celestial person said to the women  This is not Brahmadeva This is the most honored one in the three worlds called the Buddha The people he has saved are innumerable Thereupon the women advanced to where the Buddha was They did obeisance came forward and said to the Buddha We have a great deal of impurity and we are women now We wish to be free from bondage and be reborn in the brahma heaven The Buddha said  women as you are eager to obtain fine gain you have made this wish In the world there are two things for which the retribution is clear He who does what is wholesome experiences what is meritorious He who does what is evil experiences calamity The suffering of the world or the hap piness of heaven the vexation of the conditioned or the tranquil ity of the unconditioned who can choose and take what is true Excellent  women that you have a clear purpose Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas heaven Who can expound the verses of the Doctrine like picking wonderful flowers ware an illusion and a brief existence one brings a stop to the opening of Maras flowers and will not experience the cycle of life and death spontaneous one brings a stop to the opening of Maras flowers and will not experience the cycle of life and death When the women had heard these stanzas of the Buddha they wished to apply themselves to the true Path and to become nuns Their hair fell off of itself and they were provided with the robe of the Doctrine After reflection and quiet concentration they attained the path of the arhat Ananda said to the Buddha Well what merit did these women actually have that they had the Worldhonored One save them And further as soon as they had heard the exposition of the Doctrine they went forth and attained the Path The Buddha informed Ananda Once at the time of the Buddha Kasyapa there was an important elder whose riches were countless His wives and ladies numbered five hundred He was jealous by nature and his gate was not opened arbitral ily The wives and ladies wanted to go and meet the Buddha but they never obtained his permission The Buddha said to Ananda The five hundred wives and ladies of that time are the present five hundred nuns Because of the sincerity of their vow they now de serve to be saved That is why the Worldhonored One saved them  When the Buddha had explained this there was none who was not glad Chapter XII Formerly when the Buddha had just attained the Path he was in the land of Rajagrha While making conversions he gradually ar rived in the land of Sravastl Then there was a merchant an important person called Poli  He went to sea with five hundred merchants searching for precious things The spirit of the sea then came out He held a handful of water and asked Poli Is the water of the sea plenty or is my handful of water plenty Poli answered  The handful of water is plenty W hy  The water of the sea may be plenty but it is useless for ones present need It cannot save a thirsty person A handful of water may be little but if one meets a thirsty person one may use it and give it to him to save his life The merit one will experience in later times is incalculable The spirit of the sea was glad and he said in praise Excellent He then took off his eightfold fragrant necklace comparable to the seven precious things to present to Poli While the spirit of the sea accompanied him he went back safely and arrived in the land of Sravastl He presented the fragrant necklace to King Prasenajit and gave a complete account of its origin I think this fragrant necklace must not be worn by me I respectfully offer it to you  The king received the fragrant necklace and he thought it wonderful So he called the women and had them line up in front of him Sixty thousand women came in complete attire The king asked Why did my wife Mallika not come for ward A servant answered  Today is the fifteenth day She ob serves the fast according to the Doctrine of the Buddha She dresses in plain clothes not in grand attire That is why she does not come forward  Then the king became angry and he sent someone to call her saying  To observe the fast now do you not disobey the kings orders When he had thus sent for her three times Lady Mallika came forward dressed in plain clothes Among the multi tude she was as bright as the sun and moon and twice as beauti ful as usual The king was startled and as his respect increased he said I have received this female form The impurity of its sensual nature night and day accumulates like a mountain But ones life is short and one is afraid of falling into the three woeful destinations That is why I observe the fast of the Buddhas Doctrine in my life If one stops craving and follows the Path one will meet with merit in every existence The king rejoiced upon hearing this and he gave the fragrant necklace to his wife Mallika His wife replied I am observing the fast now You may give it to someone else The king said It was my intention to give it to the most excellent one You are the most excellent now Moreover you observe the fast of the Doctrine and your determination for the Path is extremely strong If you do not accept it I shall put it away  His wife replied Oh great king do not be grieved I hope that you O king will depart from your intention and go with me to where the Buddha is Present this fragrant necklace to the Worldhonored One and collect the noble teaching thus accumulating a kalpas merit The king agreed with her Your disciples Worldhonored One firmly keep their fast Such is their honest faith How meritorious Thereupon the Worldhonored One accepted the fragrant necklace and he spoke the stanzas become beautiful If one widely accumulates the fragrance of virtue ones rebirth will change for the better against the wind close to the Path and spreading widely the scent of a virtuous one goes everywhere the fragrant flower of the blue lotus even though one may say This is genuine none could be compared to the scent of the precepts call it genuine But the scent of keeping the precepts reaches the gods and is most excellent in ones conduct the mind becomes tranquil and is deliv ered and one is thereby distanced free from Maras path After the Buddha had expounded the stanzas he again informed the king  The fame of the merits of fasting reaches far and wide When Lady Mallika observes the fast of the Buddhas Doctrine for one day and one night this is better than if for instance the six teen great countries were filled with precious objects and one were to take them and give them away If one compares the merits it is like comparing Mount Sumeru and a single bean If one accumu lates merit and applies oneself to wisdom one may attain nirvana The king and his wife and his ministers great and small were all happy They dedicated themselves to the practice of the Doctrine Once the Buddha was on Mount Grdhrakuta in Rajagrha In the city there were fifty sons of the elders They went to where the Buddha was did obeisance withdrew and sat down The Buddha explained to them the Doctrine relative to impermanence suffering emptiness and selflessness Affection is like a dream Having come together people will soon part Although esteemed and honored one still feels sorrow When all misfortunes are completely appeased one will be in absolute peace Upon hearing the Doctrine the fifty people were happy and they wished to be his disciples The Buddha said Welcome monks Their hair fell off of itself and they donned the robe of the Doctrine to become ascetics These ascetics had relatives and friends who were elders When the elders heard that they had gone forth they were very happy for them They went to Mount Grdhrakuta to meet them and said in praise of them You were eager to obtain fine gain and now you have the determination They set up an altar for them and invited the Buddha and his Sangha The next day the Buddha and his Sangha came to the dwelling to eat After the meal he expounded the Doctrine and they departed in the after noon Those ascetics who had recently become adepts hankered after their kin and wanted to revert back to mundane life The Buddha knew what was on their minds As he was about to leave through the gates of the city he saw that in the foul mud covered by night soil in the ditch of a field there grew lotus flowers They were colorful and their scent was clear road there grows a lotus flower with a clear delightful scent mundane person remains in the cycle but the wise one takes leave of it as a disciple of the Buddha Having spoken the stanzas the Buddha returned to the moun tain The worthy Ananda came forward and said to the Buddha When you were near the ditch in the field Worldhonored One I did not understand the meaning of the two stanzas you proclaimed there I would like to hear what they mean  The Buddha informed Ananda Did you see that in the impurity of foul mud on the night soil in the ditch there grew lotus flowers Yes I saw them The Buddha said Ananda when man is in the world he proceeds from birth to birth Considering a life of a hundred years more or less one goes through love for wife and child hunger and thirst cold and warmth sadness or happiness Moreover there are one misfortune two good fortunes the three poisons the four errors the five aggregates the six entrances the seven consciousnesses the eight wrongs the nine vexations and the ten evils to contend with They are all like the impurity of foul mud the night soil accumulated in the ditch in the field All of a sudden there comes a person who realizes that the world is impermanent who is in tent on applying himself to the Path develops his determination for purity concentrates his spirit destroys false notions and ulti mately brings about his attainment of the Path He is like a lovely lotus flower that grows in foul mud He by himself attains the Path and saves his kin as well All beings will open up in full understanding He is also like the scent of a flower that overwhelms the stench When the fifty monks had heard the Buddhas expo sition of the Doctrine their determination became firmer and they attained arhatship The Fool Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti At that time there was a brahman in the city who was going on eighty years and whose wealth was immeasurable As a person he was foolish and niggardly and very difficult to convert He was not aware of the virtue of the Path nor did he understand the nature of imperma nence But he still built a fine dwelling The brahman always man aged and directed everything by himself The Buddha saw with his eyes of the Path that this old mans life would not last all day and that he would go to the nether world He could not know that himself and he was simply too busy with his preparations any way His spirit did not have any merit The Buddha led Ananda to his gate He asked the old man how he felt Are you not too tired This dwelling you are building now for what purpose is it  The old man said In the front room I shall welcome visitors and in the hall in the back I shall dwell by myself In the side rooms both east and west I shall have my children my possessions and servants In summer I shall mount my cool terrace and in winter I shall go to my warm room  The Buddha said to the old man For a long time I have heard about you aged virtuous one I thought of postponing our conver sation but I happen to have important stanzas Alive or dead they are beneficial I wonder if you could just put your things aside for a while and sit down with me to discuss them  The old man answered Right now I am very busy I cannot afford to sit down to talk Come again at a later day and I shall have a good chat with you The impor tant stanzas you mention you can expound them now There upon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas When a fool confidently calls himself wise he is called an utter fool The brahman said You have spoken these stanzas well You are really keeping me up now Come later and we shall discuss them again The Buddha was grieved then and he left Later on the old man walked under a rafter which fell and hit his head His life was lost immediately His family wept and it shocked his four neighbors The Buddha had not yet gone far when this mishap took place When the Buddha returned to the village he met tens of brahmans They asked the Buddha where he had come from and the Buddha said Earlier when I arrived at the house of the deceased old man I expounded the Doctrine to him but he did not believe in the Buddha s words Now he has all of a sudden gone to the nether world He again fully explained the meaning of the previous stanzas to the brahmans Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas scoops something flavorful Even if he associates with the wise for a long time he still does not know the Doctrine tongue that tastes something flavorful Even though he associates with the wise for just a while he immediately understands the essence of the Path readily performs evil bringing grave misfortune on himself Then when the brahmans had heard these stanzas they increased their sincere faith They did obeisance to the Buddha were de lighted and carried out their dedicated practice Once the Buddha was in the pure abode of Anathapindada in the land of Sravasti expounding the Doctrine to gods and men At that time King Prasenajit had a widowed daughter called Vajra  She had returned as a young widow Her father the king felt sorry for her and constructed a separate palace for her elegant livelihood He gave her five hundred singing girls to amuse her Among them was an elderly servant called Kubjottara who used to go to the market to buy ointments and powder incense and flowers Once she saw a huge crowd of men and women leave town each holding incense and flowers So she asked them Where are you going The crowd replied  The Buddha has ap peared in this existence the most revered one in the three worlds He will deliver all beings and all will obtain nir vana  When Kubjottara heard this she was delighted and full of joy So she thought to herself That I meet the Buddha now in my old age is a merit of my previous existence She immediately took part of the incense money to buy beautiful flowers She followed the crowd and went to where the Buddha was She did obeisance stepped aside scattered the flowers and burned the incense and then listened attentively to the Doctrine After she had left the market she handled some incense But on account of listening to the Doctrine and pursued by her previous behavior the scent of the incense was sweeter and its weight twice as heavy Her em ployers did not like her being late and they all reproached her As a loyal servant Kubjottara stated the facts In this existence there is a noble teacher the most honored one in the three worlds When he beats the unsurpassed drum of the Doctrine it reverberates throughout the trichiliocosmos Those who went to listen to his Doctrine were countless Truly I followed and listened to his Doc trine That is why I was delayed When the followers of Vajra heard her explanation that the meaning of the Doctrine of the Worldhonored One was very profound unheard of in this world they were delighted and joyful and they sighed What did we do wrong that we alone did not hear it So they asked Kubjottara to expound it to them Kubjottara said I am a lowly person and my words are unclear I do not dare to expound it I beg you to send me to seek his advice again and I shall explain it according to his command They immediately sent her out and told her again Communicate to us the complete proceedings  When Kubjottara had yet to return the servants of Vajra were in the courtyard restless as a child waiting for his mother The Buddha informed Kubjottara If you go back and expound the Doctrine many will be saved As for the right deportment when expounding the Doc trine first set up a high seat When Kubjottara had received the instructions she reported in full the noble command and they were all very delighted They took off their garments and piled them up to form a high seat When Kubjottara had cleansed her self she received the Buddhas majestic power and expounded the Doctrine as empowered Vajra and the others more than five hun dred people had their doubts resolved They destroyed their evil and attained the path of streamenterer The exposition of the Doctrine was so beautiful that they were not aware of being con sumed by fire In one moment they burned to death and were re born in heaven The king led his attendants to rescue them from the fire but when he saw that they were burned he prepared the coffins and shrouds After the burial he went to where the Buddha was He did obeisance to the Buddha withdrew and sat down on his usual throne The Buddha asked the king where he came from The king brought his hands together and said My daughter Vajra was so unfortunate as to catch fire unexpectedly Everything was completely burned I am just back from her coffin and shroud Please Worldhonored One tell me about that unknown  The Buddha informed the great king In the past there was a city called Benares There was an elders wife who led five hundred ladies out of the city to conduct a large sacrifice The rule was that it was not to be tolerated that someone from another family came near No matter whether close or distant those who came were thrown into the fire There was an aspirant for Buddhahood in the world then called Kala He lived in the mountains In the morning he came begging for alms and in the evening he quickly returned to the mountains Kala came upon the sacrifice on his begging rounds When the elders wife saw him she was furious They all grasped him and pushed him into the fire When his whole body was ablaze he used his supernatu ral power and flew up in the air The women were terrified and repented their misdeed in tears They knelt deeply raised their heads and stated W e women were foolish ignorant of your utter truthfulness We fools were so deranged as to disgrace your divine spirit But when he is about to fall into a place of distress then he knows it is not good The Buddha informed the great king The elders wife at the time is your present daughter Vajra The five hundred servants are the present five hundred singing girls including Kubjottara They do not remain unmanifested for long Good and evil follow a person just as the shadow follows the form When he had proclaimed this Doctrine the mighty and lowly in the land devoutly subjected themselves Adept at the various methods of the six arts astronomy geography healing through medicine landslides and earthquakes playing dice and chess playing of artful music cutting out gar ments embroidering silk slicing prepared viands and blending flavors he was equally versed in human affairs I shall put myself to the test traveling through the countries and I shall overcome any opposi tion My name will spread over the four seas and my expertise will hit the sky Entering the marketplace he looked around and saw a man sitting down and making a bow out of a horn While he was sepa rating the strings and fashioning the horn his hands looked as if they were flying His adjustments were swift as he made the bow The buyers pressed around him vying with each other Since my youth I have thought that my learn ing was complete I did not anticipate feeling inadequate for not learning to make a bow If I were to contest his skill I would lose I must learn from him  So he followed the bowmaker and sought to be his disciple His art was so ingenious that he even surpassed his teacher He then gave away his possessions took his leave and went away While on his way to another country he had to ford a river There was a boatman who was handling his boat as if he were flying He was turning going up and down with incomparable swiftness Again he thought to himself It may be a humble skill but I do not know it and I should learn it and be equipped with all ten thousand skills So he followed the boat man and sought to be his disciple In time he knew what was right or wrong He was making turns while managing the boat far better than his teacher He then gave away his possessions took his leave and went away Again he reached another country The king s palace was be yond compare in the world So he thought to himself The carpen ter who built this palacehow skillful he is I must again apply myself so that my mind will be satisfied So he sought out the carpenter and wished to be his disciple He honored him with all his heart and took up the ax In time he gained complete understanding of the measurements of square and round of com pass and square He knew completely the timberwork the carved designs and the inlay work His natural genius was evident and his work instantly surpassed that of his teacher With his super natural power the Buddha transformed himself into an ascetic Leaning on a staff and holding his alms bowl he came right up to him In the land where the brahman came from there was no Doctrine of the Path He had not yet seen an ascetic and wondered who this man was He would ask him at the right moment  I am someone who manages himself He again asked the Path and his mind is pure and joyful When the ascetic had spoken these stanzas he ascended into the sky and manifested himself as the Buddha The brightness of his thirtytwo marks and eighty secondary marks was pervasive and illuminated heaven and earth He descended from the sky and said to that man  The quality of the Path gives me the strength to transform and manage myself  Thereupon the man fell pros trate in obeisance kowtowed and asked  The Buddha informed the brahman The five precepts the ten wholesome paths of ac tion the four immeasurables the six perfections the four trances and the three deliverances these are the methods of managing oneself The wonderful skills of the six arts of the bowmaker the boatman and the carpenter these are all beautiful adornments elements of specious fame He wished to be his disciple and the Buddha informed him Welcome ascetic His hair fell off of itself and he became an ascetic The Buddha explained to him the essence of the four noble truths and the eight deliverances He subsequently attained the path of arhatship Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti Five hundred li from the land there was a village of fifty or sixty families in the moun tains A poor family lived in the village The mother was pregnant and in the tenth month she gave birth to twin boys They were beautiful beyond compare Fifty or sixty days after their birth their father had been pasturing the cows and returned home worn out He withdrew and lay down on his bed Their mother had left for the field to gather firewood and had not returned The two small boys looked around but did not see their parents One said In a previous existence we were about to obtain the Path but we were correctly punished for our foolish notion that life is permanent We fell back into the cycle of birth and death for countless eons Now we are born as sons in this poor family We are being punished for our longing for riches and honor in a previous life for letting ourselves go and for spending some thought about momentary happiness Ever since then we have been experienc ing suffering on our long journey We feel sorrow now but what can we resort to The other answered We were young then What else is there to say The fa ther heard his two sons making such reproaches and he was very surprised Ah they must be evil spirits that have come to bring disaster How can small children only several tens of days old say such words I am afraid that they will later kill their parents and destroy the family I must kill them while they are still very young not yet grown up The father left in a state of fright He shut the door and went to the fields to gather firewood He wanted to start a fire to burn them to death The mother was on her way back and she asked her husband what the firewood was for The husband said Very weird Such were the nature of their words They were like demons out to destroy their own family I want to burn them to death while they are still young When the mother heard this she was disconcerted She was doubtful and did not believe it and she said It would be better to wait for a few days and listen together to what they are saying For a few days she tried to listen to their talk Subsequently when husband and wife were leaving by the door they overheard their sons inside making re proaches as before When the husband and wife heard this again they thought it very weird And so they piled up firewood with the secret wish to burn them The Buddha saw with his divine eye that the husband and wife wanted to burn their two children to death He felt grieved They were pitiable but their former merits would save them He went to their village his luminous light shining everywhere Great and small in the vil lage were startled and went to where the Buddha was They did obeisance to the Buddha and there was none who was not glad They knew that the Buddha was the highest spirit unequaled in the three worlds The Buddha arrived at the house of the twin children When the two children saw the Buddhas light their joy was unbounded The parents were startled too and they each car ried one child to where the Buddha was They asked the Buddha the Worldhonored One Forty or fifty days after these children were born they spoke wicked words We do not know what kind of demons these children are When the Buddha saw the children he laughed heartily From his mouth came a fivecolored light illuminating the whole of heaven and earth The Buddha informed the parents of the chil dren and also the young and old o f the village These two children are no demons but meritorious children Formerly at the time of the Buddha Kasyapa they used to be ascetics They had been friends and comrades as youngsters and when they had gone forth each was zealous When they were about to obtain the Path a heterodox notion suddenly came up and they were checked con tent with worldly splendor Because of their merits however they were reborn in heaven and they descended as kings as lords and as elders but when this notion had suddenly arisen they fell further and regressed They did not obtain nirvana but expe rienced the cycle of birth and death They were constantly dragged through a successive number of eons and they were suddenly re born as twins They have just now been reborn in my time Be cause they have worshiped the Buddha ever since they deserve salvation because of their remaining merits Through the extinc tion of their evil and the rise of their merit they are conscious of their previous lives So I the Worldhonored One have deliber ately come to save them If I did not save them they would unrea sonably be burned by fire Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas He does not aspire for son wealth or country He constantly guards the path of moral conduct and wisdom and does not covet false riches and honor the sand When a friends resolve is not yet strong one follows beauty tainted by its essence When the Buddha had expounded this the children saw the Buddha and immediately jum ped up with joy just as eightyearold children do They became ascetics and attained arhatship When the villagers young and old had seen the Buddhas radiant appearance and had also seen that the childrens appearance had changed their joy was great and they attained the path of the streamenterer The doubts of the parents were lifted and they also obtained the eye of the Doctrine The Arhat Once there was a country called Nadika in the vicinity of the Southern Sea The peoples normal occupation was gathering pearls and sandalwood There was scarcity in the world at that time Pos sessing only Purna he was afraid they would not make ends meet and was very sad The slave Purna said to his master  Please do not be sad I Purna will deliberate on something and within months I shall make you surpass your brother The master said If you can definitely achieve this I shall set you free as a worthy person The wife of the master had some pearls and other things and gave them to Purna as his capital Then when the tide came in the people in the city went to the shores to gather firewood In the firewood there was the fragrance of gosirsa sandalwood It could cure serious ill nesses One ounce was worth a thousand taels of gold One could not always obtain it in the world at that time Purna knew this He bought it for two coins took it home and divided it into ten There was an elder then who had contracted a serious illness He had to have two ounces of this fragrant gosirsa sandalwood as his medicine He had sought for it for a long while but could not obtain it Purna took it to him and got two thousand taels of gold When he had sold everything in this way the wealth he had accumulated was ten times greater than the older brothers The master was grateful for Purnas kindness He did not break his word and set him free as a worthy person to enjoy himself as he pleased Thereupon Purna bade farewell and applied h i m s e l f to the Path He went to the land of Sravasti did obeisance to the Buddha knelt deeply and said to the Buddha The place I came from is insignificant but I find happiness in the qualities of the Path I hope that you Worldhonored One will show me your k i n d n e s s and save m e The Buddha said Welcome Purna His hair fell off of itself The robe o f the Doctrine covered him and he became an ascetic The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to him and he subsequently attained arhatship He sat down and thought to him self I now have the six superknowledges and the freedom of life or ruin and all this because of my masters kindness  The Buddhas spiritual conversion is so fine I would like to meet the Worldhonored One and receive his teach ing Purna replied Just wholeheartedly provide for food vessels The Buddha has the three penetrating insights He will certainly come himself I hope that you will condescend generously to save us all  The Buddha knew his intentions and so he went with his five hundred arhats each with his magic power to his house He came to where the Buddha was and fell prostrate in obeisance He withdrew and sat down on his royal seat When he had cleansed himself after the meal the Buddha extensively explained his bright Doctrine to the master and to the king and his assembled officials They all accepted the five precepts and became the Buddhas disciples  Thereupon the Worldhonored One praised Purna and spoke the stanzas behavior has ceased and when one is delivered through what is right one is at rest with everything extinguished ment when one has done away with the hindrance of the three realms and when all aspirations have ceased one is said to be a superior man shore wherever an arhat has passed there is none who is not saved people do not Delightfully without aspirations they do not long for anything After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas the master and the king increased their joy They worshiped for seven days and attained the path of the streamenterer An Account of Thousands Once the Buddha was in the land of Srvast There was an aged monk called Panthaka who had only recently become a monk He was ignorant by nature and so the Buddha had five hundred arhats instruct him daily In three years he still did not achieve under standing of even a single stanza The Buddha had pity on him and so he called him and gave him the following stanza Guard your mouth and control your mind The body must not commit anything wrong He who behaves thus can be delivered from the world  Panthaka was moved by the Buddhas kindness He was glad his mind opened up and he was able to recite the stanza The Buddha informed him Your age may now be advanced you have achieved reciting the stanza Everyone knows it One must not think of it as odd I shall now explain its meaning to you Lis ten well and with all your heart As Panthaka listened to the teaching the Buddha explained to him that the body is the basis for the three  the mouth for four and the mind for three He explained about the contemplation of their origin and their extinction and that one ceaselessly revolves in the five des tinations and the three realms Because of this one either ascends to heaven or falls into the abyss but also because of this one at tains the Path and nirvana comes naturally He distinctly ex plained immeasurable wonderful things to him Panthakas mind suddenly opened up and he attained arhatship At that time there were five hundred nuns living in a sepa rate pure abode Daily the Buddha sent a monk to expound the scriptural Doctrine One day it was Panthakas turn to go When the nuns heard this they all chuckled in anticipation When he comes tomorrow we shall say the stanza backwards and make him ashamed and speechless When Panthaka went to the nuns abode the next day they all came forward young and old did obeisance looked at each other and laughed When he sat down they gave him food and after the meal he washed his hands and they invited him to expound the Doctrine  When the young nuns wanted to say the stanza backwards they could not open their mouths They were frightened and reproved themselves They kowtowed and repented their wrongdoing Panthaka then one by one distinguished the elements just as the Buddha had explained the bases of body and mind evil and merit internal and external the ascent to heaven and the obtaining of the Path concentration of the spirit annihilation of notions and entering into concentra tion When the nuns heard his explanation they thought immedi ately it was peculiarly uncanny They were wholeheartedly glad and they all entered the path of the arhat Later Prasenajit the king of the land invited the Buddha and his congregation for an assembly in his main hall Wishing to demonstrate Panthaka s imposing spirit the Buddha gave him his alms bowl to carry and he followed behind The doorkeeper recognized him and detained him He did not allow him to enter You are an ascetic who does not understand a single stanza Why would you be invited I am a layman and yet I know the stanzas How much more should an ascetic but you are without knowl edge There is no point in being charitable toward you You can not enter So Panthaka remained outside the gate while the Buddha sat down in the hall When they had passed the water Panthaka took the bowl stretched his arms and handed it from afar to the Buddha The king his ministers his wife the crown prince and the four classes of the congregation saw the arms com ing in but they did not see the body In amazement they asked the Buddha whose arms they were The Buddha said They are the arms of the monk Panthaka He recently attained the Path I let him take my bowl earlier but the doorkeeper did not allow him to enter That is why he stretches his arms and gives me my bowl  They immediately invited him in His spirit was twice as imposing as usual The king said to the Buddha I have heard that Panthaka is by nature ignorant He just knows one stanza Why did he at tain the Path The Buddha informed the king Panthaka understands the meaning of one stanza Its purity of reason has entered his spirit His body mouth and mind are calm pure as celestial gold Someone may have studied much but if he does not understand and practice it he merely ruins his consciousness What is the advantage There upon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas what is the advantage if they are meaningless It would be better to learn a single meaningful thing so as to practice and be delivered If one understands one verse of the Doctrine and practices it one may attain the Path After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas two hundred monks attained arhatship The king his ministers his wife and the crown prince were all very happy Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti in a pure abode and expounded the Doctrine to gods and men Then there was a brahman in that land an elder by the name of Ramadatta He had limitless wealth The possessions of his f a m i l y were immea surable According to the rules of the brahman class one must display extensive largesse in order to show ones fame Dispensing the family riches he used them as gifts Arranging for the pancavarsika  he established worship to more than five thousand brahmans In five years he had offered clothing bedding medicine rare precious objects and implements for the sacrifices all highly coveted things For the elder Rmadatta the brahmans conducted sacrifices dur ing the five years to the gods the four mountains the five sacred peaks the constellations water and fire There was nothing that was not complete They made incantations asking that the elder would experience prosperity for a long time When the five years were over on the very last day he was most generous following the rules of the elders Golden bowls were filled with silver grain and silver bowls were filled with golden wheat Elephants and horses carriages servants valuables personal adornments of the seven precious things parasols shoes deerskin clothes staffs couches washing pitchers and vessels beds and sleeping mats everything they had to have eightyfour thousand things he gave them all On that very day they all came to the great gathering When the Buddha saw this he sighed Why is this brahman of noted family so foolish His gifts are great but the meritorious recompense is small It is like sowing seeds in fire what benefit can one obtain If I do not transform myself he will be barred from entering the Doctrine for a long time Thereupon the Worldhonored One rose and arranged his clothes in a dignified way He transformed himself and emerged from the earth emitting a very bright light that shone all over the gathered multitude Young and old were surprised at this wondrous sight They were startled and terrified not knowing what the spirit was The elder Rmadatta and the whole multitude touched the ground with their heads and did obeisance to the Buddha The Buddha saw that everyone in the crowd had respect ful minds and because of their reverential demeanor he then spoke the stanzas uninterruptedly throughout ones entire life but it is better to be mindful of the Doctrine for a single moment The merits one brings about in one such moment are superior to those of an entire life The merits of one moment of homage are superior to those of a hundred years Thereupon the Worldhonored One informed Ramadatta Giving is fourfold What are the four First although one gives much the meritorious recompense one obtains is small Second although one gives little the meritorious recompense one obtains is great Third one gives much and the meritorious recompense one ob tains is also great Fourth one gives little and the meritorious recompense one obtains is also small What is meant by one gives much and the meritorious rec ompense one obtains is small It is when a person is foolish and makes sacrifices by killing living beings when he drinks spirits and sings and dances when he dissipates his wealth and does not have meritorious wisdom What is meant by one gives little and the recompense one obtains is small When one gives scantily and with evil intention to a man of the Path Both are foolish and there fore have no merits What is meant by one gives little and the merits one obtains are great When one can serve a moral person with kindness After the man of the Path has eaten one strenu ously applies oneself to recitation For one who does this even though it is little his merits are very great What is meant by one gives much and the merits one obtains are great When for instance a farmers soil is rich or poor what he gets as a yield is not the same At that moment when the elder Ramadatta and the people gathered there had seen the Buddha s transformation and when they had heard his exposition of the words of the Doctrine they were all very glad All gods people and spirits attained the way of a streamenterer The five thousand brahmans all became ascetics and attained arhatship Young and old who lived in the house of their master Ramadatta accepted the five precepts and also attained the Path The king of the land and his high officials all accepted the precepts and took refuge  They became lay disciples and attained the eye of the Doctrine Once when the Buddha was in a pure abode in Sravasti teaching there was a man in the land of Rajagrha who was terribly foolish He was not pious toward his parents he was rude to the good and he was disrespectful toward his elders As his house was in decay and things never went according to his wishes he took to serving the fire in the hope of gaining good fortune As for his way of serving the fire just when the sun would go down he would light a large pyre He knelt and did obeisance towards it sometimes until late at night When the fire was extinguished he stopped He acted in this way for three years but he did not gain any good fortune He further served the sun and moon As for his way of serving the sun and moon in the daytime when the sun had risen and at night when the moon was bright he did obeisance respectively toward the sun and the moon When they had gone down he stopped He acted in this way for three years but he again did not gain any good fortune He then served the gods He burned incense knelt and did obeisance He offered fine fragrant flowers spirits and dried meats pigs and sheep cows and calves Consequently he became poor and thus did not obtain good fortune He was distressed and downcast He heard that in the land of SravastI there was a Buddha honored by all gods I must go and serve him and I certainly expect to obtain good fortune When he reached the gate of the pure abode and looked up to the Worldhonored One the Buddhas bright appearance was dazzling and his looks were extraordinary just like the moon among the stars Seeing the Buddha he was glad He kowtowed folded his hands and said to the Buddha I have grown in foolishness not aware of the Buddha Dharma and Sangha That is why I have come from afar to seek ref uge wishing to be saved with good fortune  The Buddha informed him What you have served are all sorcery bogeymen and sprites Your prayers and sacrifices are like a mountain but your mis deeds are like the rivers and the sea If you seek good fortune by killing living beings you are far from good fortune It just makes you suffer a hundred eons without others respect When one prays and sacrifices using the pigs and sheep of the whole world the misdeed is like Mount Sumeru and there is not even an iota of good fortune How would you not be affected by knowing that your expenditures have been in vain Furthermore you have not been pious toward your parents You have treated the worthy with unconcern and you have no respect for your elders You are proud and haughty and your three poisons abound As your wrongs be come more serious every day why would you obtain merit If you are capable of a change of heart if you treat the worthy with respect if your demeanor is dignified and reverential if you serve your elders if you reject evil and believe in good and if you develop yourself and exalt kindness four merits will increase day by day and you will never be ailing What are the four One your appearance will be proper Two your strength will be strong Three you will be safe and without illness Four you will add years to your life and your end will not be untimely If you prac tice unremittingly you may obtain the Path too Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas It is better to pay homage to the worthy ful of your elders the four merits will naturally take effect appearance strength longevity and happiness When that man had heard these stanzas of the Buddha he was very glad and gained pious understanding He kowtowed and did obeisance He again said to the Buddha Covered by the impurity of my misdeeds I have accumulated evil for nine years but I was fortunate to be converted by kindness I do wish that you Worldhonored One will let me be an ascetic The Buddha said Welcome monk His hair fell off of itself and he became an ascetic He internally reflected on anapana and attained arhatship Evil Conduct Once the Buddha was in the land of Rajagrha He sent an arhat called Sumana to the south of Kasmir with the Buddhas hair and nails to a temple with a stupa in the mountains Five hundred arhats always stayed there Morning and evening they burned incense circled the pagoda and offered prayers In those moun tains there were five hundred monkeys They witnessed the men of the Path worshiping at the pagoda and so they immediately went together to the bank of a deep torrent Carrying mud and pushing stones they likewise built a stupa Erecting a tree as a flagstaff they attached a silk banner at its tip The moun tain waters then suddenly rose and the five hundred monkeys immediately drowned Their spirits were reborn in the second or Trayastrimsa heaven in a palace with the seven precious things Clothing and food came naturally Where did we come from to be reborn in heaven With the heavenly eye each then saw his previous appearance the body of a monkey Just like the men of the Path they were playfully building a pa goda Although their bodies were drowned their spirits had attained rebirth in heaven We must descend now to show our gratitude to our old corpses They all took their servants and with flowers incense and music they descended to their old corpses They scat tered the flowers burned incense and went seven times around them In the mountains at that time there were five hundred brahmans With their heretical path and heterodox views they did not believe in demerit or merit When they saw that the heav enly persons were scattering flowers making music and walking around the corpses of the monkeys they asked in amazement Gods your bright reflection is so imposing Such is the merit gained by playfully building a pagoda If you will earnestly serve the Buddha your merit will be difficult to describe You gentlemen hold heterodox views and do not believe in what is right Toiling for a hundred eons you will not gain a thing It would be better for you all to go to Mount Grdhrakuta The merits gained by serving and offering prayers will be endless So they all rejoiced and went to where the Buddha was The heavenly per sons said to the Buddha Recently we had the bodies of monkeys but we experienced your kindness Worldhonored One and we attained rebirth in heaven Regretfully we did not meet you O Buddha Therefore we now take refuge They again said to the Buddha What evil conduct did we do in a previous existence that we experienced those monkey bodies Even though we built a pa goda our bodies drowned The Buddha informed the heavenly persons This has a reason It does not happen out of nowhere I shall now explain to you how it came about A long time ago there were five hundred young brahmans They all went to the moun tains in search of the path of an immortal In the mountains at that time was an ascetic who wanted to mend his pure abode on the mountain with mud He went down to get some water His body was so light that it seemed like he was flying The five hun dred brahmans were envious and they all laughed at him  If he does not stop getting water in this way he will shortly drown once the torrential mountain waters come The Buddha informed the heavenly persons The ascetic who was running up and down at that time was myself The five hundred brahmans were the five hundred monkeys They jestingly performed a misdeed and they personally experienced its retri bution Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza The Buddha informed the heavenly persons Even though you were animals in your recent existence you still could playfully erect a stupa Now you have attained rebirth in heaven your sins are extinguished and you thrive in good fortune Having returned to earth now you have personally received the proper teaching Because of this you will be free from any suffering for a long time After the Buddha had said this the five hundred heavenly persons attained the Path When the five hundred brahmans gathered on the riverbanks heard about the retribution of demerit and merit they sighed We have applied ourselves to a seer for quite a number of years but we have no results yet The monkeys who playfully perform merit and obtain rebirth in heaven are much better The qualities of the Buddhas path are so truly wonderful Thereupon they kowtowed at the Buddhas feet and wished to be come his disciples When the Buddha said Welcome monks they became ascetics After strenuous daily development they attained the path of the arhat Once the Buddha was in a pure abode in the land of SravastI expounding the Doctrine to gods and men At that time the sec ond son of the king of the country was called Virudhaka When he was twenty years old his attendants and officials forced out his father the king He killed his older brother the crown prince and made himself king An evil minister called Nali said to King Virudhaka O king at the time you were crown prince you went to your family home in the land of the Sakyas When you looked in on the Buddhas pure abode you were scolded by the sons o f the Sakyas and thoroughly reviled because of your mothers lowly birth At that time you announced that when you became king you would see to this Now the time has come You should mobilize your troops and horses and exact revenge He made the necessary arrangements and leading his soldiers and horses was about to attack the land of the Sakyas The Buddha had a second disciple called Mahamaudgalyayana The disciple saw that King Virudhaka was leading his troops to attack the land of the Sakyas and avenge an old grievance and that he would destroy the four types of disciples He felt great pity and went to where the Buddha was  The Buddha informed Mahamaudgalyayana Even though I know that you have the knowledge and virtue that can relocate the people of the land of the Sakyas in a safe place all things and beings have seven things from which there is no es cape What seven Seven causality Even though one may want to avoid these seven things one cannot obtain free dom If you can do this with your supernatural power the burden of the demerit of the former retribution cannot be left behind Thereupon Mahamaudgalyayana did obeisance and left Accord ing to his own idea he chose four or five thousand friends and danapatis of the people of the land of the Sakyas placed them in a vessel and moved them to the stars in the sky When King Virudhaka had attacked the land of the Sakyas and killed three hundred thousand people he led his army and returned to his country Thereupon Mahamaudgalyayana went to where the Buddha was He did obeisance to the Buddha prided himself and said King Virudhaka has attacked the land of the Sakyas I your disciple have saved four or five thousand people o f the land of the Sakyas with your supernatural power  Buddha Have you gone and looked at the people in the vessel He said I have not gone to look at them yet The Buddha said First go and look at the people in the vessel Mahamaudgalyayana let the vessel come down through his power of the Path and he saw that the people there had all died There upon Mahamaudgalyayana was depressed and mournful and felt sorry for their suffering He returned and said to the Buddha The people in the vessel are all dead now My virtue and supernatural power were not able to counter the demerit of their former retri bution The Buddha informed Mahamaudgalyayana There are these seven things The Buddha and the nobles the seers and men of the Path may hide them or disperse their bodies but none can avoid these seven things Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Only the kind and wise do not have thoughts of others wrong and evil When the Buddha had said this countless people sitting nearby heard the Buddhas explanation of the doctrine of impermanence They were all sad knowing that retribution is hard to avoid Then they joyfully attained the Path and realized the status of streamenterer The Rod There once was a country called Hsienti An aged monk lived there who suffered from a long illness He was emaciated and filthy He was lying in a pure abode in Hsienti but no one looked after him The Buddha led five hundred monks to where he lived He told the monks to look after him to make rice gruel for him but when they smelled his foul place they despised him The Buddha had Sakra ruler of the gods bring some hot water and the Buddha himself washed the body of the sick monk with his vajra hands The earth shook and there was a burst of sudden bright light Everyone was startled The king of the land and his subjects gods dragons spirits and countless people went to where the Buddha was They kowtowed did obeisance and said to the Buddha You the three worlds possessed of the virtues o f the Path Why do you condescend to wash this sick and filthy monk  The Buddha informed the king of the land and the whole gathering The reason why the Tathagata has appeared in the world is precisely because of this distressed one who has no one to look after him When honoring a sick ascetic a man of the Path or any poor and lonely old person the merit is immeasurable Ones wishes will be fulfilled Merits will come just as the five rivers keep flowing As ones qualities are gradually consummated one may attain the Path The king said to the Buddha Now what misdeed did this monk previously do that he is stricken by illness for many years beyond any cure The Buddha informed the king Conforming to the kings sever ity the officer personally displayed a chilling effect on all When he wanted to whip someone he demanded a price When he ob tained something the whipping was light but when he obtained nothing it was heavy When the officers life ended he fell into hell He was very maliciously flogged and when his demerit was extinguished he appeared again but only to be among animals and be constantly beaten for more than five hundred existences When his demerit had ended he became a man and was constantly hampered by a grave illness The pain did not leave him The king of the land at that time is now Devadatta The officer is the present sick monk The sage is myself In my previous existence I was treated with lenience The whip did not touch me That is why I the Worldhonored One personally washed him When someone performs good or evil mis fortune or good fortune follows him Even in another birth and death cycle it cannot be avoided Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas who are without offense his misfortune is tenfold His calamity is sudden and without pardon broken Then when the sick monk had heard these stanzas of the Buddha and the events of his former lives he acknowledged his former behavior As he subdued his thoughts and reproved himself his ailment was instantly cured in front of the Buddha His person safe and his mind at rest he attained arhatship The king of Hsienti was delighted and gained pious understanding He subsequently received the five precepts and became a pure believer He carried them out till his death and attained the path of a streamenterer Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti in the pure abode of the garden of Anathapindada in the Jetavana expounding the Doctrine to gods men dragons and demons In the east there was a land called Uttaravati There were five hundred brahmans who were going together to the Ganges River On its bank there were three sacrificial ponds By washing away their impurities they sought to become immortals in their nakedness in accordance with Nirgrantha law Their way led through a vast marsh and they got lost and could not pass it They had become short on pro visions along the way and looking from a distance they saw move ment in a tree which appeared as if alive with a spirit They thought someone was there and rushed to the tree When they realized there was nothing the brahmans raised their voices and lamented loudly They were distressed by hunger and thirst and dying of exhaustion in this marsh The spirit of the tree appeared as a man and asked the brahmans Men of the Path where do you come from and where do you want to go now  They replied with one voice We want to go to the divine ponds and cleanse ourselves hoping to become immortals Today we are hungry and thirsty  The spirit of the tree then raised his hands and food and drink of a hundred flavors abundantly flowed from his hands giving them all the food and drink required When they were all fully fed and satisfied the remaining food and drink were adequate to keep them supplied for the rest of the way When they were about to part they went to the spirit and asked What virtuous deed did you previously perform that you bring about such loftiness I formerly lived in the land of Sravasti The high official of the land was then called Sudatta Providing food for the Buddha and his monks he bought koumiss on the market but there was no one to pick it up He looked all over and finally en gaged me to pick it up After they had passed around the water to cleanse them selves I solemnly listened to the Doctrine We were all glad judg ing it to be immeasurably wholesome I then fasted and did not eat upon my return in the evening My wife asked in surprise I wonder what is bothering you I answered Nothing When I was walking in the market I saw the elder Sudatta and we both gave food to the Buddha in the park He invited me to fast the fast being one of the eight prohibitions  My wife became angry and said with indignation Gautama confuses the common  If you do not forget about him trouble will come from it As she kept pressuring me I ate with her Then at night my lifes fortunes ended at midnight As a spirit I came to be born here Because my foolish wife ruined my rules of fasting and because I did not complete those deeds I came to be born in this marsh and became the spirit of this tree As for the merit of picking up the koumiss from my hands come food and drink If I had completed the rules of fasting I would have been reborn in heaven They piously accepted it and turned around back to Sravasti Their way led through a country named Kausambl There was an elder called Ghosila who was kind to others and respected by all We want to go to SravastI and to where Sudatta is Choosing the rules of fasting we long to re ceive them and obtain merit Ghosila was in raptures of joy He proclaimed that those of his kindred who could go with him and receive the regulations of fasting should unite with the five hundred men and answer his call He vowed to lead them They all talked it over and left with dignity Before he had reached the Jetavana he encountered Sudatta on this way He looked back and asked his followers who this man was They answered Sudatta The crowd of brahmans was glad We were looking for him and we found him They rushed to meet him and unanimously said in praise The spirit of the tree has praised your virtue Respectfully and candidly he has fully explained his admiration That is why we have come to place ourselves in your care I have a revered teacher called the Tathagata He helps mankind When they met with the Tathagata their gladness was hard to measure They fell prostrate in obeisance withdrew and sat aside They all knelt deeply and said to the Worldhonored One We initially left home and wanted to go to the three ponds to cleanse ourselves and seek to be immortals Please show us your supreme spirituality Thereupon because of their behavior the Worldhonored One expounded the stanzas and wear a coarse garment one may cleanse oneself squatting on a rock but how could his doubts be undone does not seek to win but is kind and loving toward the world there is no enmity where he goes When the five hundred brahmans had heard the stanzas they were very glad They all became ascetics and attained the path of arhatship The monks said to the Buddha What virtuous deed had the five hundred brahmans and elders previously done to obtain the Path so sw iftly The Worldhonored One informed them A long long time ago there was a Buddha in the world called Kasyapa He explained to his disciples that I would come at the time of the five defilements At that time there were a thou sand brahmans and elders who said these same words Let us meet the Buddha Sakyamuni The brahmans of that time are now these brahmans The elders of that time are now those with Ghosila That is why they have met me and have understood The monks were very glad did obeisance and followed the instructions Chapter XIX Similes with Old Age Once the Buddha was in the land of SravastI in the pure abode of the Jetavana After his meal he expounded the Doctrine of im mortality to gods and men to the ruler to his ministers and his people and to the four classes of disciples Then there were seven elder brahmans from afar who had come to where the Buddha was They kowtowed folded their hands together and said to the Buddha We strangers would humbly like to listen to your noble way of conversion We should have taken refuge a long time ago but there were many impediments  When the Buddha had accepted them as ascetics he told the seven men to stay together in one quarter But after these seven men had seen the Worldhonored One and subsequently were able to practice his Path they did not reflect on the nature of impermanence They sat together in their quar ters just thinking of worldly things They were speaking in a low tone or loudly laughing not reflecting on success or failure Their lives were daily nearing the end time was running out With his three penetrating knowledges the Buddha knew that their lives were about to end He felt sorry for them He stood up went to their quarters and informed them Sirs when you practice the Path you must seek to surpass worldly things All beings rely on five things What are the five One they rely on their youth Two they rely on their upright appearance Three they rely on their great strength Four they rely on their wealth While you seven sirs are speaking in a low tone or loudly laugh ing what do you rely on Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas always be ablaze Profoundly shrouded in darkness it would be better to seek for light on it is considered to be safe but it is the source of a great deal of imagining that brings forth illness How could one know it is not real luster The skin slackens and muscles shrink The fate of death is close abandoning his chariot When the flesh has dissipated and the bones are scattered how can one rely on a body After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas the seven monks un derstood Their expectations ceased and they attained arhatship in front of the Buddha Once the Buddha was in a pure abode in SravastI expounding the Doctrine to gods and men and to the ruler Then there was a vil lage of brahmans In the more than five hundred houses there were five hundred young brahmans practicing their brahmanical arts They were arrogant and did not respect their elders They considered haughtiness and selfimportance normal The five hundred brahmans discussed among themselves The ascetic Gautama calls himself a Buddha with the expedient knowledge of the three penetrating insights There is none who dares argue with him Let us question him on different points and we shall know how he is They then pre pared offerings and invited the Buddha The Buddha went with his disciples to the village of the brahmans They took their seats passed the water around and after the meal they washed their hands They happened to be on their begging round in the village The Buddha knew that formerly they had been very wealthy beyond compare and that they had been high officials So the Buddha asked the young brahmans Do you know the elder brahmans They all said yes He further asked  They were high officials before with countless riches  Then why are they now on their begging round They all said Their wastefulness was unprincipled That is why they remain poor The Buddha said to the brahmans In the world there are four things which men are unable to practice But he who does them obtains prosperity and does not become poor What are the four One when in the prime of life and strong do not be arrogant Two keep zeal at an advanced age and have no desire for debauchery Three when you possess riches and precious things be constantly mindful of giving Four take up studies with a teacher and accept his true words He is like an old heron waiting by the empty pond never catching anything Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas As life goes by swiftly and abandonment is constantly present regrets are useless The Buddha informed the brahmans In a generation there are four periods during which one may gain merit by practicing the Path In this way one may obtain salvation and escape from any suffering What are the four One the period in which one pos sesses strength in youth Two the period in which one possesses property when rich and honored Three the period in which one has experienced the fine field of merit of the Buddha Dharma and Sangha Four the period in which when reflecting on things one feels the sorrow of parting When one experiences these four things ones wishes will all be fulfilled One will certainly gain the Path Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Train yourself and seek wisdom Be free from impurity and do not be tainted Hold up a candle and contemplate the place of the Path When the Buddha said this he emitted a bright light illuminating heaven and earth The five hundred young brahmans then under stood They straightened their clothes and hair stood up and did obeisance at the Buddhas feet They said to the Buddha Welcome monks and they immediately be came ascetics and attained arhatship The villagers young and old all attained the Path and there was none who was not glad Holding Oneself Dear Once there was a land called Tamra Seven li from the city there was a pure abode Five hundred ascetics constantly dwelled there reading the scriptures and practicing the Path There was an old monk called Mahallaka As a person he was not bright The five hundred men of the Path had to instruct him but he did not master a single stanza in the course of several years The whole community despised him and the people did not share their gather ings with him Later when the king of the land invited the men of the Path to come to his palace to conduct wor ship the monk Mahallaka said to himself I was born into this world so dull that I do not know one stanza and I am held in contempt by the others What a life this is  So he took a rope and went underneath a big tree in the garden in the rear intent on hanging himself With his eye of the Path the Buddha saw this from afar He transformed himself into the spirit o f the tree He appeared half as a human being and reprimanded him saying Oh monk Why do you do this Mahallaka then fully informed him of his hardship The transformed spirit reprimanded him saying You cannot do this Yes listen to my words Once at the time of the Buddha Kasyapa you were a Tripitaka as cetic with five hundred disciples Because o f your great learn ing you despised all others Sparing o f the meaning o f the scriptures you initially would not teach anything Therefore in every existence you were born into your faculties were dull You have only yourself to blame Why destroy yourself Thereupon the Worldhonored One show ed his divinely b rillian t appear ance and spoke the stanzas watch over what should be guarded If in his aspirations he wants to understand he should apply himself to what is right without resting A wellregulated person acquires wisdom When the mind is regulated and the body correct what wish will not be fulfilled The evildoer experiences evil himself just as surely as a diamond pierces a pearl When the monk Mahallaka had witnessed the Buddhas brilliant personal appearance he trembled with both grief and joy and kow towed at the Buddhas feet He reflected on the meaning of the stanzas and immediately entered the state of concentrative mind In the presence of the Buddha he subsequently attained arhatship He knew countless matters of his former lives and penetrated the essence of all the scriptures of the Tripitaka The Buddha told Mahallaka to don his robe take his bowl and have a meal in the kings palace where he was to preside over five hundred men of the Path  These men of the Path were your five hundred disciples in your previous existence If you again expound the Doctrine to them you will help them obtain the Path and make the king un derstand and believe in the nature of evil and merit He at once accepted the Buddhas instructions He went straight to the palace and sat down on the seat of honor The assembled monks all became angry and wondered why but they respected the kings intention and did not dare scold him They thought Mahallaka was foolish and did not have any under standing about donations and that thinking was too exhausting for him Mahallaka then gave him a donation of the Doctrine He sounded like the tremor of thunder and his clear words came down like rain The men of the Path who were sitting were startled They repented and all attained arhatship Expound ing the Doctrine to the king there was nothing he did not explain All ministers and officials attained the path of the streamenterer Once the Buddha was in the land of Sravasti There were five hun dred brahmans who were constantly seeking advantage over the Buddha They wanted to defame him but the Buddha knew their thoughts by means of his three penetrating insights He felt pity for them and wanted to save them but their condition had not matured yet and the causal condition was not yet at hand When all their demerits and merits were in the proper condition he natu rally would bring on the causal condition to match up with their demerit and merit These brahmans had previously had some merit and they deserved to be saved their merit had led them on and brought about an appropriate way The five hundred brahmans deliberated among themselves and said We shall make a butcher kill some living creatures and in vite the Buddha and his community of monks The Buddha will most certainly accept the invitation and praise the butcher at which point we shall come forward and deride him  Thereupon the butcher invited the Buddha for them The Buddha immedi ately accepted the invitation and informed the butcher When a fruit is ripe it falls and when merit has matured one is saved While the butcher went back to provide for food the Buddha led his disciples to the village of the butcher to the house of the danapati  The brahmans young and old were all glad Today we shall take advantage of the Buddha If he praises the merit of the danapati we shall use this to deride him be cause before and after he has killed living beings and performed demerit If the Buddha explains the original demerit we shall re buke him for todays merit In either case we shall now have the advantage over the Buddha When the Buddha arrived he sat down passed around the water and put down the food Thereupon the Worldhonored One contemplated the thoughts of the crowd They deserved to be saved So he stuck out his tongue covering his face and licking his ears By committing evil he becomes evil just as sowing the seeds of bitterness  merit They all have their own maturation and they do not mutually cross each other By practicing what is good one obtains good just as sowing something sweet pro duces something sweet After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas the minds of the five hundred brahmans opened up in understanding They immedi ately came forward and did obeisance to the Buddha They fell prostrate folded their hands together and said to the Buddha We were foolish and degraded  The Buddha accepted them and they all became ascetics When the villagers young and old had seen the Buddhas transformation there was none who was not delighted They all attained the Path and were called noble ones without any further reference to a butcher When the meal was over the Buddha returned to his pure abode The World Once there was a brahman king called Toweihsieh The king practiced ninetysix kinds of heresies One day he suddenly had a wholesome thought that he wanted to practice extensive giving As was the rule for brahmans he accumulated the seven precious things mountainhigh and used them for his giving When some one came begging he would allow him to take one handful and leave This went on for several days but the hoard did not de crease The Buddha knew that this king deserved salvation for his previous merit He changed into a brahman and went to his land The king came out to meet him They exchanged greetings and he asked him how he was and said What do you seek I come from afar I would like to beg for some precious jewels and use them to build my dwelling The king said Take a handful and go  The brahman took a handful went seven steps returned and put the handful back in its original place The king asked Why do you not take them The brahman replied That is why I do not take anything The king said Take three handfuls So the brahman took them went seven steps returned again and put them back in their origi nal place When the king asked the brahman why he had acted in this way again he replied  This will do to take a wife But then I will not have any left for the fields servants oxen or horses I calculate that again it will not suffice That is why I ceased to act When the king told him to take seven handfuls the brahman took them went seven steps returned again and put them back The king said What is on your mind now  The brahman answered That is why I do not take anything The king said  Take the whole hoard of precious things The king was utterly surprised and again asked why The brahman answered It would be better to appease ones mind and seek for the unconditioned Path That is why I do not take anything The kings mind opened up and he wished to serve the illuminating teaching Thereupon the brahman manifested the splendid luminous appearance of the Buddha He leaped in the air and spoke the stanzas heaven or even if they were to fill the world it would still be better to experience the Path What is painful appears to be pleasant but the madman is destroyed by this Then when the king saw that the Buddhas splendid appearance illuminated heaven and earth and when he further heard these stanzas he was in raptures of delight and joy The king and his ministers then accepted the five precepts and they attained the path of streamenterer Speaking about the Buddha Once the Buddha was in the region of Magadha underneath the tree of great joy  the most excellent spot of the Path Having subdued Mara by the strength of his virtue he was sitting and reflecting May the drum of the law of immortality be heard in the trichiliocosmos Formerly the king my father sent five men The reward for their merit should be conferred These five men were in the land of Benares When the Tathagata stood up under the tree his majestic demeanor with the primary and secondary marks radiated across heaven and earth and his imposing spirit caused to tremble bringing joy to those who saw it He had parted with his relatives and left his house in search of a teacher applying himself to the Path Looking up to His Revered Excellence he felt a mingling of fright and joy He descended by the side of the road raised his voice and said in praise Your imposing spirit moves people and your dignified demeanor is outstanding What teacher have you served that you have obtained this countenance myself I am thus by myself without receiving instruction from a teacher my resolve I am alone without companion Having completed everything I have become a Buddha and thus have I understood the Noble Path Upon hearing the stanzas Upaka was downhearted for he did not understand So he asked the Worldhonored One Gautama where are you going The Buddha informed the brahman I want to go to the land of Benares to beat the drum of the Doctrine of immortality and to turn its unsurpassed wheel Among the multi tude of sages of the three worlds there has never been anyone who as I will do now has turned the wheel of the Doctrine to lead the people to enter nirvana Upaka was overjoyed Excellent excellent it is when you say so O Buddha As he had not yet reached his teacher he spent the night along the way Late at night his life suddenly ended When the Buddha saw with his eye of the Path that he had died he felt pity for him and said The world of beings is foolish in thinking that life has perma nence Having met the Buddha and departed he has perished alone When the drum of the Doctrine reverberates he alone will not hear it Passing through a number of eons when will he be saved The Buddha in his compassion spoke the stanzas and having crossed the abyss o f the five predestinations a Buddha has arisen illuminating the world in order to do away with all suffering It is difficult ie rare for the world to have a Buddha and it is not easy to hear and grasp the Buddhas Doctrine When the Buddha had spoken these stanzas five hundred gods and men in the sky heard them They were delighted and all attained the path of the streamenterer Save us from this painful heat Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Happiness Once three hundred li southeast of Rajagrha there was a village of mountain people with over five hundred homes They were un yielding as people and difficult to convert to the Path Through their merits in a former world they deserved to be saved and there upon the Worldhonored One transformed himself into an ascetic After he had begged for alms he left the village and sat down under a tree and entered samadhi on nirvana For seven days he did not pant breathe move or turn When the villagers saw this they thought his life had ended They said to one another The ascetic is dead We shall all give him a burial Each took a bundle of firewood for the pyre When the fire was lit and the firewood used up the Buddha rose from his seat and manifested his divine transformation of the Path His light was brilliantly shining and moving in the ten directions After he had manifested the transformation he returned to his seat underneath the tree We were ignorant of why you O supernatural person are free from any illness or grief or why you are not hungry or thirsty or why you did not suffer from heat Thereupon the Worldhonored One smiled with a peaceful complexion and spoke the stanzas everyone has enmity I conduct myself without enmity everyone has illness I conduct myself without illness everyone has sorrow I conduct myself without sorrow Happiness is my food just as for the Shining Gods the fire from a countrywide heap of firewood burn me Then when the five hundred men in the village had heard him expound the stanzas they all became ascetics and attained arhatship All the villagers young and old believed in the Buddha Dharma and Sangha The Buddha quickly went to the Bamboo Grove together with the five hundred men When the sage Ananda had seen that the Buddha had come together with those who had attained the Path he came forward and said to the Buddha What special qualities do these monks have that they make you Worldhonored One personally go to save them The Buddha informed the Reverend Ananda When I had not yet become a Buddha there was in the world apratyekabuddha who usually stayed in these mountains Under a tree not far from a village he wanted to enter parinirvana  The villagers took firewood and set fire to the pyre They gathered his relics put them in a precious urn and buried it on a mountain top They all had an earnest wish which was to obtain the Path later The nirvana of such an ascetic was a joyous event That is why I the Tathagata went to save them When the Buddha had said this countless gods and men all attained the Path Once the Buddha was in a pure abode in Sravastl There were four monks who were sitting under a tree They asked one another What is most sorrowful in the whole world  One said Among the sorrows in the world none surpasses lust One said Among the sorrows in the world none surpasses anger One said Among the sorrows in the world none surpasses hunger and thirst Another said Among the sorrows in the world none sur passes fear Their dispute about the meaning of sorrow went on without end The Buddha knew what they were disputing and went to where they were He asked the monks What are you arguing about They then stood up did obeisance and gave a full explanation of what they were arguing about The Buddha said to the monks Your arguments do not measure up to the meaning of sorrow Among the sorrows in the world none surpasses the possession of a body Hunger and thirst cold and heat anger fear lust and misfortune or enmity all come from the body The body is the source of all sorrows and the origin of calamities It makes ones thoughts weary and brings extreme anxiety Its stress is tenthousandfold Wriggling in the three realms one is mali cious to another When one is attached to a self the birth and death cycle does not cease If one wants to leave worldly suffering one must seek for quietude If one prop erly guards the body and controls his thoughts and is tranquil and without the rise of any vain imaginings one may obtain nir vana This is the utmost pleasure Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke these stanzas tion and minimal wisdom If one seeks what is great through contemplation one obtains the great pleasure what it is to be free from grief I have rightly transcended the three realms and I alone have subdued the Maras After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas he informed the monks Formerly countless ages ago there was a monk with the five superknowledges called Atibalaviryaparakrama In solitude un derneath a tree in the mountains he sought the Path Then there were also four creatures who always maintained their security in his neighborhood The first was a pigeon the second a crow the third a venomous snake and the fourth a deer These four crea tures went looking for food in the daytime and in the evening they returned to spend the night One night the four creatures asked each other What is the most serious cause of sorrow in the world The crow said Hunger and thirst are the most serious Its apprehensions are immeasurable That is why I have left the worldly realm to apply myself to the Path I extinguish my bad thoughts and do away with imaginings I do not covet the four great elements When ones distress has forever ended he will know great peace When the four crea tures heard this their minds opened up The Buddha informed the monks  The monk with the five superknowledges at that time was myself The four creatures then are you four people now In a previous existence you had already heard the meaning of the root of suffering why then did you argue again When the monks heard this they felt ashamed and reproved themselves Immedi ately they attained arhatship in the presence of the Buddha Pleasure Once when the Buddha was in a pure abode in SravastI there were four monks in their first stages of study Drinking wine together during a happy occasion with relatives and playing music song and dance these are utmost pleasures Another said When ones wives are just right their ornamented garments fresh and new when their perfume is fragrant and when they give rein to the passions as one likes this is utmost plea sure  The Buddha knew that the four persons deserved to be saved but that they had thoughts about the six desires without consid ering their own impermanence So he called the four monks and asked them While you were sitting there together under a tree what were you discussing  When the four monks truthfully re lated what they were most happy about the Buddha informed the four What you were discussing is completely in the path of dis tress and great danger It is not the way of enduring peace and utmost pleasure All things flourish in spring but decay in au tumn and winter Ones relatives may mean joy and pleasure but they will all go away Riches carriages and horses become the shares of the five families The beauty of wives rules love and hate When a common man dwells in the worldly realm he gives rise to the misfortune of enmity He endangers himself and exterminates his own family His sorrows are immeasurable The suffering of the three woeful destinations and the eight hardships are enor mous Therefore monks reject the worldly realm and seek for the Path Set your mind on the unconditioned and do not covet splendor Attaining nirvana is utmost pleasure Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Without love  wherewith the distress and wherewith the fear Without any affection wherewith the distress and where with the fear brings fear If one is freed from any covetousness where with the distress and wherewith the fear fulfilled when one is utterly sincere and knows shame and when one approaches the Path in ones personal conduct one is held dear by the crowd thinks what is right and tells it so and when ones mind is free from covetousness one is certain to cross the stream and be delivered The Buddha informed the four monks Once there was a king called Puan He was on friendly terms with the four kings of his neighboring countries He invited these four kings to a feast and for a whole month they wined and dined and amused themselves On the day of parting King Puan asked the four kings Living in the world what do you think is most pleasant One king said Games are most pleasant A happy meeting with relatives and music are most pleasant Another king said When while amassing many riches ones desires are in accord with ones wishes this is most pleasant Another king said Giving reign to ones passions in lust this is most pleasant King Puan said What you are dis cussing sirs is the basis of suffering the origin of distress It would be better to be at rest without any longing or desires and to be dispassion ate and keep ones concentration Obtaining the Path issues forth happiness When the four kings heard this they were delighted and gained pious understanding The Buddha informed the monks King P uan at the time was myself The four kings were the four of you We had this discussion before Therefore I shall not offer any explanation now The birth and death cycle goes on as creepers grow How can one rest at all Then when the four monks had heard these meaningful words again they felt shame and remorse for their error But their minds opened up They extin guished their evil thoughts eradicated their desires and attained arhatship Anger Once the Buddha was on Mount G rdhrakuta in Rajagrha Devadatta and King Ajatasatru were discussing how to destroy the Buddha and his disciples The king ordered his countrymen not to serve the Buddha When the Buddhas community of monks went begging for alms they could not receive any donation The Venerable Sariputra Maudgalyayana Kasyapa and Subhuti and also the nuns such as Mahaprajapatl all led their disciples to another country Only the Buddha and five hundred arhats stayed on Mount Grdhrakuta Devadatta went to King Ajatasatru and consulted with the king  The Buddhas disciples are scattered now but there still are five hundred disciples in the Buddhas presence Please O King invite the Buddha to come to the city tomorrow I shall make five hundred big elephants drunk When the Buddha enters the city I shall provoke the drunken elephants so that they will trample him to death and make an end to his kind I shall be the Buddha instead and convert the world Upon hearing this King Ajatasatru was happy and he immediately went to where the Buddha was He kowtowed and did obeisance and said to the Buddha  Tomorrow I shall arrange for a modest gift I would like humbly to invite you Worldhonored One and your disciples to a meal in my palace The Buddha knew his plan and answered We shall go tomorrow morning The king withdrew and left Upon his return he said to Devadatta The Buddha has accepted my invitation In agreement with our previous plan you must make the elephants drunk Look out and wait for him The next day at mealtime the Buddha and his five hundred arhats entered the gate of the city Five hundred drunken elephants came forward trumpeting They rushed against the walls and knocked down the trees People panicked and the whole city was terrified The five hundred arhats flew up into the air Only the Venerable Ananda stayed by the Buddhas side while the drunk elephants all charged straight toward the Buddha The Buddha merely raised his hand and his five fingers appropriately changed to five lion kings They all roared with the same voice and made heaven and earth tremble The king and his subjects were all overawed The Worldhonored One slowly came forward and arrived at the kings pal ace After he had eaten with his arhats he recited a formula The king said to the Buddha My nature is not bright I believed in calumny and I started doing evil My scheme was not right Please have great mercy and forgive me for my foolishness Thereupon the Worldhonored One informed Ajatasatru and the whole great multitude In the world there are eight things that increase slan der all stemming from fame Furthermore by coveting gain and honors one brings about great sins unending for eons Which eight Gain and loss defamation and fame praise and ridicule suffering and pleasure From olden times to the present one sel dom is free from them Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas When a wise man keeps the precepts he is not ridiculed After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas he again informed the king Once there was a king who liked to eat the meat of wild geese He used to dispatch a hunter to spread his nets and catch geese The hunter presented a goose a day to provide for the kings meal Then there was a goose king who flew down at the head of five hundred geese to seek for food The goose king fell into the net and was caught by the hunter The other geese kept flying about in consternation and did not leave There was a particular goose who kept fluttering about and followed without avoiding bows and arrows It cried in a piteous way spitting blood never ceasing day and night When the hunter saw this righteous behavior he felt compassion He then set the goose king free so that he might go with the others When the flock of geese had reclaimed their king they surrounded him full of joy The hunter then told every thing to the king The king also sensed the righteous act and henceforth stopped catching geese The Buddha informed King Ajatasatru The goose king at that time is myself The particular goose is the worthy Ananda The flock of five hundred geese are the present five hundred arhats The king who ate geese is you now great king The hunter then is Devadatta now Since his former existence he has constantly desired to harm me Because of the power of my great compassion he was saved Disregarding his enmity I have brought about my becoming a Buddha  When the Buddha explained this the king and his ministers were all delighted Defilements Once there was a man without brothers When he was a child his parents loved him dearly They were compassionate and diligent and wanted him to grow up perfect They took him to teachers and urged him to study writing But the child was arrogant and never paid any attention He discarded in the evening what he had received in the morning He did not remember anything Thus it was for several years and he did not know anything His par ents called him back to let him manage the familys affairs But their child was boastful and was not diligent in his endeavors The family consequently became destitute and everything seemed to slip away The son was heedless and did not care to keep any records selling off family possessions He was buoyant and did as he pleased He let his hair become disheveled went barefoot and wore unclean clothes He was stingy and impudent and did not heed shame and disgrace First of all he harbored resentment against his parents and then he reproved his teachers The spirits of my ancestors are unwilling to help me They let me weep even though I am in such dire straits It would be better to serve the Buddha and be able to obtain merit  So he went to where the Buddha was and did obeisance He came forward and said to the Buddha  Buddha your Path is vast and it does not exclude anyone I wish to be your disciple I beg to receive your permission The Buddha informed him Well if you want to seek for the Path you must practice the pure ways You bring common worldly taints if you enter my Path  Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas taint for the household Want of dignity is a taint on appearance Heedlessness is a taint of action In this world and the next evil is always a taint foolishness When the man had heard the stanzas he understood his arro gance and foolishness He accepted the Buddhas instructions and responded with joy Reflecting upon the meaning of the stanzas he repented and reformed He served his parents with filial piety and respected his teachers He studied the path of the scriptures and diligently conducted his affairs as a layman He followed the precepts and kept control of himself Three years later he went back to where the Buddha was He fell prostrate in obeisance and he related in good faith My respect is utterly real and I have made my image complete Rejecting evil and doing what is wholesome I am congratulated by both high and low Welcome his hair fell off and he immediately became an ascetic Inwardly he reflected on tranquility and insight the four truths and the right path As his zeal increased daily he attained arhatship The Righteous Once there was an elder brahman called Satyaka Nirgrantha He had five hundred disciples but he was haughty and proud of himself without any regard for the world He plated his belly with a sheet of iron When someone asked him why he said Because I am afraid my knowledge may overflow When he heard that the Buddha had appeared in the world to convert people to the Path which has illuminated the world far and wide he harbored jealousy and at no time was he at ease He said to his disciples I hear that the ascetic Gautama calls himself a Buddha I shall go now and ask him very profound and subtle questions that will make his heart palpitate and he will not know what to say He immediately went with his disciples to the Jetavana and lined up outside the gate From a distance they saw that the Worldhon ored Ones majestic splendor was as grand as the sun that has just risen Their five feelings were aroused and their joy was mingled with fear They then advanced to the front and did obeisance to the Buddha The Buddha told him to sit After they were seated Nirgrantha asked the Buddha What is said to be a follower of the Path W hat is said to be a learned one W hat is said to be an elder What is said to be a monk What is said to be a sage What is said to be the attainment of the Path What is said to be the maintenance of the precepts If you can explain these to me I wish to become your disciple Thereupon the Worldhonored One contemplated the questions and answered with the following stanzas who behaves with right thoughts and cherishes precious wisdom he is said to be in the Path who is without fear and apprehension and guards what is wholesome is a learned one Although his appearance is mature and his hair white he may just be foolish selfcontrolled and benevolent and whose knowledge and understanding are pure he is an elder flower or is one who jealously covets vain ornaments and whose words differ from his conduct is wise and without hatred he is said to be upright taken the tonsure while he continues to lie covet and desire like a common man extensively calms his thoughts by extinguishing his bad intentions he is said to be an ascetic begging while he continues to aspire for salvation with wrong conduct and seek fame for its own sake practices clean living whose wisdom enables him to destroy evil he is a monk entertaining impure thoughts only externally controlled internal behavior is pure one who is tranquil here and everywhere he is a sage saves not a single being but the whole world doing no harm in the Path he is eloquent He may have little learning but if he personally relies on his conduct according to the Doctrine and if he keeps the Path and does not forget it he is versed in the Doctrine When Satyaka Nirgrantha and his five hundred disciples heard these stanzas of the Buddha they were delighted and their minds opened up They rejected their haughtiness and all became ascetics Nirgrantha alone manifested the mind of a bodhisattva and his five hundred disciples all attained arhatship Practicing the Path Once there was a brahman who had gone forth in his youth to study Until the age of sixty however he was unable to obtain the Path If at sixty one had not attained the Path according to the rules of the brahmans one should then return home take a wife and live at home He had a son who was upright and lovely At the age of seven he exhibited great intelligence in his study He was eloquent and sometimes said things that were beyond peoples grasp Exhausted he fell prostrate on the corpse and when he rose again his relatives admonished him and took him away by force to prepare the corpse for burial outside the city The brahman thought to himself I reckon that my weeping now will not do any good It would be better to go to King Yamaraja and beg for my sons life  Thereupon the brahman cleansed himself fasted and offered flowers and incense Where is the place that King Yamaraja holds his court He kept going for several thousands of li and when he arrived deep in the mountains he saw brahmans who had attained the Path What do you sir seek by asking about the place where King Yamaraja holds his court He answered I want to go to King Yamaraja to beg him for my sons life I want to bring him back to his family and raise him and prepare for my old age The place where King Yamaraja holds his court is not a place a living person can go to We shall show you sir the right direction If you go more than four hundred li westward from here there is a large stream and in it is a city This is a city where divine spirits stay when they are on an inspection round in the world When he arrived by the stream he saw a marvelous city Its palaces and houses were like those of the Trayastrimsa gods The brahman went to the gate burned incense raised his feet and recited incantations wanting to meet King Yamaraja When King Yamaraja gave the order to meet and question him the brahman stated At a late moment in my life I had a son and wanted to prepare for my old age I brought him up for seven years but recently his life ended Please great king be merciful and generous Give me back my childs life King Yamaraja said Your son sir is now disporting in the eastern garden He then went ahead embraced him and wept for him He said While I was thinking of you night and day my meals and sleep were not pleasant Did you ever think of the suffering of your parents The small child was frightened and rebuked him saying I have heard that the ascetic Gautama knows how to transform mans spirit I shall go and ask him Thereupon the brahman returned to where the Buddha was The Buddha then was in the Jetavana of SravastI expounding the Doctrine to his great multitude When the brahman saw the Buddha he kow towed did obeisance and gave a full explanation of the circum stances to the Buddha He is truly my son but he does not want to be called so On the contrary he says that I am a foolish old man Why is it so The Buddha informed the brahman You are really foolish Father and mother wife and child they come together because of certain circumstances just like a guest who rises and departs Bound by foolishness one still reckons them to be ones own One does not recognize them as the basis of ones sorrow and distress Immersed in the cycle of birth and death one does not rest yet Only the wise do not covet affection He is aware of suffering but rejects its cause as such He diligently cultivates the scriptural precepts Since he has done away w ith any imaginings his cycle of birth and death has ended  Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas contemplate the principle of disease death will come all of a sudden just as quickly as swirling waters there be for other relatives Relying on a relative when ones life has ended is like a blind man holding on to a torch the scriptural precepts Diligently practicing to cross the world one may completely remove suffering away the clouds He who has extinguished his imaginings has insight unconditioned nature The wise one receives the right teaching and ends the cycle of birth and death When the brahman heard the stanzas he suddenly understood He knew that life was impermanent and that wife and child are just like transient guests He kowtowed and made an obeisance Upon his wish to become an ascetic the Buddha said Excellent His hair fell off of itself and he donned the robe of the Doctrine He immediately became a monk By reflecting on the meaning of the stanzas he extinguished his craving and did away with any imaginings There on his seat he attained arhatship Miscellaneous Once the Buddha was in Sravasti expounding the Doctrine and making conversions Gods and dragons demons and spirits and the ruler and the people went to listen at three moments The king at this time was called Prasenajit As a man he was arrogant and given to pleasure His eyes were deluded by lust and his ears were confused by sounds His nose was attracted to fragrances his mouth was unrestrained about the five flavors and his body was conditioned to subtle smooth things He became fat unable to ride in a carriage W hether lying down or standing up he was indeed short of breath His breath was obstructed and his breathing interrupted which constantly alarmed him He was groaning whether sitting or standing and constantly suffered from the weight of his own body While his attendants supported him he made inquiries withdrew and sat down his hands folded together Worldhonored One from a great distance I have humbly come to visit you asking your counsel free from any procedure I do not know what my crime is that my body has become so bloated I myself cannot perceive why I have become so  The Buddha informed the great king There are five things that make a person corpulent One frequent meals two fondness for sleep three merriment four absence of grief five uneventfulness These are the five things and being fond of them makes one cor pulent If one does not want to be corpulent one will become lean having diminished ones food not caring for it Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza When the king heard the stanza his joy was immeasurable He immediately called his cook and informed him Accept the recita tion of this stanza At mealtime expound the stanza to me before serving the meal The king took his leave and returned to the palace When the cook offered a meal he forthwith expounded the stanza When the king heard the stanza he was glad and he diminished his meal a spoonful each day As his meals diminished little by little his body consequently became lighter and he eventually became as lean as before When he saw his condition he was happy and remembered the Buddha So he stood up walked to where the Buddha was and did obeisance The Buddha told him to sit down and asked the king Your horses and carriage and your followers are in their usual condition now That is why I have come on foot You know what is best The Buddha informed the great king People in the world are so ignorant about imperma nence They keep desiring all their lives long not thinking about performing merits When someone has died the spirit leaves and the body remains in the grave grows and becomes fatter without any wisdom As one intently covets the body one experiences unending suffering They extinguish bad thoughts and do away with desire When their craving has ended they are free from rebirth When the king had heard the stanzas he was glad and readily understood the meaning He then became intent on starting on the unsurpassed right Path Those who had been listening were countless and they all gained the eye of the Doctrine Hell In the land of SravastI there was once a brahman teacher called Purana Kasyapa He had a following of five hundred disciples No one whether the king or the people failed to wait on him The Buddha had recently attained the Path and arrived in SravastI from Rajagrha with his disciples Thereupon Purana Kasyapa became jealous and wanted to de stroy the Worldhonored One He expected to be respectfully served all alone So he led his disciples to meet with King Prasenajit and made a plea We elders have applied ourselves to the old teachers of the land Yet you  King forsake me and want to serve only him Now I would like to probe the qualities of the Path with the Buddha and to know who will be victorious May you O King serve the winner all your life The king said Very well So the king went to where the Buddha was in his majestic carriage Having greeted him he informed him Purana Kasyapa wants to thoroughly test the power of the Path with you Worldhonored One I wonder if you Worldhonored One would agree The Buddha said After a period of seven days I shall test his transformation The king installed two high seats in a fine place in the wide plain east of the city They were forty chang high and adorned with the seven precious things He made a display of pendant streamers and adjusted the seats The distance between the two seats was two li and the disciples of the two schools sat below them Thereupon Purana Kasyapa and his dis ciples arrived first at his seat and he was about to climb the steps A demon king called Pancika saw Kasyapas vain jealousy and raised a big storm blowing at his high seat His seating turned over and the pendant streamers flew about It rained sand and shingles and their eyes were blinded Meanwhile the high seat of the Worldhonored One was stable and did not move at all the Buddha and his great multitude came in a solemn way and they directed themselves toward the high seat After he had mounted it straightaway the whole community of monks quietly sat down The king and his ministers kowtowed even more respectfully and they informed the Buddha Please confer your divine transformation suppress our wrong views and let the people in the land clearly hold faith in what is right and true Thereupon the Worldhonored One all of a sudden was not visible on his seat Purana Kasyapa knew there was no way out He hung his head down in shame and did not dare lift up his eyes Thereupon the adamantine hero raised his adamantine bolt and fire came from the tip of the bolt He pointed it at Kasyapa  Why do you not show your transformation sir Kasyapa was terrified He abandoned his seat and left his five hundred disciples also removed themselves and scattered The majestic countenance of the Worldhonored One did not delight them in their distress He returned to the Jetavana to the garden of Anathapindada On the other hand the king and his ministers were very happy and withdrew  Purana Kasyapa was ashamed for his disciples When they reached the bank of a river he lied to his disciples When I throw myself into the water now I shall cer tainly be reborn in the brahma heaven If I do not return know that I am happy there His disciples waited for him but he did not return They discussed among themselves Our master has certainly gone to heaven Why should we stay One by one they threw themselves into the water hoping to follow their master Unknowingly led by their wrongdoing they all fell into hell Later when the king heard about the event he was quite startled and felt uncanny He went to where the Buddha was and inquired Why did master Purana Kasyapa and his followers err so The Buddha informed the king  Master Purana Kasyapa and his fol lowers did two serious wrongdoings Because of these two wrongdoings they had to fall into hell They were prompted by their misfortune and threw themselves into the river Their bodies have died and their spirits have departed but the suffering they experience is immeasurable That is why a wise one controls his thoughts Internally he does not engender what is unwholesome and externally evil does not arise When for instance a frontier town is in contact with bandits there is nothing to fear if the defense is solid People inside are safe and the bandits outside cannot come in A wise one guards himself in the same way Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas actions have not been correct who finds fault with good people and who administers the world on the basis of false accusations such a man led on by his own wrongdoing throws himself into a pit both outside and inside just so guard your thoughts What is wrong will not arise If however ones actions are deficient one brings on sorrow causing one to eventually fall into hell After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas he again informed the king A long time ago there were two monkey kings each head ing five hundred monkeys One king became jealous and wanted to kill the other king He schemed to rule all alone and went on the attack He repeatedly failed however and retreated in shame He arrived at the shore of a great sea In a bay there was a heap of foam on the water and as the wind was blowing it was piling up several hundred chang high In his foolishness the monkey king thought it was the Snowy Mountain and he said to his group I have long heard that there is a great Snowy Moun tain in the sea The others wondered why he did not come out They thought he was certainly very happy and jumped in one by one thus depleting the group in drowning The Buddha informed the king The jealous monkey king at that time was the present Purana Kasyapa The group was Purana Kasyapas present five hundred disciples That other monkey king was myself Be cause Purana Kasyapa was involved with jealousy in his earlier existence led on by his wrongdoing he threw himself into a heap of foam bringing an end to his group and depleting his kind He has now slandered me again and they have all jumped into the river The retribution for his evil will make him burn for eons with out any limit When the king heard this he gained pious under standing Similes with the Elephant Once when Rahula had not yet attained the Path his nature was rude and his words untrustful The Buddha ordered Rahula Go to Amrayastika and stay in its pure abode Guard your mouth control your mind and diligently develop the scriptural precepts  Rahula accepted the instructions did obeisance and left He stayed there for ninety days and felt shame and regret He could not rest night or day He rushed forward and greeted the Buddha He arranged a rope bed and adjusted his clvara  The Buddha occu pied the rope bed and told Rahula Take some water with your washing bowl and wash my feet for me Rahula accepted the in struction and washed the Buddhas feet When it was done the Buddha said to Rahula Do you see the water to wash the feet in the washing bowl Rahula said to the Buddha Indeed I see it The Buddha said to Rahula Can one use this water for food and drink to wash the hands or to rinse the mouth Rahula said This water was originally clean but having washed your feet it is defiled now That is why one must not use it again The Buddha said to Rahula  The same applies to you Even though you are my son and the grandson of the king even though you have given up worldly splendor and emoluments to become an ascetic you do not pay attention to strenuous pursuit while controlling your thoughts and guarding your mouth The impurity of the three poisons fills your feelings just like this water which cannot be used again The Buddha fur ther said to Rahula  Throw away the water in the washing bowl  Rahula immediately threw it away and the Buddha said to Rahula Even though the washing bowl is empty may one not fill it again with food and drink He said One must not Because it is known as a washing bowl that has been defiled The Buddha said to Rahula The same applies to you Even though you are an ascetic your mouth is not trustworthy Your disposition is overbearing and you do not pay attention to strenuous pursuit You have a bad reputation just like the washing bowl that must not be filled up with food The Buddha kicked away the washing bowl with his toes and it rolled of its own accord jumping away several times before it stopped The Buddha said to Rahula Would you be careful with this washing bowl afraid it might break Rahula informed the Buddha A basin to wash the feet is something cheap  The Buddha said to Rahula The same applies to you Even though you are an ascetic you do not control your body and mouth Many are injured by your harsh words You are not loved by the multitude and the wise do not cherish you When your body dies and your spirit leaves you will be twisting in the three woeful destinations As you are born and die your suffering will be im measurable not pitied by any Buddha or noble one just as you said not to care for the washing bowl When Rahula heard this he felt shame and fear The Buddha informed Rahula Let me explain it with a simile Once a king had a huge elephant who was fierce and keen in battle His strength was superior to that of any of the five hundred smaller elephants That king raised an army and wanted to attack an opposing country He dressed up the elephant with iron armor and assigned an elephant master to control it He tied a couple of halberds to the two teeth of the elephant He also attached two doubleedged swords to his two ears and tied curved swords to the four legs of the elephant The elephant just hid his trunk guarding it and did not use it to fight The elephant master was glad knowing that the elephant was protecting his life An elephants trunk is soft and if it is hit by an arrow the elephant will die When the elephant had been fighting for a long time however he would thrust his trunk looking for a sword The elephant master did not like it because he thought that this fierce elephant did not have any regard for his own life Thrusting his trunk looking for a sword he wanted to hold it with the tip of his trunk The king and his ministers were concerned about this huge elephant and they decided not to let him fight again  The Buddha informed Rahula Men commit nine evils but they merely have to guard their mouth just as this huge elephant guarded its trunk and did not fight Why so He was afraid to be hit by an arrow and die That is why man likewise guards his mouth He must fear the three woeful destinations and the suffering in hell If he commits all ten evils and does not guard his mouth he might lose his life like this huge elephant who thrust its trunk in a fight not counting on being hit by an arrow The same applies to man when all ten evils are committed and he does not reflect on the three woeful destinations and the suffering of the poisons If how ever he performs the ten wholesome actions controls his body mouth and mind and commits no evil he may obtain the Path and be free from the three destinations and the calamity of repeat ing the cycle of birth and death Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas With trustworthiness I shall save people without moral precepts mounted by a king A wellregulated person is most respected and is bestowed trust When Rahula heard the earnest admonitions of the Buddha he was moved and encouraged He remembered them and did not forget He was full of zeal but mild and his forbearance was like the earth His imaginings quieted down and he attained the path of the arhat Once the Buddha was in the pure abode of the Jetavana in the land of Sravasti proclaiming the great Doctrine to the disciples of the four divisions to gods dragons and spirits and to the ruler and his subjects At that time there was an elder layman called Hotitan  He came to where the Buddha was did obeisance to the Buddha withdrew and sat aside He folded his hands knelt deeply and said to the Worldhonored One I have long been receiving your great teaching looking up to you and serving you but under the pressure of personal matters I have been incapable Please be merciful The Worldhonored One had him take a seat and asked him where he had come from and his name He knelt deeply and answered My name is Hastidamaka and at the time of the former king I was the kings elephant tamer The Buddha asked the lay man how many principles are necessary in taming elephants and he replied I always tame a big elephant by using three things Which three One a firm hook I hold its mouth with it and place the reins Two by diminishing its food I always let it grow lean Three I lash it with a rod making it feel pain With these three things I can tame it w ell The Buddha further asked That is the right way to tame it If you have subdued it what can you use it for He replied If it is subdued it may be mounted by a king and one may let it fight Is there just this method  To tame an elephant there is just this way The Buddha informed the lay disciple You can only tame an elephant You must further be able to tame yourself  So he said I wonder what taming oneself may mean Please Worldhonored One teach me what has not yet been made known The Buddha informed the lay disciple I also have three things by which I subdue everyone and by means of subduing oneself one gains access to the realm of the unconditioned One control ones verbal actions in utmost sin cerity Two suppress ones corporeal vigor through pure compas sion Three extinguish ones cover of mental foolishness through wisdom With these three things one may be delivered from every thing be free from the three woeful destinations realize the un conditioned and not experience any sorrow or suffering caused by the cycle of birth and death Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas and hard to restrain It may be reined in and not given food but it is still a very wild elephant I have completely rejected its fetters and regulated it like an elephant restrained by a hook and if one can always guard his thoughts one may pull himself out of corporeal suffering just like an elephant leaving a pitfall When the lay disciple heard the stanzas his joy was immeasur able He understood deep inside and immediately attained the eye of the Doctrine Those who were listening were countless and they all attained the Path Craving Once the Buddha was in the land of Rajagrha in a pure abode on Mount Grdhrakuta expounding the great Doctrine for gods and men and for dragons and spirits Then there was a man who had left his family his wife and child and who came to where the Buddha was He did obeisance to the Buddha and asked to be an ascetic The Buddha immediately accepted him as an ascetic He instructed him to sit underneath a tree and reflect on the qualities of the Path Having received his instructions the monk went deep into the mountains more than a hundred li from the pure abode He sat alone among the trees and reflected on the Path for three years but his thoughts were not firm and he wanted to return He thought that to leave his family in search of the Path was difficult and it would be better to return quickly to see his wife and child After he thought thus he rose and left the mountains With his noble penetrating insight the Buddha saw that this monk deserved to obtain the Path that he was returning because of his foolishness With his supernatural power the Buddha trans formed himself into an ascetic He went in the opposite direction and they met along the way  This place is flat Let us sit down and talk There upon the two men sat down and talked at ease We shall readily enjoy ourselves and later make plans again All of a sudden there appeared an old monkey who had left the forest He was in a place without any trees and living there The transformed ascetic asked the monk Why is this monkey all alone on the plains There are no trees How does he enjoy him self The monk replied to the transformed person I have been seeing this monkey for a long time He has come to live here for two reasons Which two One because of his wife and child and many relatives he could not obtain sufficient food and drink but it was his joy to give full rein to his mouth Two night and day he constantly went up and down the trees so that the soles of his feet were worn down and he could not find any rest For these two reasons he left the trees to come and live here At the moment the two men were talking they again saw the monkey going away and returning to the trees The transformed ascetic said to the monk Did you see the monkey go back to the trees He answered I have This animal is foolish He left the trees but then enters them again while his group remains restive and he is not wearied with the trouble The trans formed man said The same applies to you sir What is the difference this monkey For two reasons you sir have come and entered these mountains Which two because your wife and dwelling were a prison Two because your child and relatives were shackles That is why you sir have come in search of the Path to end the suffering attendant on birth and death Now you want to return to your family to renew your shack les and reenter the prison Love and affection lead straight to hell The transformed ascetic  chang tall then showed his primary and secondary marks His golden light shining everywhere he moved the whole mountain Flying birds and running animals came looking for the light They all recognized their former lives and deeply repented their misdeeds Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas although it is cut down it will still grow again If ones craving mind is not completely done away with one will soon experience suffering again delivered hastens back to the trees such acts are repeated by people Having left their prison they reenter it accompanied by arrogance When ones imaginings are set on desire one is covered and does not see anything craving acts like a creeper one can eradicate the root of the intentions only by perceiving them distinctly through wisdom When the monk saw the brightness of the Buddhas light and heard the words of the stanzas he was struck with fear He fell prostrate in obeisance confessed his sin and apologized for his misdeed Internally he immediately removed himself counted his breath and as a result of his tranquility and insight attained arhatship in front of the Buddha All the gods had come to listen and they were all glad They scattered flowers and worshiped and their praises were immeasurable Chapter XXXII Once when the Buddha was in the land of SravastI expounding the Doctrine to gods and men there was a brahman elder in the city whose wealth was immeasurable He was stingy and not fond of giving He used to close the gate during meals and did not like to have guests W hen it was m ealtim e he would order his gatekeeper to close the doors firmly and not let anyone enter the gate unless he had a good reason The elder would immediately think of nice food and order his wife to prepare food and drink He instructed her to kill a plump chicken blend it with ginger and pepper and broil it An arrange ment of dishes was made on the spot and he ordered that the outside gate be closed Husband and wife both sat down and their small child was placed in the middle In this way they drank and ate together The parents took the chicken meat and fed the child They did this a number of times and did not abandon the practice The Buddha knew that this elders former merit should save him and so he transformed himself into an ascetic Watching while they sat down eating he appeared in front of their seats He uttered incantations and further mentioned that with some giving one could obtain great merit When the elder raised his head and saw the transformed ascetic he immediately scolded him saying You may be a man of the Path but you are shameless Why do you give offense while I sit eating with my household The ascetic answered You sir are foolish Why would I be ashamed The elder asked I and my household we are enjoying ourselves Why would I be ashamed The ascetic replied You have killed your father and married your mother and you worship your enemy not knowing any shame person does not consider them to be a prison When a fool sees the adornments of wife and child his mind is firmly attached to them difficult to leave When the elder heard these stanzas he was startled and asked earnestly Man of the Path why do you expound these words The man of the Path answered The chicken on your table was your father in a previous existence Because of his stinginess he was constantly reborn among chickens to be eaten by you sir This small child was a flesheating devil  and you sir were a trader Your father had boarded a ship and gone to sea A sudden current shipwrecked him in the land of the raksasas and he was eaten by a raksasa And so when his life ended after five hundred existences the raksasa came to be your son sir Because your re maining evil is not over yet he came with the intention to harm you Your present wife was your mother in a previous existence sir Because her love was so strong she now is your wife still You are foolish now and you do not know your previous lives You killed your father and fed your enemy and you have taken your mother as your wife The wheel of birth and death in the five destinations turns without end Going round in the five destinations who can know Only a man of the Path sees this world and observes the other A fool does not know How would he not be ashamed The Buddha manifested his awesome supernatural power and revealed to him his former lives When the elder saw the Buddha he immediately recognized his former lives He subse quently repented apologized to the Buddha and accepted the five precepts The Buddha expounded the Doctrine to him and he im mediately became a streamenterer Once the Buddha was in the Jetavana in Sravasti expounding the Doctrine There was a young monk then who had gone to the city on his alms round He saw a young woman whose beauty was beyond compare His thoughts kept longing for her Bound by de lusion he could not free himself When the men of the Path who were his fellows in study went to ask him what was ailing him the young monk ex plained all that was on his mind I want to do away with my thoughts of the Path and follow my craving but my wish is not fulfilled I am sick with grief His fellow students reproved him but it did not enter his ears So they forced him and helped him to go to where the Buddha was They reported the whole matter to the Worldhonored One The Buddha informed the young monk Your wish is easy to obtain It is not worth any grief I shall expe diently solve this for you Stand up and eat and drink When the monk heard this he gained confidence and was glad and his sad ness was immediately over Then the Worldhonored One led this monk and his great multitude to the city of Sravasti to the home of the beautiful woman The woman had died and they had laid her corpse out for three days Her household was in mourning and could not stand to bury her Her body was putrid and swollen with impurities flowing out The Buddha informed the monk  The beautiful woman you were longing for is now like this Everything is impermanent Change comes within a breath worm weaving a cocoon The wise one is able to give it up Without ogling he removes all suffering craving mind increases and he consequently builds his own prison always thinks that desire is impure and he consequently leaves his evil prison He can do away with the calamities of old age and death Thereupon when the young monk saw that this woman had been dead for three days that her countenance was swollen and rot ting and that the stench was hard to approach and when he fur ther heard the stanzas with the W orldhonored Ones pure instructions he was sorry and his mind opened up He knew he had been wrong He did obeisance to the Buddha kowtowed and repented his error He took refuge in the Buddha and was led back to the Jetavana Throughout his life he was full of zeal and he attained arhatship When the countless people in the crowd under stood that the desire for beauty was impure their belief in the nature of impermanence was confirmed Their coveting minds ceased and they attained the Path Once the Buddha was in a pure abode of Sravasti expounding the Doctrine to gods people and dragons There was an elder there whose wealth was immeasurable He had a son twelve or thirteen years of age When his parents died he was young and did not know about livelihood and how to manage the affairs of the family He wasted the riches and within a few years they were gone He went begging some time after but he still could not provide for himself His father had a relative an elder whose great riches were immeasurable One day the elder met him and he asked him about his circumstances The elder took pity on him took him back with him and regulated everything He gave him his daughter in marriage and provided him with servants carriages and horses But as a man he was lazy He did not keep any accounts and could not provide for their livelihood Squandering and depleting his wealth they were more distressed by hunger every day Because of his daughter the elder gave him more riches but he squandered them as before They consequently became destitute The elder frequently gave him money but he used it recklessly Thinking that he could not get any result he wanted to take the wife away and marry her to another While he was talking it over with his kindred the daughter overheard them and went back to tell her husband My family is powerful and can take me away from you because you cannot provide a living What will you do What plan will you make When he heard his wifes words he felt shame and thought to himself Yes my merit is meager and I am full of mistakes I am not versed in the ways o f a family livelihood or of making a living I am going to lose my wife now and I shall be begging just as before After love one becomes covetous How shall I cope with it He reflected and reflected and then he had an evil idea He led his wife into their chamber and said I now want to die with you in the same place He stabbed his wife on the spot and then stabbed himself Both were dead The slaves panicked and ran to inform their elder The elder and the young and old were alarmed and when they came to have a look they confirmed that they were dead A funeral was held with their coffins and shrouds as was the established custom in the land They kept thinking about the woman and did not leave A while later the elder heard that the Buddha was in the world converting and expounding the Doctrine and that those who saw him were very glad as they forgot their sorrow and did away with their distress He thus led the family young and old to where the Buddha was They did obeisance to the Buddha withdrew and sat aside The Buddha asked the elder where he came from Why are you so sad and unhappy The elder said My house is unfortunate I gave my only daughter in marriage but she happened to meet a foolish husband who could not provide for a livelihood When I wanted to take away his wife he killed his wife and himself On our way back we come to visit you Worldhonored One The Buddha informed the elder The poison of covetous ness destroys the self and ones family It even harms all beings a fortiori man and wife  Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas does not seek to cross to the other shore He longs for riches hurting others and himself too and delusion are the seeds Therefore when one gives to him who has passed beyond worldly things the merits obtained are immeasurable merchant is frightened and afraid Exploiting his emotions bandits will harm his life That is why the wise do not covet anything Then when the elder heard the Buddhas exposition of the stanzas he was delighted and happy He forgot his sorrow and removed his distress Still in their seats young and old and all who were listen ing destroyed their two million evil misdeeds and attained the path of the streamenterer Once the Buddha was in a pure abode in Sravasti expounding the Doctrine to gods dragons spirits and the ruler and his subjects Do give us your permission The Buddha accepted them and they then became ascetics The Buddha ordered them to stay together in one room While the two were staying together they just thought of worldly desires and pleasures Again and again they sighed for sensuous appearances Talking about their seductive exploits they were totally attached to them and did not forsake them Their fondness did not cease With his eye of wisdom the Buddha knew that their thoughts were disturbed and that their minds were rampant with desire They were unable to settle down their thoughts and thus they could not be saved The Buddha made one of them go away and transformed himself into that man He en tered the room and asked The ideas we have in mind do not go away We might both go and have a look The Buddha magically created a prostitute in the village They both entered her dwelling and said to her We men of the Path have received the Buddhas prohibitory precept not to perform any sexual act It is our intention to have a look at a womans personal beauty necessarily just five desires If one can swiftly destroy the five desires he is a brave one After the Buddha had spoken the stanzas he manifested his bril liant appearance When the monk saw this he was ashamed and repented of his wrongdoing He fell prostrate and did obeisance to the Buddha who again expounded the Doctrine to him He was glad and gained understanding and he attained arhatship When the other man returned he saw that his companions expression was happier than usual So he asked his companion why he was like that The companion then gave an explanation according to the facts The Buddhas great compassion had caused the rescue Having received the Worldhonored Ones mercy he had been able to escape from every suffering Thereupon the monk further spoke the stanza wanders not giving any thought to curbing it one will then long for her foul exposure on seeing a woman When ones imaginings are extinguished one is free from sorrow When his companion the monk heard this stanza he immedi ately started reflecting He did away with his desire extinguished his imaginings and attained the eye of the Doctrine Nurturing by Gain Once the Buddha led his disciples to the pure abode of Ghosila in the land of Kausambi and expounded the Doctrine to gods men spirits and dragons The king was called Udayana He had a wife who practiced benevolence and was famous for her purity He val ued her principles and respected her privately When he heard that the Buddha had come to make conversions he made prepara tions for both to go to where the Buddha was They did obeisance to the Buddha withdrew and sat down according to their regular rank The Buddha explained to the king his wife and the ladies in waiting the nature of the following impermanence suffering the void why man is reborn that what comes together must sepa rate that meeting with enmity is painful that one is reborn in heaven because of ones merits and that one enters the abyss be cause of ones evil The king and his wife were happy and gained pious understanding Each accepted the five precepts and became a man and wife with pure faith They saluted the Buddha and withdrew returning to the palace There once was a brahman called Magandika who had a most lovely daughter unequaled in the society When she was sixteen years old no one could find fault with her He offered a reward of a thousand taels over a period of ninety days to find that she was not an upright woman the money would be given away but no one complied As she attained womanhood she should find someone to marry He pondered on the possible person If there is anyone who is as upright as my daughter I shall give him my daughter I have heard about the monk Gautama of the Sakya clan His appearance is golden and rare in the world Your daughters beauty sir is considered good by her family but my beauty is considered good by the Buddhas My good appearance and beauty are in principle not the same She is like a painted vase filled with excrement What is particularly fine about that Her beauty is local attached to the great villains of her eyes ears nose mouth and body The beauty of an outward appearance is a great per sonal calamity It destroys ones house and extinguishes ones family It kills relatives and harms children I stand alone all by myself Although I am afraid of real danger how much less would I accept your disastrous and villainous offspring Go away sir I do not accept her  Thereupon the brahman became angry and left He went to King Udayana praised the attractiveness of his daughter and told the king By her looks this daughter should be your con cubine Because she is of age I present her to you now O king When the king saw her he was happy and immediately accepted her She respectfully agreed to be his second subordinate wife He conferred his official seal gold and silver and precious things on Magandika who respectfully agreed to be his councilor When this woman obtained her rank she was always jealous and her witch craft misled the king She spoke ill of the first wife and not just once But the king put her to shame saying You allure me but your words are insolent The deportment of that person ie the first wife is honorable and yet you speak ill of her The thoughts of this woman were malicious as she still wanted to harm her She kept on speaking ill and the king was somewhat perplexed His first wife kept her fast and she alone did not comply with the order He repeated it and called her three more times but she kept her fast and did not move The king was in a great rage and sent someone to drag her out He had her tied up in front of his palace and prepared to shoot her dead But his wife was not afraid as she wholeheartedly took refuge in the Buddha The king himself shot at her but the arrow returned to him Another shot and it returned at once And so it was with several more arrows The king had great fear by then Untying her he asked What artifice do you have that you bring this about His wife replied How well said He immediately sent Magandika away and the second wife was returned to her parents He correctly established his first wife in the palace The king his first wife the women of the palace and the crown prince made preparations to leave and along with their ministers they all went to where the Buddha was They did obeisance withdrew sat down and listened to the Doctrine with their hands folded The king then gave the Buddha a complete explanation of the event according to the facts The Buddha said to the great king A bewitching woman has eightyfour attitudes but there are eight main attitudes detested by the wise Namely which eight One jealousy two false anger three insulting four imprecation five repugnancy six greediness seven fondness for embellishment eight a poison ous mouth These are the eight main attitudes The Buddha informed the great king The demerit and the merit performed by man has each its own real nature The retribution reflected in each experience is tenthousandfold never equal If one practices the six qualities and keeps the fast the merits are numerous Praised by the Buddhas one will finally be reborn in the brahma heaven and the happiness based on merit will come naturally When the Buddha said this the king his wife the ladies in waiting and great ministers all opened up their minds and obtained the Path The Ascetic Once the Buddha was in a pure abode in Sravasti expounding the Doctrine to gods dragons spirits the king and his subjects Then there was a young monk At daybreak he donned his robe and with staff and bowl in hand he went to a large village on his alms round By the side of the main road there was a vegetable garden cultivated by an official At the edge of the garden he planted millet In the outer grassy area of the garden he had installed a net to discharge arrows If an animal or thief were to disturb it an arrow would be discharged upon touching the net killing the intruder A beautiful young girl guarded this garden alone If someone wanted to go in she called out from afar and showed the way to safely enter Someone who did not know the way was sure to be killed by a discharged arrow However while this girl was on guard all by herself she sang melancholy songs Her voice was clear and bewitching Of those who heard it there was none who did not halt his chariot or horse They turned around and mincing their steps they wanted to hurry to her but they lingered about and did not go further The Buddha saw with his three penetrating insights that if this monk went a little further he would be killed by an arrow Through his merit he deserved to obtain the Path although he was misled by foolishness and over whelmed by the screen of desire The Buddha had pity on his fool ishness and wanted to save him He changed himself into someone clad in white and went to his side thoughts and drive away desire If one does not sever desire a thought will accordingly run its course When one has renounced home but is indolent the m in d is still tainted suspend it If conduct is not clean or pure how could it bring about the great treasures tree withered by the wind A person is of his own making Why not be zealous Having spoken these stanzas he returned to his own appearance His primary and secondary marks were evident and his light illu minated heaven and earth Anyone who saw it had his delusion cleared away and his confusion ended They were all back in their element When the monk saw the Buddha his mind suddenly opened up as when observing a light in darkness He immedi ately fell prostrate and did obeisance to the Buddha He kowtowed repented his wrongdoing confessed and apologized to the Buddha When he had deeply understood tranquility and insight he at tained arhatship and followed the Buddha back to the pure abode The countless who heard this all attained the eye of the Doctrine The Brahm an Once in the land of Ssuhotieh there were big mountains called Ssuhsiucheto In the mountains there were more than five hun dred brahmans who excelled in the superknowledges They said to each other What we have attained is exactly nirvana Mean while the Buddha had just appeared in the world to establish the Doctrine to open up the gate of immortality The brahmans heard about it but they did not go to meet him They deserved to be saved however because of their previous merits The Buddha went to them alone without a companion At the entrance of the road he sat down under a tree As his mind concentrated in meditation C samadhi light emitted from his body and illuminated the whole mountain The whole mountain was ablaze as if it were on fire They recited incantations over water and tried to extinguish it They exhausted their divine pow ers and were unable to extinguish it They felt strange and gave up and then left the mountains following the road In the distance they saw the Worldhonored One meditating under a tree as if the sun had risen at the edge of the golden mountains They wondered what kind of spirit he was They approached him and gazed at him The Buddha bade them sit down and asked them where they came from The brahmans replied We are stay ing in these mountains and we have long been practicing the Path but at dawn a fire suddenly started burning the trees in the moun tains We were frightened and left The Buddha informed the brahmans  This is the fire of merit It does not harm anyone It wants to extinguish your impurity the fetter of delusion The brahmans masters and followers turned their heads and said to each other Among the ninetysix kinds there never was this master They said  We have heard that the son o f King Suddhodana called Siddhartha was not happy with his majestic position and that he has gone forth in search of Buddhahood Might he not be the one The disciples asked the masters to question the Buddha on whether the practices of the brahmans were correct or not The masters and the followers all rose and said to the Buddha  The scriptural doctrine of brahmans called the four nonobstructions including astronomy geography regnal rule rules which govern the people and the ninetysix kinds of magical arts are the rules that should be practiced Are these scriptural texts the way to nirvana Please O Buddha explain and disclose what we have not yet heard The Buddha informed the brahmans Listen well and think about it Countless eons of previous lives I have constantly been practicing these scriptures Having attained the five superknowledges too moving mountains and stopping currents I still passed through countless cycles of birth and death I neither attained nirvana nor did I hear of someone who had attained the Path Such practices as yours cannot be those of brahmans  Thereupon the Worldhonored One sighed and spoke the stanzas Brahma and knows that the formations have ended I call him a brahman he is pure and has crossed the abyss and his fetters of desire are undone I call him a brahman When one sincerely practices in accord with the Doctrine he is pure and wise for what purpose is a simple coarse garment When inwardly one is not free from attachment what is the gain in ones outward rejection and all evil like a snake casting off its skin I call him a brahman utter harsh words and is mindful of the eightfold path I call him a brahman not fall into a gathering of gods and does not revert back to any gathering I call him a brahman lives where one has come from time and again when ones cycles of birth and death have ended when one understands the profundity of the Path and one is as wise as the one who is silent  I call him a brahman A fter the Buddha had spoken the stanzas he inform ed the brahmans As for what you have practiced you think that you have already attained nirvana Just like fish in shallow water how could you have lasting happiness It is actually missing in your lives When the brahmans heard his teaching an inner joy arose in their five feelings They knelt deeply and said to the Buddha that they wished to be his disciples Their hair fell off naturally and they immediately became ascetics Because they had previously conducted themselves in purity they attained the Path and became arhats The gods dragons and spirits of the mountains all attained the Path Nirvana Once the Buddha was on Mount Grdhrakuta near the city of Rajagrha together with one thousand two hundred fifty monks Should we rather raise troops to attack them In the land there was a wise lord the prime minister called Varsakara who replied Yes indeed The king said to Varsakara  The Buddha is not far from here With his three insights of a noble sage there is nothing he does not see clearly When he ar rived he did obeisance to the Buddha his head touching the ground The Buddha bade him sit down and he took a seat The Buddha asked the prime minister where he came from and the minister replied  The king sends m e He kowtowed at the Buddhas feet and asked how he was whether he was taking his meals as usual The Buddha then asked the lord Are the king the people and the subjects of his land all in peace The minister said that the sovereign of the land and the people were all receiv ing the Buddhas grace He informed the Buddha The king feels dislike toward the country of Vrji and wants to attack it Can he according to your noble opinion  Buddha gain a victory The Buddha informed the minister If the people of the country of Vrji are carrying out seven rules one cannot have victory over them The king must think carefully He must not initiate any thing recklessly The minister then asked the Buddha what the seven rules were The Buddha said The people of Vrji frequently gather together to discuss the right Doctrine While developing merit they guard themselves and take this to be their norm This is namely the first  The people of the country of Vrji the ruler and his ministers are in constant harmony They are very loyal in their duties Whether instructing or carrying out their duties they do not offend anyone This is namely the second  The people of Vrji are involved in observing the Law There is nothing they do not attend to and they also do not dare commit any violation Superior and inferior comply with the rules This is namely the third  The people of Vrji are courteous and re spectful Men and women are separate but the old and young are together They do not commit any breach of the rules of proper deportment This is namely the fourth  The people of Vrji piously care for their parents and are obedient to their elders They receive instructions on the acceptance of the precepts and con sider this to be a national rule This is namely the fifth  They venerate the gods of the soil and grain They respectfully comply with the four seasons and do not neglect farming This is namely the sixth  The people of the country of Vrji honor the Path and respect virtue When someone has come from afar they worship him and provide clothing bedding and medicine This is namely the seventh  Now when the lord of a country acts according to these seven rules he cannot easily be endangered Even if all the people in the world went to attack him they could not gain a victory The Buddha informed the minister If the people of Vrji were to observe even a single rule one still must not attack them How much less when they observe all seven such rules Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanza one wins one shall suffer further yet When Prime Minister Varsakara heard the stanza expounded by the Buddha he immediately attained the Path Young and old at the meeting all attained the path of the streamenterer The minister then rose from his seat and said to the Buddha  The affairs of the state are very troublesome I wish to return Please excuse me The Buddha said You may but keep this event in mind He then rose from his seat did obeisance to the Buddha and left Upon his return he reported everything to the king who then gave up his attack He upheld the Buddhas majestic teaching and thereby transformed his nation The people of Vrji then came and obeyed his orders Superiors and inferiors were respectful to one another and the land consequently prospered The Birth and Death Cycle Once the Buddha was in the pure abode of the Jetavana in the land of Sravasti widely expounding the wondrous Doctrine to gods and men and to the king and his high officials There was an elderly brahman who was dwelling along the road and his wealth was immeasurable He had a son who was twenty years of age and who had recently married not yet fully seven days Husband and wife respected each other and their words were in harmony The wife said to her husband He fell to the ground was injured badly and died The whole family young and old was in a frenzy as they ran to where the son was Calling out to heaven they mourned but then stopped and came to their senses again Kinsmen far and near came in countless numbers and they were all very grieved Thereupon the Worldhonored One was saddened by their foolishness He went to ask how they were When the household of the elder young and old saw the Buddha they were moved and did obeisance They stated their hardship in detail Everything is impermanent and can not possibly remain long Having come into existence one will die and evil and merit will follow As for this son in three places one weeps for him The distress may cease but still it is hard to over come Whose son is it after all Having received a form life moves like lightning flowing night and day and difficult to halt If life expires it will be reborn but evil and merit are not lost but delusion remains longer as a result of desire One creates and experiences ones own suffering and happiness Although the body dies the spirit does not perish When the elder heard the stanzas he understood their meaning and forgot his sorrow He knelt deeply and said to the Buddha What evil did this son commit in his previous life that he met an untimely death in his wonderful life Please explain the misdeed he committed previously The Buddha informed the elder Well in the past there was a young child who played with bow and arrows among the divine trees Nearby there were three other people When they saw a sparrow high on a tree the young child wanted to shoot it down The three people urged him on If you can hit the sparrow people will praise you as a hero The young child thought it was fine He drew his bow and shot the sparrow which died instantly falling to the ground They passed through the cycle of birth and death for countless eons They encountered each other wherever they existed and all met and experienced their evil One of the three people had merit however and he is now in heaven One is reborn in the sea and has transformed there into a dragon king This young child was previously reborn in heaven and was the son of a god When his life ended he descended and was reborn as your son  elder He fell from the tree and when his life ended he was immediately reborn in the sea as the son of the transformed dragon king On the very day of his rebirth a transformed bird king with golden wings took him and ate him up Now two are distressed and weep in three places I would say Because they joined him in their merriment the retribution of these three is to weep Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas Just as a seed accords with its former appearance  retribution natu rally follows ones shadow When the Buddha had spoken the stanzas he wanted to open up the mind of the elder So he manifested his previous life with his power of the Path fully showing the events in heaven and among the dragons The elders mind opened up and he rose with joy He knelt deeply folded his hands and said to the Buddha I and the young and old wish to be your disciples O Buddha dedicating ourselves to the five precepts and becoming upasakas The Buddha then conferred the precepts and once again expounded the Doctrine and the meaning of impermanence to them The Advantage of the Path Once there was a king who ruled according to the right Doctrine and the people longed for a change But he had no heir apparent and this was sad When the Buddha came to his country he went out to visit the Honored One Listening to the scriptures he was glad and he immediately accepted the five precepts He observed them respectfully with all his heart but his only wish was to have a son Night and day he was zealous not lax during the three moments He had a servant who was eleven years old and who constantly served him The servant was faithful trustful served the Law and did not lose the dignity of his demeanor He was humble forbearing and zealous With all his heart he applied him self to the recitation of scriptural stanzas All of a sudden he fell seriously ill and it resulted in his death but his spirit returned and became the kings son He was reared to adult hood and at fifteen years of age he was established as the heir apparent When the life of the king his father had ended by way of inheritance he became the king He was arrogant and licen tious lewd and lustful Night and day he was indolent and he did not manage the affairs of the land His officers of state gave up the court and the people suffered from calamity The Buddha knew that this behavior was not in agreement with his office and so he led his disciples to that country When the king heard about the Buddhas arrival he did exactly as the late king He welcomed him with a large crowd kowtowed to the ground withdrew and sat on the kings seat The Buddha said to the king  The officers the people the officials and ministers are they all their usual selves The king said In this land there is no one else The Buddha said to the king  Do you know now O king where you actually came from or what merit you have performed to obtain this royal posi tion The king said I wonder In my ignorance I do not under stand I do not know where I came from in the previous world The Buddha said to the great king Actually one becomes a king through five things Which are the five One through giving one becomes a king all people offer with reverence palaces and halls and ones wealth is without limit Two constructing temples and worshiping the Buddha Dharma and Sangha with bedding and decorative hangings through this one becomes king Three personally revering the Honorable Things and all venerables through this one becomes a king All people do obeisance to him Four forbearance of the three of the body and the four of the mouth and seeing that the mind is without its three evils through these one becomes a king All who see this are glad Five in learning one always strives for wisdom Through this one becomes a king When making decisions about the affairs of the land all respectfully apply them When one practices these five things one will be a king in every existence Then the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas ruler his father his teacher and men of the Path when he is trustful moral charitable learned and wise he will finally be lucky and peaceful in his rebirth When one brings peace to the world with the Path and serves the Doctrine all will follow him thinking is clear his merit gradually increases As for merits recompense it does not matter whether one is revered or despised The Buddha said to the king At the time of your previous exist ence O King you were a servant of the great king You faithfully served the Buddha and the Doctrine with purity You served the Sangha with respect your relatives with piety and your lord with loyalty It was thus that your merit followed you and you became the kings son complementing the kings splendor Now you are honorable but you are on the other hand indolent If you are a king you must practice the five things What are the five things One guiding all people without being condescending or abusive Two training the officers and receiving and giving in timely fash ion Three mindfulness to the development of ones actions while the merits do not cease Four trust in the right admonitions of loyal ministers and do not accept slandering words that will harm those in the right Five do not allow the mind to be negligent covetous and desirous for affection If one practices these five things ones fame will extend to the four seas and prosperity will come naturally If one forsakes these five things no principle will work When people are in straits their thinking is confused When officers are weary their authority does not function When loyal ministers do not dare to ad monish and their thoughts are heedless the land is not managed In such condi tions you will lose your good name and later you will have no m erit Thereupon the Worldhonored One further spoke the stanzas and refrains from wrong and one controls his thoughts and overcomes all evil such a one is a righteous king kindness and one is compassionate and likes to benefit others benefiting them with impartiality all feel close to such a one When the Buddha had said this the king was very glad He rose and stood in front of the Buddha He fell prostrate in obeisance confessed and apologized to the Buddha He immediately accepted the five precepts Once the Buddha was in the land of SravastI in the pure abode of the Jetavana expounding the unsurpassed great Doctrine to gods and men to the king high officials and the four classes of dis ciples In the south of the land of SravastI there were deep moun tains A wild elephant often appeared there which had three colors white blue and black The king wanted to have a famous great fighting elephant So he dispatched someone to catch it and bring it back to be tamed by an elephant master Within three years the elephant could be mounted and ordered into battle At that time there also was a divine elephant brought forth by a dragon Its body was as white as snow and its tail as red as cinnabar The two tusks looked like they were gold colored When the hunter saw this exceptionally fine elephant he returned to inform the king that there was another big elephant of such an appearance and fit to be ridden by a great king The king immediately called more than thirty elephant catchers and ordered them to catch this elephant They all went to where the elephant was and set a snare to catch it but the divine elephant knew what was on their minds So it immediately came forward as if to fall into their trap When they all came and wanted to catch it the elephant became angry and rashly kicked and jumped at them Those nearby were killed and those further away fled but the elephant did not give up its pursuit On the flanks of the mountain there were young men of the Path full of vigor and daring They had been applying themselves to the Path in the mountains for a very long time but they had not yet attained a concentrated mind When one of the men of the Path saw from a distance the elephant chasing after and killing people he felt pity and wanted to rescue them full of confidence and brave When the Buddha saw this from afar he was afraid that this monk would be killed by the divine elephant So he went to the elephants side and emitted a great bright light When the elephant saw the Buddhas light its anger ceased and its wrath was dispelled It did not chase and kill people any longer When the monk saw the Buddha he drew back and did obeisance to him The Buddha then spoke the stanza to the monk only bring suffering and calamities on yourself Evil intentions mean ones death and that one will never reach a wholesome place When the monk had heard the stanza he immediately kowtowed confessed and apologized for his wrongdoing He inwardly and deeply rebuked himself and really felt himself to be wrong In front of the Buddha he immediately attained arhatship The men who had been catching the elephant came to their senses again Those who had fled returned and they all attained the Path Once the Buddha was on Mount Grdhrakuta in Rajagrha King Bimbisara then had a high official who had committed an offense He discharged him and moved him to the mountains in the south a thousand li from his country Moreover nobody lived there and the five cereals did not grow But when the high official arrived there the spring water flowed in excess and the five cereals grew in abundance Those who were suffering from hunger or cold in the countries in the four quarters all came to this mountain Within a few years there were three or four thousand families The three elders among them and the senior members deliberated among themselves A country without a ruler is like a body without a head They went to where the high official was and installed him as their king The high official replied to the elders If you take me as your king it should be in conformity with the rules of a king High officials left and right and both civilian and military leaders high and low should visit my court One should present women to fill my palace  The elders of the land said Indeed We accept your commands They should be in conformity with the rules of a king So they established him as their king They placed in offices ministers as well as civilian and military leaders high and low They incited the people to con struct the city walls and build houses a palace and pavilions But the people were subjected to suffering and they could not take it any more villainous ministers and associ ates took the king out hunting They led the king into a marshy wilderness thirty or forty li from the city with the intention of killing him The king asked those around him Why would you want to kill m e They replied Families are in ruin they plot against the state The king informed them Sirs it is of your own making It is not my doing If you unjustly kill me the spirits will know about this Let me have one wish so that I shall have no animosity in dying So he made the wish If you nevertheless kill me now I go without any real crime against the people Should I die I wish to become a flesheating devil and enter my old body again I shall avenge this grievance Thereupon they strangled him abandoned his corpse and left After three days the kings spirit became a flesheating devil and was in his old body again He was called Atavaka He then rose entered the palace and sucked up the new king the ladies of his harem and the villainous ministers around him He killed them all The devil left the palace in anger and wanted to kill everyone The three elders in the land tied themselves with a straw rope and went to the flesheating devil to surrender volun tarily  This was done by villainous ministers The populace could not have known this We implore your leniency I have to obtain human flesh as nourishment He is wrathful and does not consider what may be grievous The three elders said The land is yours O king Therefore it should be as before but the nourishment you need will be a different matter The elders of the land issued an order that the people should all draw lots to determine the sequence in which the families should provide an infant to serve as live food for the devil king Among the three or four thousand families there was just one household whose members were the Buddhas disciples They were zealous in their home and did not violate the five precepts They drew the lots with the rest of the people and obtained the first lot They happened to have an infant who would be the first to be fed to the devil king They went far away to Mount Grdhrakuta and did obeisance to the Buddha They repented their wrongdoings and rebuked themselves The Buddha saw their suffering with his eye of the Path and he spontaneously declared Because of this infant I shall save countless people He then flew alone to the devils gate He manifested his bright form which illuminated the palace He immediately went out and saw the Buddha He became malicious and wanted to spring forward and suck up the Buddha but the light pierced his eyes Shouldering a mountain and spitting fire he changed everything to dust Only when he became weary after a long while did he surrender The Buddha expounded the scriptural texts to him and after carefully listen ing to the Doctrine he accepted the five precepts and became an upasaka The whole family loudly cried and followed the child Those who looked on were countless grieving for them as the officer carried the child in his arms lifted this food and placed it in front of the devil The devil then took this child lifted the food and went in front of the Buddha He knelt deeply and said to the Buddha I am different from the people of the land if I take the child as my food I have now accepted your five precepts O Buddha and I do not have to eat this child any more I present him to you O Buddha So the Buddha accepted him expounded the Doctrine and made an incantation The Buddha placed the child in his bowl and took him out through the palace gates He returned him to his parents and informed them Raise the infant in good health Do not be sad any longer  O f all the people who saw the Buddha there was none who was not startled They wondered what spirit it was What merit does this child have that he was rescued him alone The devils food was taken away and returned to the parents  Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas among the great multitude meritorious reward will always follow He who sees the Doctrine is most respected among men He finally keeps himself far from the three evil predestinations Meritorious reward is most revered in the three worlds Demons dragons or a snakes poison cannot harm a person who maintains the precepts When the Buddha had spoken the stanzas countless people saw the Buddhas radiant appearance and they knew that he was the most honorable one beyond compare in the three worlds They were all converted and became the Buddhas disciples They were glad on hearing the stanzas and all attained the Path Once the Buddha was in the Deer Park in the land of Benares expounding the Doctrine to a countless multitude to gods and men dragons and demons and kings and their subjects The crown princes of large kingdoms and their attendants and the eldest sons of the princes of smaller kingdoms more than five hundred people went to where the Buddha was They did obeisance to the Buddha withdrew and sat aside listening to the Doctrine The crown princes then said to the Buddha Your Path  Buddha is fine wondrous and difficult to reach Has there from of old ever been a king a crown prince a high official or the son of an elder who has forsaken officialdom love and happiness to become an ascetic The Buddha informed the crown princes Happiness and love in the societies of the world are like an illusion a mirage a dream or an echo Kings and crown princes because of three things one cannot obtain the Path What three One one is arrogant and does not have the mindfulness to study the fine meaning of the Buddhas scriptures in order to save ones spirit Two one is covetous and not mindful of being charitable to the poor and distressed The wealth accumulated by officials and military officers is not shared with the people so that only their capital increases Three one cannot forsake lust and desire for affection and reject the distress of its prisonlike confines in order to become an ascetic extinguishing all hardships and developing ones person Therefore whosoever is born a bodhisattva is regal and removing these three things one attains Buddhahood There are three more things What three One study when young and lead the people to transform while governing the land so that they will practice the ten wholesome  Two in middle age give away your possessions to the poor and lonely while your officials and military officers are as happy as the people If you do not practice the three things you simply will not obtain anything Thereupon the Worldhonored One stated Once in a previ ous world I was a noble universal sovereign called Emperor Nemi ruling with the seven precious things There were palaces and pools lodges and theaters and also officials crown princes their wives and ladies elephants and horses and kitchen servants each eightyfour thousand strong Nemi had a thousand sons who were brave and skillful One of them was worth a thousand men He flew through the air and traveled throughout the four seas He was sovereign in his actions and no one was higher than he was His lifespan was eightyfour thousand years He governed accord ing to the Doctrine and did not do wrong to his people The noble king then thought to himself Mans life is short impermanent and hard to preserve I should just perform acts of merit and thereby seek the truth of the Path  So the king ordered his barber If you see that my hairs is white inform me  After a very long period tens of thousands of years the barber informed the king You have a white hair The king ordered him to pull it out and put it on the table When the king saw the white hair he wept and decreed The first messenger has suddenly come again Now that my hair is white I must go forth and become an ascetic to seek the natural Path He lifted the hair in his palms and spoke the stanza am depleted Thereafter  he governed the world simply as a great king He again ordered his barber If you see that my hairs is white inform me After a very long period the barber again informed him You white hair The king ordered him to pull it out held it in his hands and spoke the stanza These three noble kings again became fa ther and son High above they were emperors of the gods down below they were noble lords and in the middle they were crown princes thirtysix times each to end and yet to begin for several thousands of tens of thousands of years When I practiced these three things I realized Buddhahood The father in those times is myself now The crown prince is the worthy Sariputra The kings grandson is the worthy Ananda Following one another they were reborn and in this process they became kings in order to transform the world Therefore I am especially honored and I am beyond compare in the three worlds When the Buddha said this the king and his crown prince and all the other crown princes were very glad They accepted the Buddhas five precepts became upasakas and attained the path of the streamenterer Good Fortune Once the Buddha was on Mount Grdhrakuta in Rajagrha turning the wheel of the Doctrine of the three vehicles for gods and men and for dragons and demons Through the actions of a former Buddha the brahmans disciples deserved to obtain the Path They all went together to the bank of the river They arranged their seats and started a discussion by asking themselves As to the actions of the peoples in various societies what can we consider good fortune in the world We disciples do not understand They went to their teacher did obei sance and with folded hands said We disciples have been studying for a long time We know well what we have studied but we have not heard what the countries consider to be good fortune The nirgrantha inform ed them In Jambudvipa there are sixteen great countries and eightyfour thou sand small countries Each country has its own good fortune whether it is gold or silver crystal lapis lazuli the divine brightmoon gem elephants or horses chariots beautiful women coral shells line music a phoenix or a peacock the sun the moon the stars a precious vase the four classes  a brahman or a man of the Path These are the signs of good fortune held dear by the countries If they see them their esteem is immeasurable These are the signs the good fortunes of countries The disciples said Could there rather be another very special good fortune which is beneficial to oneself by which one may finally be reborn in heaven The nirgrantha replied Since the time of former teachers there has never been anything that surpasses these No book records anything superior The disciples said Recently we heard that someone of the Sakya clan has gone forth to practice the Path He sat upright for six years subdued Mara  and became a Buddha His three penetrating insights are unhin dered How about it O great teacher The teacher and his followers more than five hundred disciples went along the moun tain roads to where the Buddha was They did obeisance to the Buddha and took their positions as brahmans They folded their hands knelt deeply and said to the Worldhonored One As for the good fortune in every country such are what the people are fond of but we wonder if there is still something else that excels these The doctrine of good fortune as I know it is that if you practice prop erly you will obtain merit and be forever free from the three worlds You will bring about nirvana Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke the stanzas It is the utmost good fortune quest for luck and if one does not pray and sacrifice to the spirits this is the utmost good fortune ion constant and foremost performance of merits and acceptance of the truth with all ones being this is the utmost good fortune some if one avoids liquor knows moderation and does not lust after female beauty this is the utmost good fortune zealously applies oneself to the rules and if one develops oneself free from any strife this is the utmost good fortune parents if one regulates ones family and cares for wife and child and if ones conduct is not deficient this is the utmost good fortune faction and remembers to be thankful and if one recites the scriptures properly and in a timely fashion this is the utmost good fortune one is happy to meet an ascetic and quickly heeds his every exposition this is the utmost good fortune one persists in meeting the wise and stays close to the sages this is the utmost good fortune faith if one corrects ones intentions and directs himself toward the removal of doubt and if one wants to rid himself of the three evil predestinations this is the utmost good fortune one serves those who have attained the Path and respects gods and men this is the utmost good fortune delusion and hatred and if one is able to practice insight into the true Path this is the utmost good fortune oneself to the development of the Path and if one con stantly resorts to matters that are of concern this is the utmost good fortune compassionate mind and if this brings about benevolence and peace to all beings this is the utmost good fortune behavior reflecting good fortune and when they bring about the perfection of their wise insight this is the utmost good fortune When the brahmans teacher and disciples heard the Buddhas exposition of the stanzas they were glad and their minds opened up They were very happy came forward and said to the Buddha Very wonderful Worldhonored One Extraordinary in the world There is a reason why we were deluded and unable to gain insight yet We hope Worldhonored One that you will have compassion and save us We wish personally to take refuge in the Three Honor able Things of the Buddhas Doctrine We need to become ascetics and long to behave as such from now on  When the Buddha said Excellent Welcome monks they immediately became ascetics They internally reflected on anapana and attained arhatship The countless listeners all attained the eye of the Doctrine Preface to A Forest of Pearls from the Dharma Garden Composed by Li Yan styled Zhongsi of Longxi Grand Master for Court Council and GentlemanAttendant of the Orchid Pavilion From the six lines of divination the arrangements of the eight hexagrams are formed Then ideograms appear and the illumination of scriptures occurs Phoenix calligraphy and dragon diagrams golden tablets and jade letters one hundred schools have different standards and their ten thousand volumes are divided into many categoriesEven though they investigate minutely and discuss the norms of things exhaustively tracing and ordering human emotions and human nature they do not go beyond matters of this worldHow could any of these apply to otherworldly mattersFurthermore there is the teaching of Cang Jie the ancient court historian and the discourse of  a minor country officialTheir treasure scriptures are frivolous and their embroidered books are strangeThey are like carving ice which does not produce permanent shapes or writing in the sky which leaves no substantive If we compare these with the flower garlands of marvelous teachings and the leaves inscribed with mysterious words the broad teachings of the two vehicles and the eight types of Buddhist scriptures in terms of their depth and superiority it would be like comparing a small anthill to the high mountains Mount Song and Mount Hua or the amount of water collected in a cows hoofprint to the amount of water in the Jiang or Han RiversThese Buddhist teachings reveal comprehensive truths hidden norms gates of liberation and a garden of spellsFrom beginning to end they tally with suchnessFrom beginners to the advanced all take refuge in true enlightenmentThe Buddhist teachings guide those who are lost born in the ocean of desires causing their senses and sense objects along with their mind and mental defilements to disappear and they draw those who are at a loss to the chamber of compassionBoth the treasure robe and the jewel topknot  arrived The influence of this teaching reaches as many worlds as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River and the effects reach an infinite number of world agesHow great are these teachings How perfect they areThey cannot be adequately praisedFurthermore comets fell like rain in the realm of the ZhouWhen the Buddhas teaching reached the Han the image of the sun accompanied Cai Yin traveled the westZhu lan came to the eastThe words from the golden mouth of the Buddha and the teachings of the Jeweled Tower transposed onto silk and bamboo have become available in the central region of ChinaThey are contained in numerous scrolls and the accounts are deep and extensiveIt is difficult to study in detail the true origins of realityWe are now under the rule of the Tang and the Emperor creator of things reigns and proclaims the profound teaching Monastics gather and transmit the bright teaching pouring it liquid that illuminates and moistens the realm under the ruleThe sounds of reciting scriptures and utterances of praise are heard quietly all over the realm The prospering of the Buddhist teaching is truly indescribableThe great monastic of Ximingsi Monastery Dharma Master Daoshi styled Xuanyun is a leader of the Buddhist communityIntelligent even as a young child at a tender age he played with a stupa made of sand he shaved his head while he was still wearing the colorful clothes of a youthHis great compassion is such that it brings salvation even to antsHaving completed his training he reached the ordination platform where he received the complete preceptsEach of the precepts is perfect offering protection equal to  swallowing a gemDaoshi was well versed in the practice of selfcontrol taking delight in it in the same way one follows luminous mirrorsHe loves the Great Vehicle and penetrates and illuminates realityBecause of his superior and broad learning he was called to reside at Ximingsi MonasteryIn the time outside of the cultivation of the fivefold teaching he read the Tripi ṭaka extensivelyHe thought that over many generations from the ancient past to the present many authors compiled these worksThough elegant in meaning and beautiful in expression they are not all worthy of recordingThus Daoshi selected the best flowers from the field of these writings sniffed out the fragrant blossoms of the great teaching and organized them in altogether one hundred fascicles filling ten boxesThough its language is economical its content is richIt strings together the essentials of extensive teachings comparable to those of Yu  and the traces collected here proclaim the teaching as a mirror of the Way Like the Collection for the Propagation and Clarification of Buddhism Tteaching its words are beautiful and the Way is presented clearlyNone of the profound teachings are left out all essential teachings are included without exceptionIf a text is too long and detailed one soon becomes tired of it but if the content is too abbreviated the scope of learning is limitedEven though he wished not to fill scrolls with fiction and empty words Daoshi could not eliminate substantive mattersThe writing seems to be extensive if one studies it over a long period one gets to know the essential teachingsIn the first year of the Zongzhang period  on the thirtieth day of the third month the compilation was completedIt is our hope that authors of philosophical writings will find in these fascicles jewels that fit their needs perfectly and that those who follow the correct path will open this work and drink the sweet dew of immortalityInvestigating these pages one comes to know the subtle in contemplating reality with the teachings presented

Introduction Epidemics Warfare Famine Successive Generations and TreatmentsA kalpa is the designation for a time period like the term year Though time is not a separate entity the meaning of this designation becomes clear in the light of the Buddhist DharmaThe holy teaching is preached widely and contains many different kinds of records that include not only the profound norms of principle and contemplation but also the mysterious teachings on reward and punishmentIf one roams afar lost in the consciousness of the past it is easy to exhaust the number of minute dust If one returns to the starting point on the path of enlightenment  it is possible within the limit of the asaṃkhya periodThis may result in the difference between being lost or becoming enlightenedEven in the massive city in the Hell of Incessant Punishment the life span is limited and sinners move on to further rebirthsa rock used for clothes people are born in heavenHere the teaching is illustrated in contrasting cases of good and evil rebirthsIn this sahā world one brief moment is experienced as a hundred years in the land of the monastics an infinitely long world age constitutes one calendrical cycle of ten daysHere is the distinction between the defiled and the pureTo speak in broad terms there is nothing beyond the greater and lesser kalpas and each of them contains three itemsIn the greater kalpa there are the calamities of water fire and windIn the lesser kalpa harm comes from warfare famine and epidemicsThus we know that beautiful buildings  in the end are burned to ashesThe jewel terrace of a thousand brahmans in the end floats away in a sudden downpourFurthermore divinations will not produce any signs prayers will have no effectThe shining blades of weapons meet each other and the pointed swords of starlight cross each otherLiving people are harmed and almost entirely destroyedYet fear of the three realms does not lead to awakeningLamenting over the six realms of rebirth one is filled with sorrow The Dazhidu lun saysWhat is meant by jie AnswerThe Sanksrit term in correct transcription is jiebo batuo Jiebo means a division of time batuo means goodThe Lishi apitan lun saysThe Buddha the Worldhonored One said One minor kalpa is called one kalpaTwenty kalpas are also called one kalpaForty kalpas are also called one kalpaSixty kalpas are also called one kalpaEighty minor kalpas are also called one major kalpaWhy is one minor kalpa called one kalpa At the time the monk Devadatta was in hell suffering from karmic retribution the Buddha said that the period he will remain there is one kalpaIf the Buddha said that the period is one kalpa why are twenty kalpas also called one kalpaWhen the Brahmā god is born in heaven his life span is twenty minor kalpasThe Buddha said that it is one kalpaWhy are forty minor kalpas also called one kalpaThe life span of the Brahmakāyika god is forty minor kalpasThe Buddha said that it is one kalpaWhy are sixty kalpas also called one kalpaThe life span of the Mahābrahmā god is sixty minor kalpasThe Buddha said it is one kalpaWhy are eighty kalpas called one large kalpaThe Foshuo Jiezhong shijie jing saystwenty minor kalpas of destructionThen when the twenty minor kalpas of destruction are finished the twenty minor kalpas of arising and formation comeThese twenty kalpas of arising and formation have already startedHow many of them have already passed and how many are yet to comeEight minor kalpas have already passed eleven minor kalpas are yet to come The ninth minor kalpa is the present kalpa which has not yet come to an endIn this ninth kalpa how much has already passed and how much is yet to comeThere are still six hundred and ninety years to come This is calculated taking the last yimao year of the Liang as the basis In the course of these twenty minor kalpas three kinds of minor calamities occur one after anotherfirst the calamity of epidemics second the calamity of warfare and third the calamity of famineThe names of these three calamities are given differently in different scripturesThe Chang ahan  the Zhong ahan  and the Qishi first list warfare then famine and epidemics the Jushe apidamo and the Posha lun first lists warfare then epidemics and famineThe Yqie Yogacārabhūmi T and the Duifa list famine and then warfareAs for the length of the years and months and the order the view of the Yqie and the Duifa is the correct one Following the Lishi apitan lun This ninth kalpa is the time for the third calamityThis kalpa comes to an end because of famineThe Buddha the followingIn the course of the twenty kalpas of arising and formation in the first of these kalpas when a lesser calamity occurs there will be a great epidemicAll kinds of illnesses will spread everywhere in all the lands of JambudvīpaPeople everywhere will experience a great epidemicAll supernatural beings will become angry and harm the people of the worldHuman life span will be shortened to only ten yearsPeople will become short in stature some will be two hands tall some three handsIf they measure themselves with their own hands they will be eight hands tallThe best food available will be inferior milletThey will consider clothing made of human hair the best and have only swords and sticks for decorationAt that time people will fail to follow the correct teaching they will deviate from the teaching and indulge in greed wrong views and other evil behaviors will increase day and nightEvil ghosts will harm people everywhereAt that time the lineages of great kings will be terminated and the kingdoms territories will gradually become abandonedOnly small local government offices scattered in places at great distances from each other will remainIn this way people will suffer greatly from epidemics with no one to offer them medicine food and drinkFor this reason there will be many who die pointlessly before their life span is exhaustedEach day and night innumerable sentient beings will die from illnessPeople will receive this result because of having committed evil deeds in previous livesThe disturbance of the kalpa occurs after death people are reborn in the three inferior realmsAt that time local governments will be abandoned only a small number of families will exist separated from each other by great distancesWhen people die of epidemics there will be no one to bury themThe ground will be covered by white bonesEventually more and more houses will be abandonedDuring the last seven days of the kalpa an innumerable number of sentient beings will fall victim to the epidemic and dieThose who happen to survive this will be scattered in different placesThen someone will gather together all the men and women in JambudvīpaThere will only be ten thousand people left these people will become the human race for the coming age These ten thousand people are capable of good deedsSupernatural beings not wishing to let the human race be completely exterminated will protect them pouring good nourishment through their hair folliclesBecause of karmic conditions the human race will not be exterminated and after seven days the great epidemic will suddenly disappearAll evil ghosts will be banishedIn response to sentient beings needs food drink and clothing will come down from the sky like rainThe seasons will follow in proper order and a good harvest will be producedThe physical appearance of the people will be attractive and they will be free of illnessThey will be filled with the joy felt by relatives and close friends who have not seen each other for a long time when they are suddenly reunitedThey will stay together all the time and be unwilling to be separated from each otherIn the previous kalpa the human life span was ten yearsThese people will give birth to those who are born in the following kalpa whose life span may be as long as twenty thousand yearsSuch benefits are obtained spontaneously without any effortIn accordance with good teachings their actions of body speech and mind will be good and after their life span is completed they will be reborn in superior realms of existenceThen after finishing their lives as gods they will be reborn among human beingsWithout any effort they will be naturally good and observe the precepts fullyAfter their life span as human beings is over they will be reborn as godsThis will go on forever and everIn the transitional period following the first kalpa epidemics and illnesses will be completely absentThis period that connects with the subsequent second kalpa will last for twenty thousand yearsDuring the transitional period people have the same life span as the first kalpa people then are born from the people of the previous first kalpa with a life span of twenty thousand yearsIn the subsequent kalpa people have supernatural powers at their command and are supplied with everything they needTheir life span is forty thousand yearsSentient beings are reborn as human beings and as gods over and overThis is called the second kalpaIn the following transitional period people have the second kalpas life span of forty thousand yearsIn the following kalpa people will be provided with everything they need and their life span will be sixty thousand years They will be reborn as humans and gods over and overThis is called the third kalpaIn the following transitional period people have the third kalpas life span of sixty thousand yearsDuring the periods with sixty thousandto eighty thousandyear life spans women marry at the age of five hundred yearsPeople have only seven kinds of discomfort namely excreting urinating feeling cold heat sexual desire hunger and old ageIn these periods all kingdoms are wealthy and are well provisionedRobbers rebels and thieves are absentNeighboring villages hear each others roosters crowThough they cultivate little the harvest is greatSupplies of clothing and other property and treasures are sufficientSitting in peace people enjoy pleasures and do not have to run around in search of anythingThe period when the life span is eighty thousand years lasts for an infinite number of years sentient beings then will not commit any of the ten evil deedsWhen they begin committing the ten evil deeds after one hundred years their life spans will be reduced by ten yearsIn the subsequent one hundred years the life span will again be reduced by ten years Human life span is thus gradually reduced until it is only about ten yearsAt the last stage when it becomes ten years the life span will no longer be reducedFrom the maximum of eighty thousand to the minimum of ten years the life span will change if the Buddha does not appear in the worldIf the Buddha appears the true Dharma will stay and the reduction of sentient beings life span will stop for a whileAs the true Dharma begins to disappear the life span will also begin to be reducedThe Lishi apitan lun saysThe Buddha said One minor kalpa is called one kalpa The text continues in this way similar to the above up to the point of saying that eighty minor kalpas are called a large kalpa This large kalpa begins with the first twenty minor kalpas of arisingIn the subsequent twenty kalpas of abiding the second lesser calamity occurs due to great warfareWhen the human life span is ten years the three poisons of greed anger and ignorance as well as evil views grow day and nightParents children siblings and relatives fight with each other how much more so do people who are strangers to each otherAt this time people repeatedly treat each other with contempt they threaten each other with bricks and stones or with swords and sticksKingdoms in all four directions send expeditions to conquer each otherAn uncountable number of deaths occur in the course of a single day and nightSuch faults occur spontaneouslyPeople behave in evil ways and their karmic consequences are born in the midst of this period when the pollutions of the kalpa ariseAt this time peoples houses collapse and even those who survive are scattered in different directionsThis period of the end of the kalpa lasts for a little over seven daysIn the last seven days when people take hold of grasses and trees they all turn into swords and sticksWith these weapons they harm each other afraid they die in distressAt this time the people fearing  swords and sticks flee into the bushes or cross rivers to hide on remote islandsSome go into caves to avoid disasterSometimes they see another person and they run away from each other overcome with fearSometimes they fall to the ground like a deer confronted by a hunterAfter seven days of this countless people lie dead killed by swords and soldiersEven those who survive are scattered in different placesThen someone will gather together all the men and women in JambudvīpaThere will only be ten thousand people left these people will become the human race for the coming ageThese ten thousand people are capable of good deedsSupernatural beings not wishing to let the human race be completely exterminated will protect these people pouring good nourishment through their hair folliclesBecause of karmic conditions in the intermediate period between the kalpas the seeds of the human race will be preserved and not allowed to be exterminatedAfter seven days the great warfare will suddenly ceaseAll the evil ghosts will be banishedIn response to sentient beings needs food drink and clothing will come down from the sky like rainThe seasons will follow in proper order and a good harvest will be producedThese peoples physical appearance will be attractive and their features will be restored to their original conditionAll good dharmas will spontaneously ariseThere will be comfort in coolness quietude happiness and freedom from illnessPeople will be compassionate and free from harmful intentionsThey will be delighted when they see each other just as those who have not seen their loved ones for a long time and are suddenly reunited are delighted stay together and cannot be separated from each otherThe evolution continues as people perform good deeds and are born in heaven and then again among humans from the period when the life span is ten years through the period of the life span of twenty thousand years eventually to that of the life span of eighty thousand years which lasts for an uncountable number of yearsThe rest of the passage is identical to what is given above I will not bother to reproduce it here againThe Lishi apitan lun saysIn the course of the evolution from the first minor kalpa to the eightieth minor kalpa in the middle of the kalpa of abiding the third lesser calamity occurs due to a great famineWhen this calamity is about to occur there will be drought and people will suffer from a great epidemicAll supernatural beings will become angry and harm the people of the worldHuman life span will be shortened to only ten yearsPeople will become short in stature some will be two hands tall some three handsThey will eat inferior milletThey will make clothing with human hair and consider it superiorHaving only swords and sticks for decoration they will not treat each other respectfullyThey will suffer from poverty and ignorance and wrong views will grow day and night among themWhen those who are more powerful see others with food they will immediately seize it and eat it themselvesFor this reason countless people will die of hungerWhen sentient beings are born at this time in the midst of the kalpa of defilements they automatically commit evil deedsWhen there is no rain for four or five years in a row a great drought will occurEven when people search they will not find weeds and trees much less rice or other kinds of grainAll sorts of animals will have already eaten themIn the course of a single day and night an innumerable number of people will die from hunger leaving commanderies and districts emptyOnly a small number of houses will remain but these will be separated from each other by great distancesNo one will practice the true Dharma and the three poisons of greed anger and ignorance will flourishWhile people suffer in great poverty the days and nights are filled with evil Then for six or seven years there will be no rain and because of the great drought people will long to see water but it cannot be foundHow much less so cooked riceThe intermediate period following this kalpa lasts only for seven daysEach day and night innumerable people dieEven those who survive will be scattered in many different placesThen someone will gather together all the remaining men and women in Jambudvīpa adults and children altogether ten thousand people who become the human race for the coming ageThey are capable of good deedsSupernatural beings not wishing to let the human race be completely exterminated will protect these people pouring good nourishment through their hair folliclesBecause of karmic conditions the seeds of the human race will not be exterminatedAfter seven days the famine will suddenly disappearAll the evil ghosts will be banishedIn response to sentient beings needs food and clothing will come down from the sky like rainThe seasons will follow in proper order and a good harvest will be producedThe peoples physical appearance will be attractive and their features will be restored to their original conditionAll good dharmas will spontaneously ariseThere will be comfort in coolness quietude happiness and freedom from illnessesPeople will be compassionate and free from harmful intentionsThey will be delighted when they see each other just as those who have not seen their loved ones for a long time and are suddenly reunited are delighted stay together and cannot be separated from each otherThe evolution continues as people perform good deeds and are born in heaven and then again among humansTheir life span will grow longer to twenty thousand years and eventually to eighty thousand yearsOther developments are similar to those described above for other calamitiesaccording to the description in the Lishi apitan lun the three calamities last for seven days eachAccording to other scriptures and treatises famine lasts for seven years seven months and seven days epidemics last for seven months and seven days and warfare lasts for seven days The Yqie lun saysbegin at the time when the human life span is thirty yearsAt that time good food and drink are no longer obtainableOnly fried and cooked dried bones are served at banquetsIf a grain of rice wheat or millet is found it is valued like a maṇi jewel placed in a box and guarded carefullySentient beings are weakened if they fall to the ground they cannot get upBecause of hunger sentient beings almost completely disappearThis calamity of famine lasts for seven years seven months seven days and seven nightsSentient beings gather together and begin the activity of lesser renunciationFor this reason the life span is no longer reduced and the calamity of famine ceasesAt the time human life span is twenty years the activity of renunciation undertaken earlier is abandonedThen many kinds of epidemics spread wildlyPeople are struck by these diseases and most dieThis calamity of illness lasts for seven months seven days and seven nightsSentient beings gather together and begin the activity of middle renunciationFor this reason the life span is no longer reduced and the calamity of illness ceasesThen at the time when human life span is ten years the activity of renunciation undertaken earlier is again abandonedThen sentient beings constantly feel a fierce impulse to harm each otherFor this reason they take a blade of grass a tree branch bricks or stones and turn them into sharp swords and with these they kill each otherThis calamity of warfare lasts for seven daysThe Zhong ahan jing saysIn the past a wheelturning king appeared in the world His name was MūrdhajarājaHe upheld the rules of purity and cultivated the virtue of givingTo the poor in his kingdom he gave from his wealth so that their needs were metAfter a long while though there were still poor people in his kingdom he could no longer give from his wealth to provide for their needsOne person was then greatly distressed and consequently stole from someone elseHis master captured him and sent him to the kṣatriya king Mūrdhajarāja saying Heavenly king this man stole my propertyPlease pass judgment The king asked the accused man Did you in fact steal He said Yes in fact I did stealThe reason I did so was because I was in dire straits and I could not survive without stealing The king then brought out his own possessions and gave them to the thief saying You may go but do not steal again Because of this turn of events others thought We should also steal from others Then everyone stole as if in competitionConsequently people became poorer and had nothing to give out of compassionThe result was that people became even more impoverished and stole more frequentlyThis caused human life span to be reduced and peoples appearances to become unattractiveThe fathers life span was eighty thousand years while the sons life span was forty thousand yearsAt the time when human life span was forty thousand years another man stole and was sent to the kingHaving heard about this the king thought If people in my kingdom steal from others and if I give to them everything that I own then my storehouse will become empty and theft will become even more frequentInstead I should now make a very sharp sword and if there is a thief in my kingdom I should capture him and placing him under a tall platform chop off his head Having thought this issued an edict to this effectFrom then on people made copies of the sharp sword and carried it around with them to rob others of their possessionsThey captured the owners of these possessions and cut their heads offConsequently poverty became intense and murder by the sword increasedThis caused human life span to be reduced and peoples appearances worsenedThe fathers life span was forty thousand years while the sons life span was twenty thousand yearsAt the time when human life span was tewenty thousand years a thief thought If the king knew the truth he would bind me with a rope or fine me or line me up on a platformI would rather lie to the king Having thought this he said to the king  I did not steal For this reason people became impoverished and their possessions disappearedThey were not able to provide for others out of compassion Theft and murder became more frequent and people lied to each otherThis caused human life span to be reduced and peoples appearances worsenedThe fathers life span was twenty thousand years while the sons life span was ten thousand yearsAt the time when human life span was ten thousand years some became jealous of virtuous people and slept with their wivesThis caused human life span to be reduced and peoples appearances worsenedThe fathers life span was ten thousand years while the sons life span was five thousand yearsAt the time when human life span was five thousand years three things increaseddeviation from the teaching desire for evil and greedy attachment to evil teachingsTherefore while the fathers life span was five thousand years the sons life span became two thousand five hundred yearsAt the time when human life span was two thousand five hundred years again three things increased lying harsh speech and frivolous speechThis caused human life span to be reduced and peoples appearances worsenedTherefore while the fathers life span was two thousand five hundred years the sons life span became one thousand yearsAt the time when human life span was one thousand years one thing increased namely following wrong viewsBecause this one thing increased peoples life spans were reduced and their appearance worsenedTherefore while the fathers life span was one thousand years the sons life span became five hundred yearsAt the time when human life span was five hundred years people were unfilial to their parents and failed to respect monks and brahmansThey were not obedient did not perform meritorious deeds and failed to see the punishment they would receive in later livesTherefore while the fathers life span was five hundred years the sons life span became two hundred and fifty or two hundred yearsToday those who enjoy longevity live as long as one hundred years or soThe Buddha said to the monks Sometime far in the future human life span will be ten yearsWomen will marry five months after birthAt the time when human life span is ten years millet will be considered the tastiest food and unpolished grain the greatest delicacyGhee oil salt honey and sugarcane will all have disappearedOnly those who commit the ten kinds of evil deeds will be respected by others none of whom has ever performed a good deedMothers will vehemently wish to harm their children and children will vehemently wish to harm their mothersFathers and sons brothers sisters and relatives in their turn will wish to harm each other in the same way that hunters who see a deer vehemently wish to harm itDuring the time when the human life span is ten years for seven days the activities of the soldiers with swords will become intenseWhenever they take hold of a blade of grass it immediately becomes a swordWhen they grasp a dead branch it also immediately becomes a swordWith these swords soldiers murder each otherAfter seven days the activities of the soldiers with swords will come to an endAt that time when soldiers harm each other there will also be those who know embarrassment and shame who dislike worldly life and are free from attachment these people will go into the mountains or fields and hide there for those seven daysAfter the seven days are over they will come out of hiding and on seeing each other they will feel compassionate and affectionate toward them in the way that mothers love their only child or those who have been separated for a long time feel happiness when they find each other againWith great affection for each other they will say to each otherWise ones we now see each other We have now obtained peaceWe sat and gave rise to intentions that were not good and let all of our relatives dieWe should together perform good deeds and reject all murderous deeds As they perform good deeds human life span will begin to increase and appearances improvePeople with a life span of ten years will give birth to children with a life span of twenty yearsThose with a life span of twenty years will think If we seek to perform good deeds our life span will be lengthened and our appearance will improveWe should do more good deeds and together refrain from the act of taking without giving They will do this good deed and their life span and appearance will improvePeople will give birth to children with a life span of forty yearsThese then will refrain from licentious deeds they will do this good deed and their life span and appearance will improvePeople will give birth to children with a life span of eighty yearsThey then will refrain from telling lies they will do this good deed and their life span and appearance will improvePeople will give birth to children with a life span of one hundred and sixty yearsWith the life span extended to one hundred and sixty years they then will refrain from telling divisive lies they will do this good deed and their life span and appearance will improvePeople will give birth to children with a life span of three hundred and twenty yearsThey then will refrain from harsh speech they will do this good deed and their life span and appearance will improvePeople will give birth to children with a life span of six hundred and forty yearsThey then will refrain from frivolous speech and doing this good deed their life span and appearance will improve and they will give birth to children with the life span of two thousand five hundred yearsThey then also will refrain from jealousy they will do this good deed and their life span and appearance will improvePeople will give birth to children with a life span of five thousand yearsThey then again will refrain from anger they will do this good deed and their life span and appearance will improvePeople will give birth to children with the life span of ten thousand yearsThey then again will refrain from evil views they will do this good deed and their life span and appearance will improvePeople will give birth to children with a life span of twenty thousand yearsThey then will again refrain from deviating from the teaching desire for evil and greedy attachment to evil teachingsWe will refrain from these three evil conduct They will do this good deed and their life span and appearance will improvePeople will give birth to children with a life span of forty thousand yearsAt the time human life span is forty thousand years people will become obedient to their parents and they will honor and treat with respect the monks and brahmansRespectfully following their orders they will cultivate meritorious deeds anticipating the possibilities of punishments in future livesHaving done these good deeds people will give birth to children with a life span of eighty thousand yearsAt the time human life span is eighty thousand years this Jambudvīpa will become prosperous with a large populationVillages will be close to each other at a distance that a pheasant can cross in one flightWomen will marry at the age of five hundredThere will be seven kinds of discomfort namely cold heat excreting urinating sexual desire hunger and thirst and old ageThere will not be any other kind of troubleAt that time there will be a king called aṅkha who will become a universal monarch He will be intelligent and wise and will govern the four realms under heaven with four kinds of orderly armiesThe seven jewels will be abundant and he will have a thousand sonsHandsome and ferocious he will be fearless and conquer other groupsHe will govern the great earth all the way to the great oceanHe will rule not by the sword but by moral teachings and ordinancesThere will be peace Note epidemics and famine serve to encourage people to follow the Dharma in the same way as above According to the new translation of the Apidamo da piposha lun There is a holy teaching that serves as the treatment to this problemIf a person can uphold the precept of not killing for a single day and night in future lives this person will not encounter the calamity of soldiers with swords If the person can present one piece of harītakī fruit that is if someone takes one harītakī fruit and with a truly pure mind offers it to the sangha in future lives will not encounter the calamity of pestilence If a person gives one portion of food to another sentient being in future lives he or she will not encounter the calamity of famineQuestion Do these three calamities exist on other continentsAnswer They are absent in their basic forms but similar phenomena do existThese are increasing anger the decline of physical powers and frequent hunger and thirstThese apply to two of the continentsIn the continent of Uttarakuru such similar phenomena are also absent because no sins are committed there and there is no increase of anger thereSentient beings by nature form attachments and lack the will to reformThey are greedy jealous and increasingly indulge in evil deedsThus human emotions become intense and the evil poisons follow themOnce we are into the last stage of the decline of the teaching all people and everything else become evilBoth primary and secondary karmic retributions or ones body and mind as well as the environment in which one is born decline day and nightThe Fu fazang jing saysAt the time King Aśoka was personally making offerings of alms to the monks PiṇḍolaBhāradvāja pouring ghee over riceThe king said Great Sage ghee is hard to digestDoes it not make one ill The Honored One said Do not worryWhen the Buddha was present water and ghee were identicalTherefore one does not become ill by eating it Then wishing to demonstrate the truth of the matter PiṇḍolaBhāradvāja put his hand into the ground to a depth of over fortytwo thousand li and scooping up the rich soil showed it to the kingThe king should now know that because sentient beings lack merit rich and nourishing tastes have all flowed into the groundConsequently the merits and fortunes of the world have declined Having finished making the offering the king was delighted and withdrewEven less than a hundred years after the appearance of the Buddha there was already such a sign of declineToday almost two thousand years after the Buddhas appearance how could such nourishing tastes still existThe Yqie lun sayssentient beings also experience three kinds of extreme declinethe decline of life span the decline of primary and secondary karmic retributions and the decline of material resourcesThe decline of life span leads ultimately to a life span of ten yearsThe decline of primary and secondary karmic retributions leads to the size of the body being reduced to the measure of one hand or one knuckleWhen the reduction of material resources occurs people take millet as the best kind of food human hair as the best clothing and iron as the best material for decorationThe five kinds of delicacies all disappear namely such delicacies as ghee honey oil salt and the unusual taste of sugarcaneCalamities Length of Time Units of Time The Kalpa of Destruction and The Kalpa of Formation According to new translation of the Apidamo da piposha lun There are three kinds of kalpasfirst the antarakalpa second kalpa of formation and destruction and third the major kalpaThere are also three kinds of antarakalpasthe kalpa of decrease the kalpa of increase and the kalpa of increase and decreaseDuring the kalpa of decrease the human life span decreases from infinite to ten yearsDuring the kalpa of increase the human life span increases from ten years to eighty thousand yearsDuring the kalpa of increase and decrease the human life span increases from ten years to eighty thousand years and then decreases from eighty thousand years to ten years One kalpa of decrease one kalpa of increase and eighteen kalpas of increase and decrease constitute twenty antarakalpasHaving passed through twenty antarakalpas the world is formedHaving been formed it remains for twenty antarakalpas Together these two periods are called the kalpa of formationHaving passed through twenty antarakalpas the world is destroyedHaving been destroyed it remains empty for twenty antara kalpasTogether these two periods are called the kalpa of destructionAltogether these forty antarakalpas are called the major kalpaDuring the twenty antarakalpas of abiding that follows the antarakalpa of formation the first kalpa is simply of decrease and the last simply of increase the eighteen kalpas between these are of both increase and decreaseTherefore the Duifa lun says On the basis of this calculation of kalpa numbers the life spans of gods in the realm of form and the formless realm are shown According to the Xiguo zhuan by Dharma Master zang The progression of yin and yang and the turning of the sun and the moon are called by different names even though the conditions of the yearly changes remain the same The names of the months are established by lunar stationsThe shortest unit of time is called a kṣaṇa According to new translation of the Apidamo da piposha lun How does one know the duration of a kṣaṇaThe following is saidAccording to the Prajñaptiśāstra  when a middleaged woman weaves wool she shakes off the fine threads and evens out the material so that it is not too long or too shortThe time she takes to do this is called a tatkṣaṇaIt does not matter whether the piece of wool thread is long or short simply the time it takes to draw the thread out between the fingers is a tatkṣaṇaQuestion I asked earlier about a kṣaṇaWhy do you quote the Prajñaptiśāstra passage on tatkṣaṇaAnswer Here I used the coarse to explain the fine because the fine is difficult to know about and cannot be made tangibleOne hundred and twenty kṣaṇas is one tatkṣaṇaSixty tatkṣaṇas forms one lava which contains seven thousand two hundred kṣaṇasThirty lavas forms one muhūrta which contains two hundred and sixteen thousand kṣaṇasThirty muhūrtas forms one day and night which contains twenty thousand less than six million five hundred thousand kṣaṇasEach day and night this body of five skandhas undergoes a certain series of ceaseless coming into being and going out of being According to one opinion this is too broad and does not describe a kṣaṇaAccording to what it holds when a strong man snaps a finger the duration of sixtyfour kṣaṇas has passed According to another opinion this again is not rightAccording to what it holds when two strong men pull and cut a bundle of fine Kāśī threads as so many of them have been cut so many kṣaṇas have passedAccording to another opinion this again is not rightAccording to this opinion when two strong men grab a bundle of Kāśī threads and one man cuts it with a sharp sword from the kingdom of Cīna  as many threads as are cut so many kṣaṇas have passedAccording to another opinion this is still too broad and does not describe a kṣaṇaThe Worldhonored One did not describe the true duration of a kṣaṇaThe Worldhonored One said Imagine that four archers each holding a bow and arrow and standing back to back were to shoot in the four directions and a fast runner came up to them and said You should now shoot simultaneouslyI can run and catch all the arrows without letting any of them fall to the ground Would this not be quick The monks replied to the Buddha That is very quick Worldhonored One The Buddha said That man is not as quick as a groundtraveling yakṣaThe groundtraveling yakṣa is not as quick as the flying yakṣaThe flying yakṣa is not as quick as the four heavenly king deitiesThese deities do not travel as quickly as the sun and moonThe two wheels of the sun and moon do not travel as quickly as the gods who guide the sun and moonThese deities move around quickly but not as quickly as the coming into being and going out of being caused by the laterlifeproducing power The succession of kṣaṇas does not stop even for a moment From this we know that the Worldhonored One did not describe the true duration of a kṣaṇaQuestion Why did the Worldhonored One not describe the true duration of a kṣaṇa for the benefit of othersAnswer Because no sentient beings would be able to understand itThe Anpan jing says In the period of time it takes to snap a finger the mind undergoes nine hundred and sixty  The Renwang jing says One thought moment contains ninety kṣaṇasOne kṣaṇa in turn contains nine hundred comings into being and goings out of being The Pusa chutai jing  saysThe period of time it takes to snap a finger contains three billion two hundred million and one hundred thousand thought momentsThe succeeding thoughts produce material forms and succeeding material forms produce consciousnessesThe power of the Buddha enters each of the fine consciousnesses and lets them achieve salvationThe Abhidharmaśāstra saysThere are twelve itemsThe first is called kṣaṇaThe second is called tatkṣaṇaThe third is called lavaThe fourth is called muhūrtaThe fifth is called day and nightThe sixth is called halfmonthThe seventh is called monthThe eighth is called seasonThe ninth is called ayana  The tenth is called yearThe eleventh is called pairThe twelfth is called kalpaOne kṣaṇa is translated as one thought moment One hundred and twenty kṣaṇas is called one tatkṣaṇa which is translated as one momentSixty tatkṣaṇas is one breathOne breath is one lavaThirty lavas is one muhūrta which is translated as one short periodThirty muhūrtas is one day and night which consists altogether of six million three hundred and eighty thousand kṣaṇasThe Sengqi lTwenty thought moments constitute one momentTwenty moments constitute one period of time in which it takes to snap a fingerTwenty such periods of time constitute one lavaTwenty lavas constitute one short periodOne day and night contains thirty short periodsDuring the time when the day is longest there are eighteen short periods during the day and twelve during the nightWhen the day is shortest there are twelve short periods during the day and eighteen during the night During the spring and fall equinoxes day and night are equal in lengthThe Zhidu lun saysOne day and night is divided into six divisions and thirty time periods At the spring and fall equinoxes the day and the night each have fifteen time periods At other times there are increases and decreasesIn the fifth month the day has eighteen time periods and the night twelveIn the eleventh month the night has eighteen time periods and the day twelveAccording to the Xiguo zhuan by Dharma Master zang Among ordinary people the day is divided into eight time periods  Note in the original four in the day and four in the night each time period is further divided into four segments The period of the moons waxing up till the full moon is called the white portion  and the period of the moons waning up till the disappearance of the moon is called the black portion The black portion may be fourteen days or fifteen daysThis is because the length of a month variesThe black portion followed by a white portion constitutes one month Six months together form one ayanaThe period when the course of the sun remains inside to the north of the equator is the uttarāyaṇa the period when the course of the sun is outside to the south of the equator is the dakṣnāyanaThe two ayanas together form one year The year is also divided into six seasons From the sixteenth day of the first month to the fifteenth day of the third month is the season of increasing warmth From the sixteenth of the third month to the fifteenth of the fifth month is the season of excessive heat From the sixteenth of the fifth month to the fifteenth of the seventh month is the rainy seasonFrom the sixteenth of the seventh month to the fifteenth of the ninth month is the season of rich growth From the sixteenth of the ninth month to the fifteenth of the eleventh month is the season of increasing cold From the sixteenth of the eleventh month to the fifteenth of the first month is the season of excessive cold In the holy teaching of the Tathāgata the year is divided into three partsFrom the sixteenth of the first month to the fifteenth of the fifth month is the hot seasonFrom the sixteenth of the fifth month to the fifteenth of the ninth month is the rainy seasonFrom the sixteenth of the ninth month to the fifteenth of the first month is the cold seasonThe year is also sometimes divided into four seasonsspring summer fall and winterTo summarize all these explanations fifteen  nights form a halfmonthTwo halfmonths form a monthThree months form a seasonTwo seasons form an ayanaOne ayana is six months or a halfyearTwo ayanas form one yearTwo and a half years form a pairThis is because of intercalary monthsWhen the intercalary month is added to the original month there is a pairing of months not a pairing of intercalary monthsIf a pair of intercalary months occurs every five years this would mean that one intercalary month occurs every two and a half years How could we posit a pair of intercalary months in this same periodThe matter becomes clear once we make this calculation of the time duration There are four kinds of kalpasthe antarakalpa the kalpa of formation the kalpa of destruction and the major kalpaA long time passes between the time when the human life span is ten years and the time when it is eighty thousandAdd to this the time it takes for human life span to decrease to ten years The total is called the antarakalpaIn contrast to other sums of time periods it is called the antarakalpaThe calculation is made on the basis of the factsAccording to the Za ahan jing If a city one yojana on all sides and in height were filled with dust and one particle of dust taken out every one hundred years when all the particles of dust had been taken out in this way a kalpa would still not yet be over I take this to refer to one antarakalpaIn the case of the major kalpa the comparison would be with a city that is eighty yojanas in all directionsThe Loutan jing says To discuss kalpas with two comparisons first take a large city one thousand li from east to west and four thousand li from north and southIf this city were filled with dust and every one hundred years gods were to come and take a single particle of dust even when all the particles of dust had been taken away  a kalpa would still not have been exhaustedSecond take a large rock forty li on all four sidesIf every hundred years gods were to come down and touch this rock with their fine clothes even when the rock has been worn down due to this repeated contact a kalpa would still not have been exhaustedThis too an antarakalpaThe Loutan jing continues Second the kalpa of formation consists of forty kalpas the kalpa of destruction likewise consists of forty kalpasThis is because when the world comes into being it takes twenty kalpas it stays in existence for twenty more kalpasThe period of destruction is twenty kalpas and the period of absence is twenty kalpasHere the period of abiding is combined with that of formation and the period of absence with that of destruction and each of these two periods consists of forty kalpasThe periods of formation and destruction combined last eighty kalpas and this is called a major kalpaTo describe the matter yet again there are six kinds of kalpas antarakalpa kalpa of formation kalpa of abiding kalpa of destruction kalpa of absence and major kalpaOr there are three kinds of kalpasminor kalpa medium kalpa major kalpaThe minor kalpa refers to an antarakalpaThe medium kalpa refers to those of formation and destruction The major kalpa refers to those of formation and destruction togetherIn the heavens in the realm of desire the life span is one minor kalpaIn the three heavens of the first meditation the kalpa of the life span is the medium kalpaIn the heavens of the second meditations and above the kalpa of the life span is major kalpasThe worldly arithmetic in foreign countries speaks of sixty ranksBeyond these ranks counting is not possible and such numbers are called asaṃkhya One to sixty ranks may be used to count the number of kalpas the asaṃkhya kalpa refers to the major kalpaThus when the Dazhidu lun uses the city of one hundred yojanas as the measure speaking of taking one particle of dust once in each one hundred years or takes as a measure the metaphor of the light heavenly cloth of Kāśī brushing a rock measuring a hundred yojanas on each side once every hundred years all of these refer to the major kalpaIn the sahā world in the course of a one major kalpa a thousand buddhas appearSince what is called a kalpa cannot be calculated in finite numbers the metaphors of the rock dust and the city are used to describe its durationAs described above there are four kalpas of formation abiding destruction and absenceAs noted above the life span increases from ten years to eighty thousand years and then decreases from eighty thousand years to ten yearsTwenty repetitions of this constitute one minor kalpaTwenty minor kalpas constitute one kalpa of formationIf we are to calculate this in years eight trillion one hundred billion and eight million years corresponds to one minor kalpaAt present the kalpa of formation has been completed and we are now in the kalpa of abiding and have finished eight minor kalpas thereākyamuni Tathāgata is the fourth buddha in the kalpa of abidingAnother nine hundred and ninetysix buddhas will appear successively after himAccording to the Xiguo zhuan by Dharma Master zang The unit of measurement of distance is a yojana One yojana is the distance that a sage kings army can travel in one dayAccording to an old tradition one yojana is forty liIn the customary usage in India it is thirty liIn the opinion of holy scriptures it is only sixteen liThe Abhidharmaśāstra says Four hastaka is one dhanu Five hundred dhanus is one krośaEight krośas is one yojana one dhanu is equivalent in length to eight chi five hundred dhanus is equivalent in length to four hundred zhang four hundred zhang is one krośaOne li on the other hand is three hundred and sixty bu One bu is six chiSince ten chi is one zhang altogether two hundred and sixteen zhang is one liTwo li will be four hundred and thirtytwo zhangIf we calculate on the basis of the equation that five hundred dhanus is four hundred zhang one krośa is still thirtytwo zhang short of two liThus we conclude that one krośa is less than two li and that eight krośas which is identical to one yojana is less than sixteen liAccording to the Zabaozang jing  One krośa is five li If we combine this with the Abhidharmas thesis that eight krośas is one yojana then the latter will be forty liAccording to the Chang ahan jing How far do the effects of the three calamities reach upward into the heavensWhen the calamity of fire occurs its effects reach as far as bhāsvara HeavenWhen the calamity of water occurs its effects reach as far as ubha kṛtsna HeavenWhen the calamity of wind occurs its effects reach as far as Bṛhatphala HeavenWhen the three calamities are about to occur all the people of the world are practicing the correct teaching following the correct view and cultivating the ten good deedsIn this way a person achieves the second state of meditation Immediately he jumps up into the sky and dwelling in the realm of holy ones or of a deity or of Brahmā he says loudly Wise men and women you should know the delight of the second state of meditation which is free of sensation and viewing People hearing this cultivate the state free of sensation and viewing and when their bodies are destroyed they achieve rebirth in bhāsvara Heaven At that time the sentient beings in hell having finished their punishment their bodies there having been destroyed are reborn among human beings They also cultivate the state free of sensation and viewing and obtain rebirth in bhāsvara HeavenAnimals hungry ghosts asuras  and other beings in the heavens of the six realms of desire all attain rebirth in bhāsvara HeavenAt this time hell is emptied first then the realm of animals is emptiedSubsequently the realms of hungry ghosts and asuras and further the heavens in the realm of desire up to Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven are emptiedAnd then the human realm is emptied leaving no tracesThis world is destroyed and the calamity then occursThe Shunzhengli lun saysAnd so there will be no sentient beings left in hellAt this point it is said that the hell is destroyedThose who are meant to receive karmic consequences in hell will by the power of karma be placed elsewhereThe cases of the realms of animals and of ghosts may be inferred from thisAt that point no living being is found in a human body and human bodies are identical to the Buddhas bodyAt that time in the human realm in this continent a person without a teacher but who is in accord with the teaching can attain the first state of meditationComing out of this meditative state he says loudly Leaving life produces delight and pleasure which is very enjoyable and calming On hearing this other human beings all go into meditation and when their lives end they all are reborn in the world of BrahmāConsequently in this continent sentient beings disappearThis is said to be the disappearance of people from the Jambudvīpa continent The case of the eastern and western continents can be inferred from thisIn the northern continent when their lives are finished beings are reborn in the heavens of the realm of desire Because their sense organs are inferior they cannot abandon desires and they are reborn in the heavens of the realm of desireThere they realize a meditative state and achieving superior karmic conditions they transcend desiresAfter this no sentient beings are left in the human realm and the human realm is destroyedIf in the heavenly realm in the six heavens of the realm of desire gods follow the teaching and achieve the first state of meditation they will be reborn in the world of Brahmā  Then it is said that the six heavens of the realm of desire have been destroyedIn this way no sentient beings will be left in the realm of desire and it is said that sentient beings in the realm of desire have been destroyedIn the world of Brahmā if a sentient being without a teacher but who is in accord with the teaching attains the second state of meditation and coming out of this meditative state he says Meditative concentration produces delight and pleasure which is greatly enjoyable and calming Hearing this other gods all go into meditation and when their lives end they are reborn in bhāsvara Heaven Consequently in the Brahmā world sentient beings disappearThis is said to be the disappearance of the world of sentient beings Only the insentient world of the environment is left this world is vast and emptyIn universes elsewhere all sentient beings sense that karmic processes have ceased in this worldsystem of threefold one thousand worldsThen seven suns appearAll the oceans dry up and the mountains become emptyContinents and islands and the three cosmic wheels on which they stand are all burnedFerocious winds and flames rise up to the heavenly palaces turning the Brahmā palace into ashesflames that rise in a given realm burn the palaces of that realmcalamities that are not of that realm wreak destruction on that realmThis is caused by the interaction between the realmsThus it is said Lower fire driven by wind burns up a higher realm Thus the fire of the realm of desire rises and causes fire in the realm of form which proves calamitousOne should thus know that the development that begins with the gradual disappearance of the hells results in the disappearance of the insentient world of the environmentThis entire development is called the kalpa of destructionThe Guanfo sanmei jing saysThe period from the beginning of heaven and earth to its end is called one kalpaWhen a kalpa is about to end the calamity of fire occursAll people turn against the correct and turn to evil  rushing toward the ten evil deedsRain will stop coming from the sky and plants will not growBeginning with the spring where the streams originate down to the four great rivers all water sources dry upAfter a long time the wind goes into the bottom of the ocean bringing the sun palace up and placing it in its original location on top of Mount Sumeru The Chang ahan jing Tcb saysAfter a very long time a great black wind blows over the ocean causing the ocean to a depth of eightyfour thousand yojanas to separate into two banksThe wind takes the sun palace  and places it halfway up Mount Sumeru fortytwo thousand yojanas above the ground and securely in the orbit of the sun In this way the second sun appears In a similar way the appearance of the seven suns is explained one by oneThe Zaxin lun saysAt the time a kalpa is destroyed seven suns like wheels appear  Mount YugaṃdharaAccording to another opinion one sun is divided into seven sunsAccording to yet another opinion the suns come from Avīci Hell brought out by the karma of sentient beings When one sun comes out a hundred plants and trees suddenly dieWhen two suns come out the water of the four great oceans to a depth of one hundred to seven hundred yojanas spontaneously dries upWhen three suns come out the water of the four great oceans to the depth one thousand to seven thousand yojanas begins to decreaseWhen four suns appear the water of the four great oceans to the depth of one thousand yojanas is completely exhausted and when the five suns appear the water of the four great oceans seven thousand yojanas long and wide is completely exhaustedThe Chang ahan jing Tab says that it after five suns come out the water in the ocean begins to change depthThe ocean water becomes like cows hoofprints after a spring rainIn the end the ocean dries up so that not even a finger can be dipped in it When six suns come out the ground as deep as sixtyeight thousand yojanas is covered with smokeFrom Mount Sumeru through the entire cosmic worldsystem numbering one thousand to the power of three as well as the eight great hellseverything is burned upWhen the smoke settles nothing is leftThe lives of all people have endedFor all beings on Mount Sumeru and in the six heavens of the realm of desire life comes to an end and their palaces are emptiedAll is impermanent and cannot remain foreverWhen the seven suns come out the great ground and Mount Sumeru will gradually begin to crumble in an area measuring one hundred thousand yojanas wide and in the end there wil be nothing leftEverywhere in the mountains jewels explode and smoke and flames reach Brahmās heavensAll realms of inferior births will disappearThere will be no more punishments only merits ariseAll will gather in the fifteenth heaven and aboveEverything below the fourteenth heaven is destroyedNewly born gods have not seen this and are afraidGods born earlier come to console them saying Dont be afraiddoes not reach here When peoples lives are finished they are reborn in bhāsvara HeavenThought is their food light shines spontaneously and they have the supernatural power to flySome are reborn elsewhereIf they are reborn in hell when their punishment in hell is completed they are reborn in heaven If their punishment is not finished they are born elsewhereThere is no sun moon or stars there are also no day or nightThere is only great darkness This is called the fire kalpaThe karmic retribution of the fire kalpa brings this destructionWhen the kalpa is about to completed the fire goes out by itselfA great cloud forms and gradually drops rainEach drop is shaped like the axle of a chariotAt that time the entire cosmic worldsystem numbering one thousand to the power of three will be filled with water up to Brahmās heavensThe Yqie lun saysBecause sentient beings respond to the karmic powers that produce phenomenal appearances and because there is the matter of the six kinds of burning six suns also gradually appearCompared with the earlier suns the heat of these suns is four times strongerWhen they become seven the heat is increased seven timesWhat are the objects of the six kinds of burningCanals and moats of different sizesThese are dried up by the second sunSmaller and larger riversThese are dried up by the third sunThe Great Pond Free of Heat which is dried up by the fourth sunThe great oceanIt is dried by the fifth and a part of the sixth sunMount Sumeru and the ground are firm and solid they are burned up by a part of the sixth and the seventh sunThe flames of these fires are intensified by wind and spread with increasing strength reaching as far as Brahmās heavensIn this way the world is burned up and reduced to ashes and charcoalNothing else is left even in shadowy formsThis is called the destruction of the environment worldThis process takes twenty kalpas the condition lasts for another twenty kalpasWhat is called the calamity of waterAfter the calamity of fires has taken place seven times in the heavenly realms of the second meditative state a calamity occurs spontaneously from the water elementIt destroys the world in the way water melts away saltThe water and the environment world disappear simultaneouslyAfter the destruction the condition lasts for another twenty kalpasWhat is called the calamity of windAfter the calamity of water has taken place seven times the calamity of fire again occurs seven timesThen immediately in the heavenly realms of the third meditative state a calamity occurs from the wind elementIt destroys the world in the way wind dries out the joints of limbs and makes them disappearThis wind and the environment world disappear simultaneouslyAfter the destruction the condition lasts for twenty kalpasHere the destruction of the world is described brieflyThe Shunzhengli lun saysThese three major calamities of water fire and wind oppress sentient beings making them abandon the lower ground of earth and gather together in the heavensThe calamity of fire is caused by the appearance of seven sunsAccording to one opinion the seven suns travel in a way similar to the way geese travel following their separate paths in a circular motionAccording to another opinion the seven suns travel at different heights following their respective paths in a circular motionThe distance between these paths is five thousand yojanasThen the calamity of water is caused by a torrential rainfallSome explain this as followsIn the sky in the region corresponding to the third state of meditation rain heats up and congeals into waterAnother explains that the cosmic waterwheel comes up from below and shoots up water which in turn floods everythingWhat is certain is that it occurs in this worldLater the calamity of wind is caused by a strong striking wind Some explain this as followsIn the sky in the region corresponding to the fourth state of meditation wind suddenly arisesAnother explains that the cosmic wind wheel shoots up air which causes a windstormWhat is certain is that wind calamities work in the same way as the above case What is the sequence of the three calamitiesFirst the seven calamities of fire occur one after anotherThen one calamity of water occursImmediately after that the seven calamities of fire occur againAfter these seven calamities of fire one calamity of water takes place againIn this way seven calamities of water occurThen the seven calamities of fire take place and then a calamity of wind occursIn this way eight sets of seven calamities of fire one set of seven calamities of water and one calamity of wind occursEach occurrence of a calamity of water or wind follows a calamity of fireAfter the calamity of water or wind there is always a calamity of fireIn this way there is a principled order in the occurrences of calamitiesWhy must the seven calamities of fire occur before one calamity of water occursThis pattern is determined by the life span of the gods in bhāsvara Heaven which is as long as eight major kalpasSo it is in the eight kalpas that the calamity of water occursThe reason why seven calamities of water and eight sets of seven calamities of fire must occur before one calamity of wind occurs is because this pattern is determined by the life span of gods in ubhakṛtsna Heaven which is sixtyfour kalpas longTherefore it is only after eight times eight calamities that the calamity of wind occursDepending on how high the level of meditation that is cultivated by sentient beings karmic effects mature at different times and their life spans become longerThus the places where they reside become more permanentThus verses from the Abhidharmaśāstra Za apitanxin lun Tc Seven calamities of fire pass in order And then one calamity of waterSeven times seven calamities of fire and seven calamities of water And again seven calamities of fire and after that the calamity of wind The Duifa lun saysThus in the eastern direction one after another without interruption an infinite number of worlds existssome are about to be destroyed and some are about to come into being some are in the process of being destroyed and some remain in the state of having been destroyed some are in the process of coming into being and some remain in the state of having come into beingAs in the eastern direction so too in all ten directions is the situation the sameIn this way whether it is the world of sentient beings or the world of their environments all have been produced by the power of karma and desiresThey have resulted from the increase of the karmic power of desireFor this reason they are all called the truth of suffering The Zaxin lun saysQuestion Why does the kalpa of destruction not affect  the fourth meditative stateAnswer This realm consists of the uddhāvāsa HeavensThese are the highest heavens  If beings are born there they are bound to achieve nirvana thereThey will not be reborn in any of the lower realmsThe cessation of things is not achieved through wisdom it is only due to the lack of causal conditions that things do not arise there The situation for those beings who dwell and experience the kalpa of destruction is different because they are reborn there through the power of increased meritsBecause internal disturbance is bad in these levels internal disturbances lead to external calamitiesIn the first meditative state coarser and finer mental disturbances of fire occur internally and for that reason the calamity of fire results externallyIn  the second meditative state internal disturbances of taking delight in water occur and for that reason the calamity of water takes place externallyIn the third meditative state internal disturbances of the wind of the exhalation and inhalation of breath occur and for that reason the calamity of wind takes place externally QuestionIf mental disturbances are absent in the fourth meditative state how could it be not permanentAnswer kṣaṇa is affected by impermanenceTherefore the fourth meditative state lack the fixed character of continuityThe moment a being is born in that heaven a heavenly palace also appears simultaneouslyWhen the beings life span ends there the heaven also disappearsThe Qishi jing saysThen again after infinite and incalculable days and months a great cloud appears and covers the entire Brahmā worldHaving covered it it pours down a floodlike rainThe raindrops are large some are like a chariots shaft others are shaped like a hammerAfter hundreds of thousands of millions of years the rainwater gradually accumulates and all the places where the gods reside are filled with itThis body of water is supported by four wheels of windWhat are these calledThe first is called holding the second safely holding the third not falling and the fourth firmly holding After the rain stops the water recedes spontaneously and its level goes down by an infinite number of hundreds of thousands of millions of yojanasThen great winds appear simultaneously in the four directionsThe name of the wind is AnapiluoIt blows into the body of water and agitates it incessantlyGreat bubbles appear spontaneously in the water and the great wind blows it up into the sky and above this the palace of Brahmā Heaven is builtIt is beautiful and attractive filled with the seven jewels of gold silver lapis lazuli crystal red pearls musāragalva shells and agateInto this world Brahmā gods are bornThat water recedes further and the water level goes down by an infinite number of hundreds of thousands of millions of yojanasAs before the winds called Anapiluo arise in the four directionsThis great wind blows up bubbles and forms a heavenly palaceMāra gods appear and live around the walls in the same way as do the Brahmā godsOnly the degree of refinement of the jewels is differentIn the same way other heavens from Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven to Yama Heaven are formed one after anotherThe six heavens are completed one after another in the same way as Brahmā Heaven only the degrees of refinement are differentThen the water again decreases and the water level goes down further by an infinite number of hundreds of thousands of millions of yojanasThe water then remains calm From the body of water bubbles go up in the four directions to a distance of sixtyeight myriad yojanasThe circumference  is infinitely vastA great wind blows up bubbles and forms Mount Sumeru made of four jewelsThe wind blows bubbles again and forms the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods  made of seven jewelsAgain the wind blows up bubbles and in the middle of Mount Sumeru at the height of fortytwo thousand yojanas they form the palaces of the sun and the moon gods made of seven jewelsIt is for this reason that there are seven sun palaces in a single palace securely kept even today these palaces are all made of seven jewelsThe wind again blows up bubbles from the ocean water to the height of a myriad yojanas to form a similar crystal palace and city for the skydwelling yakṣasThe wind also blows up bubbles on the four sides of Mount Sumeru each at the distance of one thousand yojanas from the mountainUnder the great ocean on the four sides asura cities decorated with seven jewels are formedAgain the wind blows up bubbles to form other great jewel mountainsContinuing in this way the wind blows up bubbles passing through the four great continents and the eight myriad smaller continents outside of Mount Sumeru and the other great mountains and securely stations a boundary there called the Great Surrounding Mountain RangeIts height and width are both six hundred eighty myriad millions of yojanasThe boundary range is solidly formed out of diamond and can only be destroyed with the greatest difficultyIn a similar way the great wind digs into the ground to an increasing depth and places the great body of water inside it The water remains calm and unmovingThus the great ocean is brought into existenceAgain the Qishi jing saysWhy is the water of this great ocean so salty and bitter unsuitable for drinkingThere are three reasons for thisWhat are the threeFirst for an infinite period of time after the calamity of fire a heavy cloud covers the world and does not moveThen the cloud pours down rain all over the worldThis great rain washes over all the palaces in Brahmā Heaven and then the palaces of Māras heaven then the palaces in Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven Nirmāṇarati Heaven Tuṣita Heaven and Yama HeavenWhen these palaces are inundated all kinds of salty sharp and bitter tastes flow down from the The rain then washes over Mount Sumeru the four great continents the eight myriad smaller continents and many mountainsWhen these places are inundated flow into the oceanFor this reason the water of the great ocean is salty unsuitable for drinkingSecond inside this great ocean live many great deities with massive bodiesAll the excrement and urine go into the oceanFor this reason the water of the great ocean is salty unsuitable for drinkingThird ancient sages cast spells that cursed the water of the ocean vowing to make it salty and unsuitabl for drinkingFor this reason the water of the great ocean is salty unsuitable for drinkingAlso according to the Shunzhengli lun The kalpa of formation refers to the period from the rising of wind to the time when sentient beings are born in hellAfter this world is destroyed by calamities for twenty antarakalpas there remains only empty spaceAfter this long period of time another equally long period of time When this kalpa of formation arrives the karmic power of all sentient beings increasesIn the sky a breeze gradually arisesThis is the sign that the environment world  which forms the container for the world of sentient beings is about to be formed The wind gradually becomes stronger and causes as was said earlier the wind wheel the water wheel and the the metal wheel to be formedThen the heavenly palace of great Brahmā gods and so on up to the heavenly palace of the Yama gods are established Then the wind rises againThis is how the external environment world is formedThis is due to the power of sentient beingsIn other words for a long time sentient beings are gathered in bhāsvara HeavenBecause of the number of gods there the residence becomes crowdedThose beings whose merits have decreased must spread out into the lower heavensThis is how this environment world worksFirst one sentient being dies in bhā svara Heaven and is reborn in the palace of the highest of the Brahmā heavens the Mahābrahmā HeavenLater other sentient beings die there and are reborn in the second highest of the Brahmā heavens Brahmā purohita HeavenSome are born in the Brahmā heavenOthers are born in Paranirmitavaśavartin HeavenGradually being reborn in lower realms in this way we get to the human realm and later beings are born in the realms of hungry ghosts of animals and of hellIt is a matter of principle that if there is later destruction there must be formation before thatWhen one sentient being is reborn in Avīci Hell it is known that the twenty antarakalpas of formation has been completedAfter this a period of twenty antarakalpas called abiding after formation follows in an orderly fashionThe Lishi apitan lun saysWhen the entire environment world has been formed two kinds of realms grow namely the realm of earth and the realm of fireThe realm of wind arises and blows on the realm of fire which heats and refines the earth realmThe realm of wind constantly blows and make all things become firmWhen things have been made firm all kinds of jewels become visibleIn this way the long period of sixty kalpas is ultimately completedThe Chang ahan jing says These three plus earth make the four calamities and the four kalpasExcluding earth the remaining three are called the major kalpado not reach the fourth meditative state because these realms are the uddhāvāsa HeavensThese are the highest heavens  If beings are born there they achieve nirvana thereThey are not to be reborn in any of the lower realms The cessation of things is not achieved through wisdom it is only due to the lack of conditions that they do not arise In the course of the transformation of heaven and earth when heaven is formed anew there is nothing in itThe sun and moon are also absentIn the ground a sweet spring opens up the water of which has the taste of honeyAt that time some gods of bhāsvara Heaven having exhausted their merit are reborn in this newly formed worldSome of them love this new ground and being frivolous in temperament dip their finger in the spring to taste the waterAfter three attempts they taste the sweetness and as they keep tasting it their skin gradually becomes coarse losing the heavenly and miraculous light The world plunges into darknessLater a great black wind blows on the ocean water and taking the sun and moon that are floating on it places them securely on the side of Mount Sumeru in the orbit of the sunThey circle Mount Sumeru and illumine the four realms under heavenPeople at that time are delighted when they appear and are frightened when they disappearFrom this point on the cycles of day and night the end and the beginning of the month the seasons of the year repeat themselvesWhen the kalpa of formation first begins gods come down and become people They are all born by transformationTheir bodies shine as they wish and they have the miraculous ability to flyThere are no distinctions of male and female or of higher and lower social rankMany are born togetherFor this reason they are called many born The earth has the natural taste of butter or fresh ghee It is sweet like honeyLater sentient beings try to taste it by scooping it in their hands and eventually they become attached to its taste and make balls of it to eatThe light they emit gradually dims and they lose their supernatural powersThe faces of those who eat a lot of earth look haggard the faces of those who eat little remain shinyThis leads to the rise of the distinction between winning and losingBecause of the distinction between winning and losing the distinction between right and wrong appearsThe taste of the earth gradually disappears and all are distressed cursing this development as a disasterThen the earth loses its taste completely and forms a skin  thin like a pancakeThis skin also disappears and another surface appearsThis thicker surface also disappearsAccording to the Zengyi jing  Also rich earth appears spontaneouslyIt tastes like sweet wine Again the Loutan jing saysThe sweet earth disappears and a twobranched vine appearsThe taste is also sweetPeople eat a lot of it over a long period of time and they all begin to look as if they are always laughingThe twobranched vine disappears and rice without husk appearsWithout cooking it contains all tasty flavorsSentient beings eat it and the physical distinction between male and female appears Again the Zengyi jing saysThen those among the gods who have stronger sexual desires become female human beings and in this way the distinction between husbands and wives appearsLater the sexual desires of sentient beings increase and so husbands and wives come to live togetherAfter the remaining effects of the merits of sentient beings that support their life spans are exhausted a god of bhāsvara Heaven comes here and stays in a mothers wombIn this way birth from the womb appears in the worldAt that time if one goes to the great city of Campā or to any other residential city quarters one sees rice plants growing spontaneously If one harvests the rice crop in the morning another crop is ripe by eveningIf one harvests it in the evening another crop is ripe in the morningAs one crop is harvested new crops appear immediatelyThe Zhong ahan jing Tca ref Chang ahan jing Tc saysRice plants grew four cun long and had no stalksSentient beings then harvested what they needed each dayThey taught each other to follow this practiceThey took five days worth of riceThen the rice plants that grew back gradually did not revive and became dead stumpsThen people cried in distressThey assigned to each a field residences and rice plants and marked out boundariesPeople then hid their own rice and stole grain from other peoples fieldsFailing to settle such disputes they voted to establish an unbiased chief who was to protect people rewarding the good and punishing the evilSome people used swords sticks and other similar weapons to beat and kill othersbirth old age illness and deathThe possession of fields and land led to disputesTherefore each took some of his property and provided it Choosing one person of distinguished and elegant appearance who was endowed with a great deal of property they asked him to be the rulerThis was how the name peoples ruler appearedHis fields and residences were called by this nameThe realm under heaven prospered in ways that cannot be described in detail hereThe ruler honored and practiced the ten good deeds and showed compassion for people in the way that parents love their childrenPeople respected the ruler just as a son respects his fatherHuman life span became very long and people enjoyed unsurpassed prosperityThe Shunzhengli lun saysFrom taking the ordinary food their bodies become gradually heavyThe light disappeared and darkness appearedThe sun moon and many stars appeared from this point onAs people indulged in consuming it the tasty earth disappearedAt this point on the thin cakes of earth skin appearedAs they rushed to eat them the earth cakes disappearedThen fine rice plants appearedAs they rushed to eat the fine rice plants these plants disappearedThen unplanted fragrant rice plants appeared spontaneouslyThe crowd grabbed these and ate them till they were fullBecause this food was coarse residues remained in the bodyBecause the people wanted to get rid of the residues the two excretory organs appearedFor this reason male and female organs appearedBecause these organs looked very different in appearance due to the power of karmic influences they looked at each otherThis is how immorality eventually came into existenceFurther developments led to the rise of theftSo the community chose one moral person and each person took onesixth of his income and hired the moral person as the guard designating him as the ruler of the fieldsIn this way the name kṣatriya was establishedPeople accepted his rule and his care spread over all the landFor this reason he was further called the great kingThere were no kings He was the first king many kings appeared following himThe Chang ahan jing says The Buddha said to the monks There are four things that last for an incalculable and infinite period of timeThis time period cannot be measured by the sun and moon or by the annual progress of JupiterWhat are the fourFirst as the calamities of the world occur in sequence the period between the destructions of this world is extremely long and cannot be measured by the sun and moon or by the annual progress of JupiterSecond when this world is destroyed there will be a period in which it is empty and desertedFor an extremely long time there will be no worldThis period cannot be measured by the sun and moon or by the annual progress of JupiterThird the period from the time when heaven and earth come into being until the formation of the world is extremely longThis period of time cannot be measured by the sun and moon or by the annual progress of JupiterFourth after heaven and earth have been formed this world will remain for a very long timeThis period of time cannot be measured by the sun and moon or by the annual progress of JupiterThese four things last for incalculable and infinite periods of time These time periods cannot be measured by the sun and moon or by the annual progress of Jupiter verses say The distance of one hundred yojanas is easily covered by mustard seeds The three calamities naturally exhausts themselves The fire struck from a stone does not form a permanent flame The lightning from thunder does not remain long When hunger is extreme people eat each other With swords and weapons they conquer each other Against pestilence no doctor is effective Their labor in vain people cry out in hatred and suffering Close relatives cannot help each other Cruel violence leaves behind its echoes A boxful of writings left behind is in vain The enjoyment of plentiful wealth and valuables is pointless There is a great sigh at the swiftness of the river of waves And grief at this entanglement of painful karmaWith birth and destruction pressing hard The situation is urgent and no peace has been secured The Three Realms Explanation of the Four Continents and Explanation of the Heavens Four Continents Introduction The Name Measurement of the Earth Measurement of Mountains Measurement of Different Realms Locations Size of the Body Life Span Size of Clothing and Comparative Merits The three realms have a fixed ranking and the six realms of existence are divided into separate sectorsThose that are refined have different appearances from those that are coarse pain takes different manifestations than pleasuresIf we contemplate the origins  we are led to material form and mind these appearances and manifestations are ultimately matters of transient phenomena that come into and go out of existenceThe wheel of coming into and going out of existence is called impermanenceShadowy illusions of material form and mind are the origin of sufferingThus the Nirvana Sutra compares them to a great river the Lotus Sutra compares them to a burning houseThe Sage is enlightened and stopping the carriage  returns to the origin he transcends the three realms of existence and proceeds steadily through the ten stages of the bodhisattvas pathThe world is constituted by the combination of four basic elements when primary and secondary conditions are combined then at the appropriate time it is formed After undergoing many calamities it returns to nonexistenceThose with short life spans consider the time period between the worlds formation and destruction to be long by calling it long they reveal the brevity of their own livesEmpty space is nonexistent and therefore its size is unlimitedThe world has no ultimate boundaries and therefore it has no fixed shapeThe Dharma King rules over the great chiliocosm the Brahmā king governs the small chiliocosmakra resides at Mount SumeruThe Iron Mountains form the encircling wallThe great ocean fills the eight directions with waterThe sun and moon are the lights for the four quartersAll kinds of sentient beings live in this world as their home numerous minute conscious beings do not even think of it as unclean as mud and charcoalThey look at it from the viewpoint of those sunk in worldliness false and excessive talk is offeredThose who investigate matters in the light of the Great Way grasp truth as something familiarThe world honors the Duke of Zhou and Confucius and always follows their scripturesThe discourse on the universe remains incomplete howeverThe Book of Changes speaks of dark heaven but this does not go beyond naming it as a profound and deep realmThe Zhuangzi speaks of the blue sky but this refers only to the color of distant objectsDaoist recluses blindly accepting the Zhuangzis clarity believe that the world viewed  is blue like jade piecesConfucian scholars following scripture say that heaven is black like lacquer paintDifferent colors of blue and green are both inappropriate to describe the reality that is one and the sameCon fucian scholars and Daoist recluses offer different descriptions ignorant of the fact that reality is oneIn this way worldly people honor the name of Heaven but know nothing about its realityHow could they know anything about the marvelous beauties of the six heavens of the realm of desire or of the light that illumines Brahmās ten heavens in the realm of formKnowing nothing of the visible matters in the lower realms how could one fathom the profound truth about these higher realms that is beyond our understandingMahayana scriptures frequently speak of seeking emptiness Such scriptures as the Chang ahan jing and the Loutan jing describe the world in detailTheir descriptions both in prose and verse are extensive and cannot be discussed fullyHere I only summarize them briefly and present their essenceAccording to the Chang ahan jing  the Qishi jing  and other sourcesAt the heart of the four continents is Mount SumeruAround this mountain there are also eight other mountainsMount Sumeru is surrounded by the great ocean which is eightyfour thousand yojanas deepThe ocean surrounding the first of the eight mountains is eight thousand yojanas wide and contains the water of eight merits  Each ocean around each of the subsequent mountains is smaller than the preceding one to the same measure so that the water under the seventh mountain is one thousand two hundred and fifty yojanas wideThe saltwater ocean around these is infinitely wideOutside of this ocean is a mountain called Iron Mountain This mountain surrounds the ocean and one sun and one moon circle around day and night and illumine the four realmsAll this is called one landOne thousand of these surrounded by an iron wall are called one small thousandworldsystemOne thousand of these worldsystems again surround by an iron wall are called one middle thousand worldsystemOne thousand of these middle thousandworldsystems also surrounded by an iron wall are called one great thousandworldsystemWithin it there are millions of four continents kings of mountains suns moons and peaks It has been noted from olden times that there is a miscalculation in numbers here When the universe is formed these worlds are formed at the same time when it is destroyed they are destroyed at the same timeAll of these constitute the one location under control of one preaching buddhaThis is called the threefold thousandworldsystemIt is also called the sahā worldThe Zishi sanmei jing saysAs for the sahā world Compilers notethings of this world are hard and difficult to bear so it is designated by the word to bear the buddha there is called Nengren The world is divided into three realmsthe realm of desire the realm of form and the formless realmThe desires in the realm of desire are of four kindsdesires of emotions desires of forms desires of food and sexual desiresThe desires in the realm of form are of two kinds desires of emotions and desires of formsIn the formless realm there is only one kind of desire desire of emotionsIn the first the realm of desire all four kinds of desires are present desires are strong and forms are weakerTherefore it is called the realm of desireIn the second the realm of form forms are strong and desires are weakerTherefore it is called the realm of formIn the third the formless realm forms have disappeared and desires are inferior Therefore it is called the formless realmThe Huayan jing discusses the threefold thousandworldsystem and lists many categories but because the discussion is cumbersome it is not reproduced here The Huayan jing saysThe threefold thousandworldsystem comes to be formed from infinite numbers of causes and conditionsThe great earth is based on the wheel of water the wheel of water is based on the wheel of wind the wheel of wind is based on the wheel of spaceThe wheel of space is not based on anythingThus as the karma of sentient beings matures the world is securely constructedThe Zhidu lun says The base of the threefold thousandworldsystem is the wheel of wind The new translation of the Pusazang jing saysThe buddhas and tathāgatas have attained the wisdom beyond discursive thoughtTherefore they know about wind and rainThey know of the existence in this world of a great wind called UlubojiaAll perceptions on the part of sentient beings are due to the movement of this windThe wheel of this wind is three krośas in heightAbove this wind in the sky is another wind called Wheel of CloudThe wheel of this wind is five krośas in heightAbove this wind in the sky is yet another wind called ZhanbojiaThe wheel of this wind is ten yojanas in heightAbove this wind in the sky is yet another wind called VairambhakaThe wheel of this wind is thirty yojanas in heightAgain above this wind in the sky is another wind called Qulai The wheel of this wind is forty yojanas in heightThus āriputra one after another there are sixtyeight thousand koṭis of wheels of windThe tathāgatas with their great wisdom know all of them thoroughlyāriputra the wheel of wind at the top is called Zhoubian On it rests the wheel of water in the higher realmThat water six million eight hundred thousand yojanas in heightOn it rests the great earthThis earth is sixtyeight thousand yojanas in heightāriputra on the surface of this earth is one threefold thousandworldsystemThe Loutan jing says This earth is twenty billion li deepBelow it are golden grains also twenty billion miles deepUnder this are again diamonds again twenty billion miles deepUnder this is water eighty billion miles deepUnder this is unlimited great wind five hundred twenty billion miles deepHere there are six levelsthe first four are wheels of the earth the fifth is a wheel of water and the sixth is a wheel of windThe Jinguangming jing saysThe earth is one hundred and sixtyeight thousand yojanas deepUnder it are golden sandsGolden sands refers to golden grainsUnder this is diamond groundThe commentary saysThe front wheel of wind is hard and indestructibleA person hit it with a vajra hammer but the hammer broke into pieces and the wheel of wind suffered no damageThe great strength is the strength the fourth king of the Brahmā Heaven NarāyanaIt is also the strength of the buddha bodyThe wheel of wind is called the Narāyaṇa wind wheelAbove the wheel of wind is the wheel of water The Lishi jing saysis eleven million three hundred thousand yojanas deep three hundred and eighty thousand yojanas less than the wheel of windThe water does not scatter because of the power of sentient beings karmaJust as a storage house containing rice is held up by external objects the wheel of water is similarly held up by the wind outside and does not scatterJust as milk is refined into cream so water is refined into gold with the turning of this windThe water is eleven million three hundred thousand yojanas deepWhen refined into gold the water is only eight hundred thousand yojanas deepThe difference of three hundred and thirty thousand yojanas has become part of the ground of goldIf one moves within the wheel of gold from the part of lesser density to that of greater density the thickness of the wheel is twelve lakṣasOne lakṣa is equivalent to one hundred thousand yojanasThe diameter of this wheel is the same in all directionsThe buddhas worldhonored ones all appear and teach in this threefold thousand worldsystemThey appear and then disappear in order to teach both monastics and laypeopleIn the four realms under heaven which is illuminated by the sun and moon Mount Sumeru is situated at the center Note In the Tang dynasty it is called MiaogaoshanEarlier it was called XumishanIt is also called Miliu or MiloushanThese are all variant renderings The height of this mountain is three million three hundred and sixty thousand liIt is made of four kinds of precious materialthe eastern side of gold the southern side of blue jade the western side of silver and the northern side of crystalInside the great ocean it reaches to the depth of three million three hundred and sixty thousand liIt is based on the wheel of goldThe Qishi jing says Mount Sumeru is surrounded by eight layers of mountainsThe name of the first mountain is KhadirakaIt is fortytwo thousand yojanas in height and the width of the higher parts of this mountain is the sameIt is made of seven precious materialsThe distance between Mount Sumeru and Mount Khadiraka is eightyfour thousand

VinatakaIt is six hundred yojanas in height and the width of the higher parts of this mountain is the sameIt is made of seven precious materialsThe distance between is one thousand two hundred yojanas The circumference  is beyond measureOutside of Mount Vinataka is another mountain called CakravāḍaIt is three hundred yojanas in height and the width of the higher parts of this mountain is the sameIt is made of seven precious materialsThe distance between  is six hundred yojanas The circumference is beyond measureBetween each of the mountains listed above is always an oceanIn the water are blue lotus flowers red lotus flowers yellow lotus flowers and white lotus flowersThe water is covered with various fragrant objectsNot far from Mount Cakravāḍa is an empty space covered with green grass which is a great oceanTo the north of this ocean is a great tree called JambuIts circumference is seventy yojanasIts roots extend into the ground to a depth of twentyone yojanasIt is four hundred yojanas in height and its branches cover the ground in all four directions as far as fifty yojanasThe Chang ahan jing saysInside the empty ground of the mountain is a great ocean called YuchannaBelow this water is the passage of the universal monarch It is twelve yojanas wide and flanked on both side by seven walls seven balustrades seven jeweled nets and seven lines of treesIt is covered with decorations of seven jewelsWhen a universal monarch appears in Jambudvīpa the seawater spontaneously disappears and the road appearsNot far from this ocean is a mountain called Mount YuchannaNot far from this mountain is another mountain called Golden WallBeyond this mountain is the Snow Mountain  five hundred yojanas long and wide and five hundred yojanas in depthIn the middle of Snow Mountain is Treasure Mountain twenty yojanas in heightThe peak of Snow Mountain is one hundred yojanas in heightAt the top is Anavatapta Pond fifty yojanas long and wideThe water of this pond is clear and unpollutedIts bank is constructed from bricks of seven precious materialsThe bottom is filled with golden sandThe flowers are like wheels of chariots their stems are like their axlesFrom the hub of the flowers a milky white liquid comes out sweet like honeyTo the east of the pond is the Ganges River which flows out of Oxen Mouth and follows five hundred rivers to flow into the Eastern OceanTo the south of the pond is the Sindhu River which flows out of Lions Mouth and follows five hundred rivers to flow into the Southern OceanTo the west of the pond is the Bocha River which flows from Horses Mouth and follows five hundred rivers to flow into the Western OceanTo the north of the pond is the īta River which flows out of Elephants Mouth and follows five hundred rivers to flow into the Northern OceanDharma Master zangs Record of the Western Regions TIn the middle of Jambudvīpa is Anavatapta PondIt is located south of Fragrant Mountain and north of Great Snow MountainIts circumference is eight hundred liIts banks are decorated with blue jade and crystalIt is filled with golden sand its clear waves are like shining mirrorsBecause of the power of his vow a tenthstage bodhisattva became a dragon king and resides in the pond pouring forth clear water for the use of JambudvīpaFor this reason from the silver mouth of an ox on the eastern side of the pond flows the Ganges River The old transliterations are based on vernacular renditions The river circles around the pond once and flows into the eastern part of the South SeaFrom the golden mouth of an elephant on the southern side of the pond flows the Sindhu River The old transliteration is based on a vernacular rendition The river circles around the pond once and flows into the western part of the South SeaFrom the blue jade mouth of a horse flows the Cakṣu River The old transliteration Bocha is based on a vernacular rendition The river circles around the pond once and flows into the western part of the North SeaFrom the crystal lions mouth flows the īta River Note The old transliteration is based on a vernacular rendition The river circles around the pond once and flows into the eastern part of the North SeaSome say that the stream that goes underground and appears at Mount Jishi is a tributary of the īta River and that this is the origin of Chinas Yellow RiverAt the present time the cosmic conditions are such that there is no universal monarchIn Jambudvīpa there are four kingsTo the south is the elephant king the warm climate suits elephantsTo the west is the king of treasures the area facing the ocean is filled with treasuresTo the north is the king of horses the cold climate suits horsesTo the east is the king of human beings the climate is mild and there is a large populationThus the kingdom of the elephant king is extremely noisy People are diligent in learning and are particularly learned in unusual skillsThe land of the treasure king lacks morality and bribery is commonThe customs of the horse king are naturally violent and include killingThe land of the human king is civilized and moral principles are made clearThe culture of the king in the eastern realm is superior among those of the four kingsThe residences there have doors that open to the east and when the sun rises people face east and worship In the land of the human king the southern direction is honoredThe cultures of these kingdoms vary but they may be summarized as followsAs for the norms and decorum governing the hierarchical relationship between ruler and subject and the observance of law and properly composed writings the land of the human king cannot be further improvedIn the instruction for calming the mind and removing greed as well as in techniques that lead one beyond life and death the land of the elephant king possesses superior principlesThese are all clearly presented in scriptures which are based on local customs gathered from past and present and critically examinedHowever the Buddha appeared in the west and his teachings moved eastwardIn the course of this transmission the pronunciation became distorted and words got mixed upConsequently the meaning of these writings was often lostTherefore We must have the rectification of names It is important to be free of mistranslation The Qishi jing refTcb Chang ahan jing Tc In the middle of Anavatapta Palace is a hall of five pillarsThe dragon king Anavatapta always stays thereThe Buddha said Why is he called AnavataptaWhat is the meaningAll dragon kings in this realm of Jambudvīpa have three afflictionsOnly the Anavatapta dragon king is free from these three afflictionsWhat are these threeFirst all dragons suffer when hot wind and sands buffet their body burning their skin flesh and bone marrowOnly the Anavatapta dragon is free from this sufferingSecond in all dragon palaces violent winds arise and blow away their bejeweled clothingWith their bodies exposed the dragons sufferOnly the Anavatapta dragon is free from this sufferingThird when dragon kings are amusing each other in their palaces great garuḍa birds enter the palaces and seize themAs soon as these birds are born they wish to eat dragons so the dragons are frightened and constantly in distressOnly the Anavatapta dragon is free from this sufferingIf a garuḍa king wishes to go to this dragon it immediately diesFor this reason it is called anavatapta  The Buddha said to the monks To the right of Snow Mountain is a city called Kapila To the north of this city are the Seven Black MountainsTo the north of the Black Mountains is Fragrant MountainThe sound of music and dance is heard constantly on this mountainThere are two caves on the mountainone is called Jin and the other ShanjinThese caves are made of the seven precious materials and are as soft and fragrant as the robes of godsA beautifulsounding gandharva king lives there accompanied by five hundred gandharvasThe Shunzhengli lun saysAmong the four continents only Jambudvīpa has the vajra seatIt reaches the upper limit of the earth above and the Gold Wheel belowBodhisattvas in their last birth about to achieve the highest true insight all sit upon this seat and enter the vajra samādhiWith all the strength of the state of nirvana both with or without karmic remainder they uphold the seatThe Chang ahan jing saysThe Buddha said to the monks There are the deities of the four elementsWhat are the fourThe first is the earth godThe second is the water godThe third is the wind godThe fourth is the fire god Each of these elements contains the other threeTherefore once when the earth god held a wrong view and said that water fire and wind are absent in earth I knew what this god was thinkingSo I went to him and asked Have your ever thought and said that water fire and wind are absent in earth He answered Indeed water fire and wind are absent in earth At that time I said You should not entertain the thought that water fire and wind are absent in earthWhy is this soWater fire and wind are present in earthBecause earth is dominant it is called element  The Buddha said to the monks For the benefit of the earth god I removed his mistaken view and instructed him He was delighted and having obtained truth his eyes were openedearth fire and wind are present in water earth water and wind are present in fire earth water and fire are present windOne of these elements is dominant however and names are assigned accordingly According to the Lishi apitun lun Outside the salty ocean is a mountain called CakravāḍaparvataIt reaches to a depth of three hundred twelve and a half yojanas to the bottom of the ocean and its height above the surface of the ocean is the sameIts width is also the sameIts circumference is three trillion six hundred million ten thousand three hundred and fifty yojanasThe distance between the southern boundary of Jambudvīpa and the base of Cakravāḍaparvata is three hundred million sixty thousand six hundred and sixtythree yojanasFrom the center of Jambudvīpa eastward to the center of Pūrvavideha is three hundred million sixty thousand six hundred yojanasFrom the center of Jambudvīpa westward to the center of godāniya is three hundred million sixty thousand six hundred yojanasFrom the northern boundary of Jambudvīpa northward to the northern boundary of Uttarakuru is four hundred million seventyseven thousand five hundred yojanasOn the western side the distance between the further and closer boundaries of the water around Cakravāḍaparvata Mountain is one million two hundred thousand eight hundred and twentyfive yojanas The circumference of the boundary of the water surrounding Cakravāḍaparvata Mountain is three billion six hundred million eight thousand four hundred and seventyfive yojanasFrom the peak of this Mount Sumeru to the peak of the other Mount Sumeru is one billion two hundred million three thousand four hundred and fifty yojanasFrom the center of this Mount Sumeru to the center of another Mount Sumeru is one billion two hundred million eightythree thousand four hundred and fifty yojanasFrom the base of this Mount Sumeru to that base of the other

thousand yojanas long and wide the western continent godāniya is eight thousand yojanas long and wide the eastern continent Pūrvavideha is nine thousand yojanas long and wide and the northern continent Uttarakuru is ten thousand yojanas long and wide There are two kinds of human beingsordinary and holyIf we speak in terms of location there are four kinds namely people in the realms under the four heavensIn terms of places of residence there are altogether four thousand and eight places in the realms under the four heavens and consequently there are four thousand and eight kinds of peopleWe will confine our discussion to the location of JambudvīpaThe Loutan jing saysAltogether there are thirtysix large kingdoms There are corresponding numbers of different kinds of peopleTo speak in further details there are two thousand five hundred smaller kingdoms There are again corresponding numbers of different kinds of peopleFurthermore each kingdom has several different kinds of people such as the Hu the Han the Qiang the Lu the Fan the Yi the Chu and the Yue who differ reflecting variations in localityI will not go into details hereAgain the Loutan jing saysIn this southern Jambudvīpa there are six thousand four hundred different kinds of people I refer to them as a group not naming each of the different subgroupsThe Chang ahan jing saysThe Buddha said to the monks Surrounding the four realms under heaven are eight thousand realms under heavenThen there is the great ocean surrounding the eight thousand realmsThen there is again the great diamond mountain surrounding the great oceanOutside the great diamond mountain is again the second diamond mountainThe area between the two mountains is darkEven though the deities such as the sun and moon are very powerful they cannot illuminate with their light the eight great hells that are located there Uttarakuru in the North The Chang ahan jing saysTo the north of Mount Sumeru is a realm under heaven called UttarakuruIts ground is square ten thousand yojanas long and widePeoples faces are also square just like the shape of the landThere is a great tree called mra seven yojanas in circumference and a hundred yojanas in heightIts branches spread fifty yojanas in the four directionsThere are many mountains and bathing pondsFlowers and fruit are plentifulInnumerable birds sing in harmonySoft grasses grow on the ground in clockwise circles jade in color and with the fragrance of vārṣika flowers that bloom in the rainy seasonThey are as soft as the garments of godsThe ground is so soft that

area are Anavatapta Ponds each one hundred yojanas long and wideFour large rivers each ten yojanas wide are made of seven jewelsBirds sing in harmonyThere are no ditches or holes sharpneedled bushes

in itPots and pans appear spontaneouslyThere is also a maṇi jewel called light of flame that when it is placed under the pot its light dims when the food is cookedThere is no need for firewood and no human effort is requiredIn this place trees called bent back grow their leaves cover over each other in layers and heavenly rain does not pass throughMen and women here spend the night under these treesA fragrant tree seventy miles in height and covered with flowers and fruits also grows thereWhen its fruit ripens the skins of the fruit open spontaneously and give off a fragrant smellSome trees are sixty or fifty li tallThere is a small tree five li tall and when its fruit ripens the skin opens spontaneously and various pieces of clothing appearSometimes pieces of bodily ornaments various utensils or various kinds of food appearSometimes people there play in the river with many treasure boatsBefore going into the water the people leave their clothing on the riverbank and then board the boat After they finish playing  they return to the bank and put on their clothingWhoever comes out first puts on the first piece of clothing they find and those who come out later put on whatever clothing is left They do not look for the particular pieces of clothing they originally woreWhen they come to the fragrant tree called bent back the people take up musical instruments tune the strings and with beautiful voices they sing in harmony with the music as they walk around the garden amusing themselvesIn this place during the night Anavatapta dragons frequently go up to gather the pure clouds that cover the world and bring down sweet rainLike milk drawn from a cow the water of eight qualities nourishes the ground everywhereAfter midnight the sky is clear and cool breezes blow from the ocean The people there are comfortable and pleasedThe ground of this place is fertile and it is densely populatedWhen food and drink are needed rice grains appear spontaneously in the cooking potWhen the maṇi jewel called light of flame is placed under the pot the food is spontaneously cooked and the light of the jewel dims Everyone comes and eats as much as they wishSo long as the host

of gods There is no illnessPeople are filled with vital energy and their complexions are healthy No one shows any signs of declineThe people in this place have identical bodies and faces and are indistinguishable from each otherThey look as vigorous as people in their twenties in JambudvīpaTheir teeth are white and perfectly alignedTheir hair is dark and clean and falls to a length of eight fingers to above their eyebrows neither too long nor too shortWhen the people in this land feel desire they gaze at  and walk awayThe woman then follows him to the gardenIf the woman happens to be a relative of the mans parents and is not suitable to be his wife the tree will not provide shade for them and the two go their separate waysIf they are not related the tree then provides shade and they indulge in pleasure at their will day after day for seven days Then they leave each otherAccording to the Lishi apitun lun Tb c women and welcome them as their wives nor do they buy or sell womenWhen a man wishes to marry a woman he simply gazes at herIf the woman thinks of a man as desirable she also simply gazes at himIf a woman has not realized that a man has gazed at her the other women tell her That man has looked at youYou two are now husband and wife If a man does not realize that a woman has gazed at him the other men tell him That woman has looked at youYou two are husband and wife

Furthermore in this place whenever people urinate or defecate the ground spontaneously opens up  and when they have finished the ground closes over againThe people in this place are not obsessive nor do they accumulate propertyTheir life span is fixed and when they die they are reborn in heavenWhy is their life span fixedIn their previous lives they have practiced the ten good deedsWhen their lives ended they were reborn in UttarakuruTheir life span is one thousand years never longer or shorterTherefore the life span of the people here is exactly the same for everyoneIf a person gives to brahmans to the poor the ill and others in distress providing them with food and clothing offering rides on carriages decorative headwear perfume beds or residences or by building stupas lighting candles and making offerings when that persons life comes to an end will be reborn in Uttarakuru where their life spans will be one thousand years neither more nor lessIn this place the teaching of the ten good deeds is not offered yet everyones conduct is in accord with that teachingWhen their life there ends the person is reborn in heavenFor this reason people here are praised as being

Vehicles Attendants Distinction of Classes Wealth and Poverty and Funerals According to the teaching in the Posha lun There are thirtytwo kinds of heavensthe realm of desire has ten the realm of form has eighteen and the formless realm has fourFirst the ten heavens in the realm of desire consist of Ganshou  Chihuaman  Changfangyi  the heaven of the sun moon and stars the heaven of the four heavenly kings the thirtythree heavens  Yama Heaven Tuṣita Heaven Nirmāṇarati Heaven and Paranirmitavaśavartin HeavenNote the heaven of the sun moon and stars etcand the last four heavens are in the skyThe other five are situated on the mountainDetails are found below in the section on locations Second the eighteen heavens in the realm of form consist of the three heavens of the first meditative state Interlinear noteThese three heavens do not constitute separate realms of residenceThe Brahmapurohita deities are higher and aweinspiring and the Mahābrahmā king rules over themOf the three heavens Brahmakāyika refers to the common deities Brahmapurohita to ministers and Mahābrahmā to the rulerOnly at this first level of meditation do distinctions among ruler minister and commoner existDistinctions are absent above this level the three heavens of the second meditative state  again the three heavens of the third meditative state  and the nine heavens that exist only in the fourth meditative state Punyaprasava Fuai  Bṛhatphala Asaṃjñika NoteThis nothought heaven again is not a separate place it is the same place as the preceding one but because nonBuddhists live here it is given a separate name Abṛha Atapa Sudṛśa Sudarśaṇa and Akaniṣṭha Third the four heavens in the formless realm consist of Infinite Space  Infinite Consciousness  Nothingness  and Neither Thought nor Nothought These three realms altogether contain thirtythree kinds of heavens QuestionI do not know how many among these thirtytwo heavens are for ordinary beings and how many are for holy beings AnswerIn two of these heavens only ordinary beings live and in five only holy beings liveIn the remaining twentyfive heavens both ordinary and holy beings liveThe two in which only ordinary beings live are the Mahā brahmā Heaven of the first meditative state and the Heaven of Nothought of the fourth meditative stateThese are both places where nonBuddhists liveQuestionWhy do only ordinary beings live in these two heavensAnswerThe king of Mahābrahmā Heaven is deficient in positive karmic causesHe says that only he can produce heaven earth and all beings and because of this they arrogantly despise all holy beings and refuse to live in the same place as these beingsIn the Heaven of Nothought only nonBuddhists who have practiced the nothought meditation are born and receive the karmic reward of being in the state of nothought for five hundred world agesNonBuddhists cannot achieve nirvanaWhen their rewards have been exhausted they are bound to follow wrong views and be reborn in hellFor this reason holy beings are never born thereThe abovementioned five heavens where only holy beings live refer to the five heavens of pure beings  above Bṛhatphala through Abṛha Atapa This is where nonreturners and arhats liveIf an ordinary being is born there they proceed to obtain a nonreturners body achieve the four meditative states and issue forth untainted wisdom and meditative work filled with good perfuming effectsSome engage in the five kinds of practices and are reborn thereOrdinary beings lack these meditative works filled with good perfuming effects and for this reason they are not reborn thereIt is correct and without doubt that nonreturners are born thereQuestionArhats are free from rebirthHow is it that they are said to be born thereAnswerOne should say that nonreturners of the realm of desire are born there and achieve arhatshipIt is not that they are first arhats and are then reborn thereThe abovementioned remaining twentyfive heavens where both ordinary beings and superior beings live together cannot be discussed in detail hereGenerally according to the teachings of the Small and Great Vehicles there are four categories of heavensThe Niepan jing saysThere are four kinds of heavensthe worldly heaven the heavens of rebirths the pure heaven and the heaven of truthworldly heaven are like kingsThe heavens of rebirths refer to the various heavens from the heaven of the four heavenly kings to the heaven of Neither Thought Nor NothoughtThe pure heaven is for streamwinners through pratyekabuddhasThe heaven of truth is for bodhisattvas of the ten stagesWhy is it called truthBodhisattvas of the ten stages are called the heaven of truth because they understand the truth of the teaching well and see into the truth of the emptiness of all beingsDiscussing the heavens of four heavenly kings the Chang ahan jing ref Tca saysThe eastern heavenly king is called Dhṛtarāṣṭra the name is translated into Chinese as Governed Realm Ruler The Dazhidu lun refTb gives a slightly different transcription He rules over the gandharva and piśāca generals guarding people in Pūrvavideha against invasionThe southern heavenly king is called Virūḍhaka the name is translated into Chinese as Increase Heaven Ruler The Dazhidu lun refTb gives a slightly different transcription He rules over the kumbhāṇḍa and preta ghost generals guarding people in Jambudvīpa against invasionThe western heavenly king is called Virūḍhaka the name is translated into Chinese as Mixed Words RulerThe Dazhidu lun Tb gives a slightly different transcription He rules over the dragon and pūtana ghost generals guarding people in Apara godānīya against invasionThe northern heavenly king is called Vaiśravaṇa the name is translated into Chinese as Wide Hearing Heaven Rulerthe Dazhidu lun Tb gives a slightly different transcription He rules over the yakṣa and rākṣasa generals guarding people in Uttara kuru against invasionThe Dazhidu lun saysThe god akras full name in Sanskrit is akradevānam Indraakra is translated in Chinese as able deva is translated as god and indra is translated as lord Together the name means able lord of gods The name of the god Suyāma is translated in Chinese as very good Tuṣita is translated in Chinese as wellsatisfied Nirmāṇarati is translated in Chinese as enjoying transformation vaśavartin is translated in Chinese as enjoying freely what others produced by transformation The king of Brahmā Heaven is called Sikhi which is translated in Chinese as great top or great vessel uddhāvāsa is translated in Chinese as pure dwelling Note The Dazhidu lun explains the meaning of each name one after anotherThe names of higher heavens are the same as those listed in the Posha lun For the sake of concision they are not reproduced here The Zhong ahan jing saysAt one time another monk approached the Buddha and paid respect by bowing to the Buddhas feetAfter withdrawing to a corner he addressed the Buddha Worldhonored One why is akra  called by this name The Buddha replied to the monk In a previous life akra was a human being and performed spontaneous givingHe gave drink food money goods and lamps to monks and brahmans who were poor and in distressBecause he was strong enough to do this he is called akradevānām Indra Why is he called Puraṃdara The Buddha said When he was a human being in a previous life he frequently  and performed giving offering clothing drink food lamps and so onFor this reason he is called Puraṃdara Why is he also called Maghavā The Buddha said When he was a human being in a previous life his name was MaghavāSo he is called by his original name Why is he also called Vāsava The Buddha said When he was a human being in a previous life he offered a gift of robes So he is called Vāsava Why is he also called Kauśika The Buddha said When he was a human being in a previous life his surname was Kauśika Why is he also called Sujāṃpati The Buddha said Because Sujā is the first empress of this heavenly emperor Why is he also called Thousand Eyes  The Buddha said When he was a human being in a previous life he was intelligent and wiseIn one sitting he could consider a thousand matters observing and investigating them Why is he also called Tili The Buddha said Because this heavenly emperor is the ruler of the thirtytwo heavens The Buddha said to the monk When akradevānām Indra was a human being in a previous life he practiced seven kinds of virtuous deeds and because of this he was able to become this deityWhat are the sevenThe list begins with serving ones parents and ends with making offerings to everyone equallyThe content of these deeds are described in the verse in the scripture  QuestionWhat deeds produce the karmic effects leading to each of the six realms of existenceAccording to the Dazhidu lun The karmic causes of the six realms of existence are none other than good and evil deedsEach has three subcategoriesThe higher category leads to birth in heaven the middle to birth as human being and the lower to birth in the four inferior realmsAccording to this theory only the higher subcategory of good deeds leads to birth in heavenno distinction is made between general practice and meditationThe Yebao chabie jing discusses the ten good deeds that lead to rebirth in heaven in detailed terms of the distinctions between general practice and meditation and the distinction of three realmsThe scripture says There are also ten good deeds that lead sentient beings to birth in the heavens of the realm of desireIf they practice the superior ten good deeds they can be reborn in the heavens of the realm of desireThis refers to general good deeds of the realm of desireThere are also ten good deeds that lead sentient beings to birth in the heavens of the realm of formIf they practice the tainted ten good deeds they can be reborn in the heavens of the realm of formThese correspond to meditation This refers to the meditative good deeds of the realm of formThere are also the four karmic deeds that can lead sentient beings to rebirth in the formless realmfirst the meditation of emptiness that goes beyond all thoughts of forms and destroys all dualistic thought second the meditation of consciousness that goes beyond all meditations of emptiness third the meditation of nonexistence that goes beyond all meditations of consciousness fourth the meditation of nothought and its negation that goes beyond all meditations of nonbeingBy means of these good deeds they obtain rebirth of the formless realmIf someone asks why the ten good deeds are not mentioned in regard to this last realm one should reply that one in the formless realm has transcended form and disregards such things as the body and speech For this reason one only speaks of four karmic deeds and not of the ten good deedsHowever the views expressed above are all the teaching of the Tathāgata He distinguished the different retributions for different kinds of deeds Causes and effects match each other without error According to the Shanjie jingMonks uphold two hundred and fifty precepts and nuns uphold three hundred and seventyeight preceptsThere are also deeds that lead to birth in heavenThus a verse in the Sifenljieben Tc Tb happiness fame wealth and birth in heaven after death This refers to the heaven in the realm of desireThe Zhengfanian jing says Some uphold the precepts of not killing not stealing and not engaging in immoral sexual conduct for these three good deeds they are reborn in heavenThis also refers to rebirth in a heaven in the realm of desireIn the teachings given by the Buddha on different occasions such heavenly rebirth is not attributed solely to these three causesAccording to the Wenshi jing  by bathing a monk as an act of spiritual purity one can be reborn in heaven or in higher realmsThis too is the Buddhas teaching on a different occasionIt is not that by bathing a monk one can be reborn in all higher realms one can be reborn only in the heavens of the realm of desireFurthermore according to the Nirvana Sutra A loving mother tries to save her child in the Ganges River but both the mother and child die and are reborn in the Brahmā HeavenThis refers to general worldly love and it is not supported by other good deeds of Buddhist meditationHow can lead to rebirth in heavenIt must have resulted from other distant causes and was not mere worldly love that caused rebirth in heavenThe teaching that by simply hearing once the word nirvana one can avoid falling into the four inferior realms of rebirth is also intended in the same wayTherefore the Zhenfanian jing teachesBy following the seven precepts of not killing not stealing not engaging in immoral sexual conduct not telling lies not engaging in insincere flattery not uttering slanderous words and not speaking harshly one can be reborn in the heaven of the four heavenly kingsBy upholding seven kinds of precepts one can be reborn in the heavens There are three kindsBy upholding the precept of not killing one can be reborn in the place of the four heavenly kings By upholding the precepts of not killing and not stealing one can be reborn in the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods By upholding the precepts of not killing not stealing and not engaging in immoral sexual conduct one can be reborn in Yama HeavenBy upholding the precepts of not killing not stealing not engaging in immoral sexual conduct not lying not uttering slanderous words not speaking harshly and not engaging in insincere flattery one can be reborn in Tuṣita HeavenAccepting worldly precepts and having faith in Buddhist precepts not killing not stealing not engaging in immoral sexual conduct not lying not uttering slanderous words not speaking harshly and not engaging in insincere flattery one can be reborn in Nirmāṇarati Heaven and Paranirmitavaśavartin HeavenThe Chang ahan jing sayshad earlier engaged in spiritual cultivation under the Buddha and when their lives here ended they were born in the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods  causing the deities in that heaven to increase their five benefitsfirst their life span in heaven second their appearance in heaven third their reputation in heaven fourth their pleasures fifth their power in heavenThe Za ahan jing saysThen the Worldhonored One said to the monks In the past in the kingdom of Kosalā there was a lute player called GuttilaHe wandered among the people of Kosalā and rested in a fieldSix heavenly maidens from the great heavenly palace came to the where the lute player Guttila was staying in the kingdom of Kosalā and spoke to him saying Uncle play the lute for usWe will sing and dance The lute player Guttila said Sisters it should be this wayI will play the lute for you and you will tell me who is born in heaven and for what reason they are born there The heavenly maidens said As you play the lute we will sing and dance and the song we sing will explain the conditions for being born in heaven then played the lute and the six heavenly maidens sang and dancedThe first maiden sang these verses As a man I gave a woman the gift of a beautiful robe Because of this gift of a robe I obtained this superior rebirth  For giving something that I cherished I was reborn in heaven and have everything as I wish I live in a palace fly up and travel in the sky With the body of a heavenly being made of gold I am the best among a hundred heavenly maidens Observe this merit which is the highest example of redirected merit The second maiden sang these versesAs a man I gave a woman the gift of quality perfume Because of this gift of something I cherished I was reborn in heaven and have everything as I wish I live in a palace fly up and travel in the sky With the body of a heavenly being made of gold I am the best among a hundred heavenly maidensObserve this merit which is the highest example of redirected merit The third maiden sang these verses As man I gave a woman the gift of food Because of this gift of something I cherished I was reborn in heaven and have everything as I wish I live in a palace fly up and travel in the skyWith the body of a heavenly being made of gold I am the best among a hundred heavenly maidens Observe this merit which is the highest example of redirected merit The fourth maiden sang these verses As I recall a previous life I was someones maidservant I did not steal nor was I greedy Tirelessly I engaged in spiritual cultivationTaking for myself only a measured amount of food I divided my food and offered assistance to the poor Now I live in a palace fly up and travel in the sky With the body of a heavenly being made of gold I am the best among a hundred heavenly maidens Observe this merit which is the highest example of making offerings The fifth maiden sang these verses As I recall a previous life I was someones wife My motherinlaw had a violent temper Constantly criticizing meI upheld the moral principles and cultivated the proper ways of behaving as a woman humble and obedient Now I live in a palace fly up and travel in the sky With the body of a heavenly being made of gold I am the best among a hundred heavenly maidens Observe this merit which is the highest example of making offerings The sixth maiden sang these versesI once encountered some monks and nuns I heard from them the correct teaching and after a short while received the lay precepts Now I live in a palace fly up and travel in the sky With the body of a heavenly being made of gold I am the best among a hundred heavenly maidens Observe this merit which is the highest example of making offerings Thereupon the lute player Guttila of Kosalā kingdom uttered the following versesLuckily I came here to the forest of Kosalā And was able to see these heavenly maidens with most beautiful heavenly bodies Having seen them and heard them teach I should with increased effort cultivate good deeds Because of the merits of this new effort I will be able to be born in heaven When had finished saying this the heavenly maidens disappearedBirth in the Heavens of the Four Heavenly Kings According to the Chang ahan jing and the Dazhidu lun the gods in the heavens of the four heavenly kings all marry and satisfy their desires just as do human beingsBut they are born by transformationTheir newborns are like twoyearold human children and sit on lapsAccording to the Shunzhengli lun as noted below they are like fiveyearold human childrenAccording to another scripture a newly born male child sits on his mothers right knee and a female child sits on her mothers left knee Shortly after a newborn has arrived they become thirsty and hungrySpontaneous jeweled vessels filled with a hundred different kinds of food appearIn the case of those with greatest amount of merit the color of the rice is white in the case of those with an average amount of merit it is blue in the case of those with smallest amount  it is redIf they are thirsty the jeweled vessel fills with sweet juiceThe color varies as in the case of the foodThey do not keep what is left of the drink but throw it into fire just as in the case of gheeBy the time they finish eating they are the same size as the other godsWhen they are first born they still remember their previous lives but as they play they forget themBirth in the Heaven of the Thirtythree The Piyeposhenrenwen jing saysThe Great Sage should know thisIn the Heaven of the Thirtythree the gods play and have funGoing through the forest if the mind  sees a male deity and a female deity sitting together it is overjoyed and is quickly reborn thereJust like a bead threaded on a string will run straight along the string when one end of the string is pulled that sentient being will not be reborn elsewhereWhen the sentient being is about to be born there a flower appears in the hand of the female deityWhen she sees it she realizes that she is pregnantShe then takes the flower and gives it to her husband saying I am going to have a childBe happy Seeing this the male deity is delighted knowing that his wife is bearing a divine childThe two deities are pleased and after seven days have passed the sentient being with long hair pure and uncontaminated endowed with a gods clothing is born in that heavenDuring the seven days he entertains the thought I withdraw from suchandsuch place to be born in this heaven I will perform good deeds for my parents he is filled with joyWith joy desire appears and the sentient being immediately goes to that place in heaven just as a drunken elephant stumblesHis nose is like an elephant round and long and his chest is flat and gold in color His upper and lower body is large while it is narrow in the middleHis gait is cautious He is thoughtful and courageousHis waist bends like a bow and his back is straightHis thighs are large like banana plantsHe knows the laws of heaven well His beard is very short He has the strong fragrance of the godsHis nails are thin and his body is cleanWithout help from anyone he dresses and adorns himselfThere is no illness in heavenHe gradually grows up in the palace where there is no masterWhen the heavenly maidens see him they gather around him saying Holy child welcomeIn this palace we have no husband who is our masterWe have long been separated from our husband and have only childrenWe are young endowed with beautiful featuresWe will provide milk just as if it were to come from a golden jarOur faces are of the color of a newly opened lotus flowerWe move like lightning We are attractive and pleasingWe are heavenly maidensWe will now serve youThis is a place for seeking pleasure In this way the women approach the child and serve himIn the Heaven of Thirtythree Gods is the Hall of Good Teaching the place where the gods gather togetherIt has eightyfour thousand pillars each made of jewelsWithin it is free of troublesome vermin such as mosquitoes and fliesNor are there any difficulties such as sleepiness and exhaustionInfinite numbers of heavenly maidens offer fun and pleasure as one wishesSuch troubles as jealousy and fighting are absentThe cheeks of the heavenly maidens are pure and spotless like the mirror of the round moonWith their own methods using perfume and colors they decorate their facesThese maidens sing and entertain each other The Qishi jing saysIn that heaven either from a male or female deity as they sit the newborn suddenly appears near the knees or between the thighsWhen the new creature has just been born he or she looks like a twelveyearold human childIf a male child he is born somewhere around the knees of the sitting male deityIf a female child she is born between the thighs of a female deityAs soon as the child is born the deity says that he or she is his or her childWhen the child is born because of his or her previous karma the child entertains three kinds of thoughtsfirst the child recalls where he or she died second the child realizes where he or she has just been reborn third the child realizes that this rebirth is the fruit of his or her previous karma that it is the reward for meritHaving entertained these thoughts the newborn thinks of eatingImmediately many jeweled vessels appear in front of the newborn each spontaneously filled with heavenly food of different colorsThe Shunzhengli lun saysWhat is the size of the bodies of the gods who have just been born in the six heavens in the realm of desireWhen gods are born in these heavens their bodies are the same size as those of five six seven eight nine or tenyearold human beings respectivelyAfter birth they quickly grow to their full sizesWhen the deities of the heavens in the realm of desire are born their bodies are fully grown and they are wearing beautiful heavenly robesAll the gods speak the holy language Thus their language is identical to that of Central IndiaTherefore they understand the language of the scriptures without studying itThe Qishi jing says At the foot of Mount Sumeru are three levels of areas in which gods liveThe lowest level is sixty yojanas wide and deep the second level is forty yojanas wide and deep and the highest level is twenty yojanas wide and deepEach has seven layers of walls surrounding the palaceNumerous birds sing beautiful songs and nothing anyone might wish for is lackingIn each of these levels yakṣas also liveIn the middle part of Mount Sumeru at the height of fortytwo thousand yojanas is the palace where the four heavenly kings liveAt the top of Mount Sumeru is the palace of the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods This is where akra livesAbove the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods is Yama HeavenAbove that is Tuṣita HeavenAbove that is Nirmāṇarati HeavenAbove that is Paranirmitavaśavartina HeavenAbove that is Brahmakāyika HeavenBelow Brahmakāyika Heaven in the space between it and the heaven below is the palace of Māra the Evil OneAbove Brahmakāyika Heaven is

HeavenAbove Akaniṣṭha Heaven are further heavensthe of Unbounded Emptiness the Heaven of Unbounded Consciousness the of Nonexistence the of Neither Thought Nor NothoughtThese names all refer to places where gods liveIn these differently marked areas different sentient beings live coming and going appearing and disappearingAll beings in this world undergo birth aging illness and death and are reborn in different realms The highest realm in which they can be reborn are these heavensThis world is called the sahā worldInnumerable worlds in all directions are also like this worldThe Lishi apitun lun saysTwo hundred thousand yojanas below Jambudvīpa is Avīci HellOne hundred thousand yojanas below Jambudvīpa is the location of the hell of Yamas worldBetween these two are other hells This treatise does not discuss the distances among these hells Four hundred thousand yojanas above here is the place where the four heavenly kings liveEight hundred thousand yojanas above here is the location where the thirtythree gods liveOne million six hundred thousand yojanas above here is the location where the gods of Yama Heaven liveThree million two hundred thousand yojanas above here is the location where the gods of Tuṣita Heaven liveSix million four hundred thousand yojanas above here is the location where the gods of Nirmāṇarati Heaven liveTwelve million eight hundred thousand yojanas above here is the location where the gods of Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven liveA monk asked the Buddha How far is it from Jambudvīpa to Brahmās place The Buddha said The distance between Jambudvīpa and Brahmās place is very farSuppose on the fifteenth day of the ninth month when the moon is full a person in Brahmās place dropped a rock measuring one hundred square zhang downward which fell without obstruction through the space in between it would not reach the ground of Jambudvīpa until the full moon in the ninth month of the following yearApramāṇābha Heaven is still further by the same distanceFrom Apramāṇābha Heaven to bhāsvara Heaven is again the same distanceFrom bhāsvara Heaven to Parīttaśubha Heaven is again the same distanceFrom Parīttaśubha Heaven to Apramāṇaśubha Heaven is

Atapa Heaven is again the same distanceFrom Atapa Heaven to Akaniṣṭha Heaven is again the same distanceFrom Akaniṣṭha to the ground of Jambudvīpa If one were to throw a dense rocky mountain After sixtyfive thousand five hundred and twentythree years with no obstacles in the space in between The rocky mountain will reach Jambudvīpa The Dazhidu lun saysIf someone were to throw a one squarezhang rock from the edge of the heavens of the realm of desire it would take eighteen thousand three hundred and eightytwo years before it reached the ground hereThe Three Realms The Zaxin lun says Seven subatomic particles form an atom These are the smallest unitsdivine eyes can see them and bodhisattvas and universal monarchs can also see themSeven atoms form a molecule of metalSeven molecules of metal form a molecule of waterSeven molecules of water form a molecule of the tip of a rabbits hairSeven molecules the size of the tip of a rabbits hair form a molecule  of a sheeps hairSeven molecules the size of the tip of a sheeps hair form a molecule of a cows hairSeven molecules the size of the tip of a cows hair form a particle of dust  seven dust particles form a lice eggSeven lice eggs form a liceSeven lice form a particle of wheatSeven wheat particles form one aṅgula Twentyfour aṅgulas is a hastaka Four hastakas is a dhanu Five hundred dhanus is one krośaEight krośas is one yojana Thus a verse saysSeven paramāṇus forms one aṇu Seven aṇus forms one metal molecule A particle of water the hairs of a rabbit and cow Each follows as the preceding is multiplied by sevenThus in the treatises the sizes of the gods from the four heavenly kings to the gods in Akaniṣṭha Heaven are measures by krośasThus the Posha lun says The bodies of the four heavenly kings are a quarter krośa in height According to the Zhengfanian jing The size of gods of the four heavens is the same as that of their kings The Abhidharma also says the same The size of the gods in the Heaven of Thirtythree Gods is onehalf krośa in heightThat of akra is one krośaThe size of the gods in Yama Heaven is two quarterkrośas in height The body of akra is taller than that of Yama because in a past life he singlemindedly devoted himself to pious works The gods in Tuṣita Heaven are one krośa tall just like the gods in akras heavenThe gods in Nirmāṇarati Heaven are one and onequarter krośas in heightThe gods in Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven are one and onehalf krośas in heightSecond as for the sizes of the gods in the realm of form the Za apitanxin lun saysThe gods in Brahmakāyika Heaven are onehalf

Heaven are thirtytwo yojanas in heightThe gods in ubhakṛtsna Heaven are sixtyfour yojanas in heightThe gods in Fuqing Heaven are one hundred and twentyfive yojanas in heightThe gods in Puṇyaprasava Heaven are two hundred and fifty yojanas in heightThe gods in Bṛhatphala Heaven are five hundred yojanas in heightThe gods in the Heaven of Nothought are the sameThe gods in Abṛha Heaven are one thousand yojanas in heightThe gods in Atapa Heaven are two thousand yojanas in heightThe gods in Sudarśana Heaven are four thousand yojanas in heightThe gods in Sudṛśa Heaven are eight thousand yojanas in heightThe gods in Akaniṣṭha Heaven are sixteen thousand yojanas in heightThird the formless realm transcends physical shapes and cannot be described in wordsQuestionWhat are the heavenly robes likeAccording to the scriptures the gods in the six heavens of the realm of desire wear heavenly robes and freely fly about everywhereTheir clothing looks like robes but emits light and it is not like the ordinary brocade of our worldThe clothing of the gods in the realm of form is also called heavenly robes but its light constantly changes sometimes brighter and sometimes more beautiful and it cannot be describedThe Qishi jing saysThe four heavenly kings are onehalf yojana tall their robes are one yojana long and onehalf yojana wide and they weigh onehalf liangThe gods in the Heaven of the Thirtythree are one yojana tall their robes are two yojanas long and one yojana wide and weigh onehalf liangThe gods in Yama Heaven are two yojanas tall their robes are four yojanas long and weigh onequarter of onehalf liangThe gods in Tuṣita Heaven are four yojanas tall their robes are eight yojanas long and four yojanas wide and weigh oneeighth of onehalf liangThe gods in Nirmāṇarati

thirtytwo yojanas wide and weigh one sixtyfourth of onehalf liangIn the many heavens above these the size of the gods bodies and their robes are no differentThe Qishi jing says The robes of the gods in the various heavens of the realm of desire are decorated in many different ways and cannot be described in detailIn the two heavens of Nirmāṇarati and Paranirmitavaśavartin however the sizes of the gods robes follow what is in their minds and the weight of their robes is likewiseThe gods in the realm of form do not wear robes but look as if they doTheir heads do not have hair and look like heavenly crownsThere is no distinction between male and female forms there is only one gender The Chang ahan jing saysThe robes of the gods in the Heaven of the Thirtythree weigh six zhu The robes of the gods in Yama Heaven weigh three zhuThe robes of the gods in Tuṣita Heaven weigh one and a half zhuThe robes of the gods in Nirmāṇarati Heaven weigh one zhuThe robes of the gods in Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven weigh onehalf zhuThe Shunzhengli lun says The moment the gods of the realm of form are born their bodies are fully developed and covered by clothing The Za apitanxin lun saysAs for the life spans of the gods fifty years for human beings is one day and night for the four heavenly kingsCalculating in terms of days and months five hundred years the life span of the four heavenly kings equals nine million human years based on the calendar of the sun and moonSimilarly taking one day and one night in Revivifying Hell and calculating the time period in terms of days and

the formless realm in the Heaven of Emptiness is twentythousand world ages in the Heaven of Consciousness it is forty thousand world ages in the Heaven of Nothingness it is sixty thousand world ages in the Heaven of Neither Thought Nor Nothought it is eighty thousand world agesIn all the three realms some beings die without fulfilling their life spansOnly in Uttarakuru for the finalbody bodhisattvas in Tuṣita Heaven and in the Heaven of Nothought is the life span fixed and there is no such thing as not fulfilling ones life span In other cases some die before fulfilling their life spansThe Shunzhengli lun also agrees though it saysIn the realm of human beings people in Uttarakuru are endowed with the strongest powers of merit and even those of inferior capacities who indulge in physical pleasures do not receive punishment and after death are reborn in heaven without fail Otherwise this work agrees with the views cited aboveQuestionAt the time of the world age of fire when the great conflagration marks the end of the world the fire reaches the heavenly realm of the first meditative state and burns up everythingWhy does the Za apitanxin lun cited above claim that the ruler of Mahābrahmā Heaven survives for a period of one and a half world ages AnswerThe one and a half world ages here refers to the theory that takes sixty minor world ages as one and a half world ageThis world age is not a major world ageAccording to the theory that speaks of the major world ages of water fire and wind the major world age consists of eighty minor world agesThe life span in the sixty minor world ages is still shorter by twenty minor world ages than this major world age that includes destruction by fireThere is no contradiction between this theory and the comment about the life span of one and a half world ages How do we know thisThe old Jushe lun calls an anatarkalpa a special world age The Lishi apitan lun calls it the minor world age The new Jushe lun Tworld age These three names refer to the same thing and the duration involved is the sameAccording to the gamas  the human life span was at first eightyfour thousand yearsEvery one hundred years it decreased by one year until it became ten yearsThen it began to increase  until it again became eightyfour thousandOne cycle of this increase and decrease is called a medium world age  According to the Jushe lun the period that comes to an end when heaven and earth undergo the three calamities and their course is exhausted is called a greater world age Going through the calamities of water fire and wind one by one takes eighty medium world agesAs one medium world age comes to an end another medium world age comes into beingIn the course of nineteen medium world ages different kinds of sentient beings gradually come to existFor a period of twenty medium world ages all things existThen in the course of the next nineteen medium world ages things are gradually destroyedThen in one medium world age fire water and wind destroy the environmentIn the course of nineteen medium world ages hunger illness and destroy sentient beings The comment about the life span of one and a half world ages can be accommodated within this theoryThe Abhidharma also speaks in the same vein speaking of the place that exists and the place that is emptied first refZa apitanxin lun TThis is the place that becomes empty at the very endThe realm in which the sentient beings first come to exist is not fixedIn the world age of fire it is the realm of the first In the world age of water it is the realm of the second meditative stateIn the world age of wind it is the realm of the third meditative stateIf we follow this theory then one great world age includes these sixty medium world ages plus twenty special world ages of emptinessAltogether there are eighty special world agesThe major world age and its subdivisions are distinguished in this wayLet us now show how there is no contradictionIt is said above that the life span of the gods in Brahmakāyika Heaven is onehalf a world ageYou should know that this means half a world age in reference to  special world age thus it means twenty medium world agesSecond the life span of the gods in Brahmapurohita Heaven is one world ageThis means one special world age or forty medium world agesThird the life span of the gods in Mahābrahmā Heaven is one and a onehalf world agesYou should know that this refers to one and a half special world ages or sixty medium world agesGiven this way of calculation there is no contradictionThis explains the matter with regard to the first meditative stateFrom the second meditative state on you should calculate in terms of the major world ages of the three calamities and not use medium or special world ages as units of calculationIn the second meditative state the life span in the first heaven called Parīttābha is two world ages in the second heaven called Apramāṇābha it is four world ages and in the third heaven called bhāsvara it is eight world agesIf someone asks Since the calamity of water reaches the realm of the second meditative state how can the gods in bhāsvara Heaven have a life span of eight world ages we should remind him of the followingAfter seven calamities of fire the calamity of water occurs and this reaches the realm of the second meditative stateTherefore the bhāsvara gods can have a life span of eight major world agesIn the third meditative state the life span in the first heaven called Parīttaśubha is sixteen world ages the life span in the second heaven called Apra māṇaśubha is thirtytwo world ages the life span in the third heaven called ubhakṛtsna is sixtyfour world agesIf someone asks Since the calamity of wind reaches the realm of the third meditative state how can the gods in ubhakṛtsna Heaven have a life span of sixtyfour world ages we should remind them of the followingAfter sixtythree calamities either of water or of fire the calamity of wind occursTherefore the ubhakṛtsna gods can have a life span of sixtyfour world agesHow do we know that this is the caseAccording to the Abhidharma seven calamities of fire occur one after another and then the calamity of water occursThus by the time the sequence of seven times seven or fortynine calamities of fire is completed seven calamities of water would have occurred Altogether fiftysix world ages would have passedThen after these fiftysix world ages seven calamities of water occur again and it is after these seven calamities of fire that the calamity of wind occurs and its destruction reaches the realms of the third meditative stateAltogether including the preceding ones this takes sixtyfour world agesFollowing this reasoning the ubha kṛtsna gods can have a life span of sixtyfour world ages Thus a verse in the Abhidharma saysSeven fires pass one after another And then one calamity of water occurs After seven times seven fires and seven waters And still another seven fires the calamity of wind occurs QuestionIn the case of the four heavens of the formless realm the life span in the Heaven of Consciousness is twice as long as that in the Heaven of SpaceWhy is it that for the even higher two heavens the life span is not doubledAnswerThe Posha lun reproduces three different explanations of this matter offered by doctrinal mastersThe first explanation is as followsIn the two heavens of Infinite Space and Infinite Consciousness there exist the practice of infinitude and the rest of the allsensefields meditative practices This is the reason the life span is doubled in the latterIn the Heaven of Infinite Space the infinitude practice results in a life span of ten thousand world ages other practices result in an additional life span of ten thousand world agesAltogether a life span of twenty thousand world ages is obtainedIn the Heaven of Infinite Consciousness the infinitude practice results in a life span of twenty thousand world ages other practices result in an additional life span of twenty thousand world agesAltogether the life span of forty thousand world ages is obtainedIn the heavens above these there is no infinitude practice and consequently the life span is not doubledThis is the first explanationA second explanation by another doctrinal master is as followsIn these two heavens of Space and Consciousness there exist the two kinds of practices namely meditation and wisdomThis is the reason why the life span is doubled in the latterthe practice of meditation results in a life span of ten thousand world ages the practice of wisdom results in an additional life span of ten thousand world agesAltogether the life span of twenty thousand world ages is obtainedIn the Heaven of Infinite Consciousness the practice of meditation results in a life span of twenty thousand world ages the practice of wisdom results in an additional life span of twenty thousand world agesAltogether the life span of forty thousand world ages is obtainedIn the two heavens above these there exists only the practice of meditation the practice of wisdom is absentFor this reason the life span is not doubledThis is the second explanationThe third explanation by a yet another doctrinal master is as followsThe fixed life span in each of the four heavens of the formless realm is only twenty thousand world agesThrough rejecting or failing to reject desires the life span is doubled or not doubled in the different heavensIn the Heaven of Infinite Space the gods fail to reject the desires that belong to this realmTherefore their life span is only twenty thousand world agesIn the realm of Infinite Consciousness the fixed life span is twenty thousand world agesDue to rejecting the desires of the Heaven of Infinite Space another twenty thousand world ages are addedThis doubles the former and results in a life span of forty thousand world agesIn the Heaven of Nothingness the fixed life span is twenty thousand world agesDue to rejecting the desires of the heavens of Infinite Space and Infinite Consciousness another forty thousand world ages are addedIn the Heaven of Neither Thought Nor Nothought twenty thousand world ages is the fixed life spanDue to rejecting the desires of the lower three heavens another sixty thousand world ages are addedBecause of this calculation the life span in the realm of Neither Thought Nor Nothought is eighty thousand world agesThese are the three explanationsThe truth is revealed in these QuestionDescribe the places where the gods liveAnswerAccording to the Posha lun Although there are thirtytwo heavens there are only twentyeight dwelling placesThe four heavens of the formless realm transcend forms there are no dwelling places thereThese gods dwell everywhere in the two realms of desire and formWhen their lives end sentient beings who have completed the work that leads to rebirth in the four heavens of the formless realm immediately receive the karmic retribution of rebirth in the formless realmAlthough there are no specific places this rebirth is different from that in the realm of form taught in the Great VehicleThe twentyeight dwelling places are located on Mount SumeruFour thousand yojanas above the ground level in the space around the mountain that is ten thousand yojanas long and wide is the place where the Karoṭa pāṇi gods dwellGoing up further the same distance at eight thousand yojanas is the place where the Mālādhara gods dwellGoing up further the same distance and surrounding the mountain at a distance of four thousand yojanas is the place where the Sadāmatta gods dwellGoing up further the same distance and surrounding the mountain at a distance of four thousand yojanas is the place where the gods of the sun moon and stars dwellGoing up further the same distance and surrounding the mountain at a distance of four thousand yojanas is the place where the four heavenly kings dwell Inside this place are seven golden mountainsThe residential areas of the cities of the four heavenly kings are all situated inside these mountains Going up further forty thousand yojanas one reaches the top of Mount Sumeru forty thousand yojanas wide and long this is the place where Indras city called Sudarśana is situated it is ten thousand yojanas long and wide and equipped with one thousand gatesThis is the place where the thirtythree gods dwellGoing up further forty thousand yojanas above this mountain is a place cloudlike and made of seven jewels that is shaped like the groundThis is the place where the god Yama dwellsGoing up further the same distance is a ground cloudlike and made of seven jewels where Tuṣita Heaven is locatedGoing up further the same distance is a ground cloudlike and made of seven jewels where Nirmāṇarati Heaven is situatedGoing up further the same distance is a ground cloudlike and made of seven jewels where Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven is locatedIn this way up to Akaniṣṭha Heaven the highest heaven of the realm of form each heaven has a ground that is cloudlike and made of seven jewels The heavens are separated from each other by the same distanceThe repetitive comments for these heavens are not reproduced hereThe Shunzhengli lun saysThe Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods is located at the summit of Mount SumeruThe four sides of the peak are each twenty thousand longThus the entire circumference equals to eighty thousand Some doctrinal masters say that each side is eighty thousand longThe lengths of the bottom and top of each side are identicalIn each of the four corners at the top is a peak that is five hundred in height and widthA yakṣa called Vajrapāṇi lives there and protects the heavensAt the top of this mountain is also a palace called Sudarśana twentyfive thousand long on each side altogether ten thousand in circumferenceThe golden wall is one and half highIts ground is flat and is also made of pure gold decorated with one hundred and one different kinds of jewelsThe floor is as soft as cotton and when one steps upon it it cushions the impactThis is where the Indras city is locatedThe city has a thousand gates which are beautifully decorated Five hundred bluerobe yakṣas fearsome in appearance and each one yojana tall armored and bearing weapons guard the city gatesInside the city is the Vaijayanta Hall decorated with various beautiful jewels The jewels cover this heavenly palace and so this palace is called Vaijayanta Each side is two hundred and fifty long the circumference is one thousand Within this city are many lovely things outside along all four sides are beautifully decorated gardens where the gods play togetherChariot Garden  in which different kinds of chariots appear in accordance with the power of each god Roughness Garden  where when the gods are about to go to battle weapons appear according to their needs Mixed Grove Garden  in which the gods enter to play the same game and have a lot of fun and Pleasure Grove Garden  in which different kinds of very subtle objects of desire appear together and one never tires of seeing them one after anotherThese four gardens are all differently shaped but each has a circumference of one thousand Inside each is a magical pond each side of the pond measures fifty yojanasThe pond is filled with the water of eight meritorious qualitiesThese four gardens are copiously decorated with flowers filled with birds and fragrant grovesThe fruit of karma is difficult to understand the happiness of the gods Outside of the city near the southwestern corner is the Great Hall of the Good DharmaThe gods of the Thirtythree Heavens gather here and debate with the asuras determining what conforms to the Dharma and what does notThe Qishi jing saysThe Buddha said to the monks Why is the place where gods gather called the Hall of Good Dharma When the gods of the Thirtythree Heavens gather there they discuss only the deep meaning of good statements on subtle matters carrying out inferences and visualizations these matters all involve the most essential facts or the truly correct principlesTherefore the gods call this place the Hall of Good DharmaWhy is it called the Parūṣakavana Garden On entering this garden the gods of the Thirtythree Heavens sit on two rocks called wise and good and wise and discuss only worldly statements which are rough  not good or playfulThis is why the garden is called ParūṣakavanaWhy is it called the carriage garden of miscellaneous colorsOn entering this garden the gods of the Thirtythree Heavens sit on two rocks called miscellaneous colors and good miscellaneous colors and discuss only worldly statements regarding various miscellaneous colorsThis is why the garden is called the carriage garden of miscellaneous colors Why is it called the garden of messy disorderOn the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the eighth month the gods of the Thirtythree Heavens bring all the palace ladies into this gardenThe gods and women sport with each other without hindrance indulging freely in their delightsEnjoying the five sensory pleasures of the gods they roam around happilyThis is why the gods all call this garden the garden of messy disorder Why is there a garden in this heaven called delight On entering the garden the gods of the Thirtythree Heavens sit on two rocks called delight and good delight Their minds are filled with delight and extreme pleasureThis is why the gods all call that garden delight And why is the tree given the name Pārijātaka KovidāraA deity called Moduo lived under this treeBecause enjoyed the five sense pleasures of the gods playing happily with others the gods called the tree Pārijātaka Kovidāra QuestionHow spacious are the heavensAnswerAccording to the Posha lun The peak of Mount Sumeru is eightyfour thousand yojanas long and wideIn the middle is a flat place where one can live only forty thousand yojanas Yama Heaven is double of this its area is eighty thousand yojanas long and wideIn this way the lengths and widths double from one heaven to another and the area of Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven is sixtyfour thousand yojanas The sizes of the heavens of the four meditative states  are not determinedThere are two theoriesAccording to the first theory the heavens of the first meditative state are the same size as the four continents the heavens of the second meditative state are the size of a smaller chiliocosm the heavens of the third meditative state are the size of a middle chiliocosm and the heavens of the fourth meditative states are the size of a greater chiliocosmAccording to the second theory the heavens of the first meditative state are the size of a smaller chiliocosm the heavens of the second meditative states are the size of a middle chilio cosm the heavens of the third meditative state are the size of a greater chiliocosm and the heavens of the fourth meditative states are infinite in size and their structure is indescribable Doctrinal masters consider the second theory to be correct QuestionIf the heavens of the first meditative state are of the size of one smaller chiliocosm and so on and the heavens of the fourth meditative state are infinite in size then I do not know whether the heavens from Brahma kāyika Heaven of the first meditative state to Akaniṣṭha Heaven are situated above the greater chiliocosm and shared by all the worlds or if above each of the four continents there are separate heavens beginning with Brahma kāyika all the way up to AkaniṣṭhaAnswerAccording to the Loutan jingseparately above each of the worlds consisting of the four continents and these heavens are not the sameThus it is said there that inside each of the greater chiliocosm are ten billion Mount Sumerus great oceans Cakravāḍaparvata Mountains and so on including ten billion Akaniṣṭha HeavensThis statement leaves no room for doubt However according to the Shunzhengli lun The word small implies the inferiority of the lower this expression is used because You may collect many cows whose horns have been cut off you still will not get the missing horns QuestionIf each of the worlds consisting of the four continents has its own separate set of heavens above all the way up to Akaniṣṭha each of these sets occupy a separate placeDont they get in each others wayAnswerEven though ten billion heavens happen to be in the same place they do not get in each others wayRays of light that cross each other all reach their goals and do not interfere with each otherThe gods and the heavens are also like thisThis is because they are all made of subtle matterJust as it is said in scriptures the gods from the realm of form came down to listen to the DharmaEven if sixty gods all sit together on the tip of needle they do not find themselves crowded and they do not get in each others wayThe textual evidence from this passage leaves no room for doubtAccording to one analogy the heavens of the first meditative state are like villages those of the second are like districts those of the third are like regions and those of the fourth are like states According to the Dazhidu lun Mount Sumeru is thirtythree billion six hundred million li high and is made of four jewelsthe eastern side is yellow gold the western side of white silver the southern side of lapis lazuli and the northern side of crystalSurrounding the mountain on its four sides are the Yugaṃdhara Mountains each fortytwo thousand yojanas highThe rulers of the four heavenly realms reside on each of these mountainsThe Chang ahan jing saysThe northern side is made of heavenly gold and its light illumines the northern direction the western side is made of crystal and its light illumines the western direction the eastern side is made of heavenly silver and its light illumines the eastern direction the southern side is made of lapis lazuli and its light illumines the southern directionThe Dazhidu lun ref Tb refChang ahan jing Tb Each of the rulers of the four heavens resides in his own citythe city to the east is called Dhṛtarāṣṭra the city to the south is called Sudarśana the city to the west is called Zhouluo there are three cities to the north one is called Viṣāṇā the second Gavāṃpati and the third ṭavaṭaThe Chang ahan jing saysPañcaśikha said When the gods of the Thirtythree Heavens gather at Sudarśana Hall to hold discussions the rulers of the four heavens sit according to the respective directions of their heavensThe god Dhṛtarāṣṭra sits to the east facing westakra is in front of himThe god Virū ḍhaka sits to the south facing northakra is in front of himVirūpākṣa sits to the west facing eastakra is in front of himVaiśravaṇa sits to the north facing southakra is in front of himOnly after the rulers of the four heavens have been seated will I take my seatThe Lishi apitan lun saysAs for the great city of Sudarśana of the gods of the Thirtythree Heavens the circumference is ten thousand yojanasThe surrounding wall is made of pure gold and is ten yojanas highThe upper fortification is half a yojana high the gate is two yojanas highOutside of this gate are further gates that are one and a half yojanas highThere is a gate every ten yojanas thus going around the four sides of the city there are one thousand gate towersThese gates are all made of jewels and decorated with a variety of maṇi jewelsThe great city is divided into four partsIn the

building called VaijayantaIt is five hundred yojanas high and two hundred and fifty yojanas wideIts circumference is one thousand five hundred yojanasOn the four sides of this building are jewel military towers at twentysix places on the eastern side and twentyfive places on the other four sides altogether one hundred and one towersEach of these towers are two yojanas wide on each side the circumference is eight yojanasOn top of these towers is another jewel tower onehalf yojana high which is used as the viewpointIn each of the military towers are seven heavenly maidens in the palace of

with ācī Inside the palace city there are residential quarters situated in all four sides and markets on the street corners all thoughtfully designed and builtIn heavenly cities the merits determine the number of buildings which are all made of jewels and are symmetrically shaped and handsomeIn this heavenly city there are five hundred roads in a clear pattern formed by straight and parallel streets crossing at right anglesThe four gates are connected by these streets and the east and west sides face each otherThe stores in the markets at the street corners are filled with goodsIn the heavens there are seven kinds of marketsfirst a rice and grain market second a clothing market third an incense market fourth a food and drink market fifth a flower headdress market sixth a market of skillful artisans seventh a market of prostitutesAt each of these there are market officialsGods and goddesses come to these markets to trade discussing the value of the merchandise debating quantities and discussing measurements all according to the market rulesAlthough the gods and goddesses engage in these activities they do so as gamesThere is no taking or giving and no sense of ownershipFree from selfish desires they take only what is neededIf the objects give them pleasure the gods take them freely if they dont they say This is very valuable but it is not what I need The passageways inside the markets are smoothsurfaced and lovely with decorations made of various jewels hanging heavenly cloth and raised flags and bannersThe sound of music is heard incessantlyA voice

garden is a pond also called Nandana one hundred yojanas long on each side and one hundred yojanas deep filled with heavenly water and the sides and bottom are tiled with bricks made out of the four

trees in the forests are found there and birds fly around singingIts beauty is beyond descriptionThe Lishi apitan lun saysAt that time akra led other gods and wishing to play in the garden he came to the Hall of Good Dharma Surrounded by the gods he respectfully entered the gardenOn the side of the central pillar of the Hall of Good Dharma was a lion seatakra went up to that seatTo the right and left there were sixteen gods sitting in a line on each sideThe other gods sat according to their rankAt that time akra had two princes one called Candana and the other XiupiluoThe two generals of the Thirtythree Heavens sat on both sides of the gods of the Thirtythree HeavensAt that time heavenly king Dhṛtarāṣṭra sat near the eastern gate accompanied by his ministers and soldiers who paid respect to the gods and were allowed to sit among themAt that time heavenly king Virūḍhaka sat near the southern gate accompanied by his ministers and soldiers who paid respect to the gods and were allowed to sit among themAt that time heavenly king Virūpākṣa sat near the western gateAt that time heavenly king Vaiśravaṇa sat near the northern gate NoteBoth of these two latter heavenly kings as in the first two cases were accompanied by their attendants who were allowed to sit among the gods The four heavenly kings were at the Hall of Good Dharma to memorialize the good and evil events in the world to the god akra and the gods of the Thirtythree HeavensThen the Buddha the Worldhonored One said On the fourth day of this month the four heavenly kings will travel in the world and examine the following conditions one after another saying Today how many observe the eight preceptsHow many practice givingHow many cultivate meritorious deedsHow many honor their parents monks brahmans and the elders in the family On the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of the month do the sameIf there are not many people who have accepted the eight precepts practiced giving and honored these people the four heavenly kings will go to the Hall of Dharma and report to the god akra on the condition of the worldWhen the many gods and the god akra hear this they are distressed and say This situation is not good and is not in accord with the DharmaThe followers of the gods will decrease in number and the company of demons will increase daily If people accept the eight precepts practice giving and cultivate meritorious deeds when the four heavenly kings make their report the many gods and the god akra will be overjoyed and will say This situation is very good and is in accord with the Dharma The followers of the gods will increase daily and the company of demons will decrease in number Then the Buddha uttered the following verses On the eighth day the ministers of the four heavenly kings travel around the realm under heaven On the fourteenth day the princes of the four heavenly kings observe the world On the fifteenth day at the best time the four heavenly kings having heard good reports Will themselves travel in the world observing good and evil deeds The intentions of the people in this world agree with the Way and the DharmaMany honor their superiors and practice giving to bodhisattvas Conquering anger they cultivate the Way the merits of these men and women increase Then the gods of Thirtythree Heavens hearing this are overjoyedFrequently taking delight in others good deeds the four kings speak wellThe followers of the gods increase over and over The company of demons decrease day by dayRecalling the Enlightened One the Dharma is preached to the holy assembly Gods dwell in peace and happiness joy is born in the heart Worldly fruits and otherworldly fruitsthose born in the realm of human beings can obtain both Being good to the Buddha Dharma and Sangha they dwell in the realm of the Three Jewels I now preach to you about the three good realms of rebirth If people see truth and reality abandoning evil and cultivating good With a little of the valuable currency obtained in this way they can obtain a great deal Like the gods of the Thirtythree Heavens who performed a few good deeds and are born in the heavensAs for the god akra and the other deities their great merits are widely admired They gather at the Hall of Good Dharma and other locations For men and women who perform good deeds the four heavenly kings present their report These people are loved by the pure deities and their karmic effects perfume the many heavensThe Loutan jing says In the space between the two realms of desire and of form is Māras palaceConsumed with jealousy Māra grinds down merit just as one grinds down a stoneThe palace is six thousand yojanas on each side and is surrounded by seven walls All of the decoration is like that of a lower heaven The deities who come here have the following characteristicsThey can fly over incalculable distances they can fly back incalculable distances they go freely they come freely the bodies of the gods have no skin muscles blood or flesh their bodies do not produce impure feces or urine their bodies do not become fatigued female deities do not give birth to children the eyes of the gods do not blink according to their wishes their bodies become blue if they like blue yellow if they like yellow or any other color that they likeHere is another list of the ten characteristicsthey can fly endlessly they can go away from and return to places at whatever distance in the heavens there are no thieves they do not speak to each other about whether their bodies are good or bad they do not invade each other the gods teeth are of equal length and are sensitive their hair is dark blue seven zhi long if the body of a god is blue his hair is also blue if a god wishes to be white his body becomes white if a god wishes to be black his body becomes blackThe Qishi jing saysAll the gods have ten distinct characteristics What are theseWhen the gods fly back and forth they have no limits when gods fly back and forth they fly freely when the gods fly they are neither late nor early when the gods walk they leave no traces the bodies of the gods never become fatigued the bodies of the gods have shapes but they do not cast shadows no god produces feces or urine no god produces saliva the bodies of the gods are pure and subtle and do not have skin flesh muscles veins fat blood marrow or bones the bodies of the gods may appear to be tall short blue yellow red white large small crude or subtle just as they wish and they are always beautiful handsome and striking people love themAll the gods have these ten mysterious characteristicsFurthermore the bodies of gods are substantial their teeth are white and set closely together their hair is dark blue and neat soft and moist their bodies emit lightThey also have supernatural powers they can fly and their eyes do not blinkNecklaces appear spontaneously and their clothing is free of dirtThe Shunzhengli lun saysFor those in the realm of the four heavenly kings to go up and see the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods is not the same as for those in the realms of the thirtythree gods to go up and see Yama Heaven If supernatural powers are activated through meditation however anyone can go up and see higher realmsSome rely on anothers power to go up and see higher heavens they obtain supernatural powers to go up guided by heavenly beings and reach the heavens to which they are entitledHaving arrived in the heavens some can also look down and see the lower realmsWhen they have come to higher realms and then turn downward they must transform themselves into bodies of lower realms in order to be seenThis is because they are in different realmsSimilarly beings in one realm do not feel it when they are touched by beings in a different realmWhen those in higher realms turn to lower realms they must transform their bodies in order to see the gods who live at the lower levelsThe Lishi apitan lun saysPeople in Jambudvīpa cannot see forms outside the limit of this continent except by means of supernatural powers or other meritorious powersThose in the other three continents cannot see forms outside the limits of their respective continents except by means of supernatural powers or other meritorious powers gods in the six heavenly realms of desire cannot see from their respective heavens forms outside the limit of those heavens except by means of supernatural powers or other meritorious powersEven when they look afar they can only see objects inside Mount Cak ra vāḍaThey cannot see objects that lie beyond this mountainGods in the Great Brahmā Heaven cannot see from their own palace forms outside the limit of this heaven except by means of supernatural powers or other meritorious powersEven when they look afar they can only see objects inside the chiliocosmThe Dazhidu lun saysAs retribution from earlier karma the body emits lightThe bodies of the gods in the realm of desire constantly emit lightThis is due to gifts  of lamps and candles as well as purification from upholding precepts and meditationTheir bodies constantly emit light that is visible even when the sun and moon are not shining on themThe gods of the realm of form practice meditation and remove desiresThey cultivate the concentration of fireFor this reason their bodies constantly emit light that is more beautiful than the light of the sun and moon or the light that appears in the realm of desire as karmic retribution This light is unlike anything in the heavens of the realm of desireIn summary all of these lights result from the purification of mindThe light emitted by the buddhas extends to one zhang in all directionsThe light emitted by the gods may reach as far as an infinite number of yojanasYet if it is placed next to the light emitted by the buddhas it is overwhelmed and disappearsThe Yupoyi jingxing jing says The Buddha told Viśākhā The Tathāgata has six kinds of lightsWhat are the sixThey are blue light yellow light red light white light crimson light and purple lightThese lights of different colors illuminate objectsThese are called the Tathāgatas six kinds of light The Chang ahan jing saysThe Buddha said to the monks The light of a firefly is not as bright as that of a candleThe light of a candle is not as bright as a torchThe light of a torch is not as bright as that a large fireThe light of a large fire is not as bright as that of the four heavenly kingsThe light of the clothing and bodies of the four heavenly kings is not as bright as that of thirtythree godsContinuing in this way the light of the Akaniṣṭhabhavana gods is not as bright as the god Maheśvaras lightMaheśvaras light is not as bright as the Buddhas lightEven if the light of a firefly and so on up to the Buddhas light are brought together is not as bright as the light of the truth of suffering the truth of the cause of suffering the truth of the cessation of suffering and the truth of the pathFor this reason monks who seek light should seek the light of the Four Noble Truths of suffering the cause of suffering the cessation of suffering and the path Furthermore the same source saysHuman beings may be of seven colorsWhat are the sevenSome are of golden colorSome are of the color of fireSome are blueSome are yellowSome are red Some are whiteSome are blackGods and demons are also similarly of seven colorsThe Lishi apitan lun says The sentient beings in Jambudvīpa are of various colorsWith the exception of the color black the people in Pūrvavideha in the east and Aparagodānīya in the west are of the same various colors as the people of JambudvīpaThe human beings in Uttarakuru in the north are all a clean white colorThe beings in the heavens of the four heavenly kings are of four different colorsblue red yellow and whiteThe beings in all the heavens of the realm of desire are similarHow do the gods acquire these four colorsAt the time of their births if they see blue flowers they become blueThe situation with the other colors is likewiseThe Qishi jing saysIn trade the people of Jambudvīpa sometimes use money sometimes grain and silk and sometimes peopleIn trade the people of Aparagodānīya sometimes use cattle and sheep and sometimes maṇi jewelsIn trade the people of Pūrvavideha sometimes use goods and silk sometimes the five kinds of grain and sometimes maṇi jewelsIn Uttarakuru there is no trade whatever people wish to have spontaneously appearsFurthermore the Qishi jing saysIn the heavens of the realm of desire such as those of the four heavenly kings and the thirtythree gods trade and tourism that lifts peoples spirits also exist but they take different forms from those among human beingsThis has been discussed earlierThe Qishi jing saysThe other three continents also have their respective ways of marriage between men and womenPeople in Uttarakuru have no homesMen and women copulate under the hanging branches of trees and there is nothing like marriageDragons garuḍas and asuras all have their own procedures for marriage roughly similar to those of human beingsMarriage exists among the gods in the six heavens of the realm of desire and in the realm of mārasThese have been briefly explained earlierIn all of the heavens above marriage does not exist because the distinction between male and female does not existWhen human beings in the four continents engage in the sexual act two organs are brought together and impure liquid substances flowWhen dragons garuḍas and all others engage in the sexual act two organs are brought together but only gases are released giving pleasure and nothing impure is involvedWhen the gods in the thirtythree heavens engage in the sexual act as the organs are brought together pleasure is realized and again only gases are releasedThe process is no different from that of the dragons and garuḍas described aboveIn Yama Heaven the gods take hold of each others hands as the sexual act in Tuṣita Heaven gods only think of each other in Nirmāṇarati Heaven the gods gaze at each other in Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven the gods talk to each other the gods in Māras heaven also gaze at each otherIn all these cases pleasure is realized and the sexual act is consummated The Lishi apitan lun saysWhen the gods in the heavens of the four heavenly kings look for a woman  only after the womens families give permission do they take them as wivesGifts and money are offeredGods in the other heavens of the realm of desire do something similarHuman beings in Jambudvīpa and the other continents the gods in the heavens of the four heavenly kings and in the Heaven of Thirtythree Gods must engage in copulation to perform sexual actsGods in Yama Heaven embrace to perform the sexual actGods in Tuṣita Heaven hold hands to perform the sexual actGods in Nirmāṇarati Heaven laugh to perform the sexual actGods in Para nirmitavaśavartin Heaven gaze at each other to perform the sexual actHuman beings in the continent of Aparagodānīya in the west receive pleasure that is two times greater than that of those in JambudvīpaContinuing in this way the gods in Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven receive pleasure that is two times greater than that of those in Nirmāṇarati HeavenAmong human beings in the four continents are who eat badly and those who grow fetuses in their wombsAmong the female gods in the heaven of the four heavenly kings none of the female deities eats badly or grows a fetus in her womb they do not give birth nor do they hold babiesMale and female deities give birth either from the knees or in their sleepWhen a baby is born to a female deity she says This is my child the male deity also says This is my child The child has one father and one motherWhen a baby is born from the knees of a sleeping father there is only one father and all his wives and mistresses become motherThere are spiritual practices that enable them to remain free of desires until deathFor the gods born in the heaven of the four heavenly kings there are infinite ways of satisfying desiresThere is also spiritual cultivation for remaining free of desire until deathThe situation in all of the heavens of the realm of desire is similarFor all women touch is the source of pleasureFor all male beings releasing impurities is the source of pleasureFor all of the gods in the realm of desire the release of gases is the source of pleasureThe newly translated Posha lun saysAccording to the sutra at the beginning of the world age human beings did not have male and female organs and men and women looked the sameLater after people began eating food male and female organs appeared and consequently the distinction between male and female developedIn the realm of form there is no physical food For this reason the two organs are absentAccording to one view the male and female organs are useful in the realm of desire but not in the realm of formTherefore they do not exist there The two organs of nose and tongue have their use in the realm of desire but they do not exist in the realm of formFollowing this line of enquiry further the following question arisesAre the gods in the realm of form male or femaleAnswer The following must be saidthese gods are all maleEven though they do not have male organs they have the appearance of menAlso because these gods are free of defilements they are maleThe Qishi jing Tbc refQishi yinben jing Tb For all sentient beings there are four kinds of food which sustain their constitutive elements What are the fourGross and subtle physical food sense perception as nourishment thought as nourishment and consciousness as nourishmentWhich sentient beings take gross and subtle physical foodThe people in Jambudvīpa eat rice barley beans and meat as gross physical food and massage bathing and anointing the skin as subtle physical foodPeople in the other continents and the gods in the six heavens of the realm of desire all take gross and subtle foodThe gods in the heavens higher than these take the pleasure of meditation and the joy of learning the Dharma as food and no longer consume gross and subtle physical foodQuestionWhich sentient beings take sense perception as foodAnswerAll creatures whose bodies are born from eggs take sense perception as foodWhich sentient beings take thought as foodSentient beings that nourish their sense organs with thought and lengthen their lives such as fish turtles snakes frogs and kalākuṭa  as well as all other sentient beings that nourish their sense organs with thought and lengthen their livesall these use thought as foodWhich sentient beings take consciousness as foodSentient beings in the hells and the gods in such heavens as Infinite Consciousness take consciousness as foodGods in the heavens of the four heavenly kings all eat sudhā  taking it once in the morning and again in the evening Once inside the body transforms itself into a bodily substanceThis sudhā grows naturally around gardens and pondsThis heavenly food can also be turned into the eight kinds of food and drink such as hard khādanīya foodThis is the situation with all the gods in all the heavens of the realm of desireThe gods in the realm of form from the heaven of the first meditative state up to ubhakṛtsna Heaven  take joy as foodThe gods in the heavens in the formless realm take thought as foodQuestionHow do the gods eat and drinkAnswerAccording to the scripture  the gods in the realm of desire differ in terms of their nobility and attractivenessTo those endowed with a good deal of merit everything is provided as they wishIf they wish to drink their cups are filled with the drink of immortality if they wish to eat a hundred different dishes arriveThose endowed with little merit are never offered food and drink that satisfies themBecause they are not satisfied they come down to the human world looking for foodThus the scripture says that while the gods share their jeweled eating vessels the color of their food differs according to their accumulated meritTo those in the highest category the food appears white to those in the middle category it appears yellow and to those in the lowest category it appears redThe gods in the realm of desire take the pleasure of meditation as foodIf we were to describe it in terms of the theory of the four kinds of food  then they take only sense perception as foodQuestionWhat about the servants and vehicles of the godsAnswerA scripture says The gods in the six heavens of the realm of desire have servants and vehicles Servants refers to attendantsVehicles refers to the animals that they rideThe gods in the six heavens of the realm of desire are distinguished in terms of rulers ministers wives mistresses and those who are of humble or noble or those who are higher or lower in the hierarchyThe humble must obey the nobleThe lower must follow those who are higherAs for vehicles the gods in the six heavens of the realm of desire all have various kinds of animals that they ride when they go outSome ride horses and elephants some ride peacocks some ride dragonsAccording to the Posha lun Below Trāyastriṃśa Heaven elephants horses owls geese waterfowl peacocks and dragons existAbove Yama Heaven no fourlegged creatures such as elephants or horses existOnly birds such as Teaching the Undisciplined Truthspeaking and Red Water reprimand the gods and keep them from undisciplined behaviorQuestionIf elephants horses and other fourlegged creatures are absent what do the gods in those heavens rideAnswerAs the commentary to the treatise says though there are no elephants and horses when the gods wish to go out because of the power of their merit elephants and horses appear miraculously following the gods minds and the gods ride them freely as they wishWhen they have finished riding the animals disappearBirds such as Teaching the Undisciplined exist everywhere in the six heavens and as teachers to the gods they reprimand them for their lack of disciplineThey are not confined to heavens higher than Yama HeavenQuestionThese birds are still only animalsHow can they serve as teachers to the godsAs the Zhengfanian jing says When they were human beings in earlier lives these birds served as teachers who taught in the realm under the three heavensThe gods in their earlier lives were sentient beings who received their instructionFaithfully receiving the instruction they gave and upheld the precepts and they have now been reborn in the heavensWhen they were teachers in their previous lives the birds were called Violating Precepts for ProfitTheir hearts were not sincere and now they have been reborn as heavenly birdsDue to the power of their limited goodness derived from their teaching efforts they were reborn in the heavensBecause they originally were teachers they now serve as teachers to the gods and when the gods are undisciplined they come and reprimand themWhen the gods see and hear these birds they all repent and refrain from undisciplined acts QuestionHow numerous are the gods attendantsAnswer According to the treatise the gods in the realm of form cannot be said to be manyThese gods are neither male or female and they do not become coupled as husband and wifeWhen they are born they come into being through transformation when they die they go out of being through transformationThrough primary and secondary causes their palaces appear following themThey derive pleasure from meditationIt is not possible to say how many attendants they haveThe gods in the realm of desire have the distinction of the male and female gender and are coupled as husband and wifeThus the Dajiyi shenzhou jing saysThe four heavenly kings worldprotectors govern the four directionsThe heavenly king Dhṛtarāṣṭra governs over the gandharvasThe heavenly king Virūpākṣa governs over the kumbhāṇḍa ghostsThe heavenly king Virūḍhaka governs over the dragons The heavenly king Vaiśravaṇa governs over the yakṣasEach of these heavenly kings has ninetyone sons handsome in appearance and very powerfulAll of them are called emperorsThese heavenly kings altogether have four hundred and sixtyfour sons who guard the four directionsakra governs the four intermediate directionsThe heavenly king Great Brahmā governs the upward directionThe Dazhidu lun saysSupernatural beings in the mountains rivers trees grounds and cities are all subject to the four heavenly kings When the four heavenly kings came they all appeared following themThose among these beings who had not been able to obtain the Perfection of Wisdom scriptures thus come to the place of the Perfection of Wisdom scriptures worship them and realize their benefitsThe attendants in the heavens higher than the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods are numerous and cannot be listed in detailThe many attendants in the heavens lower than that of the Thirtythree Gods include heavenly maidens numbering nine billion nayutas who belong to akraEach of these maidens has ten sons and an infinite number of ministersTogether they form the group of attendantsAs a verse saysakra responds equally to each of the heavenly maidens Ninetytwo billion nayutas in number Each of these heavenly maidens says to herself It is with me only that the heavenly king entertains himself As for the gods with the smallest number of attendants even they have ten thousand heavenly maidens as their attendants This is the absolute minimum number QuestionWhat is the distinction of classes among the gods likeFirst in the six heavens of the realm of desire the ruler ministers and people and the kings wife and concubines are differentiatedIn akras heaven akra is the ruler the thirtytwo gods are the ministers and the other gods are the peopleAmong women Madame ācī is the empress and the other heavenly maidens are concubinesThe situation is similar in the other five heavensIn the realm of form the distinction of classes exists only in the three heavens of the heaven of the first meditative stateGreat Brahmā is the ruler Brahmapurohita is the minister and the assembly of Brahmā gods is the peopleIn the heavens above these all the gods receive the same karmic retribution and the distinction of classes does not existQuestion What are wealth and poverty among the gods likeAnswerAccording to the Zhengfanian jing  above Yama Heaven including all the heavens of the realm of form all the gods possess equal wealthBelow the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods karmic retribution differs and the distinction of wealth and poverty existsThose with rich karmic retribution are provided with everything and the result of their karmic retribution is abundantThose with poor karmic retribution are given clothes and palaces their food is constantly insufficientTherefore the scripture says that the gods with poor karmic retribution were once hungry and for that reason they came down to Jambudvīpa to pick sour dates and ate themPeople were puzzled by their appearance and questioned themThey answered We are not human beings but gods with poor karmic retributionThough we live in palaces and wear beautiful clothes our food is always insufficientThat is why we have come here to pick dates and eat themYou should not find this strange The details of this story are in the scriptureIn their previous lives these gods had upheld the precepts and practiced patience but did not practice giving  In the heavens of the four heavenly kings up to Akaniṣṭha Heaven  when gods die their bodies are not cremated or exposed or buriedLike a flame they disappear without leaving a corpse behindThis is because these gods are born through transformationGods in the heavens of the four heavenly kings kill and let others kill but they do not eat the flesh of the deadThe same is true in the Heaven of the Thirtythree GodsFrom Yama Heaven upward to Akaniṣṭha Heaven the gods do not kill living beings nor let others kill and they do not eat the flesh of the deadThis is because these beings are born through transformation and do not leave any substance after death verses say The three realms are entangled The six realms of rebirth are filled with activities Creatures ceaselessly come and go Suffering endless pain Retribution presses upon them And their pain spreads and increases From evil deeds These dangers arise in response How could one have known about the water in which one might drown Who could know how to navigate it with a boat Carrying heavy burdens Beings cannot fly up high We wish to leave this polluted world And rest in the Pure Land Singlemindedly turning ourselves to the correct path We will achieve unlimited longevityThe Sun and Moon Introduction Lunar Mansions The Sun Palace The Moon Palace Climate Illumination Waxing and Waning Rising Clouds Thunder Lightning Rainfall Irregular Weather and EarthquakesBefore the universe came into being the two foundations of yin and yang had not yet manifestedAfter sentient beings accumulated grain the three lights shone on them activating the deep compassion of jewellike will and issuing forth the mysterious thought of auspiciousnessHarnessing the yang spirit they let the light flowClarifying the yin soul they make the stars riseLike galloping windhorses they move in their coursesIn accordance with the measurements of astronomical instruments they travel in the right degreesThey order heat and coldness properly for the three time units of the yearThey move from morning to evening through the four continentsEven though the patterns are above in the sky they serve as signs below on earthJust as if their virtue matches the Original Goodness  they travel along the ecliptic circle Their logic differs from that of human relationships and is comparable to that of fish and water mirrors are transported along the profound paths and circle around the three lunar stationsPraising good words they demonstrate their effects with auspicious events that appear at the fivefold turning points of the yearShowing evil omens they discipline the evil onesBy looking up at the mysterious mirrors we look upon our own lives in terms of reward and punishmentGreat is the use of the sun and moonThe Daji jing saysThen the dragon king Sāgara said to Jyotirasa Bodhisattva Great being who has spoken about the lunar stationsWho made the larger and smaller starsWho made the sun and moonWho placed them in empty spaceThirty days form a month and twelve months a year How are these time units determinedTo which location do they belongWhat are their clan names and personal namesWhat are their good and evil qualities What do they eat and what should we give them as offeringsHow are their days and how are their nightsThe sun moon and lunar stationsat what pace do they moveYou rank as the first among sagesTake pity on us dragons and explain these matters fullyHaving heard your explanation we who seek release from suffering will serve these stars Jyotirasa Bodhisattva replied to the dragons In the past at the beginning of the present age of the wise there was a god called MahāsammataHe was unusually handsome and intelligentHe governed with correct conduct and always took pleasure in quiet meditationStaying away from love and attachment he always kept himself pureThe king had a queen who was greedy with sexual desireBecause the king no longer cared for her she had no way to satisfy her needOne time she saw a donkey with an erect penis sexually aroused she took off her clothes and approached itThe donkey saw her and they had sexual intercourseConsequently she became pregnant and at the end of one month gave birth to a childHis head ears mouth and eyes were all like those of a donkey only his body was shaped like a human body but it too was covered with coarse hair just like the body of an animalWhen she saw this creature she was frightened and immediately threw him into the toiletDue to his power of merit however he hovered in the air and did not fallAt that time a female demon  called Donkey God saw that the child had not been soiled and said to herself He must be a child of extraordinary merit She took hold of the child in the air and washed himShe then went to the Himalayas fed the child milk and raised him treating him exactly the same way as she did her own childrenWhen the child grew up she made him take the drug of immortality he played with the other children of the gods day and nightAnother great deity came and loved this child feeding him tasty meals candies and herbsThe childs body was transformedit was decorated with meritorious effects and illuminated with bright light and the other gods all praised him calling him Kharoṣṭhī which means Donkeylipped Great SageFor this reason wherever Donkeylipped Sage went in the Himalayas and elsewhere various beautiful flowers good fruit medicines fragrances clear streams and different kinds of birds appeared by transformationWherever he stayed the place was filled with a rich harvestBenefiting from the medicines and fruit his crude appearance gradually changed and he became handsomeOnly his lips were still like those of a donkeyFor this reason he was called Donkeylipped SageDonkeylipped Sage studied the holy teachingFor sixty thousand years he stood on one leg not putting his other foot down day and night never becoming fatiguedThe gods saw the great sage undergoing this austerityThen the gods of Brahmā Heaven and akra Heaven as well as those in the higher realms of the realm of desire gathered and came to pay respectDragons asuras and yakṣas all gathered together like a cloudAll the sages and practitioners of the holy path came to the place of Donkeylipped SagePlacing their offerings they held the palms together and asked Great sage whatever you are searching for would you please speak of it to us godsIf it is within the range of our capabilities we will immediately give it to youWe will not begrudge it When Donkeylipped Sage heard these words he felt delighted in his heart and answered the gods You can satisfy what I truly wantI will explain brieflyI recall that in one of my previous lives in a past world age I saw in space many lunar stations the sun and the moon traveling day and night at a fixed speed and illuminating the realm under heavenI want understand this matter thoroughlyOut of pity for the beings who live in darkness these lunar stations the sun and the moon work tirelesslyAt the beginning of the present world age of the wise such efforts were not

evil some are goodlooking and some uglyJust as I have requested please describe them exhaustively All the gods said Great sage  this is a very profound matter and it is outside of our own sphere

correspond to the Northern GateAmong these twentyeight lunar stations there are five that cover fortyfive time units namely Bi Shen Di Dou and BiThere is a lot to be said about the twentyeight lunar stations and it is difficult to come to understand them deeplyI will not discuss the matter in detail hereHere I discussed the lunar stations briefly The gods who heard the discussion were delightedThen facing the assembly the sage Kharoṣṭhī held his palms together and said Arrange the sun moon the year and time units in this way Note The Zhi riyue nianshi jing Scripture of Placing the Sun the Moon the Year and the Time Units belongs hereIt is not included here due to its length What are the six seasons of the larger and smaller star mansionsAnswerThe first and second months are called the season of moderate warmthThe third and fourth months are called the season for plantingThe fifth and sixth months are called the season for praying for rainThe seventh and eighth months are called the season for the ripening of fruitThe ninth and the tenth months are called the cold and freezing seasonThe eleventh and twelfth months are the season of snowstorms In this way the twelve months are divided into six seasonsFurthermore there are eight larger star mansionsSuixing  Ying huoxing  Zhenxing  Taiboxing  Chenxing  the sun moon and HeluohouxingThere are twentyeight smaller star mansions which refer to the set of lunar stations starting with Mao and ending with WeiI placed them in this way in an orderly fashionYou have all heard the explanationsAt that time all the gods sages asuras dragons  and human beings with palms joined said Now this heavenly sage is to be honored to the highest degree among gods and humans and none among the dragons and asuras is superior to himIn wisdom and compassion he is the firstFor the duration of innumerable kalpas he has not failed to take pity on sentient beings and he has obtained meritorious rewardsAmong all the gods and human beings there is none who has comparable wisdomHe makes the cosmic laws function in this way There are none among the sentient beings who can make the laws work in this wayAll beings are delighted and he brings comfort to us It is good most virtuous oneYou bring peace to sentient beings Then the sage Kharoṣṭhī spoke again saying that the twelve months constitute one yearIn a moment he finished speaking about these matters regarding the larger and smaller starsHe also placed the four heavenly kings in each of the four directions around Mount Sumeru to bring benefit to sentient beings in each directionThen everyone in the assembly praised the sage saying It is good They were boundlessly delightedThen the gods dragons yakṣas and asuras presented offerings day and nightAfter innumerable ages another sage called Qieli will appear in the worldHe will again speak about the arrangement of the star mansions small and large and the calculations of the lunar periods and seasons I have now listed the twentyeight lunar stationsEach has different affiliates and spiritual guardsThus according to the Daji jing The Buddha said to the ruler of the sahā world the heavenly king Brahman Indra and the four heavenly kings In the past how did the heavenly sage place the lunar stations the sun moon and planets in order to protect the land and nurture sentient beings The great king Brahmā and others replied to the BuddhaIn the past the heavenly sage placed the lunar stations the sun moon and planets in order to protect the land and nurture sentient beingsIn the eastern direction are seven lunar stationsthe Jue lunar station in charge of birds the Gang lunar station in charge of those who have renounced the householders life and seek the holy path the Di lunar station in charge of sentient beings born from water the Fang lunar station in charge of those who drive vehicles for profit the Xin lunar station in charge of women the Wei lunar station in charge of sentient beings in the continents and islands and the Ji lunar station in charge of pottersIn the southern direction there are seven lunar stationsthe Sei lunar station in charge of metal workers the Gui lunar station in charge of all kings and ministers the Liu lunar station in charge of dragons in the Himalayas the Xin lunar station in charge of the wealthy the Chang lunar station in charge of thieves the Yi lunar station in charge of merchants and the Chen lunar station in charge of the kingdom of Suraṣṭra In the western direction there are seven lunar stationsthe Kui lunar station in charge of boatmen the Lou lunar station in charge of merchants the Wei lunar station in charge of the kingdom of Po lou jia the Mao lunar station in charge of water buffaloes the Bi lunar station in charge of all sentient beings the Zi lunar station in charge of the kingdom of Vaideha and the Shen lunar station in charge of the kṣatriyasIn the northern direction there are seven lunar stationsthe Dou lunar station in charge of the kingdom of Jiaobusha the Niu lunar station in charge of the kṣatriyas and the kingdom of Anduobojiena the Nlunar station in charge of the kingdom of Yangqiemoqietuo the Xu lunar station in charge of the kingdom of Nasheluo the Wei lunar station in charge of those who wear flower crowns the Shi lunar station in charge of the kingdoms of Gandhāra and Shuluna as well as all creeping creatures such as dragons and snakes and the Bi lunar station in charge of those who are happy among the gandharvas Bhagavats of great virtue and past heavenly sagesIn this way the lunar stations were placed in the four directions in order to protect the land and nurture sentient beings Then the Buddha said to the Brahmā king and the others You must listen carefullyAmong the heavenly sages in the world I am the most superior with regard to all knowledgeIt is also I who causes the stars and star mansions to protect the land and nurture sentient beingsYou must announce to them how I divided the land and sentient beings so that each is protected and nurtured according to this divisionThe divided kingdoms belong separately to the twentyeight lunar stations QuestionWhat are the sizes of the starsAnswerAccording to the Zengyi ahan jing  the larger stars are one yojana in diameter and smaller stars are two hundred steps in diameterAccording to the Loutan jing the circumference of a large stars is seven hundred li that of a midsized star is four hundred and eighty li and that of a small star is twenty liAccording to the Yqieshidi lun  the larger among the star mansions are eighteen krośas the midsized ones are ten krośas and the smallest ones are four krośasCompilers commentAccording to Buddhist scriptures these star mansions are all residences of the gods who live inside them due to their karmic powers light is emittedAccording to secular books they are said to be simply pieces of rockThus during Song period a star fell the meteor was like a piece of rockSome said it was not the star but rather a stone that fell from the Heavenly RiverThus according to one secular book the Heavenly River is connected with the Earthly River and thus stones sometimes fall from the riverThe Xumi xiangtu shan jing says The river in heaven is called Yemaluo it travels in the sky over a long time large rocks and small sand have occasionally come off it these have been fixed as starsThis work is not an authentic scripture but rather an arbitrary composition by a secular authorThough it has been in circulation it does not represent the Buddhas teachingIn the eighteenth year of the Zhenguan period of Tang  in the tenth month on the day of bingshen there was a great thunder in the sky at the boundary between Fenzhou and the Wenshui district of BingzhouA stone fell from a cloud in the skyIt was of the size of a pheasants beak with a raised back and a flat bottomZhang Xiaojing Aide of the Wenshui district along with the official of Fenzhou presented a memorialAt that time an elder from Mahābodhi Temple in Magadha came to the Western CapitalHe was very knowledgeable about all sorts of thingsThe emperor asked him about this occurrenceThe elder answered Two dragons fought with each other and consequently dropped down like stones If we are to speak on the basis of this exchange it is not necessarily the case that what falls from the sky is a starThe matters of the distant heavens cannot be fathomed by ordinary beingsHeaven and earth are the hardest to know for human beingsIt is said among people that heaven is the ether of essence the sun is the yang essence stars are the essence of myriad thingsAccording to what Confucian scholars teach to reassure us when a star falls it becomes a stoneIf its essence is that of a stone it cannot possibly emit lightIt would also have a heavy massTo what would it have been attachedThe diameter of one large star is one hundred liThe distance between the head and tail of one lunar stations is several tens of thousand liObjects one hundred li in diameter are arranged at distances of several tens of thousand li and as they move the distances between the stars do not changeFurthermore the light emitted by the stars the sun and the moon is similar only the sizes variesHow can the sun and moon be stonesStones are solid and dense How could a crow or a hare reside within itHow can stones move in the qi by themselvesSuppose that the sun moon stars and lunar stations were all qiThe substance of qi is light and qi merges with the skyTheir movement and turning cannot diverge from one anotherHow then can the sun moon the five planets and the twentyeight lunar stations all have different degrees and move unevenly rather than move uniformlyHow could qi fall and suddenly turn into stonesIf the earth is the accumulation of dregs it should sink at the bottomYet when we dig in the ground springs open up The earth floats upon waterWhat lies under the waterStreams in a hundred valleys gather into the Yangzi River and the Yellow River Where do these streams originateThe rivers flow to the east into the ocean Why does the ocean not overflowTo where does the water of the Guitang Gorge and the Weil Deeps  eventually leadWhat gas continues to burn in the rocks of Wujiao Who controls the ebb and flow of the tidesWhy doesnt the Milky Way that hangs in the sky not fall downHow come water which by nature flows downward rise up thereAs soon as heaven and earth were established there were lunar stationsThe nine continents had not been marked and many states were not divided Marking boundaries of the territory is like traveling through lunar stationsAfter the feudal system is established who controls the bordersstates change but the stars are steady in their course of progressCalamities and good fortune never miss the right timePatterns in the sky are large stars are numerousHow could the divisions of the ground be confined to ChinaThe lunar station Mao is Maotou  which is the protective star of the Xiongnu tribesHow would it abandon the western Hu the eastern Yi the Diaozhi or JiaozhiAs we explore exhaustively we cannot treat human affairs as being beyond cosmic People believe only what they see with their own eyes and hear with their ears they doubt everything that lies beyond this limitYet the Confucians have several astronomical theories such as huntian and gaitian and speak of the conformation of the heavens and the vastness of heaven  These theories are quite comprehensive and unlike the viewpoint of those who only accept what they themselves seeYet their calculations are not reliableWhy should we believe the speculation of worldly people and doubt the superior teaching of the Great SageWhy are we tempted to deny the existence of worlds as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges River and of world ages as numerous as minute dust particlesZou Yan spoke of the nine continentsThose who live in the mountains do not believe that a fish can be as large as a treeThose who live near the ocean do not believe that a tree can be as big as a fishEmperor Wu of the Han did not believe in the existence of a bowstring made of glue King Wen of Wei did not believe in the existence of fireresistant clothForeigners see embroidered silk and do not believe that it is made of fibers secreted by worms that eat tree leavesPeople of the Wu region living south of the Jiang River do not believe in the existence of a tent that can hold one thousand peopleWhen we come to the region north of the Ho River the people there do not believe in the existence of a boat that can hold twenty thousand shiThese things have real proof of their existenceIn the world there are such things as magicians and different magical techniques such as walking on fire stepping on swords harvesting melons  and moving wells suddenly a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations take placeIt is within the power of human beings to do these thingsWhy then could not miraculous cosmic responses beyond the limits of our understanding actually happen for example a seat decorated with a jeweled banner one hundred yojanas long or the miraculous appearance of the Pure Land or the emergence of a marvelous stupa from the groundWang Xuances Xiguoxing zhuan saysIn the fourth year of Xianqing the kings emissary reached PolisheFor the Chinese visitors the king there arranged to have five women perform These five women handled three swords adding more swords until they had tenThey also performed rope tricksGoing up in the air on top of the rope they put on their shoes and then threw them while handling a sword a shield and a spear in their handsThey performed various other kinds of tricks cutting off their tongues and pulling out their intestinesThese cannot be described in detail hereThe Qishi jing saysThe Buddha said to the monks The palace of the sun god is fiftyone yojanas in depth width and heightThe palace looks square like an ordinary residence but from a distance it appears roundIt is made of two materials gold and glassTwo parts of each side are made of heavenly gold pure and luminous one part is made of heavenly gold clean and luminousFive kinds of winds blow and make the sun move a holding wind a dwelling wind an adaptive turbulent wind a Poluohejia wind and a future windIn front of the sun palace are innumerable godsAs they move to the front they each experience pleasure These gods are called Steadily Moving NoteAccording to the Chang ahan jing the structure of the sun palace and its walls are thin like flower petalsThey are supported by the five kinds of winds Furthermore inside the sun palace is a carriage made of Jambūnada goldIt is sixteen yojanas tall and eight yojanas square and is decorated most beautifullyThe god and his attendants are inside the carriage enjoying the pleasures that satisfy the five desiresThe sun god has the life span of five hundred yearsHis son and grandson succeed him from generation to generation and rule in this palaceThe palace remains for the period of one world ageThe light that shines from the body of the sun god illumines the carriageThe light that shines from the carriage in turn illumines the palaceThe light is thus passed on and illumines beyond the four continents and the many worldsThere are one thousand light rays on the body of the sun god the carriage and the palaceFive hundred light rays shine sideways five hundred rays shine downwardThe palace of the sun god moves constantlyFor a period of six months it moves northward it keeps moving gradually all day and travels a distance of six krośas in a day It never departs from the suns pathFor the next period of six months it moves southward it keeps moving gradually all day and travels a distance of six krośas in a dayIt does not fall off the suns pathAs the sun palace keeps moving with the cycle of six months the moon palace moves in similar fashion in a cycle of fifteen days The Qishi jing saysThe Buddha said to the monks The palace of the moon god is fortynine yojanas wide and deep forming a perfect squareIt is surrounded by fences on all four sides and the palace is made of seven jewelsThe palace building of the moon god is made only of heavenly silver and heavenly blue jade pieces of which are placed side by sideTwo parts are of heavenly silver clear and untarnished and which shines brightly The remaining part is of heavenly blue jade also very clear and transparentThe light shines through it and illuminates far and wideAgain five kinds of wind support the moonAs the moon palace moves in the sky it is preceded and pulled by the palaces of numerous gods these gods all receive pleasureThis palace also has a large carriage made of blue jade eighteen yojanas in height and eight yojanas wideThe moon god and heavenly maidens are inside this carriageThe desires of each of the gods five sense organs are satisfied in various combinations and these deities move about freelyThe life span of the moon god is five hundred yearsGenerations of his descendants rule thereThe palace lasts for a period of one world ageThe light that shines from the body of the moon god illuminates the blue carriageThe light that shines from the carriage in turn illuminates the moon palaceThe light from the moon palace illuminates the four continentsThe moon god emits five hundred rays of light directed downwardIt also emits five hundred light rays that shine sidewaysFor this reason the moon god is called One Thousand Rays of Light It is also called Cool Light Why does the moon palace appear graduallyThe Buddha answered There are three reasonsit rotates for half a month bluecolored deities whose clothing and necklaces are all uniformly blue hide in their palace and because of this hiding the moon appears gradually and sixty rays of light shine simultaneously from the moon palace and obstruct the light from the moonFor these reasons the moon appears only graduallyWhy is the moon palace perfectly roundAgain there are three reasons for thisAt the right time the moon rotates and the moon palace appearsThe bluecolored deities hide for half a month but on the fifteenth day the form of the moon palace is perfectly round and its light brightestIf one lights a torch in a pool of fuel all smaller lamps is overwhelmed and disappearsSimilarly on the fifteenth day the moon palace overcomes all other sources of lightAs for the sixty rays of light that are simultaneously emitted from the sun palace and that obstruct the light of the moon palace on the fifteenth day the moon palace is fully empoweredThere is no shadow anywhereAt that time even rays of light from the sun cannot obstruct the light of the moonAgain why does the moon palace completely disappear on the fifteenth day of the waning periodThe moon palace is closest to the sun palace on the fifteenth day of the waning periodIt is covered by the suns light and therefore becomes completely invisibleAgain why is the moon palace designated by the same term as monthDuring the waning period the moon palace gradually disappears day by day until it is entirely gone at the end of the monthThe strength of the light decreases gradually For this reason it is designated by the term month Note in the Western Region the month is divided into black and whiteFrom the first day to the fifteenth day is called the white monthFrom the sixteenth day to the day the moon disappears is called the black monthIn China the black month is included and together they are called a month Why do shadows appear in the moon palaceThe jambu tree exists on this continentBecause of this tree the continent is called Jambudvīpa The jambu tree is tall and large and its shadow appears in the moon The Yqie lun saysThe shadows of the fish and turtles in the ocean are reflected in the moonFor this reason black patterns appear thereAccording to the Xiguo zhuan  once in the past a rabbit was cultivating the bodhisattva practiceThe Heavenly Ruler wanted to test  and asked for some meat to eatThe rabbit threw itself into a fire The Heavenly Ruler took pity on it and placed the burned rabbit on the moon so that all future beings would see the rabbits body and know that it had cultivated the bodhisattva practice According to the Qishi jing Again why is heat generated in the summerThe Buddha said For six months the sun palace travels northwardIn one day it steadily travels the distance of six krośas without failThere are ten reasons why heat is generatedIts light touches upon ten kinds of mountains and generates heat Again why are there cold areasAfter six months the sun palace gradually turns to the southThere are again twelve reasons why coldness is generatedBetween Mount Sumeru and Mount Khadiraka is the Sumeru Ocean eightyfour thousand yojanas wide with an immeasurable circumferenceThe ocean is filled with flowers that have a powerful fragranceThe light of the sun reaches this oceanThis is the first reason why there is coldnessSecond Mount ṣādhara third Mount Yugaṃdhara fourth Mount Sudarśana fifth Mount Aśvakarṇa sixth Mount Nimindhara seventh Mount Vinataka and eighth Mount CakravāḍaNinth the sun reaches the places where rivers flow in Jambudvīpa and for this reason there is coldnessTenth there are twice as many rivers in godānīyaEleventh there are twice as many rivers in PūrvavidehaTwelfth there are twice as many rivers in UttarakuruThe light of the sun reaches these twelve groups of rivers and coldness resultsIn addition to the eight mountains the opening section on generating heat mentions as the ninth reason the demigods palace in the sky ten thousand yojanas above the groundThe tenth reason is the mountains in each of the four continents Altogether ten reasons are listed The Lishi apitan lun saysQuestionWhy is it cold in winterWhy is it hot in springWhy is it some times hot and sometimes cold in summerIn winter the water element is dominant and has not begun its downward trendVegetation is moist and has not begun to dry upThe earth element is damp the fire element is turned downward the water element rises upward We know this because deep water is warm and shallow water is coldWhen the cold season arrives the sun moves along the outside path and the daylight is shorterThe yang force is inside Food is digested quicklyFor this reason it is cold in winterWhy is it hot in spring During this season the strength of the water element declinesVegetation dries up and the ground splits from the lack of moistureThe water element is directed downward and the fire element rises upwardWe know this because deep water is cold and shallow water is warmHaving passed through winter the sun travels along the inside path and the daylight is longerThe fire inside the body declines Therefore it is hot in springWhy is it sometimes hot and sometimes cold in summerThe ground is constantly scorched in the eighth monthWhen a large cloud sends down rain the ground steams with vaporWhen the wind blows the vapor disappearsThen it becomes coldIf there is no wind then it is hotFor this reason it is sometimes hot and sometimes cold in summer In the Western Region four months constitute a seasonThere is only spring summer and winter there is no autumnFor this reason there are three residences three seasons The Qishi jing saysWhy do rivers flow in the worldThe Buddha said to the monks The sun generates heat the heat causes scorching scorching causes steam steam causes sweating This moisture in the mountains forms the rivers The Chang ahan jing saysAt the beginning of the world age heaven and earth were in great darknessA great black wind blew over the great oceanThe sun was then installed to illuminate the worldIt was placed halfway up Mount Sumeru along the solar routeIt turns around the four continents and shines on sentient beingsThe Qishi jing says At that time the world became darkSuddenly the sun moon and stars appeared and there were days nights years and seasonsThen the sun went up to the great palaceIt arose from the east circled around the middle of Mount Sumeru and went westward After it sets there it returns to appear again in the eastWhen sentient beings saw the sun rise from the east again they said to each other The sun rose from the east and circled around Mount SumeruIt will set in the west When they saw it a third time they said to each other This is the heavenly light that travels This is how the sun got its name The Zhidu lun says The diameter of the sun and the moon is five hundred yojanas and yet they appear to be no bigger than a fan when we see them The Chuchu jing says The Buddha told nanda The limit of what the human eye can see is known to be four hundred and twenty thousand yojanas The Lishi apitan lun saysWhy are there nightsWhy are there days There is night because of the sun and because of the sun there is dayThe realm of desire is itself darkBecause the sunlight is covered there is nightBecause the sunlight is exposed there is dayThe Qishi jing saysWhen the sun is at its highest point on the continent of Jambudvīpa  it is beginning to set on the continent of Pūrvavideha  it is beginning to appear on the continent of Aparagodānīya  and it is midnight on the continent of Uttarakuru When the sun is at its highest point on the continent of Aparagodānīya it is beginning to set on this continent of Jambudvīpa it is beginning to appear on the continent of Uttarakuru and it is midnight on the continent of PūrvavidehaWhen the sun is at its highest point on the continent of Uttarakuru it is beginning to set on the continent of Aparagodānīya it is beginning to appear on the continent of Pūrvavideha and it is midnight on the continent of JambudvīpaWhen the sun is at the highest point on the continent of Pūrvavideha it is beginning to set on the continent of Uttarakuru it is beginning to appear on the continent of Jambudvīpa and it is midnight on the continent of AparagodānīyaThe Buddha said to the monks West to the people in Jambudvīpa is east to the people in AparagodānīyaWest to the people in Aparagodānīya is east to the people in UttarakuruWest to the people in Uttarakuru is east to the people in PūrvavidehaWest to the people in Pūrvavideha is east to the people in Jambudvīpa The same relationship applies in the northsouth direction The Lishi apitan lun saysWhy is the one part of the moon black and the other part whiteIt is because of the sun that one part is black and the other part whiteThe course of the sun follows that of the moonEach day the distance between them either decreases by fortyeight thousand and eighty yojanas or increases by the same amountWhen they come closer  the sun covers three and onethird yojanas of the moon each day in fifteen days the sun covers the moon completelyOn that day the black part is completeThe sun also leaves the moon at the rate of fortyeight thousand and eighty yojanasThe moon opens up by three and onethird yojanas each day in fifteen days the moon is completely exposedThe people in the world say that the moon is completely white When the sun and moon are furthest apart the moon is full the people in the world say that the moon is completely whiteWhen the sun and moon are in the same place they are said to be moving together the people in the world say that the moon is completely black When the sun follows the moon the light of the sun illuminates the light of the moonBecause the light of the moon is coarse a shadow appears and this shadow covers the moonThis is why the back part of the moon is missingIn this way larger and larger parts of the moon are covered and in fifteen days the moon is covered completelyThe period when the sun follows the moon is designated as the black part When the sun precedes the moon each day new parts are exposed in the same way and in fifteen days the entirety of the moon becomes completely visibleThe period when the sun precedes the moon is called the white part The Qishi jing saysQuestionWhy is the night long and the day short in winterThe Buddha answered the monk After six months the sun palace begins to gradually travel southEach day it moves precisely six krośasIn this season the sun palace is at the southern end of Jambudvīpa where the land is narrowThe sun passes this end very quickly and therefore in winter the days are short and the nights are long Again why are the days longer and the nights shorter in spring and summerThe Buddha answered After another six months the sun palace begins to gradually travel northEach day it moves precisely six krośasDuring these seasons the sun travels over Jambudvīpa where the land is wide and its passage takes a long time Therefore the days are longFor this reason in spring and summer the days are long and the nights are shorter The Zhidu lun saysThe Nonretrogression chapter  speaks of the division of the day and month  which should be understood as followsThe day begins at dawn and ends at  consisting of the first part middle part and last partThe night is also divided into three partsThe day and the night together consist of thirty time units At the spring and fall equinoxes fifteen time units belong to the day and fifteen to the nightAt other times there are increases and decreasesAt the summer solstice in the fifth lunar month the day consists of eighteen periods and the night of twelve at the winter solstice in the eleventh lunar month the day consists of twelve periods and the night of eighteenThe month may consist of thirty and onehalf days or of thirty days or of twentynine and onehalf days or of twentyseven and onehalf daysThere are four kinds of monthsfirst is the month of the sun second the worldly month third the month of the moon and fourth is the month of the lunar stationsThe month of the sun is thirty and onehalf days the worldly month is thirty days the month of the moon is twentynine days plus thirty sixtyseconds of a day the month of the lunar stations is twentyseven days plus twentyone sixtieths of a dayThe intercalary month results from the combination of the month of the sun and the worldly month and is called the thirteenth monthSometimes thirteen months forms one yearThe year contains three hundred and sixtysix days and repeats itselfThe bodhisattva knows that in the middle of a day the former half of the day has already gone out of existence and the latter half of the day has not yet come into existenceThe middle point does not remain there is no specific and fixed characteristic that marks this pointThe day thus is empty there is no existence to which it correspondsWhen the thirtieth day of the month has arrived the preceding twentynine days have already disappearedHow can one gather all of the disappeared days in the one day that is present and form a month If a month does not exist in this way how can one gather these months and form a yearTherefore the Buddha said that worldly dharmas are like an illusion or a dreamThey are nothing but the delusive product of the mindA bodhisattva is capable of forming worldly days months and years he or she is also capable of deconstructing them into nonbeingThis is called skillful distinctionThe Qishi jing saysThere are four kinds of clouds in the world white black red and yellow cloudsOf these four kinds of clouds the white one is common in the realm of earth the black one is common in the realm of water the red one is common in the realm of fire the yellow one is common in the realm of windThe clouds rise above the ground into space Some reach one krośa and stay thereOthers reach two three and so on up to seven krośas and stay thereSome clouds go up into empty space to the height of one yojana and so on up to seven yojanas and stay thereSome clouds go up one hundred yojanas and so on up to seven hundred yojanas and stay thereSome clouds rise above the ground to the height of one thousand yojanas and so on up to seven thousand yojanasThis continues until the end of the world ageThe Chang ahan jing says At the beginning of the world age clouds appear and reach bhāsvara Heaven NoteAccording to scripture there are many kinds of cloudssometimes fivecolored and auspicious clouds appear at other times red clouds black clouds and other kinds of clouds appear These cannot be described exhaustivelyDetails can be found in such scriptures as the Renwang jing  The Qishi jing saysThe Buddha said to the monks Someone following nonBuddhist teachings may come and ask you Why is there sound in the sky You should then answer as followsFor three reasons of mutual contact sound appears in cloudy skiesWhat are the threeFirst the wind realm and the earth realm come into contact inside the cloud and for this reason sound occursSecond the wind realm and the water realm come into contact inside the cloud and for this reason sound occursThird the wind realm and the fire realm come into contact inside the cloud and for this reason sound occursWhy is this soFor example if the branches of a tree rub against each other fire may be created The contact  described above work in a similar way NoteAccording to scriptures there are many kinds of thundersometimes supernatural beings are said to hit the drum on the thunder chariotThus popular sayings speak of the heavenly drum Those with many sins and evil deeds are hit and die Here we see karmic retribution The Qishi jing saysThe Buddha said to the monks Someone following nonBuddhist teachings may come and ask you Why does electric lightning appear suddenly in the sky You should then answer as followsFor reasons that will be described in two parts electric lightning appears in the skyWhat are the two First the electricity of lightning in the eastern direction is called no thickness The electricity of lightning in the southern direction is called the stream The electricity of lightning in the western direction is called fallen light The electricity of lightning in the northern direction is called one hundred growing trees Second if the electricity called no thickness that appears in the eastern direction and the electricity called fallen light that appears in the western direction come into contact with each other they scrape and hit against each other and for this reason a bright light appears in the clouds in the skyThis is called electric lightningAgain if the electricity called following the stream that appears in the southern direction and the electricity called one hundred growing trees that appears in the northern direction come into contact with each other they scrape and hit against each other and for this reason electric lightning occursThis may be compared to the process of the wind blowing two trees into contact with each otherSuddenly fire appears and spreads through the two trees Note According to scripture sometimes there is first thunder but no lightning other times there is lightning but no thunderFrom the contact of electric currents fire results and then thunder may be heard by people and animals The Fenbie gonde lun saysThere are three kinds of rainthe rain of the gods the rain of the dragons  and the rain of the asurasThe rain of the gods is fine and misty The rain of the dragons is coarse with large raindropsWhen the dragons are happy the rain is mild and nourishing when they are angry thunder and lightning appearThe asuras who fight with the gods in Indras heaven are also capable of causing rainfallTheir rain is sometimes coarse and sometimes fine There are also many other kinds of rain Sometimes there are no clouds yet it rainsSometimes there is first a cloud and then it rainsSometimes the dragons bring down the rainSometimes it rains independent of the dragons The karmic conditions of sentient beings determine thisDetails can be found in the scriptures The Qishi jing saysThe Buddha said to the monks There are five conditions that create obstacles to rainfallDiviners cannot fathom these and become increasingly confusedThey predict rain yet the rain does not comeWhat are these fiveFirst a cloud rises in the sky and thunder is heard or lightning may be seen and a cold wind may begin to blowThese are all signs of approaching rain and all diviners of weather and astronomers determine that it will rain at that timeThen the asura king Rāhu comes out of his palace takes the cloud in his two hands and throws it into the oceanThis is the first condition that creates an obstacle to rainfallDiviners are not aware of this and yet the rain does not come Second a cloud rises in the sky and the sound of thunder is heard in the cloud lightning also appears and the wind brings cold airDiviners see these signs and determine that rain will comeThen the power of the fire realm increases and burns up the cloud that had appearedThis is called the second condition that creates an obstacle to rainfallDiviners are not aware of this and yet the rain does not come in the end Third a cloud rises in the sky and the sound of thunder is also heard in the cloud lightning appears as wellIn addition the wind brings in cold airWhen diviners see these signs they determine that rain will definitely fallBut the power of the wind realm increases and blows away the cloud and it goes into the riverbank in Kaliṅga or in a desert or into the riverbank in MoliannaThis is called the third condition that creates an obstacle to rainDiviners are not aware of this and yet the rain does not come in the end Fourth because sentient beings are licentious and defile the pure practices rainfall becomes irregularFifth because the people of Jambudvīpa do not follow the teaching they are stingy jealous and hold the mistaken opinions of heterodox views and for this reason rain does not fall NoteThese last two points are described in the original passage in the same way as the earlier three pointsThe Chang ahan jing also has a similar passage The Zengyi ahan jing saysThere are four kinds of shadows that cover the sun and moon and prevent their light from reaching usWhat are these fourThey are first clouds second dust in the wind third smoke and fourth the asurasThese all cover the sun and moon and prevent their light from reaching usMonks also have four kinds of bondage that cover the human mind and keep them away from understandingfirst the bondage of desire second anger third ignorance and fourth materialismThese all cover the human mind and keep it from understanding The Sifen lalso presents a similar list of four first licentious desire second drinking wine third amassing money and valuable objects and fourth wrong kinds of livelihoodThese four things also prevent the Buddhas teaching from being clearThus verses sayThe fire element causes smoke to rise up The cloud element takes the form of towering clouds The divine dragon spits out mist The rising dust falls on the world of human beings Wine is the gate of licentiousness Licentiousness is the source of life and death Gold and silver give rise to grave illness Wrong kinds of livelihood destroy the root of the precepts The Fo banniyuan jing saysnanda brought his palms together and asked the Buddha I would like to learn about earthquakes The Buddha said to nanda There are three conditions The first is that the earth sits on a body of water and the water rests upon the wind and the wind rests upon the skyWhen a great wind rises the water is disturbed and when the water is disturbed the earth movesThe second is that when a monk who has attained the Way or a mysterious god wishes to cause a cosmic response the earth moves as a consequenceThe third is the power of the Buddha Before and after achieving the buddhahood the Buddha moves and the suns moons and heaven and earth all respondMany among the gods and human and supernatural beings achieved understanding The Da fangdeng daji nianfo sanmei jing  saysThe entire earth shook in six waysmoving everywhere shaking everywhere swelling up everywhere roaring everywhere rising up everywhere and awakening everywhereEach of these six ways had three aspects thus there were eighteen manifestationsIn this way the east swelled up and the west sank the west swelled up and the south sank the south swelled up and the north sank the north swelled up and the south sank the middle swelled up and periphery sank the periphery swelled up and the center sankThe Lishi apitan lun saysThe Buddha told Purāṇa There is also a great deity whose powers are known in all the heavensIf this god wishes to make the earth shake then he can make the earth shakeSome monks have great supernatural abilities and powers and during visualization they can make the size of the earth change from large to small and from small to largeThese monks can also make the earth shakeThere is wind called Vilambā This wind blows constantly and upholds the movement of the earthSometimes the wind blows upward and sometimes downwardSometimes the wind blows from the side and sometimes it blows in a balanced way and holds up the earth as it turns The Zhidu lun saysThere are four kinds of earthquakesthe first kind is caused by fire the second by dragons the third by garuḍas and the fourth by the gods and the twentyeight lunar stationsRākṣasas and gods can also cause earthquakesThe Zengyi ahan jing says The Buddha was at rāvastī and said to the monks There are eight reasons for the quaking of the earthThe earth is sixtyeight thousand yojanas deep and is held up by waterThe water in turn is supported by empty spaceSometimes the wind in the empty space moves and the water also movesWhen the water moves the earth shakesThis is the first kind of earthquakeIf a monk acquires supernatural powers he can move about freely and regards the earth as if it were the palm of his own handHe can make the earth shakeThis is the second kind of earthquakeAgain the gods who have great supernatural and miraculous powers can make the earth shakeThis is the third kind of earthquakeAgain at the time when I as a bodhisattva in Tuṣita Heaven was about to be born into this world the earth shookThis is the fourth kind of earthquakeWhen I as a bodhisattva realized that I was in my mothers womb the earth shook greatlyThis is the fifth kind of earthquakeWhen I as a bodhisattva realized that ten months had passed and that I was about to come out of my mothers womb the earth shook greatlyThis is the sixth kind of earthquakeWhen I as a bodhisattva having renounced the householders life sat on the seat of enlightenment conquered Māra and finally achieved enlightenment the earth shook greatlyThis is the seventh kind of earthquakeWhen in the future I as a bodhisattva enter nirvana without remainder the earth will shakeThis is the eight kind of earthquake Note Elsewhere the scriptures also talk about many different kinds of earthquakesSometimes when the earth quakes holy beings come into the world when mountains quake holy beings who have attained the fourth fruit or arhats come into the worldOr when buddhas and bodhisattvas are said to come into the worldSome speak of the shaking of one worldsystem other of many worldsystems Sometimes it is said that sentient beings endowed with little merit can feel the earth quaking and being damagedDetails in terms of the primary and secondary karmic effects are described in the scriptures Compilers CommentBelow I will summarize briefly the descriptions in nonBuddhist sources of the first differentiation of heaven and earth yin and yang and the appearance of forms and their transformationsThere are five levels of discussionOriginal Substance Primal Simplicity Primal Commencement Primal Beginnings and Primal MaterialAccording to the Hetu The Original Substance has no shape it is noisy and activeAs it comes to rest it becomes earth as it looks down it becomes heaven The Litong says Heaven and earth are produced by the Original Substance they are the ancestors of the myriad things The Diwang shiji by Huangfu Shian says The Primary Substance when it begins to sprout is called the Primal Commencement The Sanwu liji saysWhen heaven and earth have not yet come into being they are undifferentiated like a chickens eggbegins in the undifferentiated state and becomes differentiated step by stepThe planet Jupiter begins its movement from the neighborhood of the Sheti stars The Original Substance is then opened upThe Dixi pu saysWhen heaven and earth first arise all is undifferentiatedThen the heavenly emperor is born and governs for a period of eight thousand years with the virtue of wood as the ruling principleThe Liezi says If that which has shape is born from that which is without shape then from where are heaven and earth bornZhang Qian s commentary saysheaven and earth have no origin from which they emerge they emerge spontaneously For this reason there was Primal Simplicity Primal Commencement Primal Beginnings and Primal MaterialThese transformed into the One the One transformed into the Seven the Seven transformed into the NineThe Nine is the ultimate point of transformation and on reverting it transforms into the OneThe One is the beginning of the transformationWhat is clear and light rises and forms heaven what is muddy and heavy falls and forms earthThe substance that is harmoniously blended forms human beingsFor this reason heaven and earth contain intelligent essences while the myriad things are born by transformation The Xici zhuan chapter of the Book of Changes Part I saysFor this reason in change there is the Great Ultimate from which the Two Principles of yin and yang emergeThese Two Principles give rise to the Four Images the Four Images give rise to the Eight TrigramsThe Eight Trigrams determine the auspicious and the inauspiciousThe Chunqiu wei Ganjingfu chapter saysThe ruler of human beings is equally luminous as the sun and moon and accords perfectly with the four seasonsTherefore heaven is his father earth his mother the sun his elder brother and the moon his elder sisterThe ruler treats heaven as his father in the ceremony performed at Round Hill he treats earth as his mother in the sacrifice of the Square Marsh he treats the sun as his elder brother at the Eastern Suburb and he treats the moon as his elder sister at the Western Suburb The Chunqiu wei Shuotici chapter saysThe speech of heaven is pervasiveResiding high it is principle below it is the scriptures for people It is the essence of all yang Containing all it is the Great One differentiated it takes on different namesFor this reason the character of the One is established heavenThe Chunqiu fanlu saysThere are five elements in heavenHeaven is one elementEarth is one elementYang is one elementYin is one elementSoil is one elementHuman being is one elementMetal is one elementWood is one elementWater is one elementFire is one elementAltogether there are ten elementsHeaven also has the energy of delight and anger as well as the heart of sadness and happinessHeaven and human beings go side by side harmonizing with each other in terms of the same categoriesHeaven and human beings are oneSpring brings life into being because of its energy of delightFall kills because of its energy of angerSummer nourishes because of its energy of happinessWinter stores because of its energy of sorrowThese four are shared by heaven and human beingsThe Erya saysQiongcang refers to the blue sky Li Xun saysIn ancient days people looked up and saw the shape of the sky rising high in the middle like an arch Its color is blueTherefore they called it arching blue Spring is called cangtian  Li Xun saysIn spring myriad things are bornTheir color is bluegreenTherefore spring is called blue sky Summer is called haotian  Li Xun saysIn summer the energy of myriad things is strong and their energy thrivesTherefore summer is called thriving sky Fall is called mintian  Li Xun saysIn fall myriad things ripen and show patternsTherefore fall is called patterned sky Pattern refers to the natural pattern given by skyGuo Jingchun says The character min means to take pityOne takes pity on myriad things that decline in fall Winter is called shangtian  Li Xun says In winter the energy of yin stays above and myriad things fall over and are stored belowTherefore winter is called higher sky Guo Jingchun saysThis means that at this time Nonbeing remains high above and looks down upon the world The Guangya saysThe sky is round Its northsouth diameter is two hundred million thirtythree thousand five hundred and seventyfive bu longIts eastwest diameter is four bu shorterIts periphery is six hundred million one hundred thousand seven hundred and twentyfive bu longThe distance between the ground and the sky is one million one thousand six hundred seventyeight and onehalf liThe thickness of the ground is the same as the height of the skyThe Xiaojing saysThere are seven barriers and six intermediate points all around heavenThe distance between the inner barrier to the middle barrier is altogether one hundred and nineteen thousand li each separated by nineteen thousand eight hundred and thirtythree and onethird liFrom the middle barrier to the outer barrier each is separated by fiftynine thousand five hundred liThe Luoshu zhenyaodu saysThe circumference of the sky is three hundred and sixtyfive and onequarter degreesOne degree is one thousand nine hundred and thirtytwo li longThe distance between the sky and the ground is one billion seven hundred million eight thousand five hundred li The Lunheng saysEach day it proceeds by one degreeOne degree is two thousand liIn the course of one days time it proceeds one thousand liIt moves as fast as the mythical animal qilinThe Baihutong saysThe sun moves slowlyThe moon moves quicklyWhile the sun moves one degree the moon moves thirteen and sevennineteenth degreesThe diameter of the orbit of the sun and the moon is one thousand liFurthermore to measure the course of the sun there is a distinction between the inside and the outsideThe distance between the extreme northern point to the extreme southern point is nine hundred and ninety yojanasThe sun takes one hundred and eighty days to move from the inside to the outsideIt also takes one hundred and eighty days to move from the outside to the insideThis is called the movementIt is said that the sun travels sixty li each day the wheel of the suns orbit is large and the sun travels slowly in the skyBecause it travels slowly it only covers sixty liFor this reason the year has twelve monthsSix months for northward moving six months for southward movingAltogether it travels a course of three hundred and sixty degrees The Baihutong says How is the waxing and waning of the moon effected by the sunIt takes three days to form the outline of the moon  it takes eight days to fill it with light In sixteen turns twice eight the cycle is completedAs the last day of the month changes to the morning of the first the moon receives the order again and the process repeats itself A month may be longer or shorterThe sky turns leftward the sun and moon turn rightwardThe sun moves slowly while the moon moves quicklyThe period for the moon to catch up with the sun is called a monthAfter twentynine days the moon is short by seven degrees but after thirty days it is in excess by seven degreesDays cannot be divided and so the shorter months are formedThis explains the effects of yin and yang Why is the intercalary month formedThe sky contains three hundred and sixtyfive and onequarter degreesIn the course of twelve months the sun falls short by twelve degreesTherefore one intercalary month is inserted in the third year another is inserted in the fifth yearIn these cases yin is insufficient and yang is in excessThe intercalary month results from the excess of yangXuzhengs Changli saysThe diameter of the orbit of the sun and the moon is one thousand liIts circumference is three thousand liThe distance from the ground is seven thousand liThe Shangshu says The light of the sun illuminates three hundred and six thousand li The Dishuoshu says The sun and the moon illuminate four hundred and fifty thousand li The Liezi saysConfucius traveled east and saw two children debating with each otherWhen he asked why one child said I think that the sun is closer to us when it first rises and is far away in the middle of the day The other child held that the sun is far away when it first rises and is closer in the middle of the dayThe first child said When the sun first rises it looks like a large wheel but in the middle of the day it looks like a small panDoes this not mean that when it is far it looks smaller and when it is closer it looks larger The other child said When the sun first appears the temperature of the air is coldIn the middle of the day it is as hot as boiling waterDoes this not mean that when the sun is close by it is hot and when it is far away it is cold Confucius could not decideThe two children laughed saying Why do people say that you are wise Huan Tans Xinlun saysWhen I was young I heard people tell the following story on the streetConfucius traveled east and saw two children debating with each otherWhen he asked why one child said I think that the sun is closer to us when it first rises and is far away in the middle of the day The other child held that the sun is far away when it first rises and is closer in the middle of the dayThe commandant of Changshui Guan Ziyang thought that the distance between people and heaven above is far and the areas in the four directions are closerWhen stars rise in the east in the evening they are few and scattered the distances between them are over one changIn the middle of the night they are high up in the sky in great numbers The distances among them are only one or two chiThe sun is the heavenly yangFire is the earthly yangThe earthly yang rises aboveThe heavenly yang comes downIf one lights a fire on the ground and checks its heat from the sides and from above regardless of differing distances the heat above exceeds by half the heat from the sidesWhen the sun is above  the heavenly yang is balanced at its peak pointTherefore it is hotWhen the sun has just risen the heat comes out of the sun  and so it is coolIn the west  the level of the heat is the same Yet the air is different from what it is in the morningThe Lunheng saysThe sun and moon are not roundThey look round because they are at a great distance from peopleThe sun is fire essenceOn earth water and fire are not roundHow could only fire in heaven be roundThe sun and the moon in heaven are like the five planetsThe five planets like other stars in constellations are not roundOnly their light makes them look roundHow do we know thisIn the Spring and Autumn period a meteor fell in the city of SongIt looked like a piece of stoneStones are not roundThus we know that the sun moon and the five planets are not round The Lunheng saysConfucian scholars say There is a threelegged crow in the sun The sun is fireIf a crow goes into a fire it is burnedHow could a crow stand in Thus the crow shares the essence of the sunThe Shi wei Tuiducai chapter says The moon acquires a soul in three days and light in eight daysWhen the body of the toad is formed the rabbit begins to appear The Chunqiu wei Yangong tu chapter says The toad is the essence of the moon The Chunqiu wei Yuanmingbao chapter saysThe yin essence forms the moonEach day it moves thirteen degreesIt always obediently accepts responsibility and receives It receives the yang essence Because it receives luminous essence within metal and water form its internal illumination The Hetu wei Shikai chapter saysThe dust of the Yellow Spring goes up to form the blue cloudThe dust of the Red Spring goes up and forms the red cloudThe dust of the White Spring goes up and forms the white cloud The dust of the Black Spring goes up and forms the black cloudThis appears in the Huainan Zi as well The Hetu wei Kuadixiang chapter says From Mount Kunlun fivecolored clouds appearThe Yijing  Shuogua chapter says Xun is windNothing is quicker than wind in bending myriad things The Hetu wei Ditongji chapter says Wind is the messenger of heaven The Erya saysThe condition in which the four energies are in harmony is considered to be pervasively correctThis is called jingfeng  Li Xun says auspicious wind is the Wind of Grand Peace The southern wind is called kaifeng The eastern wind is called gufeng The northern wind is called liangfeng The western wind is called taifeng The fenlun is said to be tui collapsing  The fuyao is said to be yan When wind is combined with fire it is called tun  Disturbance here describes how it flares up The turning wind is called piaofeng The wind that blows when the sun comes out is called baofeng The wind that blows bits of soil is called mai The wind that blows in cloudy weather is called yi The Yi wei Jilantu chapter says Falling yang is windThe movement of falling yang does not cause tree branches to make sounds The Yijing Shuogua chapter says Zhen is lei Nothing is greater than lei in moving myriad things The Hetu wei Ditongji chapter says Thunder is the drum of heaven and earth The Zuo zhuan saysIf one stores ice at the proper time then when thunder occurs it shakes If one abandons the ice and does not use it then even when thunder does not occur it shakesThe Chunqiu wei Yuanmingbao chapter says When yin and yang come together thunder is formed The Shi guang zhan saysIn the spring thunder begins to occur It makes the sound bobo gegeA thunderbolt is male thunder  it is formed by the essence of droughtIt makes a noise like the sound of the wordThe sound is not loud A thunderbolt is female thunder it is formed by the essence of water The Shi guang zhan saysIn the vernal equinox if rain is accompanied by thunder  its sound is like that of thunder but it is not really thunderThe sound comes from below the groundSoldiers appear from below the residenceIf there is no cloud in the sky and yet it thunders it is called the movement of a comet Inauspicious things will happen in the kingdom within three yearsThe Hetu wei Shikai chapter says Intensified yang is thunder  The Yi wei Jilantu chapter says When yin and yang are combined the lightning is bright and its light lasts long The Chunqiu wei Yuanmingbao chapter says When yin and yang strike against each other there is lightning  The Heavenly Offices chapter of the Book of History says Lightning is the movement of yin and yang The Geliang zhuan says Duke Yin said Ting is a kind of lei  NoteThis refers to an excessive oneToday these are called by another name for thunderbolt The Erya says Quick thunder is called tingni   The Shuowen says Zhen means thunderbolt  it shakes things The Shiming says Pili means to breakZhen means to fight It destroys whatever it attacks as if in battle The Yiyuan saysWhen the monk Huiyuan was meditating on Mount Lu traveling dragons flew in front of himMaster Yuan angered threw a stone at a dragon and hit itThe dragon then flew up highThen a sudden windstorm occurredThe master realized that this was caused by the dragonHe climbed up the mountain burned incense gathered the monks and they recited verses togetherThereupon a thunderbolt circled around the stone thrown at the dragonThe cloud and rain then disappeared The Yiyuan saysThe Qifu group had a hostage who was brutalHe held a thunderbolt in his palm and released it outside his bodyFour characters written on his back marked his offenseEarly in the history of the kingdom Shiqu abandoned himverses say The sun and moon have long been hung in their places The stars in the sky are constantly bright Like gold during the day and at night like jade How could they compare with total darkness When they appear there is bright light When they disappear they will return Waxing and waning hiding and reappearing From the last day of the month to the first day of the next they move in accordance with the measurements of astronomical instruments Stars are lined up according to their ranks Fortunes and longevity are controlled by mysterious powers Sages establish all these According to karmic causes good things increase Cloud and dragon meet Going up and down then separating from each other Thunder and lightning strike And cold and hot weather appears according to its proper timeThe Six Realms of Rebirth The Gods  Human Beings Demons  Ghosts and Spirits Animals and The Hells Introduction Explanation of the Name Suffering and Decrease of Karmic Effects To discuss the gods rebirths we know that they are rich and colorfulTheir clothing and possessions are luminously fresh and their bodies are light and skillfulYet even in the sixth and highest heaven among the heavens of the realm of desire there is King MāraHeaven of Nothought is still a state that nonBuddhist teachings claimed At the height of the four heavens of emptiness in the formless realm attachment to evil views is not slightIn the midst of the six heavens of the realm of desire delusions are particularly heavyWhen one fails to uphold the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and to serve the Nirvana Sutra arrogance grows and attachment to the self and others becomes increasingly powerfulConsequently the flowers worn by the gods on their heads wilt and the sweat from their armpits dampens the edges of their clothesThe light shining around the palace fades and the clothes of the deities made of diaphanous material gather dirtBecause of their pure minds beings repent and wash away all sins and they are variously born as gods in the heavenly realmsthe six heavens of the realm of desire ie the heaven of the four rulers the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods Tuṣita Heaven the realm of Yama the Heaven of Selfproduced Pleasures the Heaven of Pleasures Produced by Others the heavens of the realm of form ie Brahmā Brahmapurohita bhāsvara ubhakṛtsna Bṛhatphala Anāgāmi Abṛha Atapa Sudarśana and Sudṛśa the four heavens of the formless realm ie the heavens of Empty Space of Infinite Consciousness of Nothingness and of Neither Thought Nor NothoughtIn this way they occupy all possible space horizontally and vertically reach to the summit of the heavensSometimes the gods sit upright on flower seatsActivated their movement lasts over many world ages When they meditate in a jade palace they fix their gaze on one place and do not move from it for a thousand yearsLet the clothing given to them spontaneously never leave their bodiesroam around Indras palace called the Hall of Good Conductremain above the suffering of birth and death  remain free of the troubles of warfare reject receiving the five signs of decline for a long time and remain richly blessed with the seven jewels foreverLet their physical bodies be handsome and aweinspiring their appearance blindingly luminousHaving left behind the causes of suffering for long let them rise in purity to receive the fruits of happinessQuestionWhat is meant by the six realms of rebirth  AnswerAccording to the Pitan lun  qu means to arrive at It also means way The point is that good or evil causes are the way to arrive at places of rebirth for this reason these realms are called quAlso people arrive at different places of rebirth according to the karma that they themselves have produced for this reason these places are called quTo name the point of arrival implies a sense of directionIn other words the karma that people produce directs them toward such realms as heaven and hellQuestionAre there only these six realms Certainly there are other realms isnt it soAnswerEach school is consistent about the number of realmsThe Loutan jing speaks of the sentient beings of the nine realms of existence listing the realm of the bodhisattvas that of pratyekabuddhas and that of śrāvakas in addition to the six realms of rebirth mentioned earlierThis is because ordinary beings and those holy beings live together so that the former might benefit from the latters influenceAccording to the terminological explanation in the Posha lun  heaven is so called because it is filled with shining lightThe word heaven has a similar sound and meaning and is related to the word peak  which means above Heaven is the only existent thing among myriad things that are located in the sky aboveThat is why it is called the peak Heaven also means manifest Manifest implies that it is lofty and visible from everywhereAmong the myriad things only heaven is located high above making everything clearly visibleFor this reason it is called manifest QuestionWhy is the realm of heaven called by that nameAnswerThat realm is the most excellent the happiest the best the subtlest and the highest among all the realmsThat is why it is called the realm of heavenAccording to one source it is only after producing extraordinarily good conduct speech and thought that people are led there born there and continue to remain there for this reason it is called the realm of heavenAccording to another source that realm is called heaven because of the increase of light there In that realm light shines spontaneously day and nightGrammarians say that it is called heaven because there is the capacity for illumination there with this capacity superior consequences are manifested and the karmic causes of previous lives are thoroughly illumined thereThere is also an explanation that the realm is called heaven because beings there enjoy the pleasures of playThey are constantly playing and experiencing wonderful delights thereQuestionWhat do the gods look likeAnswerThey stand erectQuestionWhat language do they speakAnswerThey all speak SanskritAccording to the Lishi apitan lun Gods are called devas because they have performed good deeds they are born in that realm of existence that is why they are called devasTo briefly discuss features of the retribution bodies of gods there are no bones and flesh in their bodies nor do they do such impure things as urinating or excretingTheir bodies shine brightly both day and nightBecause of their karmic retribution they are endowed with the five supernatural powers and their physical bodies are free from all obstructionsTherefore the Zhengfanian jing  explaining the matter through metaphor saysSuppose someone were to light five hundred lamps in one room the light of each of these lamps does not overpower the light of any of the other lampsSimilarly five hundred gods may be easily placed in the hand of one god and the gods would not crowd or obstruct each otherThe same scripture also says Sometimes one hundred and sometimes one thousand Yama gods sit together on a single filament of a lotus flower because of the good consequences of their good deeds in previous lives they do not obstruct or crowd each otherAccording to the Dazhidu lun  In Bianjing Heaven the third heaven of the realm of form sixty gods can sit on the tip of a pin and listen to the Dharma without obstructing each other Again the Zhengfanian jing saysAt that time the King of Yama deity spoke in verse to the other deitiesIf a person contemplates the Buddha in his mind He is called someone who lives his life well Because he does not neglect contemplating the Buddha His life is called a life that matters among many lives If a person contemplates the Dharma He is called someone who lives his life well Because he does not neglect contemplating the Dharma His life is called a life that matters among many lives If a person contemplates the Sangha  He is called someone who lives his life well Because he does not neglect contemplating the monastic community His life is called a life that matters among many livesAgain according to the same scripture  there were three great beings in Yama Heaven who constantly preached the Dharma for the sake of undisciplined and indulgent godsWho were these threeFirst was the king of the Yama gods Mouxiuluntuo Bodhisattva second one was Goose King Bodhisattva and third was Peacock King Bodhisattva who was variously decoratedThese three great beings constantly preached the Dharma for the benefit of others sometimes succeeding in causing some of them to attain the level of the śrāvakas enlightenment and sometimes succeeding in causing some of them attain the level of the pratyekabuddhas enlightenmentI will now describe how the scriptures detail suffering in the realm of heaven as well as the suffering of the luminous realms of form and the formless realmEven though these higher realms are superior there is nevertheless some subtle pain thereTherefore according to the Chengshi lun  In the above two realms there are no crude forms of suffering but there are still subtle forms of sufferingHow do we know thisWe speak of the four positions of walking standing sitting and lying down in discussing the four meditative statesIn each of these four positions there is also sufferingFurthermore in the realm of form there are the consciousnesses of the eyes ears and bodyPerception in each of these consciousnesses is labeled as either pleasure or suffering When in one of the four modes of conduct  we seek to change to anotherFrom the fact that we seek to change we can infer the existence of sufferingFurthermore due to a lack of understanding people form attachments that are followed by karmic consequencesWhen they make this mistake great suffering resultsAs said in the scripture when life is about to end only those who have attained the Way show no sign of despair and suffering How can the ordinary beings we are discussing here be free of despair and sufferingThe expression free from suffering is used in the treatise because suffering is very subtleJust as when there is very little salt in our food we say it is free of salt The expression does not mean that there is only pleasure and no suffering at all in heavenIn the life of pleasure in the realm above beings are in a state of silent quietude free from attachment and they are incapable of giving rise to crude forms of greed and angerTherefore they are said to be free from suffering and pleasureFurthermore it is said that there is no suffering in heaven because there are no instruments of punishment such as swords and sticks thereIt is not that there are no subtle forms of suffering in heavenTherefore according to the Niepan jing Tca TEven in the most supremely pure and clean garden if one were to place a corpse inside it the garden becomes impure and people will abandon it and not be attached to itSimilarly in the heavens of the realm of form even though that realm is pure because beings have bodies the buddhas and bodhisattvas all abandon themThose who do not contemplate the matter in this way are not engaged in the cultivation of the bodyFrom this statement we know that suffering exists in the heavens According to the Fajubiyu jing Four monks were sitting under a tree and asked each other What is the greatest suffering in the world One of them said Sexual desire is the greatest suffering Another said Hunger and thirst are the greatest suffering The third said Anger is the greatest suffering The fourth said Fear is the greatest suffering They debated the meaning of suffering endlesslyThe Buddha knew what they were saying and going to the place where the monks were he asked What have you been debating about The monks paid respect to the Buddha and explained what they were debating in detailThe Buddha said Monks your discussion has not penetrated to the bottom of the meaning of sufferingThe greatest suffering in the world is having a bodyHunger and thirst cold and heat anger fear and the vice of sexual desire are all based on the bodyThe body is the source of all suffering it is the source of all troubleHuman beings are worried and anxious about everything crawling around in the three realms like worms and yet we cruelly harm each otherWe are attached and bound to the idea of self and ceaselessly go through lives and deathsAll of this comes from the bodyIf you desire to be liberated from worldly suffering you must seek absolute quietudeBy controlling your mind correctly and becoming quietly freed from all thought you can attain nirvanaThis is the greatest pleasureFrom this quotation we know that beings who have not attained the holy knowledge and who have not destroyed their bodies that belong to the three realms cannot be free from sufferingQuestionIn the realm of form beings have bodies and thus can receive sufferingIf they do not have forms and shapes  in what forms are beings born that they receive sufferingAnswerThis kind of retribution is very subtle and minute to the point of being invisibleThough they are free from crude obstructions they are not without subtle formsThis issue is discussed extensively in another chapterAccording to the Zhidu lun When beings die or withdraw from the above two realms  they are greatly distressed in the lower realm it is as if they have fallen from the highest place and have been broken into piecesAccording to the Zhengshi lun Suffering and pleasure accompany a body through the four stages in the realm of formDespair and joy accompany the mind to the summit of all the heavensQuestionThose who are reborn in the heavens have rejected evil deeds and accumulated good deedsWhy then are they reborn in the three evil realms of the hells hungry ghosts and animals if their karmic retribution has been exhaustedAnswerFrom the very beginning of time sentient beings have committed an infinite number of evil deedsIf they have been greedy and angry for one day they receive rebirths in a thousand different formsSo since they have committed many evil deeds they are reborn even more times The karmic effects disappear after a limited period of time and further rebirths followWhen the karmic retribution for their good deeds is exhausted the seeds of the evil deeds they committed earlier mature and they are reborn again in the three evil realmsThere is nothing puzzling about thisTherefore according to the Chengshi lun Suppose someone who is in the realm of form or the formless realm has claimed that that existence is nirvana when his life ends he remains in the intermediate state of existence in the realms of form or desire and falls into a heterodox view saying that there is no nirvanaHe then reviles the supreme DharmaFrom this we learn that evil deeds exist in the the realms of form and desireFurthermore according to the Zhidu lun  Those who die in the Heaven of Neither Thought Nor Nothought fall into Avīci Hell From this we learn that all realms of rebirth in the three realms are filled with sufferingThird let us clarify suffering in the heavens of the realm of desireWhen beings engage in battles in those heavens they harm one another and both their bodies and minds sufferIf their limbs are cut off they grow back againWhen they are severed in two at their necks or torsos they then experience the suffering of deathAccording to the Pitan  All gods living in the heavens of the realm of desire commit deeds that belong to each of the ten categories of evil deeds variously in opposition to the rules of disciplineEven though gods do not harm other gods they harm the beings in other realms of existenceSometimes they cut off their hands or legs but the beings are then rebornIf they cut off the heads of these beings they dieThe beings attack each other one after another Starting from these extreme cases evil deeds that fall into all the other categories of evil deeds are all present in the heavensFurthermore when the effects of their merits are about to be exhausted the five signs of decline appear and the gods become greatly distressedAccording to the Niepan jing Although in the heavens there is nothing that causes major suffering and the bodies of the gods are soft and smooth when they see the five signs they suffer greatly in a manner that is no different from the suffering of the beings in the hells and other evil realmsThus birth in heaven is like honey mixed with poisonit tastes good at first but causes suffering laterAccording to a verse in the Zhengfanian jing If honey is mixed with poison it cannot be eaten The pleasures in the heavens are like that when beings leave they suffer greatly When their karmic effects have been exhausted they become despondent and distressed As they abandon the heavenly maidens Their moment of departing from the heavens is full of great suffering Such suffering is beyond comparison The time when the karmic effects of good deeds are about to be exhausted Is like the moment when a candle flame goes out They do not know in which realms they will be reborn Great suffering arises in their hearts When they are about to leave the heavens Great suffering arises in their hearts Various kinds of suffering and pain in the hells Sixteen of these is still less than this one kind of suffering  All circles of flame Result from the power of loving attachment Loving attachment chains and binds sentient beings to various evil realms of existence The three realms are like a turning wheel Bound by the effects of karma the wheel turns ceaselessly For this reason if a being abandons love and desire Through rejecting desire he can attain nirvana Again according to the Niepan jing Even if beings receive the bodies of gods such as in Brahmā Heaven and the gods of the Heaven of Neither Thought Nor Nothought when their lifetime as a god is over they again fall into the three evil realms of existenceEven if beings receive the bodies of gods such as the four heavenly kings and the Heaven Where Gods Freely Enjoy Pleasures Produced by Others  when their lifetime as a god is over they go to the realm of animals where some are born as lions and others as tigers buffaloes hyenas wolves elephants horses oxen and donkeysFrom this passage we learn that when the karmic effects that led to their birth as gods are exhausted these gods suffer greatlyNow that we know about these difficulties we should confess our sins openly and sincerely listing them item by item and expiate them through ritual repentanceIf someone has committed a sin but its karmic consequences have been exhausted and if that person later performs good deeds he may be reborn in heaven Yet they are still subtly affected by the influences of their earlier sinAccording to the Zhengfanian jing If a god committed the sin of stealing in his previous life at the time he sees with his own eyes the heavenly maidens taking the jewelry that he himself is wearing and offering the jewels to other godsIf a god committed the sin of lying in his previous life when the heavenly maidens hear what that god says they misunderstand him as expressing a wrong view and utter abusive words to himIf a god offered wine to someone who was upholding the precepts or violated the precept and drank wine himself or produced wine then when he is about to die his mind becomes confused and unable to concentrate on correct thought he falls into hellIf a god committed the sin of killing living beings in his previous life the life span of this god is shortened and his life in heaven ends quicklyIf a god committed the sin of sexual licentiousness in his previous life all the heavenly maidens abandon him and sport with the other gods with delightThese are called the five signs of declineBecause the gods were negligent in upholding the five precepts they are bound by the effects of karma and suffer from these retributionsAgain according to the same source  The god Indra again contemplated the fruits of karmaOn the wall of the temple he saw the eighteen sections of Screaming HellThose who commit the sins of killing living beings stealing sexual licentiousness and lying fall into this hell and suffer in various waysWhen they come out of hell they are reborn as hungry ghosts and live very long lives in this formWhen they die in the realm of hungry ghosts they are reborn as animals and harm each other cruellyWhen they die in the realm of animals they are reborn as human beingsTheir bodies are emaciated and they lack any authority and powerIf they are suffering from the effects of other sins even if they are reborn as gods the size of their body and their very appearance are inferior and the jewelry that decorates their bodies and their halo are unimpressiveThey are not loved by the heavenly maidensThe heavenly maidens turn against them abandon them and go to the other deitiesThese humble deities possess little wisdom and their minds are not upright and honestThey are laughed at by the other godsWhen the gods and asuras fight they are killed by the asurasAll this is because of the effects of the other sins that these beings had committedAccording to the new translation of the Posha lun Tc When the life of a god in the heavens is about to end two types of the five signs of decline appear the first is called minor signs and the second is called majorWhat are the minor five signs of declinekinds of beautiful music are heard from the jewels that decorate their bodiesThe music is more beautiful than that performed by professional musiciansWhen a god reaches the stage nearing the end of his life this sound stopsAccording to one view an uncontrollable sound is also heardTheir body has no shadowWhen their life is about to end the light becomes dimAccording to one view when a god finally dies his shadow appears immediatelythe fragrant ponds and come out of the water it does not cling to their bodies and their skin is dryTheir skin is like the flower and leaves of a lotusWhen a god reaches the stage nearing the end of his life water clings to his bodybeyond the limits of ordinary sense organsIt turns like a wheel of fire and does not remain still even for short periods of timeWhen a god reaches the stage nearing the end of his life he becomes fixated on one object of perception and even after a long time he cannot get rid of it blink their eyesWhen a god reaches the stage nearing the end of his life his physical strength weakens and he blinks many timesWhat are the major five signs of declineA gods clothing which was previously clean becomes soiledThe crown of flowers  which was previously blooming now withersSuddenly sweat flows from the gods armpitsAn unpleasant smell suddenly comes from the gods bodyThe god cannot remain seated comfortably in his own seatThe situation can be changed even after the first of these two sets of five signs of decline has appearedWhen the five kinds of minor signs of decline appeared the god Indra thought that the five kinds of major signs of decline were about to appear and he became frightened He entertained the following thoughtIf anyone can save me from this decline and calamity I will later take refuge in him Then he realized that none other than the Buddha the Worldhonored One could protect him from He went to the place where the Buddha was staying and asked him to show compassion and save himThe Buddha preached for him and when gained insight into the truth all of the signs of decline disappeared at onceThe god jumped up dancing in joy and delight before the Buddha uttered many loving words and uttered the following verseThe Great Sage should know That sitting in this seat I regained the life span of a god I only wish to honor and remember you According to the Shefu luohan jing Once there lived a god in the Heaven of the Thirtythree GodsWhen his life as a god was about to end seven kinds of signs appearedThe light on his neck disappeared the flowers in his headdress withered the color of his face changed dust gathered on his clothes sweat came out of his armpits his body became thin and he left his own seat Then he thought to himself After my life here is ended I will be reborn in a lower realm as a pig in the womb of a scabrous sow in the kingdom of Kuśinagara He was greatly distressed but did not know what he could do The other gods said The Buddha is here now preaching for the multitudeOnly the Buddha can help you escape from your plight caused by your previous sins The god immediately went to the Buddha and greeted him respectfully bowing to touch his forehead to the Buddhas feetBefore he had a chance to ask a question the Buddha knew what he had in mind and said You certainly know that all things are ultimately transientWhy do you become distressed about such matters as obtaining or leaving the body of a pig Recite the Three Refuges regularly Thus the god recited the Three Refuges three times every dayAfter seven days the gods life as a pig ended and he was reborn as a son of an elder in the kingdom of VaiśālīWhile he was still in his mothers womb the god recited the Three Refuges three times dailyAs soon as he was born and his feet touched the ground he kneeled and took refuge in the Three Jewels of his own accordWhen his mother gave birth to him there was no afterbirthThe maidservants who were attending the birth were all frightened and ran awayThe mother was also puzzled saying that the baby was a delusion caused by the deity of Mars and she was about to kill itThe father realized however that the baby was an extraordinarily noble person and ordered that he be brought up with great careWhen he was almost seven years old he was playing at the roadside with some friends and happened to see āriputra and Maud gal yāyana approachThe child went forward and paid respect to themThe holy ones were surprised so the child explained in detail his experience with the Buddha in heavenThis child invited the Buddha to come to his house and the Buddha preached for himThe child his parents and all the members of his extended family attained the rank of avaivartya which means free from retrogression NoteAccording to the scriptures there are many different kinds of godsDetails were given in the thirtytwo parts in the section on the three realms In the present context in the discussion of the six realms of existence I discussed the subject briefly in six parts Miracle Stories From the Jin dynasty  Layman Shi Shiguang and the monks Shi Huiwei and Shi Xianhu from the Song dynasty  two women with the surname Lun from the Wei and Wei dynasties  the monk Shi Tanluan and Layman Chuan Xianchao from the Liang dynasty  the monk Shi HuishaoIntroduction to the Miracle Stories Evil karmic consequences are momentous and they easily mislead peoples minds as they proceed on their paths the powers of myriad good deeds are miniscule and it is difficult for them to evoke a response from spiritual realityWicked thoughts occur frequently we often hear about immoral situationsThe right Dharma is seldom encountered the teaching declines and the Way is lostFor this reason if we fail to pursue the truth even for one moment then we are separated from it for a period of ten thousand world ages if we are distanced from it even for one splitsecond we are kept apart from it for a long period of one thousand reignsIndeed because those who have faith in the right Dharma and those who damage it are constantly in competition and good and evil people are in conflict with each other ignorant and deluded people easily become shallow admirers of the heterodox teachings and those who follow the pure and correct teaching frequently encounter unjust persecutionsFor this reason after more than six hundred years have passed since the Dharma entered China has been persecuted three timesDisasters followed one after another and calamities reached our own timesThe occurrences of such events are signs of cosmic responses and retributions for our moral conductThus the Prince of Jianan had a miraculous dream and was cured of his illnessMiraculous spirits appeared to Wenxuan and his illness was curedWhen the king of Wu surrounded a temple a light appeared floating above the relicWhen a Qi ruler was about to execute punishment the blade of his sword suddenly broke into piecesWhen the ruler of the Yuwen family persecuted Buddhism boils erupted on his bodyWhen the Toba ruler abolished Buddhist temples pus flowed from his abscessesSun Hao urinated on an image of the Buddha and his penis achedHelian was wicked and was killed by lightningMatters concerning good or evil deeds fortunes and misfortunes and other auspicious signs are recorded extensively in such works as the Xuanyan the Mingxiang the Baoying the Gantong the Yuanhun the Youming the Sao shen the Jingyi the Fayuan the Hongming the Jinglu yixiang the Sanbao zhengying the Shengji guixin the Xiguoxing zhuan the Mingseng the Gaoseng and the Mingbao shiyiThere are hundreds of fascicles of such works and they cannot be listed here in detailIn these works the facts are recorded in the scriptural style and highlighted more clearly than the sun and moon in the sky so that everyone can see them clearlyIf anyone doubts the truth of retribution the consequence is that he will end up in delusionTherefore a scripture says If a person performs a good deed good reward follows if he performs an evil deed an evil retribution follows The Book of Changes says A house that heaps good upon good is sure to have an abundance of blessingsA house that heaps evil upon evil is sure to have an abundance of ills Truly we know that retributions for good and evil deeds follow like shadows and echoes pain and pleasure appear one after anotherI have examined over four thousand stories and selected stories of miraculous occurrences that I have appended at the end of each chapterUnless proofs are cited it is difficult to remove a difficult diseaseAs for other pieces of evidence not included here it is my wish that someone will supplement these sections with themJin Dynasty Layman Shi Shiguang was a man of XiangyangIn the eighth year of the Xianghe period he died in WuchangSeven days later the monk Zhi Fashan was reciting the shorter version of the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra when he became tired and laid down for a whileHe heard a human voice in the spirit altarThere was a maidservant in the Shi household whose name was ZhangxinShe saw Shiguan sitting on the spirit altar dressed in exactly the same way as he had always dressedShiguang said to Zhangxin I was originally destined to be reborn in the realm of dragons but Master Zhi recited a scripture for me and Tanhu and Tanjian welcomed me to the pleasurable location of the seventh heaven of the god BrahmāTanhu and Tanjian were both novice monks of Zhi Fashan and they had passed away Later Zhi Fashan was again invited to the household to recite the longer version of the Perfection of Wisdom SutraShiguang again came to the spirit altarWhile he was still alive Shiguang had donated two banners and the banners were still at the temple He called out to Zhangxin and asked Send those banners to me As soon as Zhangxin replied Certainly she immediately diedWhen Zhangxin brought the banners they both flew together in the northwestern direction ascending a dark green mountain the color of a vaiḍūrya jewelWhen they reached the top they could see the Gate of Heaven at a distanceShiguang then held up the banners himself and let Zhangxin returnHe gave her a piece of dark green incense that looked like a pea saying Present this to Master Zhi Fashan Before Zhangxin had completed her return trip she saw from a distance Shiguang entering the Gate of HeavenZhangxin continued on her journey and arrived back home and suddenly she was revivedShe no longer had the incense in her handThe banner was still at the templeWhen Shiguang and Zhangxin had left the house together a sixyearold boy in the household pointed his finger and said to his grandmother Father is flying in the skyGrandma can you see him Later Shiguang returned to the house accompanied by more than ten heavenly beingsAfter roaming around the house for a while they departedEvery time he came back he was wearing a hairpin and a head cover but when he left his head was bareZhangxin asked him about this and he answered In heaven there is a crown but I do not wear it here Later he appeared wearing the heavenly crown accompanied by a group of heavenly beings who were playing drums and zithers and singingQuickly he went to his motherZhangxin asked him Why do you come so frequently Shiguang said I come to let you people learn about moral retributionI also wish to entertain my mother The sound of the zither was pure and beautiful entirely unlike worldly musicEveryone in the household both young and old could hear itHowever their voices seemed muffled as if they were being heard over a wallPeople could not distnguish themOnly Zhangxin could understand their speech clearlyAfter a while they leftZhangxin went to send them off and she saw Shiguang enter a black gateAfter a while he came out and said to her My fatherinlaw is receiving the punishment of whipping today It will be extremely painful and unbearableI took a glance and came backHe had been found guilty of the crime of murderTherefore he is receiving this retributionTell my sisterinlaw that if she gets a monk to recite a scripture will be able to escape this punishment The fatherinlaw had been the General of Light Chariot The punishment caused by retribution then ceasedThe origin of the monk Shi Huiwei of Changan is unknownHe stayed at a great temple in Changan and upheld the precepts maintaining remarkable purityFrequently he went up into the mountains and down into the valleys to cultivate the practice of meditationA headless ghost approached him but Huiwei did not show any sign of surprise or fear on his faceHe said to the ghost You have no headThat means that you never have a headacheHow wonderful The ghost disappeared and then reappeared as a ghost without a torso he only had arms and legsHuiwei again said You have no torsoThat means that you never have troubles with any of the five organsHow pleasurable Immediately the ghost again changed his appearanceHuiwen sent him away every time speaking to him in the same mannerA long while later it became very cold and started snowingA woman came to ask him to let her stay overnight at the place where he was practicingHer appearance was attractive and she was wearing a brightly colored dressShe conducted herself in a pleasing and elegant fashion saying that she was a heavenly maidenShe said Because you are virtuous the gods sent me to come and amuse you She spoke in a manner that was meant to arouse desire and lead Huiwei astray from his original commitment but Huiwei maintained his integrity and his mind was not disturbed even for a momentHe then said to her My mind is like lifeless ashesIt cannot get tempted by a bag of skin The woman then went away beyond the cloudsLooking back she said It is possible to drain the water of the oceanIt is possible to make Mount Sumeru lean to one sideBut this monk holds fast to his commitment and nothing will affect that Later in the third year of the Longan period  Huiwei traveled to the west accompanying FaxianWe do not know where his life came to an endThis story comes from the Liang gaoseng zhuan Tbc There was also Shi Xianhu whose secular surname was SunHis place of origin was LiangzhouHe came to stay at Yanxingsi in Guanghan and practiced meditation on a regular basisHe was also well informed about monastic discipline and never violated the monastic code even a littleHe died in the fifth year of the Longan period of the Jin dynasty When he was about to die fivecolored lights appeared from his mouth and illuminated the temple interiorHe had left instruction that his body be cremated and his disciples followed this orderAfter all the joints of his body had completely burned up one finger of one hand remained intactSo his disciples buried the finger at the bottom of his stupaThis story comes from the Liang gaoseng zhuan Tc Song Dynasty Cengcheng in Dongguan was the place of origin of two women with the surname Lun who were the sisters of ShizuIn the ninth year of the Yuanjia period  the older sister was ten years old and the younger sister was nineTheir village was remote and the people there were ignorant no one knew the teachings of the scripturesSuddenly on the eighth day of the second month both sisters disappearedThree days later they returned and asserted that they had seen the BuddhaOn the fifteenth day of the ninth month they again disappearedAfter ten days they returned speaking a foreign languageThey recited Buddhist scriptures and other books in SanskritWhen they encountered a monk from Central Asia they could communicate freely with him right awayOn the fifteenth day of the first month of the following year they again went awayPeople who were working in the fields said that they saw them rise up into the sky with a gust of windTheir parents fearful wailed loudly and offered sacrifices to the gods asking for good fortuneAfter a month the sisters returnedThey had shaved their heads and become nunsThey were clothed in nuns robes and held the hair that had been shorn from their heads in their handsThey told the following story We saw the Buddha and some nunsThey said Because of your karmic conditions from previous lives you will be our disciples The Buddha raised his hand and rubbed the hair on our heads and the hair then fell offThe Buddha gave us our religious namesThe older one is called Fayuan and the younger FacaiWhen we were about to be sent back the Buddha said You should build a templeI will give you the scriptural teaching After they returned home the women destroyed the spirit altar and raised a hut as a templeDuring the night they recited the scripturesEvery evening a fivecolored light was seen floating around the mountain peaks like so many lampsThe two women said From now on our deportment will be elegant and our use of speech correctEven the customs of the capital city will not be superior to our manners The prefect Wei Lang went to the village and offered his goodwill and material support When he heard the people in the village talking about them he was truly amazed and marveled at what they saidBecause of these events the people in the village in a valley honored the Buddhas teachingThis story comes from the Mingxiang ji Wei Dynasty The family background of the monk Shi Tanluan of Xuanzhongsi in the Shibiku valley in Xihe is unknown but the family was originally from YamenThe familys residence was near Mount Wutai and people in the area enjoyed hearing stories of miracles and strange eventsTanluan had a chronic disease and went around seeking treatmentComing to a ruin at Qinling in Fenquan he went into the deserted city and looked upward above the eastern gateThere were blue clouds and suddenly he saw the Gate of Heaven openTanluan clearly saw the officials occupying the courtly ranks in the six heavens of the realm of desire those of higher rank overshadowing those of lower rank in an orderly fashionBecause of this his illness was curedLater Tanluan visited Tao s hermitage in Jiangnan He was seeking the immortals techniques which he hoped would prolong his lifeWhen he came to the mountain Tao welcomed him in delight and gave him a work in ten fascicles describing the immortals techniquesOn his way back home Tanluan came to the Zhejiang River where a deity called the Master of Baolang Zi livedWhen a drum was struck the high waves would last for seven daysTanluan encountered high waves and could not cross the riverHe then went to the shrine of this deity explaining his situation and he prayed to the deity promising him that if he responded to his request he would raise another shrine thereImmediately the deity manifested his body which looked as if it was twenty zhang tallThe deity approached Tanluan and said If you want to cross  you should do so tomorrow morning I hope you will not renege on your promise In the morning the waves were still quite rough and high sounding as if they were driven by angry drumbeatsAs soon as Tanluan entered the boat the water became quiet and peacefulThus he was able to cross to the other sideThe emperor of the Liang dynasty thought highly of him and therefore ordered a shrine to be built for the deity of the Jiang River Tanluan later left the emperors palace and came to the border of the northern state of WeiHe was hoping to visit famous mountains to learn about new techniques for cultivationWhen he came to Luoyang he met the Tripiṭaka master BodhiruciTanluan said to him Buddhism contains many instructions for prolonging life and achieving immortality Are these superior to the teaching of the immortals scriptures in this land Bodhiruci spat on the ground and said What kind of nonsense is thisThe two teachings are not comparableWhere in this land is a teaching that prolongs life and achieves immortalityEven if you could prolong life would it be very long before you died and ended up circulating in the three realms of existence Bodhiruci then gave Tanluan the Sutra on Contemplation  saying This is the technique of the Great SageIf you follow this in your cultivation you are bound to achieve liberation from the cycle of life and death that repeats for eternity Later Tanluan moved to Xuanzhongsi a temple carved into the rock wall of Mount Beishan in FenzhouSinglemindedly he followed the teaching of  cultivating the Pure Land practiceWhen he was sixtyseven on the day his life was to come to an end flags flowers banners and umbrellas appeared high above the temple buildingFragrance filled the air and loud music was heardEveryone who was ascending the mountain to the temple witnessed thisIn the fourth year of the Xinghe period of the Wei dynasty Tanluan died at the mountain temple on Mount PingyaoHe was sixtyseven years oldThis story comes from the gao seng zhuan Tac Wei Dynasty The personal name of Chuan Xianchao a retainer in the Qibei Commandery was YiqiDuring the Jiaping period  while spending the night alone he dreamed of a heavenly maiden who came and followed himShe described herself as a jade woman of heavenShe was originally from the Eastern Commandary Her name was Chenggong Zhi qiongShe had lost both parents as a childThe Ruler of Heaven pitied her for the pain she suffered living alone and issued an order to allow her to descend to the human world and marry a husband thereChuan Yiqis dream mentioned above was the consequenceYiqis soul was alerted to her presence and was delighted by her extraordinarily beautiful appearanceWhen Yiqi awoke from the dream he kept thinking about the jade woman reverentlySometimes she seemed to be there and other times she was absentThis continued for three or four eveningsThen she manifested more solidly arriving in a carriage and attended by eight maidservantsShe was dressed in lace and embroidered silk and her face and body were those of the flying immortalsShe said that she was seventy years old but her appearance was that of a fifteenor sixteenyearold girlOn the carriage was a barrel of wine clear and white and there were five kinds of utensils made of vaiḍūrya jewelsExtraordinary food and drink were provided and they brought the wine down and started eatingYiqi joined in the feastThe woman said to Yiqi I am a heavenly jade womanI was sent down to be married and that is why I am here to accompany youIs this not a proof of your great virtueIf the cosmic fortunes dictate that I spend the night  we shall become husband and wifeEven if no benefits result from this there will be no harm eitherHowever in moving here and there I must ride in a carriage or on a wellnourished horse my food and drink must be of exotic kinds sent from distant places plain or patterned silk material must always be provided in plenty And because I am a goddess I cannot bear a child for youMy nature is not at all jealous howeverIt is alright if you fulfill the worldly obligations of marrying and having a human family elsewhere In the end Yiqi and the deity became husband and wifeShe presented a poem to himFluttering up and down and suddenly going up I speak I play with my fellow deities among cliffs of clouds piled up one upon the otherFlowers of miraculous grass do not require wateringSupreme virtue appears at the appointed timeWould an immortal descend for no purposeImmortals arrive in response to cosmic fortunesIf you accept me as your wife I will bring prosperity to the five groups of relativesIf you send me away calamities will followThis is the outline of the poemThe original text of the poem contains over two hundred words and cannot be reproduced here in fullShe also wrote a commentary on the Book of Changes a work in seven fascicles and predicted auspicious and inauspicious fortunesYiqi always made use of her predictionsSeven or eight years after they became husband and wife Yiqis parents arranged for him to marry an ordinary wife After that the heavenly woman avoided him during the daytime and appeared at night to sleep in his houseShe would arrive in the evening and depart early in the morningShe would appear and disappear suddenly as if she were flying aroundOnly Yiqi saw her others could not see herIf Yiqi was in a dark room with her human voices could be heardSuch traces of her presence were frequently found yet no one else could see her bodyLater people became suspicious and asked him about these eventsSo Yiqi told them about his situationThen the jade woman requested his permission to leave saying I am a deityThough I have been with you I do not wish to be seen by othersYou are by nature careless and sloppy and have told others about our relationship over the yearsOur love is strong and once we are separated we will certainly feel miserable and resentful But this turn of events prevents us from prolonging this relationshipEach of us must do our best She called her attendants to bring wine and foodShe wrote a Daoist register made two layers of clothes from a piece of silk cloth and presented these to YiqiShe also offered a poemTaking your arm I take leave of you shedding tears I depart on an aimless journeyIn numinous quietude I climb onto the carriage which leaves quickly as if it is flyingAfter  Yiqi fell into a deep depression that lasted for days and took him to the verge of a nervous breakdownLater he happened to be on a road on Mount Yu in QibeiHe was traveling westward and looking far ahead he saw a horsedrawn carriage on a winding road The person on the carriage looked like the jade woman ZhiqiongHe ran to the front of the carriageIndeed she was the jade womanSo he opened the cover over the carriage and the two saw each otherAt first they were overwhelmed with emotion but then they were happyHelping each other back into the carriage they sat closely together and rode the carriage to LuoyangThere they established a household and lived together just as they had beforeShe was still alive during the Taikang period  but she no longer came and went everydayOnly on the third day of the third month the fifth day of the fifth month the seventh day of the seventh month the ninth day of the ninth month and the first and fifteenth days in the same month does she come down to see him and after spending the night she returns Zhang Mosheng composed a poem about the divine woman Liang Dynasty The secular surname of the monk Shi Huishao of Longyuansi in the Shu Commandery was Chen His original registration was in Taiqiu in YingquanWhen he was a small boy he wanted to know a great deal and he was remarkably more intelligent than his peersWhen he was fiftyfour years old he died in the Moheyan Hall of the temple in which he was basedAt that time there was a citizen of Chengdu called Ying Shifeng a wise personHe became ill and lost consciousness but his body around his heart remained warmAfter five days he regained consciousness and told the following storyHe had been taken to King Yama and heard him give verdictsHe heard Yama say Welcome Dharma Master Shortly thereafter Master arrived King Yama stepped down from the building and with palms joined he bowed to touch his forehead to the masters feetThe king did not say a word but prepared a document that had one large character zheng  on itHuishao went outside and sat under a tree at the side of an open road A young boy appeared and presented a robe placed inside a lacquered willow winnowerHe bade Huishao to put it onTen monks appeared to welcome himShifeng recognized two among them as the meditation masters He and CiThere were lines of banners and decorative umbrellas along the sides of the road and then flew up and went awayAgain during the night of the day Huishao died a nun at Anpusi who had been ill for a long time lost consciousnessAfter regaining consciousness she told the following story She had accompanied Dharma Master Huishao and five hundred monks and they had climbed seven jeweled staircases to reach the lecture hall of the heavenly palaceThe ground looked like quartz and the seats were beautifully decoratedThere were also dusters and tablesLotus flowers filled the pondHuishao sat at his seat and talked for awhileAfter a short while he stood up and ordered those who had come to send him off to return There are other extraordinary signs and miracles like these that occurred at Huishaos deathOn the third day of the seventh month of the second year of the Tianjian period  Huishao died at LongyuansiHe was fiftyfour years old This story comes from the Liang gaoseng zhuan refTang gaoseng zhuan Tcb Introduction Explanation of the Name Places Where Human Beings Reside Karmic Causes Noble and Humble Beings  The Wealthy and the Poor  and SufferingIn the realm of human beings their bodies look impressive on the surface but they commit numerous sinsHuman beings take pleasure in doing wrong thingsThe Way of humanity and wisdom has declined and the teaching of love and goodness has disappearedConsequently Cui Shu murdered his lord Shang Chen killed his fatherSix powers competed with each other ten thousand states formed aggressive alliancesAll indulge in arrogance each displays unrestrained licentiousnessThe atmosphere of purity has long disappeared influences of moral superiority do not prevailThe three poisons flourish in competition the ten entanglements contest with each other to issue forthThe four violent flows of passion spread widely the five corners that obscure the mind are deeply rooted in mysterious profundityWrong views and ignorance continuously reappear in great profusionConsequently life becomes precarious like a leaning tree or a city under siegeThe sweet taste of honey in ones mouth disappears quickly the vine inside a well does not remain for longUnder a pine tree on a hill echoes the wailing of a broken man in a broad street inside many gates voices moaning with sadness are heardIf all the beings of the human realm now repentthe creatures of round head and square feet which includes superior examples endowed with wisdom and inferior ones that are ignorant and who live everywherein the western direction as far as Aparagodānīya in the eastern direction as far as Pūrvavideha in the north as far as Uttarakuru and in the south as far as this Jambudvīpa world some furthermore living in houses under roofs made of wooden boards and with curtains of woven wool others with their bodies tattooed and with disheveled hair drinking blood and eating fur or nesting in caves and holes polishing their hooves and blackening their teeth or sleeping on their stomachs and crawling around floating on Roshui like a hair or climbing steep mountains with ropes living in a remote city among barbarians protected by armor and bearing a spear or chained in prison some carrying money on their shoulders or wielding wooden sticks in their hands if all these beings were to make the vow to cultivate rites and polite conduct human beings would acquire the virtues of filial piety on the part of those below and lovingkindness on the part of those above wanton thoughts would cease and licentious desires would come to an endThe substance of these beings would become as solid as rock and metal they would soar above other beings just like the sacred mountains Song and HuaThe eight kinds of suffering would not invade their lives and the nine calamities would have long been removed from themAccording to an explanation in the Posha lun Human beings are called by that name because the word means to stop and cease Because beings can stop and cease in that realm which is one of the six realms of existence it is called the realm of human beingsWhat is meant by this is that only in this realm among the six realms beings can stop and cease giving rise to passions and evil disturbancesIn no other realm than that of human beings can beings do this better That is why the nature of this realm matches the meaning of stopping and ceasing In addition the pronunciation for the word human is the same as that of the word to bear and this points to the fundamental similarity between the meaning of these wordsBecause these beings can peacefully bear a life that is sometimes at odds with the ways of the world they are called by this nameThe Lishi apitan lun saysWhy is man called manusha There are eight reasonsHe is intelligent his conduct is superior his mind is refined he has the potential for supreme enlightenment his wisdom is superior he is capable of distinguishing the real from the unreal he is the correct vessel in which the holy Way may be placed and he is produced from the karmic effects of intelligent wisdomFor these reasons man is called manuṣyaThe new Posha lun saysQuestion Why is this realm of rebirth called manuṣyaAnswer In the past there was a universal monarch called MāndhātaHe told the people Whatever you want to do you must first think about it take its measure and observe At that time people did just as the king taught them and whatever they wanted to do they first thought about it took its measure and observedIn a variety of work requiring skills they then turned out to be skillfulThat was because they were able to use their minds and think and observe whatever they were doingFor this reason human beings are called manuṣyaAccording to another view because they perform to an increasing degree the lower category of subtle deeds of body speech and mind beings are born in that realm and are made to continue their existence thereFor this reason that realm is called that of human beingsAccording to yet another view because they are arrogant these beings are called humanIt is because none of the beings in the five realms are as arrogant as human beingsAccording to still another view because they are capable of quieting the mind they are called human beingsIt is because none of the beings in the five realms are as capable of quieting the mind as are human beingsFor this reason it is said in scripture that human beings are superior to gods in three things they are courageous they have a good memory and they can commit themselves to a life of purityThe new Posha lun says In the four realms under heaven human beings live in the four great continentsThey are Jambu videha godānīya and kuruHuman beings also live in the eight subcontinentsWhat are the eight subcontinentsThe continent of kuru has two subordinate continents Kurava and KauravāThe continent of videha has two subordinate continentsDeha and Suhe The continent of godānīya has two subcontinentsāṭha and UttaramantriṇasThe continent of Jambu has two subordinate continents Cāmara and Faluozhemoluo In these eight subcontinents people are short in height just like dwarves in our worldAccording to one view people live only in seven of the subcontinentsOnly demons live in the subcontinent of CāmaraAccording to another view the eight that are mentioned here are nothing more than alternate names for the four main continentsThis confusion arose because for each of the four continents two alternate names were givenIf we are to follow this interpretation as mentioned above each of these eight subcontinents has five hundred smaller subordinate continents Human beings live in some of these smaller continents nonhumans in other and still others are emptyQuestionWhat is the outward appearance of the beings in the human realm likeAnswerThey stand uprightHuman beings in Jambu have faces that look like a wheeled carriage human beings in videha have faces that look like a halfmoon human beings in godānīya have faces that look like a full moon human beings in kuru have faces that look like a square pondQuestionWhat are their languages likeAnswerWhen the world first came into being everyone spoke the holy language Later when beings began taking food and drink inequalities developed and flattery and deception increasedConsequently different languages developed and those who are unable to speak at all also appearedThe Yebao chabie jing presents four phrases to distinguish the different types of karmic causationKarmic causation that results in physical pleasure but mental suffering refers to ordinary beings in fortunate external circumstances karmic causation that results in mental pleasures but physical suffering refers to arhats in unfortunate external circumstances karmic causation that results in both physical and mental pleasure refers to arhats in fortunate external circumstances and karmic causation that results in both physical and mental suffering refers to ordinary beings in unfortunate external circumstancesIn all these cases everyone receives pleasure and suffering through karmic causationThe Pusazang jing saysAt that time the Worldhonored One told the elder Xianshou The elder should know the followingAs I observed all the sentient beings in the world they were oppressed by ten situations of sufferingWhat are the tenThey were oppressed by the suffering of birthThey were oppressed by the suffering of old ageThey were oppressed by the suffering of illnessThey were oppressed by the suffering of deathThey were oppressed by the suffering of sadnessThey were oppressed by the suffering of resentmentThey were oppressed by the very fact of experiencing sufferingThey were oppressed by melancholyThey were oppressed by the suffering of unbearable painsThey were subjected to the oppression of the great of pain of repeated birth and death I saw these ten kinds of suffering oppressing sentient beingsIn order to attain supreme enlightenment and be released from these oppressions with pure faith I abandoned the household of the ākya clan and pursued the supreme WayFurthermore Elder  I observed that all sentient beings in the world for innumerable world ages commit millions and trillions of faults and are constantly struck by ten kinds of large poisoned arrowsWhat were the tenThey are the poisoned arrow of love the poisoned arrow of ignorance the poisoned arrow of desire poisoned arrow of stupidity the poisoned arrow of arrogance the poisoned arrow of biased views the poisoned arrow of the mistaken view of being and the poisoned arrow of the mistaken view of nonbeingI saw sentient beings struck by these ten kinds of poisoned arrows and sought supreme enlightenment in order to put a stop to these poisoned arrowsFor this reason with pure faith I abandoned the household of the ākya clan and pursued the supreme WayIf we are to speak in terms of the four directions in the north in Uttarakuru there is no differentiation of noble and humble beingsThe distinction between master and servant is absent there and that is why there is no differentiation of noble and humble beingsIn the other three directions differentiation of noble and humble beings is always presentRulers ministers and common people are separated and in great households the masters and servants are distinguishedTherefore noble and humble beings form different categoriesAltogether these types can be classified into six groupsthe most noble group among the nobles referring to such beings as universal monarchs the middle group among the nobles referring to kings of small kingdoms the lowest group among the nobles referring to many officials the humblest group among the humble referring to developmentally challenged children the middle group among the humble referring to servants and slaves and the least extreme group among the humble referring to princesses and maidservantsThis is a rough and general classificationTo attempt a more detailed exhaustive classification would be difficultIf we are to speak in terms of the four directions the people in the north in Uttarakuru are the wealthiest and have the greatest equality  In the continents in the east and west some are wealthy and others are poorIn the south in Jambudvīpa people are the most impoverishedThe situations in the continents in the four directions all differ and are described in detail in the scripturesAgain in Jambudvīpa the economic fortunes of people are not fixedThere are three categoriesThe highest category includes such beings as the universal monarch who governs everywhere in the four directions and rules over the four oceansEverything he needs is supplied without fail The situation of the universal monarch is described in the scripturesThe universal monarchs powers provided for him through the merits of his deeds in previous lives are the greatestWhen he renounces the householders life five miraculous phenomena appear and seven jewels arrive through cosmic responseThe five miraculous phenomena are through cosmic response flowing springs and bathing ponds with calm and clear water appear everywhere in the world through cosmic response heavenly sweet dew appears in the palace courtyard and when the monarch drinks the dew his body becomes light and his illnesses are cured through cosmic response the level of the great sea goes down by the length of one yojana and roads of golden sand appear everywhere on which the monarch travels around in the realm under the four heavens through cosmic response oxhead incense appears on the shores of the ocean if the king picks it up and burns it the aroma is even stronger and if he blows on it into the direction of the wind the fragrance reaches far to places forty miles away if dead people smell this fragrance they come back to life the kācilindika bird is born in the ocean if the monarch holds and touches its body he experiences a great sensation of comfort in body and mind superior to any of the pleasures of the six sensesThe following verse in the Wangsheng lun refers to this birdThe seven jewels that decorate the Pure Land are like grasses They are soft and flexible and turn right and left If anyone touches these he feels extreme pleasure Greater than that given by the kācilindika bird has one thousand sons endowed with seven jewels courageous and fierceThe second category of median wealth refers to people like the rulers of small kingdomsThe third category of wealth the lowest refers to JotikaThere are also three categories of poverty and if you think about it you will be able to determine them for yourself In the realm of human beings there is no real pleasure and everything leads to sufferingIgnorant people think that there is pleasure but informed people know that everything is sufferingDeluded views hold that there is pleasure but the view that corresponds to reality holds that everything is sufferingTherefore the Fu fazang jing saysThose who are suffering in different ways in the world all wish to obtain pleasureBut this body is not solid it rots and is easily destroyedLike bubbles our bodies change and disappear after a moments timeEven a handsome appearance to which people are very attached goes away and cannot be found anywhere anymore when the decline of old age sets inOutside our bodies are covered with skin which is decorative pus and blood which are impure flow withinConditioned phenomena are impermanent and in one moment of our life extremely quickly they come into being and go out again four hundred timesThese phenomena may be compared to phenomena in the open sky where clouds gather with thunder and lightning and strong winds blow yet soon the clouds scatter the wind ceases and everything is back to normal againThe five kinds of desires are unstable just like the phenomena in the open skyPeople may seek peaceful happiness together yet given the effects of impermanence who will be left remaining in this stateThe world is filled with many forms of suffering and it is difficult to remain in the world for longFor this reason we know that the human body consists only of suffering and impermanence Reason dictates that we should abhor life and quickly seek liberationAll conditioned phenomena are nothing but heaps of sufferingthey are like a tumor or a latrine or an arrow that has pierced a human heartThe wheel of life old age sickness and death turns endlesslyImpermanence is the law of dissolution and rapid decayLike a prisoner facing death whose life cannot be said to be longlasting or a prisoner who has nothing he loves or for which he seeks or a piece of fruit on the road that people find bitter and throw away this body is to be reviled It is bound to be reduced to nothingAfter death crows magpies foxes and wolves rush to eat it blowing winds and exposure to the sun turn the body into a rotten and smelly lump the hair and teeth are scattered around in disorderly fashionWhy should we be attached to a body like thisWe should work diligently on the means of salvation and quickly seek liberationEven the wealthy and noble gods are in the end bound to be reduced to nothing even if they possess an attractive outward appearance inwardly they are in a state of constant despair and sadnessFor this reason as it is said in the Dazhuangyan lun It is like wearing a golden chain the chain is good but it can be used to bind and tie up a personThe throne of a king is like this the king is constantly despondent and fearfulis thinking about protecting  If he loses it he is visited by great sorrowIt is as if we speak of pleasure precisely because food and clothing have been denied to usThoughts of pleasure go out of control in the midst of acute suffering For this reason Piṇḍola spoke in verse to King Udayana  Even though the throne of a king is honored and awesome Changes in the throne cannot be stopped even for a short while Quickly like electric lightning In a moment it is reduced to decline and disappearance The throne of a king is endowed with tremendous wealth Ignorant ones truly yearn for it But decline and disappearance come in no time and The suffering of the mighty is greater than that of lowly and humble ones The king occupies a high throne His reputation fills the world in all ten directions Being handsome and attractive He ornaments his body in a variety of ways He is like someone who is about to die Wearing a flowered headdress and necklaces It will not be long before he gives up his life The throne of a king is like this The Buddha said that the example of someone about to die is just like a kingThey are both always afraid While walking standing and sitting down all the time Whether they are among familiar people or among strangers they are always filled with suspicion and fear Ministers commoners and queens and court ladies in the palace Elephants horses and rare jewels The land that belongs to the kingdom and everything else Are all the kings possessions Yet when a king is about to give up his life All abandon him and not one of any of these things will accompany himAgain in the Niepan jing the Buddha says in verseIn all the worlds Those who have been born are returned to death Even if their life span is incalculably long They are bound in the end to die Those who prosper are bound to decline Things that come together will be separated The vigorous years cannot last for long A healthy condition will be invaded by illness Life is swallowed by death There are no entities that exist permanently Kings may be free to do anything they want And their power may be unmatched Yet everything changes and disappears Our life span is also like this The wheel of suffering ceaselessly turns Beings flow and turn on it without end All three realms of rebirth are impermanent There is no happiness in anything that exists Even though the Way toward salvation must be based on reality Everything that exists is empty and ultimately nonexistent Entities that dissolve keep changing In every instance these entities eventually decline and become troubled Fear is worse than any of the other evils Old age illness and death bring distressing decline In this realm where nothing exists permanently Destruction and hatred easily enter Everything is obscured by the passions In the same way as the silkworm is within its silken cocoon How could wise ones find happiness in this place This body is constituted by suffering Everything is impure Tied to catastrophes by ropes our body is just like a tumor There is nothing good at its very basis Even superior bodies like those of the gods are also like this All the objects of our desires are impermanent Therefore I do not become attached to them or hunger for them Leaving desire behind I direct my thought skillfully And achieve realization of the truth Therefore Honorable Piṇḍola said to the king Great king please observe the matter wellWhat objects of the five desires are permanentIs there a kings throne that remains stable for a long timeWhich kingdoms maintain their borders without having the size of their territory reducedWhat rare jewels are free from eventual loss and dispersionWhich pleasures based on desire are permanent and unchangingWhich entities come together and do not scatter apart againAll the objects of the five desires are in their essence nothing but sufferingThey all arise from deluded thought and take shape as pleasures For this reason even a kings throne is suffering and there is no peace in itThe situation is similar to that of the man who saw things in a dream and when he woke up realized that the things of which he dreamed were not realFor this reason wise people should feel revulsion toward existence and take leave of it and then immediately realize that everything both within and outside of ourselves changesall is impermanentEven though coarse and fine entities appear to be different in one moment the difference disappears and the two become the same For this reason it is said in the Nirvana Sutra Tb Tof time appearsThe ten periods are the stages of membrane foam froth lump of flesh limbs infant childhood youth adult and declining old ageIf any of these stages was not impermanent the progression from the membrane stage to the stage of old age and death would not take placeThe ferocious fire of the three poisons burns the mind ceaselesslyTherefore we are pained by this suffering According to the scriptures there are many kinds of human beingsDetails have been given above in the part on the four realms under heaven in the section on the three realms of existence Miracle Stories The Chunqiu wei Yangong tu chapter saysConfucius was ten chi tall and nine wei

People of the kingdom of Jiaoyao are three feet tallThey are the shortest people Even the tallest human beings are not taller than ten feetTen is the highest of numbersNow we hear about human beings

They smelted metal and produced twelve images of themThey established fortresses in the Five Peaks in the south and constructed the Great Wall in the northThe wall went through Lintao in the west and reached Liao dong spanning a distance of several thousand milesThis is why the giants first appeared at Lintao they indicated the place where troubles would first occurTwelve years later the rule of

asura demonsThose born in this realm in their pathological thought always suspect that they are not being treated the same as others some organize rebellions and engage in battles they also lead troops to do battle with and conquer each otherThey are tall and large in appearance but always look tired and hungryTheir bodies are rough and coarse and they are always angryStanding tall they are fearsome accompanied by others who are equally tall they take people by surpriseAll have three heads and eight arms that protrude from their bodies in layersStriding over mountains and walking upon the ocean they grasp the sun and hold the clouds up highIn heaven they seek banquets and they ferment wine in the oceanSuch beings all take refuge in the Three JewelsParticularly the asura kings ambara and others the attendants of Vemacitra the peers of Khara skandha and furthermore the retinues of Bali and his brother Rāhu or the likeminded ācī and Batuo they all vow to get rid of their arrogance and practice to remove their tendency toward flatteryTheir palace halls are illuminated with rich and luxurious carpets of orchid flowers everywhereWhen a ceasefire is declared and warfare ceases their anger disappears and greed does not ariseThe suffering from doubleedged swords is no more the pain continuous like a lotus root thread is forever eliminatedHappily listening to the right Dharma and thirstily looking up to the Great Vehicle they give up their tired and ugly bodies and accept a handsome form they protect the states borders as well as the state and the ruling houseBuilding the city of Dharma they contribute to the cause of wisdoms sun Why are these creatures called demons According to the Lishi apitan lun Demons are unable to tolerate good deeds nor can they repent of their infractionsEven when they listen to various teachings their minds are unmovedBecause they are arrogant they are not good young men but because they are not gods either they are called demonsThe name axiulo is given in other scriptures as axulunNow according to the new Posha lun In the Sanskrit text the correct sound is given as suluoSuluo means gods Because these creatures are not gods however they are called asuluo Furthermore suluo also means handsome Because these creatures are not handsome they are called asuluoThe Chang ahan jing saysdemons give birth to handsome girls and ugly boysFor this reason they are called not handsome Sometimes they are called not drinking There are two interpretations of the significance of this nameAccording to the first these creatures upheld the precept of not drinking in their past lives and because of the karmic effect of this conduct they are called not drinking According to the second interpretation they originally were very fond of wineIn the realm under the four heavens they gathered flowers and scattered them over the ocean in order to ferment the seawater into wine This did not work however and the water of the ocean turned into saltwaterBecause they could not obtain wine they were forced to abandon wine completelyTherefore they are called deities that do not drink wineThe Posha lun saysSome say that demons belong to the realm of the gods but because their minds are crooked they are not firmly established as godsSome say they belong to the realm of hungry ghosts As illustrated by the fact that the god akras consort ācī was an asura demon however they are able to mate with godsTherefore the Gāthāsūtra says that some of the demons are ghosts some animals and some godsThe Zhengfanian jing says Some are ghosts and some animals Some say that are inferior godsThe designation inferior god applies to VemacitraThe name Vemacitra means loud sounds it also means cavedweller When a loud sound is heard at the bottom of the great ocean he shouts I am Vemacitra For this reason he is called loud sounds He lives in a cave in the oceanTherefore he is called cavedweller The Zhengfanian jing saysdemons live in five locationsThe first location is on the earth in the middle of a mountain rangeThe demons who live there are the weakestThe second location is to the north of Mount SumeruIf you go into the ocean for a distance of twentyone thousand yojanas there is a place where a demon livesHis name is Rāhu and this monster rules over a host of an infinite number of demonsIf you go another three times the distance of twentyone thousand yojanas you reach a place where another demon livesHis name is YongjianIf you go another four times the distance of twentyone thousand yojanas there is a place where another demon livesHis name is Huaman If you go further twice the distance of twentyone thousand yojanas you come to a place where yet another demon livesHis name is VemacitraThe voice of this demon goes through the ocean and is heard outside of the oceanHe says I am the demon Vemacitra For this reason this demon is called Loud SoundsAs for the mother of Vemacitra the Chang ahan jing ref Guanfo sanmei hai jing Tca saysAt the very beginning of the world age the god Guangyin  went into the ocean to wash his bodyA water spirit entered his body and planted one eggAfter eight thousand years a girl was bornHer body was shaped like Mount SumeruShe had nine hundred and ninetynine heads and each head had one thousand eyesThere were nine hundred and ninetynine separate mouths and each mouth had four tusksAt the end of each tusk was a flame that looked like thunder and lightningThere were twentyfour legs and nine hundred and ninetynine handsAt one time this girl was bathing and playing in the ocean A water spirit entered her body and planted an eggAgain after eight thousand years Veracitra was bornHe had nine heads and each head had one thousand eyesWater was constantly coming out of his mouthHe had nine hundred and ninetynine hands and only six legsA female gandharva gave birth to ācīrāhu who was chosen by the god Indra as his consortThe asura demon Rāhu is also called Zhangriyue  he stands at the front of Indras army and directs the light of the sun toward the asura demons blinding them so that they do not see the army of gods approachingTherefore the asura demons hold their hands up to block the rays of the sunThey are powerful and fight with the gods frequentlyThe new Posha lun saysQuestionTo where do the asuras retireAccording to one view inside Mount Sumeru is a vacant spaceThe mountain thus resembles a treasure bowl that has been placed upside downInside this empty space is a city and that where the asuras liveQuestionAccording to a scripture an asura said The ocean in which we live has the same uniform salty taste If the village where they live is located within the salty ocean how could the asura king live inside a mountainAccording to one view on top of the golden wheel inside the salty ocean is a large golden platform five hundred yojanas in both height and widthThere is a city on top of the platform and that is where the asura king livesThe asura king also has four gardens the first is called Auspicious Happiness the second Delight and Joy the third Utmost Joy and the fourth AttractiveJust as in the Heaven of the ThirtyThree Gods there is the pārijātaka tree so too in the asura kings residence there is also a tree QuestionWhat do the asura demons look likeAnswer They stand uprightQuestion What is their languageAnswer They all speak the holy language  Question To which of the six realms of rebirth do they belongAnswerAccording to one view they belong to the realm of the gods according to another they belong to the realm of the hungry ghostsThe Qishi jing saysOne thousand yojanas beyond Mount Sumeru to the east and under the ocean is the land of the asura king Vemacitra The living space is eighty thousand yojanas in width and depthIt is surrounded by seven balustrades and seven layers of gold and silver nets with bellsOutside there are seven lines of tāla treesAll these are made of seven jewelsThey are decorated elaborately in a manner that cannot be described completelyInside the big city is a palace standing by itself called ShemopotiThe palace is ten thousand yojanas in width and depth and is surrounded by seven walls all of which are made of seven jewelsThe walls are one hundred yojanas tall and fifty yojanas wideInside the garden are ponds flowers and fruit and birds singing harmoniously More complete descriptions are found in the original passage in the scripture details have been abbreviated hereOne thousand yojanas beyond Mount Sumeru to the south and under the ocean is the palace of the asura king YongyueHis palace is eighty thousand yojanas in width and depthOne thousand yojanas beyond Mount Sumeru to the west and under the ocean is the palace of the asura king ambara His palace is eighty thousand yojanas in width and depthOne thousand yojanas beyond Mount Sumeru to the north and under the ocean is the palace of the asura king RāhuHis palace is eighty thousand yojanas in width and depth The city of Mopodi is where the king livedThe asura king Rāhu held meetings at a palace which was also called Seven HeadsThis palace was eighty thousand yojanas in width and depth and was surrounded by seven walls and seven layers of balustradesThese were made of seven jewelsOn all four sides to the left and close by innumerable numbers of minor asura demons are gathered Details cannot be given exhaustively here They are explained in the sutra The Yebao chabie jing saysThe ten deeds that lead to rebirth as an asura demon areminor evil conduct of the body minor evil conduct of speech minor evil conduct of thought giving rise to the arrogance that despises others giving rise to the arrogance that assumes that ones own body and mind are permanent giving rise to the arrogance of falsely claiming that one has attained enlightenment giving rise to great arrogance giving rise to the arrogance of falsely claiming to have virtue giving rise to the arrogance of claiming to be superior to those who actually are superior to oneself and directing the karmic effects of all good deeds to rebirth in the realm of the asura demonsThe Zhengfanian jing refTca ba c causes for rebirth as an asura demonThis work appears to summarize the teachings of other scripturesFor the most part we attain rebirth in the asura realm through three kinds of causes anger arrogance and doubtThe Za ahan jing saysIn a previous life an asura demon was once a poor man who lived near a riverbankHe regularly crossed the river to collect firewoodAt one time the river water became very deep and the current very fast and strongSeveral times the man was carried away by the water and almost lost his lifeAt that time a pratyekabuddha visited the house and begged for food The people of the house were delighted and gave food to himAfter eating the food the pratyekabuddha flew into the sky and went awayWhen the poor man saw this he was led to make a vowIn my later rebirth I vow to obtain a body so large that the deepest waters will not come above my knees Because of this development the asura obtained an extraordinarily large bodyThe waters of the four oceans do not reach above his kneesIf he stands up in the ocean his body rises higher than the summit of Mount SumeruHe can let his hand rest on top of that mountain and look down on the Heaven of the Thirtythree GodsThe Zhengfanian jing saysThe first king of the asura demons Rāhu has four jade women who had been born from memories Shadowlike Fragrances Beautiful Forest and Superior VirtueEach of these ladies was attended by twelve million maidensThey all attend the king of the asura demons and entertain themselves togetherThey indulge in sense pleasures freely in ways that cannot be described in detailThe second king is called Yongjian more powerful than the first kingThe third king is called Huaman  and is even more powerful than the secondThe fourth king is called VemacitraHis power and the number of his attendants are many times greater than that of the third beyond calculationAs for the other ministers court ladies and various servants their numbers too are incalculableFor this reason we know that the gap between noble and humble asura kings is very wide and they cannot be discussed in a uniform manner The Zhengfanian jing saysThe food and clothing of the asura demons appear spontaneously by themselvesThe garlands of their crowns and their clothing are all made of seven jewels and are just as fresh and clean as those of the godsThe food they eat appears just when they think of them and all are as variously delicious as the gods foods The Dazhidu lun saysThe food and clothing are superior to those of human beingsWhen the food is actually eaten however it is no longer as good as human beings foodIn other words when the asura demons eat their food the last mouthful turns into bluegreen mud like the food of a dragon kingThis food is varied and delicious with a hundred flavors but when the king actually eats the food the last mouthful turns into a toadFor this reason the scripture says that an asura kings food is not as good as that of human beingsThe Zengyi ahan jing saysAt that time the Buddha said to the monks No being has been given a larger body than the king of the asura demonsIts height and width are eightyfour thousand yojanasIts mouth is one thousand yojanas in width and heightWhen was about to touch the sun his body doubled in size to one hundred and sixty thousand yojanasWhen he appeared before the sun and moon the kings of the sun and moon both became afraid and were no longer at peace in their placesThis was because the body of the asura king was so fearful The kings of the sun and moon were frightened and their light disappearedHowever the asura demon did not dare go forward to seize the sun and moonThis was because the sun and moon are endowed with great supernatural powersTheir life spans are extremely long and in appearance they are most handsomeThey enjoy pleasures endlessly is the period of one world age Furthermore the beings in this world came to rescue Consequently the sun and moon were beyond the reach of the asura demonThe asura demon then became distressed and disappeared into its own place The Chang ahan jing saysThe asura demon is very powerful and says to himself These gods of the Heaven of ThirtyThree Gods and the gods of the sun and moon move above my headI vow to seize them and turn them into earrings He became more and more angry and wanted to strike themSo he ordered the two asura kings ambara and Vemacitra and their ministers to make preparations to engage in battle with the godsAt this time the two dragons Nanda and Upananda encircled Mount Sumeru seven times with their long bodiesThe mountain moved and was covered by cloudsWhen they hit the surface of the great ocean with their tails the waves covered Mount SumeruThe gods of the Heaven of ThirtyThree Gods said The asuras are about to begin a battle Many dragons and supernatural beings holding weapons went into battle one after the otherThe outcome of the battle went against them and they all fledIn front of the palace of the god of the four heavens they armed their vehicles to engage in combatThe god of the four heavens first reported the situation to the god Indra  who in turn reported to higher deities up to the deity of the highest heaven of the realm of desireNumerous gods as well as dragons and other supernatural beings surrounded themIndra gave the command saying If our army turns out to be victorious bind the asura Vemacitra with five bonds and bring him to the Hall of Good DharmaI would like to have a look at him The asura demon also said If our army turns out to be victorious bind Indra with five bonds and bring him to the Hall of Seven LeavesI would like to have a look at him The great battle began immediately but neither was injuredOnly their bodies touched each other which caused them both great painThen Indra manifested a body that had one thousand eyes holding a vajra that emitted smoke and fireWhen the asura demon saw this he retreated in defeatThe gods then captured Vemacitra and brought him back to Indra Seeing him from a distance Vemacitra abused IndraIndra responded I would like to discuss morality with youDo not abuse meThe life span in heaven is one thousand years a few live longer and most do not live that longWith your evil intentions you fight well in battleFurthermore you have violated the preceptsYet even though you are unreliable in speech because you have given generously for spiritual purposes you have been reborn in this form According to another scripture the asura had been reborn in that form because even though he had not been straightforward in thought he had indeed cultivated meritorious deeds The Guanfo sanmei jing saysAs for the king of asuras Vemacitra whose mother eats ghosts eats only by chewing mud and lotus rootsWhen this demon grew up he saw that the gods were attended by maidservantsHe said to his mother Everyone has a consortWhy am I the only one who is alone His mother replied In Fragrant Hill lives a supernatural being called a gandharvaThat supernatural being has a beautiful daughter is as white as white jadeBeautiful music can be heard coming from all the pores on her bodyIt would please me greatly for you to have her as your wifeDo you want her The asura demon said Good goodI would like you to go there and ask for her The mother then went to Fragrant Hill and said to the god of music  I have a son who is so powerful that he is free to do anything There is no other being in the realm under the four heavens as powerful as heYou have a good daughter You should let my son marry her When the daughter heard about this proposal she wished to happily return with the mother and marry her sonNot long after the asura demon married the girl she became pregnant and after eight thousand years she gave birth to a baby girlThe child was exceptionally beautiful there was no one comparable to her either in heaven or in the realm under heavenShe had eight thousand four hundred attractive facial expressions and she could strike eight thousand four hundred attractive poses both to the right and to the left and likewise on the front and back sides When the asura demon saw her he thought that she was extraordinaryIt was as if the moon had taken the place of the starsShe was indeed quite remarkableKauśika  heard about her and requested her as his wifeThe asura demon was delighted and gave her to him to be his wifeKauśika became the god Indra and called his wife YueyiAll the gods who saw her marveled at her beauty exclaiming that such beauty had never before existedWhen they looked at her to the east they forgot all about the western direction when they saw her to the south they forgot about everything in the northern directionEvery one of her features including the hair on her head gave pleasureIndra was very fond of his garden and bathed in the pond there with a number of maidservantsYueyi became jealous and sent five yakṣa demons to her father saying Now Indra does not bestow love on me he only plays with maidservants When her father heard these words he became very angryMobilizing the four kinds of troops  he attacked Indra  There in the midst of the great ocean sitting atop Mount Sumeru with his ninetynine hands he attacked the city in the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods and caused Mount Sumeru to moveThe waters of the four great oceans made huge wavesIndra was taken by surprise and did not know where to goAt that time a supernatural being told the god Do not be greatly frightenedIn the past the Buddha preached the Perfection of Wisdom SutraThe king recited the scripture over and over again and the army of ghosts was crushed by itselfThen Indra sat in the Hall of Good Dharma burned many famous types of incense and made a great vowThe Perfection of Wisdom Sutra is a great spellIt is the supreme spellIt is an incomparably wonderful spellIt is truly effectiveI uphold this teaching and will realize the Buddhas Way in order to make the asura demons flee without any effort on my part When he said these words a wheel of swords appeared in the skyThis was due to Indras meritSpontaneously the wheel began to come down right on top of the asura demon severing its ears nose arms and legs which then fell into the water of the great ocean They looked red like a pearl in a clamThe asura demon was amazed and frightenedNot knowing where to flee he scrambled about and crawled into a lotus filamentMiracle Stories The Xiguo zhuan saysIn a rocky valley to the south west of the kingdom of Campa in Central India there is a cave of asura demonsA man was traveling around the mountains engaged in religious practice and came across this cave by accidentHe then went inside the cave and saw the palace of the asura demonsIt was marvelously beautiful almost like the palace of the gods in heavenThe pond in the garden and the forest of fruit trees cannot be described fully in detailWhen the asura demons saw the unexpected arrival of the man  they said Can you stay here for long The man answered I wish to return home When the asura demons saw that he did not wish to stay they gave him a peach and when the man had finished eating it the asura demons said You should get out quicklyI am afraid your body is growing larger and the cave will not be big enough to contain it As soon as the demons finished saying this the man ran to escapeHe grew taller and his body became rough and largeHe managed to get his head out of the cave but his body had become so large that became stuck in the cave and in the end he could not get outSeveral hundred years have passed since thenOnly the mans head can be seen from the outside and it resembles three large jarsWhen people see it they tell this story to each otherTaking pity on him one man offered We can carve the rock to let you get outHow about that The head answered I would be grateful The man then reported this in detail to the ruler of the kingdomThe ruler consulted his ministers who said This extraordinary man must be so strong that he alone could fight against a thousand soldiersIf we were to carve away the rock and let him get out but then something unexpected happens no one could control him So they left the large man stuck in the rock cave as beforePeople at that time called him the Largeheaded SageAn emissary from the Chinese kingdom of Tang Wang Xuance went to that place three times and spoke to the man patting the large head He could clearly understand what the head saidRecently there was a forest fire on the mountain and the head was burned black Yet the man with the large burned head is still aliveThe Record of the Western Regions was compiled in sixty fascicles as a national project and submitted to the throneBy imperial edict learned scholars were ordered to produce paintings and drawings to accompany the sixtyfascicle record and these were collected at the governments central officeThis constituted altogether forty fasciclesThe project began at the beginning of the third year of the Linde period and ended in the summer of the first year of Qianfeng period I have met Xuance who told me the details of this storyThe Biography of Dharma Master Xuanzang saysThe kingdom of Dhanakataka belongs to South IndiaBoth on the eastern and western sides of the capital city are mountains and there are large temples in these mountainsIn one of these temples was a master of doctrinal treatises Bhāviveka Before Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva he made a vow to stop eating grain and to drink only water for three yearsHe was determined and prayed to see Maitreya BodhisattvaThen Avalokiteśvara manifested his material body and ordered Qingbian to go to the deity Vajrapāṇi who was staying in a large cave in the mountain to the south of the city and to recite the vajra spell After three years the deity gave him this instruction Inside the cave is the palace of the asura demons If you follow the correct way and make a proper request a rock door will openGo through the door and bring out Maitreya who will be waiting thereI will make sure that you will succeed in this act After another three years had passed Qingbian uttered the spell and threw a pepper seed at the rock wall  and suddenly the wall opened wideHundreds of thousands of people were present there and all were amazed to see thisThe master stepped through the gate and looking back again and again he told the people to follow him but only six people followed himOthers were afraid and did not enter saying that poisonous snakes lived in the caveAfter the master had gone inside the rock doors closed up and formed an intact wall againDharma Master Xuanzang also told the following storyIn the thirteenth year of Zhenguan was at Nālanda Monastery in the kingdom of Magadha in Central India met a layman who told me There was a man who loved womenEvery time he heard scripture recited he noted that the male offspring of the asura demons are extremely ugly but the female offspring are attractiveHe had heard that there was an asura cave in a nearby mountain and that there was a extremely beautiful palace there as refined as the palace of the gods in heavenThat man thought that he would like to meet an asuras daughter and marry herHe practiced spells diligently for three years and when the threeyear period was about to end his wish was grantedThis man had long been a close friend of mineWhen he was about to go to the cave he invited me to accompany him on his trip to the palace of asura demonsAt that time I went with him and since the spell had become effective we arrived at the gate of the palaceThe guard at the gate looked very seriousMy friend asked the guard sincerely and passionately to let him pass through the gate to see the lady of the palaceThe guard reported the reason of our visit in detail to those insideThe lady of the asura demon was delighted and asked the guard How many people have come The guard replied There are two people The lady said to the guard The one who uttered the spell may come inThe one who accompanied him will stay outside the gate He returned and said The one who recited the spell may come in I had no sensation of how this happened but as I watched my friend being led inside my body was suddenly back at my own house and I was standing to the south of the buildingFrom then on I have never heard any news about my friendBecause of this I made the commitment to renounce the householders life and cultivate the religious pathI vowed to make offerings to the Three Jewels in this temple building This man told this story in detail to Dharma Master XuanzangThe Six Realms of Rebirth Introduction Explanation of the Name Dwelling Places Categories Karmic Causes  Body Size Life Span Beautiful and Ugly Appearance Pain and Pleasure Noble and Ignoble Ghosts and ResidencesIntroduction To come to the methods used by ghosts and spirits such creatures take particular delight in strange and evil thingsThey frequently commit crimes in mysterious and secret placesSome dwell among darkly shaded rocks some find shelter in high hills or in unreachable mountain streams or in dense bushOthers stay in deserted fields in uninhabited places outside of citiesThey are of extraordinary appearance and make strange sounds that disturb ordinary beings and frighten ignorant creaturesThey falsely adopt awesome manifestations and cunningly strange appearancesSome ghosts are in the shape of a bird but have the nature of fish or they may have a human face but the heart of a beastSome make music with drums and sing along with stringed instruments beating drumsticks and chiming bellsAll these creatures alike repent their sinsThey dwell in shrines in the nine continents and serve as the spirits of ten thousand statesAmong them are the Great Count of Gusu Ji Zi of Yanling Yuchuan Wenming the bearded kings of caves and marshes water gods mountain spirits masters of wind and rulers of rain Feng long Lieque the fire god Huilu and LinghouSome ride on a bamboo pole as if it were a dragon flying like wild birds instead of geeseThey reside in tall shrines attached to multistoried buildingsComing and going in the falling rain they travel up and down the dividing windsThere are also such ghosts such as the yellowheaded general and those with needle hair Xiuli  Lena  pantu  and other rākṣasas with their three thousand attendants and five hundred followersAll repent Furthermore there are those who have extremely grave hindrances called hungry ghosts The light in their eyes is like flashing lightningTheir throats are as small as the eye of a needleThey cannot even hear words like water or juice and they never taste foods made with riceThe joints of their limbs are all aflame at the same timeAs they turn around their bones creak as loudly as the sound of five hundred carriagesToday the merit of good acts are available to bring benefit to all sentient beingsA vow should be made to ensure that the hungry and thirsty ghosts may be able to eat and drink freely and that the other seductive and alluring ghosts and spirits stop groveling before people to get what they needLet them glorify the teaching of the Buddha protect the world and guard the images and scripturesWe make offerings for a long time and record the consequences of good and evil deeds in order to enable people to practice spiritual cultivation foreverWhat does the name realm of ghosts mean According to the Lishi lun The realm of ghosts is called preta because King Yama is called a pretaThose who are born in this realm are called by the name of its kingTherefore are also called pretasIt is also said that this realm is connected with other realms as beings come and go through it superior and inferior realms are connected by this and therefore it is called preta the realm of coming and going Again the new Posha lun saysQuestionWhy is that realm called pretaAnswerThe Shishe lun says Just as the ruler of the world of ghosts at the present time is called Yama so the ruler of the world of ghosts at the beginning of the world age was called pretaFor this reason sentient beings that went and were born there were called pretasThus everything in the world of the pretas has been called by this name since then According to one view if a person has committed and indulged in excessively greedy evil deeds of body speech and mind he is born thereFor this reason he experiences both hunger and thirst For more than one hundred thousand years he does not even hear the word water so how could he see or touch itImpossible Some of these beings have a belly as big as a mountain but a throat as narrow as a pinholeEven when they find food and drink they cannot take them inAccording to one view they are called ghosts  because they are driven and forced into laborThey are constantly made to work everywhere by the gods and are always running aroundAccording to another view because they have many desires they are called ghostsAmong the five realms of existence none is inhabited by beings whose desires exceed those of the inhabitants of this realm always wanting many favors from other sentient beingsFor this reason this realm is called the realm of ghostsFurthermore ghosts and spirits are explained in the Posha lun refT are weak and fearfulAlso something that is always greedily seeking is called a ghostThis refers to the fact that hungry ghosts constantly seek food from others in order to liveTherefore they are given the name greedily seeking According to the Posha lun Hungry ghosts have two dwelling places primary and secondaryThere are different views on the primary dwelling placeThe work mentioned above says that five hundred yojanas below this world we call Jambudvīpa is the realm of hungry ghosts governed by King YamaThis is the  primary dwelling placeThe Shansheng youposai jing also has the same viewFive hundred yojanas below this world is the city of Yama the ghost kingThe perimeter of each of its four sides is seven hundred and seven million five hundred thousand yojanasThe multitude of ghosts that the king rules over live inside In addition as the Wudaoku jing refWudao zhangju jing Ta Therefore this scripture says in verse Between the two Iron Surrounding Mountains One does not see the sun or moon Hungry ghosts gather together there In order to pay for their sins previous lives Coming now to the secondary dwelling place according to the Posha lun  there are again different viewsThere are two kinds of secondary dwelling placesone is for awesome ghosts and the other for ghosts that are not awesomeAwesome ghosts live in mountains and valleys or in the sky or on the shores of the oceanThey all have palaces and their karmic retribution is superior to those of humansThe ghosts without awesome powers dwell amid impure dung and dirt or in overgrown graves or by lavatories and old tombsNone of them has a houseTheir karmic retribution is inferior to that of humansAgain as the abovementioned work says ref Tb TcThe four directions under heaven all have dwelling places for ghostsIn the two directions east and west there are both awesome ghosts and ghosts without awesome powersThere are only awesome ghosts in the northern direction and no ghosts without awesome powersThis is because karmic conditions are superior thereIn the heavens up to Tuṣita Heaven are also the dwelling places of the awesome ghostsThey are driven to labor by the gods of those heavensHungry ghosts do not live in heavens higher than Tuṣita HeavenThe new Posha lun also saysAmong the gods of the four heavenly realms and the thirtythree heavens dwell only the awesome ghostsThey guard and patrol the gates and all serve as servants for the gods who live in these heavensIt is said that to the west of this world are five hundred islets in two rowsAccording to the old Posha lun  to the west of this world are five hundred cities of ghosts These five hundred cities are of two kinds On the two rows of islets are five hundred citiesIn two hundred and fifty of these cities the awesome ghosts live in the other two hundred and fifty cities live the ghosts without awesome powersFor this reason in ancient days a universal monarch called Nimi said to his charioteer Mātali I wish to go out on a pleasure driveYou should drive the chariot on this road and let me see the sentient beings receiving good and evil karmic retributionMātali did as he was told by the king and drove the chariot between the two rows of isletsThe king saw the awesome ghostsThey wore crowns on their heads and their hair was decorated with flowersThey were dressed in heavenly garments and ate delicious food as if they were the sons of godsThey rode on carriages drawn by elephants and horses and every one of them was playing happilyThe king then saw the ghosts without awesome powersTheir hair was disheveled and they were naked lacking clothingThey looked emaciated covered with their own hairThey went around begging carrying unglazed potsWhen the king saw these sights he came to believe deeply in good and bad karmic retributionQuestion What do the ghosts look likeAnswer They mostly look like human beingsSome look like animals Some ghosts look like pigs some look like different kinds of other inferior animalsThey look as they do in the wall paintingsQuestion What is their languageAnswer At the beginning of a world age they all speak SanskritLater they use different languages according to their circumstancesSome say that their appearance and speech are determined by the circumstances in which they ended their earlier lives to be reborn in this realmCommentWe do not follow this viewSuppose someone dies in the formless realm and was reborn would he be without form and speechIf one follows this view wherever one had been born previously would determine his language and appearance The Zhengfanian jing saysThe total number of hungry ghosts may be divided generally into thirtysix kinds Because the behavior that caused rebirth differs they receive different retributionsBoiling cauldron ghosts Because these creatures committed murder when hired by others they are cooked in a boiling cauldronOr they had been entrusted with objects and refused to return them to the owners later so they receive this retributioncommit murderTheir throats are narrow like a pinhole and not even a drop of water can pass through themtheir wives to make religious offerings but the women said there was nothing to giveInstead they accumulated property and were stingyTherefore these wives now must constantly eat vomitedup food in this rebirthand drinking by themselves and who felt hatred toward their husbands now as ghosts eat and vomit up excrement all the timecaused their deaths so they are now burned by fire and suffer from hunger and thirstnot give any to their wives and children letting them suffer from hunger and thirst so they now only have odorous breath for food others only in order to obtain wealthTheir bodies are now racked by hunger and thirst and they have lost all their fleshTheir lives are maintained by virtue of the monks preaching of Dharmaignorant people and causing them to violate the pure precepts so they constantly suffer from scorching thirstand selling and obtained things by cheating so they now constantly suffer from hunger and thirstThey obtain food from the offerings given for ancestral spiritsrenounced the householders life by giving them impure food so they are constantly hungry and thirsty and their bodies are cooked and boiledThey beg for other peoples saliva and eat it with impure foodstole the Buddhas garland offerings to adorn themselvesWhen people on encountering unfortunate events now make offerings of garlands these ghosts subsequently get to eat themtheir blood but did not give anything to their wives and children so they have received the form of this type of ghost If blood is poured out during a sacrificial rite these ghosts get to eat itand cut off their flesh weighed it and committed deception when trading in it so they have received this retributionBecause they are very deceptive and ugly people shun them the sight If people sacrifice mixed pieces of meat these ghosts get to eat itreceived a handsome price for it so they eat only the smoke from incense and later receive the retribution of poverty wore monks robesThey took through deception saying that they would offer them to ill people but they did not give the food to the ill and instead consumed it themselvesConsequently they receive this retributionThey eat impure food all the time and their bodies burn without any external causeThese creatures cheated and stole property and did not cultivate meritorious works so they receive this retributionFlames burst forth from the hairs on their bodyThey consume peoples vital powers and impure excretions in order to sustain their own lives and caused the legitimate owners to be imprisoned in jailBlinded in the darkness of jail the legitimate owners appealed continuously for help with pitiful criesFor this reason their tormentors now suffer the pain of being put in a dark place full of evil snakes and of being cut up with swordsand gave them to bad friends not performing meritorious acts of giving so they receive this retributionThey are endowed with great supernatural powers but must endure great suffering and murdered peopleFor this reason they receive this retributionThey scream and shout as flames burn all over their bodiesLater they are reborn as humans and are constantly robbed by othersreason they receive this retributionThey constantly spy on people defecating and are capable of harming children but did not give anything for meritorious purposes so they receive this retributionThey wander around among humans and engage in sexual intercourse with themThey deceive people by taking the forms of extraordinary creatures in order to secure their livelihoodsaw an ill person and cheated him of his possessions so they are reborn in an ocean islet and receive the pain of heat and coldness ten times worse than usualcreatures were close to kings and ministers and committed violent and evil deeds in a dictatorial manner so they receive this retributionThey have become attendants of the King of Hell Yama and serve as his stickholding ghostsproperty from others by deceit and killed pigs and sheep so they have fallen into hell after death and receive this retribution They constantly eat small childrenfriends saying I will protect you to urge their friends to be more daring the friends then fell and died in the battlefield while they did nothing to aid themBecause of this they receive this retribution big party so they receive this retribution of suffering from hunger and being burned by firestinginess and they delighted in eating food that belonged to the monastery these creatures first fell into hell and after coming out of hell their bodies are scorched in a cauldron of firepractitioners so they receive this retribution and eat impuritiescame to beg alms these creatures agreed to give him food but did not give it in the endBecause of this they receive this retribution and constantly suffer from thirst and hungerTheir torment is like the pain of hellcreatures prevented the inmates from eating and drinkingBecause of this they receive this retribution and constantly eat burning coalso they fell into hell and later came out and became ghostsThey are thirsty and hungry all the time and constantly eat poison and fire which burns their bodiesponds have been created to provide travelers with water these creatures spoke rudely broke dikes and let travelers go thirstyBecause of this they receive this retributionThey are constantly hungry and thirsty and fire burns their bodiessold flowers that had been offered to the Buddha in order to make a livingBecause of this they receive this retributionThey constantly eat the hot ashes of burned corpses among the deadto provide shade for others and they then maliciously cut them down for their own useBecause of this they have fallen into the realm of trees and constantly suffer from cold and heat their provisionsFor this evil deed their bodies are sawed apart constantly They take food from the shrines at crossroads and live on itnot believe in the correct and true teaching so they have fallen to the status of ghosts of Māra and constantly harm others who practice the right Dharma According to the Shunzhengli lun There are three kinds of ghoststhose without property those with little property and those with a great deal of property Those without property also include three kindstorchmouth pinmouth and foulmouth The torchmouth ghosts constantly emit blazing flames out of their mouths which burn with incomparable intensity their bodies look like burned up tāla treesThis is the painful retribution caused by extreme stinginessThe pinmouth ghosts stomachs are massive like a mountain valley but their mouths are like a pinholeEven though they see various kinds of wonderful food and drink they cannot take them in their hunger and thirst are difficult to bearThe foulmouth ghosts have extremely bad breath which stinks like rotting matter and comes from these ghosts all the timeis worse than excrement overflowing from a privy the foul smell clings to their mouths and they constantly go through the motions of vomitingEven when they find food and drink they cannot take them tortured by hunger and thirst they run around screaming wildlyThose with a little property also include three kindsneedle hair smelly hair and big goiter The needlehaired ghosts have body hair that is straight hard and sharp so that one cannot go near themThe hair drills holes into their own bodies and pierces the bodies of othersThese ghosts are like a deer shot by poisoned arrows running wildly in fearSometimes they find impure food that temporarily eases their hunger and thirstThe smellyhair ghosts have hair that is extremely odiferous and dirty it makes their skin and bones stink and rotSteaming dust from their bowels and stomach rises into their throats and becomes their spittleTheir pain is unbearable if one seizes the body of such a ghost and pulls on its hair it rends the skin and increases the excessive painThese ghosts sometimes find impure food that temporarily eases their hunger and thirstBecause of the effect of evil karma the goiter ghosts develop a large goiter in their throat it is hot and dry like a tumor and it achesWhen they peel the skin of the goiter for each other stinking pus wells outThey fight over food to ease their hunger a littleThose with a great deal of property also include three kindsshrineseeker thrownaway foodseeker and greatly powerful ghostsThe shrineseeker ghosts constantly go to shrines and feast on what people have offered for the sacrificeare born in realms as determined by their karma but they often visit different placesThey fly in the sky like birds and go back and forth freelyWith the superior understanding they had in a previous life they made the wish When my life ends may my descendants build a shrine for me and provide me with food and drink Because of this superior understanding they are born among these ghostsThe good karmic causes of their previous lives bring about the offerings at shrines nowSome of them loved those who were close to them in a previous life and wished to make them all wealthy and well provided for but they accumulated wealth in a manner that does not accord with the DharmaWith stinginess in their minds they did not make spiritual giftsBecause of this evil karmic cause they were born among these ghostsSuch ghosts live around lavatories and other impure places near their original residencesTheir loved ones remembering them invite solitary and impoverished monks and brahmans to make offerings to them and honor their meritWhen these ghosts see that they are recalled by their close ones in connection with the wealth they had left behind and also see the results of their stinginess clearly manifested in the poverty of those who are receiving the offerings pure faith arises in their mindsThey continue to nurture the activities that accompany the act of givingBecause of this they receive the fruit in the same life and because of this karmic force they obtain plentiful provisionsThe ghosts who seek thrownaway food wish to collect leftover food and excrement discarded by other people to use as their foodSo they are also well provided forBecause of the fault of stinginess in their previous life however where there is food or drink they see only filth or nothing at allIn pleasure and purity they see only filthYet because of good karmic rewards all their needs are amply provided forFood and drink are available to them We are born into realms as determined by karma but our different fates are unpredictable Offerings made to ghosts affect them accordinglyIn the hell realm different karmic causes mature at different times producing different effects  some are interrupted and then resume but not so in other realmsIn the human realm we can acquire superior knowledge and pure practice but not so in other realmsIn heaven everything appears as one wishesThese things are determined by karmic rebirth but there is no fixed formula for predicting the ultimate outcomeAs for the ghosts of great power the description here is roughly the same as that found in the Posha lun aboveIn addition the Yqie lun saysThere are three kinds of ghostsThe first are external obstruction ghostsBecause sentient beings were stingy they are reborn among these ghostsThey are always hungry and their skin and flesh are dry like coalThe hair on their heads is in wild disorder and their lips are dry and burnedThey constantly lick their mouths and faces with their tonguesHungry thirsty and fearful they run around everywhereWhatever springs and ponds they find are guarded by sentient beings wielding swords and sticks who do not let them approachOr the water turns into pus and blood and they themselves do not wish to drink itThey are called external obstruction ghostsThe second group is internal obstruction ghostsThis refers to sentient beings whose mouths like a burning needle and who have very large stomachsEven if they obtain food and drink they cannot take themThese are the internal obstruction ghostsThere are hungry ghosts called violent flame garland ghosts their food and drink all get burned upFor this reason they suffer greatly from hunger and thirstThey are called the no obstruction ghostsNow good deeds are said to be of benefitThey occasion happy karmic rewardsEvil deeds harm others and invite destructive retributionDoing good deeds is comparable to climbing a mountain one understands that it is difficult to ascendEvil deeds are like collapsing and falling which are indeed easy to doTherefore the heavenly palace is vacant and the footsteps of visitors are few while the jails of hell are overwhelmed by those who compete for a place in it and gather there in great numbersAs the Dazhidu lun says There are three kinds of evil Only if a creature commits the minor kind of evil is he reborn in the realm of hungry ghosts The Shidi lun also presents the same view and explains which of the ten evil deeds a creature may commit that will cause him to first be reborn in the three inferior realms of hell hungry ghosts and animals and later to obtain a human bodyThe Zhengfanian jing saysIf out of greed and jealousy a being falsely flatters and deceives others or while being stingy and accumulating wealth he does not give offerings he is reborn in the realm of ghostsWhen his lifetime as a ghost is over often he is reborn in the realm of animals receiving the body of cātaka birdConstantly hungry and thirsty he suffers greatlyHe can only drink rain that falls from heaven waiting for it with his mouth open and facing upward he cannot drink any other waterTherefore he is constantly troubled by hunger and thirst The Yebao chabie jing saysIf a being commits all of the ten evil deeds he is reborn among the hungry ghosts with his body he commits light evil deeds with his mouth he commits light evil deeds of speech with his mind he commits light evil deeds he is stingy and greedy he perpetrates inappropriate evil deeds he fawns over others and is envious he entertains heretical views he is attached to wealth and life at the moment of death he dies of hunger he dies of thirstBecause of these evil deeds one is reborn among hungry ghostsThe Fenbie gongde lun saysSome monks were practicing meditation some in a graveyard and others under treesA monk was once contemplating a corpseAt night he saw a hungry ghost beating the corpseThe monk asked Why do you beat this corpse The ghost answered Because this corpse troubles me so much I beat it The follower of the Way said Why dont you beat your mind rather than beat the corpse After a short while a god sprinkled this stinking corpse with heavenly mandāra flowersThe monk asked Why do you sprinkle this stinking corpse with flowers The god answered Because of this corpse I attained rebirth in heavenThis corpse is a good friend of mineTherefore I come to sprinkle flowers on it to repay it for its kindness in the past The follower of the Way answered Why dont you sprinkle flowers on your mind rather than on the stinking corpseThe source of all good and evil deeds is the activity of the mindAre you forgetting the source to grasp at the branches According to the Wudao jingThe largest in size among the hungry ghosts is one yojana in heightHis head is like a large mountain yet the diameter of his throat is as thin as a needleThe hair on his head is disheveled and he looks gaunt and thinHe walks supported by a stickThere are many such ghostsThe smallest of the hungry ghosts is like a small child with mental faculty Some say its size is three inches in diameterDetails are in the scriptures and need not be recorded hereAccording to the Guanfo sanmei jing  The longest life span of ghosts is eightyfour thousand years the shorter life spans are not specified Following the Chengshi lun  The longest life span is seventy thousand years shorter ones are also not specified Following the Youposai jing The longest life span is fifteen thousand yearsFive thousand years in human time is one day and night among the ghostsIn terms of these days and nights the ghosts live fifteen thousand years To calculate by human days months and years the number is equivalent to seventeen million years Following the Zhengfanian jing The life span of a ghost is five hundred yearsTen years in human time is one day and one night among the ghostsIt is five hundred years with this latter time To calculate in human days months and years the number is equivalent to one million eight hundred thousand years According to the Posha lun The ghosts with awesome powers are counted among the goodlooking ghosts in appearanceThey are handsome no different from godsAlso the gods of the five sacred mountains and the four rivers are all very handsomeThey are all said to be goodlookingOn the other hand among the ugly ones are the ghosts without awesome powersTheir appearance is hideous and cannot be described in detail hereTheir bodies are hollow like the insides of a hungry dog their hair is in disarray like wild weeds their throats are like thin needles their legs are like dry and rotten wood from their mouths saliva constantly drips and snot flows from their noses pus seeps from their ears and blood from their eyesWith all these things they are said to be extremely uglyAccording to the Posha lun refTab b  Tc   Those who suffer pain among the ghosts are the ghosts without awesome powersConstantly beset by hunger and thirst they cannot even hear words such as juice or water How could they encounter a good mealIt is impossible If they find a wide river and wish to drink from it the water turns into a burning torchIf the water enters their mouths it scorches their stomachsHow could such creatures not suffer painOn the other hand those who happily enjoy pleasures among the ghosts are the ghosts with awesome powersRich and beautiful they obtain whatever clothing and food they want just by wishing for itThey wear heavenly garments and eat the food offered to godsTheir appearance is always elegantly relaxedRiding with a whip they go from place to place traveling quicklyThey roam and play according to their moodIn what way are they be different from godsHow could such things not be pleasures ImpossibleQuestionSince such pleasures are superior to those of human beings why does the scripture speak of the different realms of humans and ghostsAnswerThe scripture says that the realm of ghosts is inferior to that of humansThis has two meanings described brieflyghosts are inferior to humans in regard to public and manifest behavior that is to say because ghosts hide during the daytime and roam around at night they are inferior to humans ghosts are inferior to humans in that they are timid and fearfulEven if they have awesome powers because their retribution is inferior they are always afraid of humans if they encounter any people during the day or night they invariably make way for them and hideQuestionIf the gods are inferior to humans how did they acquire awesome powers similar to those of the gods as retributionAnswerThey performed giving frequently and on a large scale in their previous lives so they obtained this awesome retribution but because they were not truthful flattering others dishonestly they received rebirth in the realm of ghostsAccording to the Posha lun  some have awesome powersThey may be called noble Some lack awesome powersThey may be called ignoble Also the rulers of ghosts may be called noble while those who are driven and used may be called ignoble QuestionWhat about their economic conditionsAnswerThose with awesome powers are well provided for and freely have the use of servantsThus they are called wealthy Some ghosts are constantly driven and ordered to workThey do not hear even of simple food and have difficulty finding even wornout clothesThese are called poor According to the Posha lun refTb  Tc Those with awesome powers have palaces and residences decorated with the seven jewelsAll mountain and river deities have residences to live inThose without awesome powers such as the floating and wandering ghosts and the hungry and thirsty ones do not have residencesThey live temporarily in grave mounds and stay in bushes among grasses and trees and in cavesThese are their living quartersThe Zhuangyan lun saysThe Buddha said In the past I heard of a son of a merchant whose name was roṇakoṭikarṇaHe took to the ocean to seek treasure and having achieved success he returnedHe and his companion stayed overnight in different placesOne time having lost his companion he was frightened and pressed by hunger and thirstHe saw a city far away and thought there would be water thereHe approached the city to look for water to drink but it was a city of ghostsHe entered the cityThe crossroads of the major streets running in the four directions and other places where people would usually gather together were empty and he did not see anyoneHungry and thirsty he said I am pressed with hunger and thirst He then saw another city and thought there would be water thereHe approached that city and looked for water but again it was a city of ghostsHe entered the city but the crossroads of the major streets running in the four directions and other places where people would usually gather together were empty and he did not see anyoneHungry and thirsty he cried out Water water The hungry ghosts heard a voice saying water and they all gathered like a cloud saying Who among the merciful wishes to give water The bodies of all these ghosts were like scorched pillarsCovered with their own hair they all approached with their palms joined and each said Please give me water When the hungry ghosts heard that roṇakoṭikarṇa was himself pressed by thirst and was looking for water their hope vanished and sighing deeply they said Perhaps you dont know but this is a city of ghostsWhy did you come here to look for water Then they said in verseWe live in this castle In a billion years We have not yet even heard the word water How could be any among us who were able to drink some Like a palm tree forest That is burning ablaze We are likewise Burning in all our limbs and joints The hair on our heads is entirely disheveled Our bodies are broken and bruised all over Day and night we think of food and drink Out of fear we run around in all directions Pressed by hunger and thirst With our mouths wide open we run in search for food and drink A man follows us with a stick And pursuing us he whips us Another man hits us with a hammer and no one can go near him We suffer this pain How could we obtain waterBe merciful and give to others In our previous lives We were stingy and jealous We never gave anyone juice water or any food and drink We did not give any of our possessions to others And we caused others not to give For these grave acts We now suffer pain Miracle Stories From the Song dynasty  Sima Wenxuan Wang Hu and Li Dan from the Tang dynasty  Sui Renqian demons and monsters in the mountains in Linchuan and miscellaneous nonBuddhist stories about ghosts Song Dynasty Sima Wenxuan was a man of the Honei area and he believed deeply in the Buddhist teachingIn the ninth year of the Yuanjia period his mother and younger brother diedToward the morning of one full moon night he suddenly saw his brother sitting at the spirit altar looking just as he used to when he was aliveTurning quickly toward Wenxuan he sighed and said he wanted food and drinkWenxuan then tested him saying You performed the ten good deeds in your lifetimeIf the scripture is true you should have been reborn

begging for food He left some days laterLater there was a ghost at his mothers altarIt was tall and had a red bodyWenxuans oldest son Xiaozu exchanged words with the ghostThe ghosts answers were all wellinformedAt first Xiaozu was afraid but in the end he became more at ease and accustomed to the ghostThe ghost also became more tame going in and out of the house just like a member of the familyThe story about this ghost spread in the capital city at that time and many people came to see itAt the time there was a monk in Nanlin Temple who along with Senghan a monk of Lingwei Temple debated with the ghost in a very relaxed mannerThe ghost said In a past birth I was a respected and noble personBecause I committed many evil deeds however my karmic retribution is not exhausted and I have this body as a consequenceIn the past Year of the Tiger four hundred divisions of ghosts spread diseases all overThe calamities they caused should not have troubled you who are followers of the WayBut they committed many evil deeds and disrupted good activitiesTherefore I have been sent to look over things The monks offered him foodThe ghost said I have my own foodYou should not offer this food to me Senghan said You know a great deal about my lifeFrom which realm have I come and why did I become a monk The ghost answered You came from the realm of humansYour original vow is the karmic reason for your renouncing the householders life The monk asked about life death and the realms of rebirth and the ghost answered almost all his questionsThere were also miracles but since they were too numerous we cannot record the details Senghan said The realms of humans and ghosts differYou are not looking for foodWhy have you stayed here so long The ghost said There is a woman here that I must arrest but she honors the precepts and is diligent in religious duties so I have difficulty in obtaining herThis is the reason for my delay nowI am greatly ashamed to disturb my host After this he did not show his body very much and later visitors heard only his voiceThis was in the tenth year of Yuanjia On the twentyeighth day of the third month the ghost said to Wenxuan I appeared suddenly and stayed on yet you used all your family resources to perform meritorious deedsHaving been treated with such great reverence how could I be so rude as to stay much longer Xiaozu said You may stay but why did you appear at the altar set up for someone who had just died The ghost answered The deceased in your family all have their own placesThis seat was vacant so I borrowed it temporarily So saying this he departedWang Hu was from ChanganHis uncle had been dead for several years when in the twentythird year of the Yuanjia period  he suddenly reappearedReturning home he blamed Hu for lacking diligence in spiritual cultivation and for not managing the family affairs properlyHe gave him five strokes of the cane as punishmentThose who were nearby or were in the neighborhood all heard his words and the sound of the caneThey also saw the woundsBut they did not see the uncle only Hu could interact with him personallyThe uncle told Hu I should not have diedAuthorities of the realm of the dead should check the ghost registration for meI have a large following of officials and soldiers now I am afraid they may frighten people and damage the villageSo I wont go any further into it Hu also saw a large crowd of ghosts in turmoil outside of the villageSuddenly the uncle departed saying I will come back again temporarily on the seventh day of the seventh month next yearI want to take you around the dark realms of hell of ghosts and of animals to let you know the retribution for sin and for meritorious deedsDo not prepare a receptionIf you do not put a stop to your faults suffering will come When the time came the uncle returned and said to the people in Hus household I am now going to take Hu for sightseeingI will bring him back so do not worry Hu then suddenly lay down on the bed and became unconscious as if he were deadThen the uncle took Hu to many mountains and showed him ghosts and strange creaturesBefore they arrived at Mount Songgao ghosts passing by Hu offered him foodThe taste of the offering was no different from ordinary food except for the ginger which was extremely soft and tangyHu wanted to take it back with himThe creatures laughed at Hu and said You can only eat this food hereYou cannot take it back Hu finally saw one place a beautiful and spacious building with high quality and wellmade curtains and carpetsTwo young monks stayed thereHu went to them and the two monks offered him a variety of fruit and some coconutsHaving visited many places over a long period of time and seen in detail the painful and happy retributions of sins and meritorious deeds Hu took his leave and returned homeHis uncle said to Hu You know that you must cultivate goodWhy remain a householderThe forestdweller White Feet is loftily correct in upholding the precepts and the practice of cultivationYou should serve him as your master This follower of the Way in Changan had white feet so his contemporaries called him Forestdweller White Feet He was greatly revered by the barbarous Wei people and the Wei ruler treated him as his teacherHu followed his uncles adviceWhen he was in the temple he saw the young monks of Mount Songgao among the visiting student monksHu was very surprised and breaking from his orderly conduct he asked when they had comeThe two monks said We live in this templeWe dont remember meeting you in the past Hu mentioned the encounter at Mount SonggaoThe monks said You are mistakenHow can there be such a thing The next day the two monks had departed without giving any reasonHu then told the other monks what had happened describing what he had seen at Mount Songgao earlierEveryone in the community was surprised and pursued the monks but they did not find themThereupon they realized that the two monks were divine personagesToward the end of the Yuanjia period a monk from Changan called Shi Tanshuang who traveled in the region south of the Yangzi River told this story in detailLi Dan styled Shize was from GuanglingHe was well known in his village for his assiduous filial piety and simple lifeOn the fourteenth day of the first month in the third year of Yuanjia he suddenly diedAfter seven days before his heart had become cold he regained consciousness and took a drink and ate some gruelHe recovered overnight and told the following storyA man with the flag of a messenger had come to the head of his bed and said The ruler of hell is calling you Dan immediately followed him and went directly northwardThe road was very flat and cleanWhen he arrived he found city buildings as tall and beautiful as our present city gatesSome creatures sent welcoming words telling him to come to the frontIn the office above the courtyard he saw thirty people in unlined official robes and blue headdresses sitting gravely in rowsOne person was sitting in the eastern corner His jacket was open and he was leaning on a deskHe had attending guards that must have numbered over one hundred Seeing Dan these people spokeThe man who was sitting said I will show you hell in order to let the world learn about it When Dan heard these words he raised his head to look aroundThe scene had changed completely and he was now in the middle of hellHe saw many sinners receiving painful retribution moaning and screaming It was unbearable to watchIn a while word came that the ruler of hell had sent a message to him and that there were people waiting for himBecause of this he returned to this worldIn the first month of the sixth year Dan died and again revived on the seventh dayHe described the things he had seen which were roughly the same as the first timeThere also were sinners who sent word to their families through himThey had committed crimes when they were alive and they now instructed their families to perform meritorious deedsThey mentioned their names close acquaintances and village unitsDan sought out their families according to what he had been told and always found themHe had also heard that in the jiashen year of the calendrical cycle an epidemic would spread to kill evil peopleIf the disciples of the Buddhist teaching performed the oneday practice of the eight precepts cultivated their minds and did good deeds they would be sparedDan originally a Daoist leader  immediately wanted to abandon Daoism but the Daoist believers remonstrated against him so he ended up following both teachingsHe constantly encouraged people to perform the oneday practice of the eight preceptsZheng Xianzhi of Yingyang was ViceDirector of the Imperial SecretariatDuring the fourth year of the Yuanjia period he was traveling to the capital following the emperors carriageWhen they arrived at the capital Zheng died suddenly that eveningThereupon a man was possessed with miraculous speech and said My life span has long since ended and I should have passed away from the world a long time agoFortunately in recent years I have been honoring the Buddhist teaching I freed living creatures from captivity and made offeringsWith this merit I added several years to my lifeBoth hidden and manifest retributions follow a person just as do shadows and echoesAbandon all worldly obligations and honor the great teaching At this time many superior and noble people heard these wordsTang Dynasty Sui Renqian was from Handan in the Zhao CommanderyAs a young man he studied Confucian scriptures and did not believe in ghosts always wanting to test their existenceSo he followed a ghost specialist and studied for over ten years but he still could not see ghostsLater he moved to the Xiang district and saw a man on the street who looked like a heavenly officialThe man was wearing shining clothes and riding a good horse followed by fifty mounted menSeeing Renqian he did not say a wordLater Rengian saw this man several times but it was always like thisIn ten years they ran into each other dozens of timesLater the man suddenly stopped his horse and called to Renqian I see you frequently and truly think of you with affectionI wish to be a friend of yours Thereupon Renqian greeted him respectfully and asked who he wasThe man answered I am a ghost with the surname Cheng and personal name JingOriginally from Hongnong I served as an Administrative Aide during the Western Jin period My present appointment is that of the Administrator of the state of Hu Renqian asked Where is that state and what is the name of the ruling prince The man answered Regions north of the Yellow River share a border with the state of HuThe capital is to the northwest of Loufan in the desertAs for the prince the late Prince Wuling of Zhao governs the state now but it is controlled by Mount TaiEvery month the prince sends an envoy to pay homage to Mount TaiThat is why I came here so frequently and encountered youI can be usefulI can let you know about calamities before they arrive so that you may avoid them and escape from violent injuriesOnly the fate of life and death and retributions of great fortunes and misfortunes cannot be changed Renqian agreedSo Jing ordered one of his followers to serve as the officer in chargeHaving thus presented Renqian with a man to accompany him Jing told him to report to the man as soon as something happenedIf there was ever anything that the man did not know he was to come and ask JingHaving given this instruction Jing departedThe officer in charge followed Renqian as if he were his personal attendantWhenever Renqian asked something the man knew the answerIn the beginning of the Daye period  Cen Zhixiang of Jiang ling was the director of HandanHis son Wenben had not undergone the initiation ceremonyZhixiang requested Renqian to teach Wenben at homeRenqian told the above story to Wenben and then said that Administrator Cheng told him There is one thing I am embarrassed to tell you but since we are friends I must tell youGhosts also eat but they cannot eat sufficiently and they suffer from hungerIf they obtain human food they can be satisfied for one yearMany ghosts frequently steal human food Since my status is high and I have important duties I cannot stealWould you prepare a meal for me After Renqian told Wenben this Wenben prepared an offering consisting of rare and tasty foodRenqian said Ghosts do not wish to enter peoples housesWe should set up a tent and seats outside near the water and offer the wine and food Wenben followed this instructionWhen the time came Renqian saw Jing and two other guests come and sit downAfter this the one hundred mounted soldiers came and sat downWenben repeatedly bowed toward the seats and apologized for the modesty of the mealRenqian also communicated Jings words of gracious acceptanceEarlier when Wenben had been about to set out the food Renqian asked that a gift of gold and silk also be offeredWenben asked What sort of things Renqian said The things that ghosts use are different from those of peopleonly gold and silk are used in common and it is better to give ersatz gold and silkA large piece of tin painted yellow for the gold and materials made with paper for the silk would be the most valuable Wenben did as he was toldWhen Jing finished eating he had his followers take a seat and eatWenben presented the gold and silk materials he had preparedJing was overjoyed and thanked him Through scholar Sui  I troubled youDo you wish to know the length of your life span Wenben declined saying I do not wish to know Jing laughed and departedSeveral years later Renqian became very ill not rising from his bed for over a monthRenqian relied on the ghost officer in charge of his affairsThe latter did not know the reason for Renqians illness so he asked the administrator Cheng The administrator reported There is no one who knows anything about it in our stateWhen I go to the court in Mount Tai next month I will ask about it for you and report back The following month the administrator came and said A man from your region called Zhao something is the recorder of Mount TaiThere is a vacancy for one member at the recorders office and he recommended you for this positionTherefore they are preparing a document in order properly to recruit youWhen the document is ready you will die Renqian asked about requesting to have the document nullifiedJing said Your life span should be over sixty yearsNow you have only just turned forty but Recorder Zhao is arbitrarily recruiting youYou should make the request Then he said Recorder Zhao asked about you saying Brother Sui was a fellow student in the past and I have deep affection for himFortunately I have now become a recorder at Mount Tai and there is a vacancy in the officeThe district magistrate is now looking for someone I have already spoken to himHe approved of the appointmentBrother Sui cannot live for very longOur lives all end in deathWhen death does come a man does not necessarily find an office such as the vacant one I now haveWhy does he begrudge twenty years and temporarily extend his life spanIf the document is nullified now I cannot place the request again He must make up his mind about coming hereThere is no room for doubt Renqian was depressed and fearful and his illness became more seriousJing said to Renqian Recorder Zhao wishes to take you there no matter what means he has to useYou can only escape if you appeal directly to the ruler of Mount Tai Renqian asked how he could see the rulerJing said Only ghosts can see himGo to the shrine at Mount TaiOnce you cross a small peak to the east there is a flat area which is the location of their capitalIf you go there you should be able to see him Renqian told Wenben who made the travel preparations for himSeveral days later Jing spoke to Renqian once again The document is about to be completedI am afraid you cannot escape even if you appealQuickly make a Buddhist imageThe document will then quickly disappear by itself Renqian told Wenben to spend three thousand pieces of gold and have an image of the seated Buddha painted on the western wall of the templeWhen it was completed Jing came and said You have escaped Renqian did not truly believe in the Buddha and was still doubtfulSo he asked Jing Buddhism teaches about the causes and consequences governing the three ages past present and futureIs this teaching true or false Jing answered It is all true If so when people die they must be divided and enter into the six realms of rebirthWhy should everyone become ghosts just as both Prince Wuling of Zhao and you are now ghosts Jing said How many families are there in your district Renqian said Over ten thousand Jing asked again How many prisoners Renqian said Always fewer than twenty Jing asked again Among the ten thousand families how many are officials of the fifth rank Renqian replied None Jing asked again How many officials above the ninth rank Renqian said Several tens Jing said The division into the six realms is just like thisNot even one in ten thousand succeeds in being reborn in heavenThis is comparable to the fact that not even one person in your district is an official of the fifth rankSeveral people among ten thousand succeed in being reborn as human beings just as several tens in your district are officials of the ninth rankSeveral tens also enter hell like your prisonersBut the majority are reborn as ghosts and animals like the taxed peasants in your districtThere are also ranks within the realm of ghosts Jing then pointed to one of his followers That man is far inferior to me but those who are inferior to him are even more numerous Renqian said Do ghosts die Jing said Yes Renqian asked When they die into which realm are they reborn Jing answered We do not knowjust as people know life but do not know what happens after death Renqian asked Is the Daoist ceremony of presenting a written request profitable or not Jing said Daoists govern over the six realms by the order of the Heavenly RulerThey constitute the Heavenly OfficeKing Yama is comparable to the Son of Heaven among humansThe ruler of Mount Tai is comparable to the Director of the Imperial SecretariatThe Divine Secretaries of the Five Realms are comparable to ministersOur state is like a large region or commanderyEvery time human affairs are judged Daoists send up a ceremonial petitionThis is called requesting a fortune and is comparable to seeking the benevolence of spiritsThe Heavenly Office receives it and sends it down to King Yama saying On such a month and such a day we received Soandsos appealYou should investigate the truth exhaustively without committing injustices Yama respectfully receives the order and executes itThis is like receiving when one receives an Imperial Order in the human realmUnless there is a good reason one should not seek an exemption from ordersIf there is injustice one should always be able to report itHow could one call this profitable Renqian asked again What sort of merit does a family that cultivates the Buddhist teaching receive Jing said The Buddha is the Great Sage He does not send down documentsThe gods in heaven reverently honor those who cultivate the Buddhist Way and such people often receive generous pardonsIf their merit is great even if they are in inferior realms of existence the condemning documents cannot reach themThis is something with which I am not familiarI do not know the reason for this After saying this Jing departedAfter a few days Renqian was able to get up and recovered from his illnessWenbens father died and he returned homeRenqian sent a letter to Wenben saying Ghosts and spirits are indeed greedyIn the past they wanted you to provide food and drink for them Consequently they were extremely politeThese days they know that there are no benefits to be had any more so they do not bother to come and see me any longer Yet the ghost officer who was charged to attend to me still appears and follows me wherever I goWhen this district was ransacked by bandits and many were killed I was guided by this attendant ghost as usual and even though the bandits were not seen anywhere I was able to capture them all in the end On the eighth day of the ninth month in the sixteenth year of Zhengguan  civil officials gathered for an archery ceremony at Xuanwu GateWenben was at that time the ViceDirector of the SecretariatHe was with his brother who was Chamberlain for the Palace Revenues as well as Secretarial Censor Ma Zhou and Palace Steward Wei Kun When the emperor sat facing them Wenben related the above story himselfThe above miracle story is from the Mingbao ji Tbb The Sousheng ji saysIn mountain districts in Linchuan specters appearOften strong winds and heavy rain causes a howling sound and the specters shoot at peopleThe place they hit leaves a mark like a hoof that has swollen up greatly The poison is either of the male or female kindThe male kind works quickly the female kind slowlyThe quick one does not take more than half a day and the slow one not more than overnightBystanders often come to the victims rescue and with their help the stricken person gets a little better but death always come in the endThis phenomenon is commonly called the swordtrouble ghost Therefore a secular book says The evidence of the manifestation of good and evil fortune caused by ghosts and spirits is known in the world The Laozi saysOf old these obtained the One heaven obtained the One and was clear earth obtained the One and was tranquil gods obtained the One and had their potencies The valley obtained the One and was full lords and princes obtained the One and the realm under heaven became settledThus heaven earth ghosts and spirits share the common vital root with the selfWhen the breath is divided inherent nature becomes differentiatedWhen divisions are established forms become differentThere is nothing that can share a common nature and form with other thingsThe living are the masters in the realm of yang the dead are the masters in the realm of yinEach according to his nature keeps his own sphere at peaceThe specter exists in the midst of the great yinThe Hanshi waizhuan saysWhen a creature dies he becomes a ghostGhost means returning The soul returns to heavenThe flesh returns to soilThe blood returns to water The blood vessels return to valleysThe voice returns to thunderPhysical movement returns to windThe eyes return to the sun and moonThe bones return to woodThe muscle returns to mountainsThe teeth return to stoneThe fat returns to dew and the dew returns to grassThe inhaling and exhaling breath again return to another personThe Sacrifice chapter of the Liji saysZaiwo said I have heard of ghosts and spirits but I do not know what they mean The Master said The breath is the thriving activity of the spirits the body is the thriving activity of the ghostsWhen ghosts and spirits are brought together the teaching is realized Cui Hongs Shiliuguo Chunqiu The Record of the Former Liang chapter saysZhang Qing was a man of the Ma clan in Anding regionWhen Qing killed Qu Jian Jian uttered this curseA white dog appears in the moonlight After drawing his sword and killing Jian Qing fell to the ground and did not riseHis attendants saw Jian at his sideIn this way Qing died a violent deathThe Shenyi jing saysIn the northeastern direction is the rock cave of the star of ghostsThis cave has three hundred doorsOn the side of the rock is a sign saying Gate of Ghosts The gate is closed during the daytimeIn the evening human voices are heardThere is a bluecolored fireOnce when as a young man Song Dingbo of Nanyang was walking around at night he met a ghostHe asked it Which ghost are you The ghost asked back Who are you sir Dingbo deceived him saying I am also a ghost The ghost asked Where are you going Dingbo answered I am going to the city of Wan The ghost said I also am going to the city of Wan So they walked together for several milesThe ghost said Walking on foot is too slowWe could take turns carrying each other Dingbo said Very good So the ghost first carried Dingbo for several milesThen it said You sir are too heavyPerhaps you are not a ghost Dingbo said I died recently so my body is heavy Dingbo then carried the ghost which was almost weightlessThey repeated this two or three timesDingbo said again I have only recently died and do not know what ghosts fear and avoid The ghost answered The only thing we do not like is human saliva As they were traveling together the road eventually ran into waterDingbo let the ghost cross it first and heard no soundWhen Dingbo himself waded across he made a soundThe ghost said again Why is there a sound Dingbo said Because I only recently died I have not practiced crossing water That is why I made a soundDont become suspicious of me When they were about to reach Wan Dingbo lifted the ghost up on top of his head and held him fastThe ghost screamed loudly asking to be let down but Dingbo did not listen to the ghosts criesSoon they arrived at the market in Wan and he let the ghost down on the groundThe ghost then changed into a sheep so Dingbo sold itFrightened by the transformation of the ghost into a sheep he spat at itDingbo went away with one thousand five hundred pieces of moneyAt this time Shi Chong said Dingbo sold a ghost and got one thousand five hundred pieces of money  The Biography of Zhao Tai saysTai suddenly diedTwo messengers came to help himThey entered the local government building from the western sideThe building had three black gates altogether and walls that extended several tens of milesThe building was tall and had a tiled roofOthers who had also died on the same day five or six thousand men and women stood outside the gatesAn official wearing unlined silken clothes held a pen and recorded the names of all the people who had gathered thereMens and womens names were recorded separately The official told Zhao Tai Do not moveWe are about to present you to the ruler of Mount TaiYour name is the twentieth in the listYour turn will soon come The ruler was sitting facing west surrounded by guards holding swordsThe attendants called each person by name and brought them all into the rulers presenceThe ruler ordered them to jail according to the severity of their crimesAccording to the Baopu Zi Both the Jiuding ji and the Qingling jing say Ghosts appear at the death of both humans and animals When Sun En of Wei was in rebellion the Wuxing region was in chaosA man who was escaping from a dangerous situation suddenly entered the shrine of Lord JiangWhen he went through the gate a wooden image pulled a bow and shot him deadPassersby and the shrine guards all witnessed itIntroduction Explanation of the Name Dwelling Places Body Size Life Span Karmic Causes  Retribution Cultivation of Merit Pain and Pleasure and Beautiful and Ugly Appearance To come to animals they are born due to the retribution caused by ignoranceThere are many kinds of animals and there is more than one principle that governs themEndowed with the impure quality of ignorance a creature is reborn in this inferior realmHaving lost intelligence it has only excessive greed and angerThus wasps and scorpions accumulate poison and snakes nourish angerPigeons and sparrows are addicted to copulation jackals and wolves are quick and violentSome are also covered in fur and have hornsSome have beautiful green feathers and carry jewels in their beaksSome have large beaks with sharp points and others have long and sharp talons or claws Again some are under the rule of other creatures while some are controlled by humansDogs are busy barking at night and roosters compete with each other to announce the dawnOxen exhaust themselves in the fields and horses labor in military campaignsTheir flesh thus wastes away and their skin dries upSome may hide in fields of grass and marshes but in the end they are captured in nets and trapsSome escape into ponds but unexpectedly become victims of fishing netsAll of these animals repentThere are large creatures such as the gigantic bird Peng and the leviathan Kun and those with tiny bodies like crickets and antsThere is the mole about which it is said When the mole drinks at the river he takes no more than a bellyful and there is the tailor bird of which it is said When the tailor bird builds her nest in the deep woods she uses no more than one branch There are creatures born in water and those who are born on land there are feathered families and species with fur there are those with purple scales or silken material or those with red gills and tailsIf we ourselves repent for all the animals their faith becomes pure and they abandon their inferior forms their wisdom shines forth and they again obtain the reward of being reborn in heavenThey no longer suffer from being forced to labor and they are liberated forever from the sorrow of being slaughtered and butchered for foodThey may wander around as their hearts desire and freely indulge in pleasures following their own inclinationsThey know no external limitation of eating and drinkingThey warble and sing spontaneouslyThey have escaped from their bird cages and fish baskets and are free from all bondageAccording to the Posha lun Sheng in the word chusheng means sentient being  and chu means domestication and rearingThis means that the conduct of such a creature is wild and its nature is dull and ignorantSuch creatures are unable to be independent and so are domesticated and raised by othersFor this reason they are called animals ie domesticated beings QuestionIf chusheng refers to those animals that are domesticated and raised by humans how can creatures such as dragons which travel through the water land and sky be considered to be among those that are raised by humans and thus called animalsAnswerThe meaning of rearing is broadThe term covers the six heavens as well as the human realmThe places in which creatures that are not raised by humans live are narrowly limitedonly the mountains fields and marshes in the human realmFurthermore in ancient days dragons were also raised by humansDetails can be found in the literary and historical writingsNow since the overwhelming majority of these creatures are domesticated and raised by humans they are all called chushengThe Lishi lun says The Sanskrit name for animals is tiryañc The reason is that a being is born in this realm because of slavishly fawning upon peopleIt is also said that sentient beings in this realm often hide their bodily activitiesTherefore they are called tiryañcAccording to the new Posha lun Animals are called horizontal creaturesQuestionWhy is called the realm of horizontal creaturesAnswer Because the orientation of these creatures is horizontal they also walk sideways and because they walk sideways their orientation is horizontalTherefore they are called horizontal creaturesSome say that because these sentient beings committed extremely ignorant evil acts of body speech or mind they are reborn in that realm of dark stupidityTherefore they are called crooked creatures They say that such creatures are present everywhere in the five inferior realmsIn naraka there are legless animals such as nyaṅkuṭā worms twolegged ones such as the ironbeaked bird fourlegged ones such as the large black dog and manylegged ones such as centipedesIn the realm of hungry ghosts there are legless animals such as poisonous snakes twolegged ones such as crows and hawks fourlegged ones such as foxes boars elephants and horses and manylegged ones such as sixlegged creatures and centipedesIn the three continents in the human realm there are legless animals such as all the various reptiles twolegged ones such as wild swans and geese fourlegged ones such as elephants and horses and manylegged ones such as centipedesIn the continent of Uttarakuru there are twolegged ones such as wild swans and geese and fourlegged ones such as elephants and horses but there are no legless or manylegged onesThis is because that continent is a place where creatures receive the karmic reward of freedom from sufferingIn the heavens of the four heavenly kings and in the thirtythree heavens there are twolegged animals such as beautiful colored birds and fourlegged ones such as elephants and horsesAs has been explained in the previous case there are no othersIn the highest of the four heavens there are only twolegged animals such as beautiful colored birds there are no other creaturesThis is because what takes place in the heavenly realms is perfectQuestion If there are no elephants and horses in some places what do the inhabitants use for vehiclesAlso I have heard of elephants and horses in those heavensWhy do you say there are noneAnswer Because of the meritorious karmic power of the gods in those heavens they create nonsentient forms of elephants and horses which they use as their vehicles and to enjoy themselvesAccording to the Loutan jing Animals differ from each otherGenerally speaking there are three kindsfish birds and mammalsOf these three categories each has many speciesThe fish category has six thousand four hundred species the bird category has four thousand five hundred species and the mammal category has two thousand four hundred speciesIn this scripture only the overall numbers are listed not the names of the various species The Zhengfanian jing gives different numbers of species saying that there are four billion speciesIt also does not list the names  The new Posha lun says QuestionWhere was the original dwelling place of horizontal creaturesAnswer Their original dwelling place was in the oceanLater they dispersed into many realmsQuestion What do they look likeAnswer Mostly they stand sidewaysThere are also some that stand upright such as the singing and dancing deities known as kiṃnaras the corpseeating ghosts called piśācas and the xilusuojiaQuestion What language do they speakAnswer At the beginning of the kalpa everyone spoke SanskritLater differences in the time of eating and drinking developed and sentient beings were no longer the same as each other Some creatures slavishly fawned upon others and deceived each other and so many languages appearedCreatures who cannot use language at all also appearedAccording to the old Posha lun The places in which animals live may be divided into primary and secondaryFirst to consider their primary dwelling place some say that it is in the darkness between the two areas of the Iron Surrounding Mountains some say it is in the middle of the ocean some say it is on an island in a big riverSecond their secondary dwelling place is in the five inferior realmsIn the realm of hell there are legless animals such as snakes two leggedones such as crows and doves and fourlegged ones such as dogsAmong these some are there because of the real consequences of karma while others are temporary manifestations They may be in this form due to either one of these two possibilities In the realm of ghosts there also are legless twolegged and fourlegged animalsNamely among the ghosts with awesome powers are elephants horses and camels among ghosts without awesome powers are only dogsAmong the asuras Note Some say this realm is similar to the realm of ghosts and the realm of gods there only are twolegged and fourlegged animals no other kindsIn the heavens of the two realms of desire and form there are animals with karmic causes and those without ie animals that are only temporary manifestationsThe situation is the same as the explanation given above in the case of the gods According to the Pusa chutai jing  first no large bird is bigger than a garuḍaThe distance between its head and tail is eight thousand yojanas Its height is the sameWhen a garuḍa flies it goes without stopping from one Mount Sumeru to anotherDetails are given in the scriptureSecond among animals none surpasses the dragon in sizeAccording to the Ahan jing  in appearance the two dragons Nanda and Upananda are the largestThey surround Mount Sumeru seven timesWhile their heads rest on the mountain top their tails are in the oceanThird among those with the body of a fish none surpasses the great fish makara According to the Sifen l the length of the great fish makara can be three or four hundred yojanasThe biggest is seven hundred yojanasAccording to the Ahan jing its eyes are like the sun and the moon its nose is like a big mountain and its mouth is like a large valleyIf one were to follow secular books Zhuang Zhou said that there is a large bird called PengThis bird is extremely largeOne does not know how many thousand miles long the back of the great Peng isWhen it is about to fly it hits the water with a splash that rises three thousand li highIts wings are like clouds hanging from the sky and they flutter slowly as the bird goes upReaching a height of nine thousand li above the ground it then flies awayTo go from the Northern Ocean to the Southern Ocean it flies straight for six months without stopping to restThis refers to the small garuḍa bird mentioned in Buddhist literatureSecular writers are unaware of this so they speak as if there exists in addition a bird called Great Peng Secular Chinese books also say that among the large aquatic animals none is bigger than the turtle JulingIt has the biggest of all animal bodies and its head lays in Penglai OceanThe texts do not specify its height and lengthThe description of this turtle does not match a very small makara fish so we cannot discuss in detail the differences in size Zhuang Zhou said that among the small birds none is smaller than the jiao ming bird This is a type of insect that produces its offspring inside a mosquitos antennaeIt lays its eggs inside the antennae yet the eggs do not fall This does not go far enoughIn Buddhist literature the sentient beings who receive the retribution of being reborn as extremely small creatures are shaped like dustThey can only be seen with a divine eyeTherefore the Buddhist Vinaya has the following story The Buddha instructed the monks to filter their water before drinkingāriputra filtered his water many times but there were still small insects in the water so he did not drink any water for seven days and his body became severely dehydratedWhen the Buddha learned of this he asked āriputra Why have you become so haggard āriputra answered The Buddha asked us to filter water before drinkingI filtered my water many times but I still saw insects with my divine eyeThey go through the filter like the minute particles that float on the surface of water in a potIn order to protect their lives I did not dare to drink the waterTherefore my body has become emaciated The Buddha told āriputra If one were to always check with a divine eye no one would be aliveFrom now on use only your coarse physical eyes to see if the water is cleanIf you cannot see any insects in it with your physical eyes you can drink it Therefore we know that sentient beings with the retribution of being born as minute beings fill space everywhereHow could it be that the smallest ones are as big as tailor birds According to the Pitan  In the realm of animals none has a longer life span than one kalpa as in the case of the earthupholding dragon and the Elāpattra dragon None has a shorter life span than the insect known as the dayfly which is born in the morning and dies in the evening its life lasting not even as long as one dayThe life spans of animals that fall between these two extremes cannot be described in detail hereAccording to the Dazhidu lun  The Buddha instructed āriputra to observe the past and future of a pigeonOver a period of eighty thousand kalpas this creature never abandoned the body of a pigeonTherefore we know that the life spans of animals are extremely long and beyond the limit of what ordinary beings can comprehend According to the Yebao chabie jing A living being receives the retribution of rebirth as an animal by committing the following ten types of actsevil deeds of the body evil deeds of speech evil deeds of thought evil deeds committed out of greed evil deeds committed out of anger evil deeds committed out of ignorance cursing sentient beings maltreating sentient beings making an offering of impure objects and committing adulteryAccording to the Zhengfanian jing  the species of animals differ from each otherThe karmic causes and the consequences differ for each speciesDetails can be found in this scripture and are not described here According to the Dichi If a living being commits any one of the ten evil deeds he will  the realms of hell of animals or of hungry ghostsLater he will be reborn as a human being and will still suffer pain from remaining karmic retributionAccording to the Xianyu jing Sutra of the Wise and the Ignorant TSome merchants once hoped to visit another countryThese merchants had a dog Midway on their journey the merchants stopped to take a restThinking that no one was looking the dog stole some meatIn anger the merchants hit the dog and broke its leg and they then went on abandoning the animal in the middle of the fieldAt that time āriputra saw the dog with his divine eyeCrippled and hungry it was greatly distressed and about to diePutting on his robe and holding his almsbowl āriputra entered the city and begged for food After he obtained some food he took it outside the cityFlying to where the dog was he offered it the food out of compassion and pityWhen the dog ate the food it revived and was overjoyedāriputra then preached the profound teaching to the dogThereupon the dog died and was reborn in a brahmans family in rāvastīLater āriputra was out walking alone on almsroundsA brahman saw him and said The Honored One is walking alone without an attendant novice āriputra said I have no attending noviceI hear that you have a sonYou should give him to me The brahman said I have a son named CundaHe is still too young to fulfill such duties but before he is fully grown I will give him to you Later when the child reached the age of seven years old the brahman entrusted him to āriputra causing the boy renounce the householders lifeThereupon āriputra accepted the child Just as āriputra was about to reach Jetavana he preached the teaching to the novice step by stepThe latters mind opened up and he understood the teaching obtaining the reward of arhatshipHe was endowed with all superior qualitiesWhen Cunda first attained the Way he contemplated past lives with his own power of knowledge what conduct had he performed so that he had met a holy person and obtained the goal of salvationHe saw that in his previous life he had been a hungry dogThanks to the compassion of his master he had now obtained a human body and attained the religious goalHappy feelings arose deep within him and he said to himself Thanks to my masters compassion I was delivered from much sufferingI should now dedicate myself to looking after his needsI will request to remain his novice and not receive the complete precepts  The Buddha said to nanda In the past age during the time of Kāśyapa Buddha Cunda was a young monk with a beautiful voiceHe was very good at chanting verses and people loved to listen to himThere was an old monk who had a raspy and dull voice and he could not chant the sutrasHe had obtained arhatship however and was endowed with all superior qualitiesThe youth was proud of his good voiceWhen he saw the old monk he had reviled him saying that his voice was like a dog barkingThe old monk immediately called out to the youth saying Dont you know that I have attained arhatship and all the ceremonies have been performed for me When the youth heard this he was shocked and his hair stood on endGreatly frightened he blamed himself and repented his faults before the old monkBecause of his evil speech however he received the body of a dog for a period of five hundred kalpasBecause he renounced the householders life and upheld the pure precepts he has now been able to meet me and obtain salvation Furthermore the Dazhidu lun saysBecause of excessive ignorance beings are reborn as insects and birds for example earthworms dung beetles crickets ants owls ducks and hawksNāgārjuna Bodhisattva said elsewhere that for excessively licentious desires a being receives the body of a duckOne also receives a ducks body for excessive ignoranceAre these two ducks bodies the same or differentAnswer Those who are reborn from excessive desire become waterfowl such as ducks and drakes those who are reborn due to ignorance are land birds such as hawks and owlsSome are seen both day and nightThose that are reborn on account of desire always fly togetherBirds that float on water together belong to this categorySome are seen at night but not seen during the dayReborn out of ignorance these creatures always roam around at nightThere are two kinds of owlsthose who are reborn from desire are hawk owls they are seen during the day and not at nightThose who are reborn from ignorance are horned owls they are seen at night and not during the dayFurthermore the Chang ahan jing and the Zeng ahan jing say There are four kinds of garuḍa birdsthose born from an egg from a womb from moisture and through spontaneous generationThey all previously generously made offeringsBecause their minds were lofty they fly high in the sky but they tormented sentient beings and their minds became full of anger and pride and so they were born among these birdsThey have a garland made of wishfulfilling jewels and so they can transform themselves in ten thousand ways and their every need is metTheir bodies are forty miles in height and their clothes are eighty miles in widthThey weigh two and half ouncesFor physical food they eat turtles and crocodiles NoteThe Niepan jing Tb Tc says that they can eat and digest all kinds of fish gold and silver and so forth The only exception is vajra To increase the pleasure of their sense of touch they wash their clothesThey also marrytwo bodies touch each other and form yin and yangTheir life spans are one world age though some are shorterOn the northern shore of the great ocean is a tree called JiuluozhenmaIts height is one hundred yojanas and its shade extends fifty yojanasTo the east of the tree is the palace for the eggborn dragons and the palace for the eggborn garuḍasTo the south of the tree is the palace for the wombborn dragons and the palace for the wombborn garuḍasTo the west of the tree is the palace for the moistureborn dragons and the palace for the moistureborn garuḍasTo the north of the tree is the palace for dragons born through spontaneous generation and the palace for garuḍas born through spontaneous generationEach of these palaces is six thousand yojanas long and wideEach is decorated as described aboveWhen an eggborn garuḍa flies down to the ocean it hits the water with its wings and the water opens up to a depth of two hundred yojanasThe garuḍa captures eggborn dragons and eats them freely The Huayan jing ref Dazhidu lun Tb saysThis bird eats dragons if the wind that it stirs with its wings goes into human eyes it blinds them at once therefore this bird does not appear among humans as it fears damaging human eyes The cases of wombborn and moistureborn garuḍas and those born through spontaneous generation are similar The Niepan jing Tc Ta says that the only creature garuḍas cannot eat are those that have received the Three Refuges There was a dragon who was receiving the eight precepts on an important day of fasting that occurs once every six yearsAt that time a garuḍa wished to eat it and carried the dragon in its beak to the top of a great iron tree north of Mount SumeruThe tree was one hundred and sixty thousand miles in heightWhen the garuḍa looked for the dragons tail he could not find itThe bird listened to the teaching and also received the five preceptsFurthermore the Guanfo sanmei jing saysThe king of the garuḍas named Zhengyin was happy and lived free among numerous species of birdsIn this world he ate one dragon king and five hundred small dragons each day In all of the four continents surrounding Mount Sumeru he ate the same number of dragons every dayHe toured around the continents eating every day and started all over again the next dayAfter eight thousand years the sign of death appeared and many dragons spat out poison The garuḍa could not eat Hungry and afraid it found no peace and came to Vajra MountainThe garuḍa went straight downward from Vajra Mountain and from the edge of a large body of water proceeded to the edge of a circle of windIt was blown by the wind back up to Vajra Mountain This was repeated seven times and then the garuḍa diedThe poison that the bird had eaten caused the ten jewel mountains to all catch fire at the same timeThe dragon king Nanda feared that they might burn down Vajra Mountain so he caused torrential rainfall with raindrops as big as the axle of a chariotThe flesh of the dead garuḍa completely disappeared and only its mind remainedIt went downward and returned seven times and then it rested on Vajra Mountain as beforeThe dragon king Nanda picked it up and treated it as if it were a clear jewelThe universal monarch obtained it and treated it as a wishfulfilling jewelIf a person contemplates the Buddha his mind becomes like this garuḍas mindFurthermore the Loutan jing and the Chang ahan jing sayThere are four kinds of dragonsAll of them had previously been full of anger with dishonest and perverse minds but they later performed a great act of giving as a consequence of which they received their present bodies Due to this merit of giving their palaces are made of seven jewelsThe location of these palaces is as described above in the section on garuḍas The dragons are forty miles in height and their clothes are forty miles long eighty miles wide and weigh two and half ouncesThey have full command of supernatural powersThey eat and drink food of a hundred flavorsAfter they eat the last mouthful of food they turn into frogsIf they teach their attendants causing them to make the intention to pursue the religious path and make offerings to monks and if they let the dragons make offerings to monks the sand does not fall over them and they are free from many afflictionsThey can also transform themselves into snakes and then they do not encounter frogs nor garuḍas They eat turtles and crocodiles for physical foodThey wash their clothes to increase the pleasure of the tactile senseThey also marrytwo bodies touch each other and form yin and yangTheir life span is one kalpa though some have shorter life spansThey can avoid being eaten by garuḍasThere are sixteen kinds of dragons Sāgara Nanda Upananda Elā pattra Dhṛtarāṣṭra Shanjian Alu Qiejuluo  Qiepiluo Apalāla Qienou Quqienou Anavatapta Supratiṣṭhita Yuoshanqiebotou and TakṣakaThe Loutan jing Tbb and the Huayan jing refChang ahan jing Tb say The dragon king Sāgara lives at the bottom of the ocean to the north of Mount SumeruHis palace is seven thousand yojanas long and wide and made of seven jewelsIt is surrounded by seven walls which are decorated with balustrades covering them like a netIn the palace garden groves and bathing pool many birds sing in harmonyThe palace has golden walls and silver gatesEach gate is two thousand four hundred miles in height and two thousand two hundred miles wideThey are beautifully painted in wonderful colors and constantly guarded by five hundred demons and godsThere it rains according to the dragon kings wishesOrdinary dragons cannot reach the palace of the dragon king nor stay thereThe tide from the palace flows into the oceanIts color is that of lapis lazuliThe Hailongwang jing says The dragon king said to the Buddha From the beginning of the world age I have lived in the great oceanFrom the time of Krakucchanda Buddha there have not been many wives for me nor many children born to me in the oceanYet there are many ocean dragons now The Buddha told the dragon king When someone leaves the householders life following the Buddhas teaching and breaks the precepts but does not abandon the correct views he does not fall into hellWhen such a person ends his life span he is reborn among dragons The Buddha told the dragon king At the time of Krakucchanda Buddha nine billion eight hundred million lay followers renounced the householders lifeThose who broke the precepts were all reborn among dragonsAt the time of Kanakamuni Buddha eight billion lay followers renounced the householders lifeThose who broke the precepts and indulged in their whims without restraint were all reborn among dragons when their lives endedAt the time of Jiashe Buddha six billion four hundred million lay followers renounced the householders lifeThose who violated the precepts were all reborn among dragonsDuring my lifetime ninetynine billion lay followers will renounce the householders lifeThose who fight and revile the scriptures and precepts will be reborn among dragons after their death Those who have committed these crimes in the past have for this reason already been reborn in the great oceanThis is the reason why there are countless numbers of dragons in the great oceanAfter my death many lay devotees will violate the precepts and will either be reborn among dragons or fall into hellFurthermore the Senghu jing saysAt that time the Worldhonored One told the monk Senghu  You saw the dragon king in the great oceanHaving received a dragons body with fangs shells fins and horns his appearance is fearsomeHe is unapproachable because of his bad smell and his filthinessBecause he has been born as an animal he cannot practice the teaching of renouncing the householders lifeHe cannot escape being eaten by the king of garuḍasDragons sleep a lot by natureThere are five occasions in which a dragon cannot hide itselfwhen it is born when it dies when it performs sexual acts when it is angry and when it sleepsThere are also four poisonous flaws because of which he cannot act according to the correct teaching Because of the flaw of poisonous speech he cannot live according to the teachingIf he speaks and someone hears it the one who heard him speak is harmedBecause of the flaw of poisonous appearance he cannot live according to the teachingIf someone sees his body he will necessarily harm the one who saw himBecause of the flaw of poisonous breath he cannot live according to the teachingIf he breathes upon someone the one his breath touches is harmedBecause of the flaw of poisonous touch he cannot live according to the teachingIf someone touches him the one who touches him is harmed The Pusa chutai jing saysThe Buddha told Zhiji Bodhisattva Once for a period of innumerable world ages I was a king of the garuḍasMy palace back garden and bathing pool were all made of seven jewelsI felt free at heart just like a universal monarchI could go into the ocean and look for dragons for foodAt that time in that ocean there was a dragon that had been born through transformationOn days of fasting it upheld the eight preceptsAt that time the kings of the garuḍas were eight thousand yojanas in lengthTheir right and left wings were each four hundred yojanas longI hit the ocean with my wings in order to seize a dragonBefore the wave ended and the water came back together I flew out holding the dragon in my beakWhen garuḍas eat a dragon they swallow it tail firstI then proceeded to the great iron tree north of Mount Sumeru sixty thousand miles in heightHaving arrived there I wished to eat the dragon I had caught and looked for its tail but could not find itOne day and night later on the next day the dragon showed its tail for the first time and said to me I am a dragon born through transformationIf I fail to uphold the teaching of the eight precepts on fasting days you will immediately perish When I heard this I repented and said The power of the Buddha is very difficult to fathomI have a palace not far from hereGo there with me and let us enjoy ourselves The dragon then followed me to my palace and looking upon it said Now these dependents of yours have not heard the Tathāgatas teaching of the eight precepts for fasting daysLet me instruct them on the precepts and ritesThen when their life spans are finished they can be reborn among humans Then the dragon read aloud all the teachings of the eight precepts and he preached the following verses at my palace I am a dragon prince I cultivated the Buddhas doctrine for seven thousand world ages I had a mind that was as sharp as a needle that can pierce the leaves of a treeBut I broke a precept and was reborn in the body of a dragon My palace is inside the ocean It is also made of seven jewels gems and crystal clear moonstones and gold and silver You may follow me there and observe the cultivation of Buddhas teaching And further increase the foundation of good deeds The Buddhas compassion extends everywhereAt that time the birds heard the dragons preaching and received the instruction of the eight precepts for fasting daysThey spoke out spontaneously From now on until the end of this life span we will refrain from killing as the Buddha taught The dependents of the garuḍa received the Three Refuges and followed the dragon to the ocean palaceThere was a stupa of seven jewels in which the teachings of the buddhas were hiddenThere was also a box of seven jewels filled with Buddhist scripturesPeople brought offerings as in heavenThe dragon said to the garuḍa I have received the body of a dragon and my life span in this body lasting many world ages has not yet been exhaustedI have not yet committed killing which would disturb my nature as a being who lives in water At that time the male and female dragons achieved understandingAfter their life spans were completed they all were reborn in the land of Amitābha Buddha According to the scriptures there exist fortunate dragonsDue to their karmic retribution all pleasures are available to themwives concubines and performing girls clothing food and drink elephants horses and the seven precious objects All these are availableThey enjoy leisurely pleasure at will to a much greater degree than do humansAlso in the six heavens of desire there are birds and animals and they enjoy pleasures at willOn the other hand there are dragons that have not been greatly blessed with fortuneEvery day they are exposed to hot sands and small insects bite themAmong humans animals are whipped forced to carry light and heavy burdens and made to run quickly There is no freedom for themThey live in the water on land or in the sky but as with insufficient water and grass they fight and harm each otherAgain in the Iron Surrounding Mountains animals of two realms permanently live together in darkness subject to pain without relief and they do not enjoy any pleasure even for a brief momentWe cannot describe their pain in detailAccording to the scriptures people love and treasure dragons supernatural horses phoenixes peacocks parrots mountain and day pheasants people hate to see and are unhappy to hear the sounds of monkeys mountain dogs wolves tigers singlehorn water buffaloes venomous and nonvenomous snakes owls and hawksIt is difficult to exhaustively list and describe the good and bad appearances of all creaturesWe know whether creatures are noble or ignobleWe cannot describe them here in detail Miracle Stories In the Wei dynasty  a monster appeared during the Huangchu period  A monster called Jiaguo appeared in the mountains of the Shu region A bird monster appeared in the mountains of the Yue regionA sheep monster appeared in Ji Huanzis well During the Jin dynasty a dog monster appeared in the grounds of Huai Yaos house A dog monster appeared during the time of Yi Xin Monsters were born between human beings and animals according to the Record of the Western RegionsDuring the Huangchu period of the Wei dynasty a man was traveling at night on a horse in an area of small hillsHe saw an animal the size of a rabbit in the middle of the roadIts eyes were like mirrorsIt had jumped over a bank and now blocked the horses passage preventing it from going aheadSurprised and frightened the man fell off the horseThe specter then seized him and the man faintedAfter a while he revivedWhen he revived the specter had departed and he did not know where it had goneThereupon he mounted his horse and traveled on for several miles until he met another manAfter exchanging greetings the first man described the strange event that had happened to him and said that he was very happy to have found some companyThe second man said I am also traveling alone I am happy beyond words to be able to provide company for youYou should go quickly ahead on your horseI will follow behind So the two men traveled togetherThe second man asked What did the thing that frightened you look like The first man answered Its body was like a rabbit and its eyes were like mirrorsIt was very ugly His traveling companion said Just look back at me The first man looked back and saw that was again the same specter which then jumped on the horse the man fell on the ground and fainted out of fearThe mans family found it strange that his horse came back alone so they went out looking for himThey found him on the road After the night had passed he regained consciousness and described his experiences as aboveOn a high mountain in the southwest region of Shu is a creature similar to a monkeyIt is seven feet tall and can walk like a human being called Jiaguo is good at running and chasing peopleIt is also called Mahua and sometimes it is called JueyuanThis creature hides on the road When an adult woman passes by the creature seizes her and takes her away People can never find where the abducted person has been takenWhen someone passes by this creature it pulls the person in with a long rope and no one can escape itThis creature can distinguish men from women by smell it takes women but does not touch menWhen the creature gets a woman it starts a family with her If the woman is childless she is not allowed to return for the rest of her lifeAfter ten years her appearance changes and she resembles the creatureHer mind is also disturbed and she does not wish to returnIf the woman has a child she is sent back home with the childThe baby always looks humanIf she does not raise the child the mother dies immediatelyFor this reason captured women are afraid and do not dare to abandon the children they have with the creatureWhen the children grow up they look no different from any human beingThey all have the surname of YangTherefore now in the southwest region of Shu there are many people with the surname Yang and they are all descendants of Jiaguo or MahuaDeep in mountains in the land of Yue there is a bird about the size of a pigeon blue in color called the zhi birdIt cuts a hole in a big tree and makes a nest that resembles a fiveor sixgallon vessel and with an entrance that is several inches in diameterThe nest is decorated all over with clay with red and white sections The nest looks like a shooting target made of animal skinWhen woodcutters see a tree with such a nest they flee from itSometimes in the dark of night someone does not see the birdThe bird also knows that the person has not seen it and calls out Oh how extraordinaryClimb upClimb up tomorrow Oh how extraordinaryClimb downClimb down tomorrow Even if the zhi bird does not let the person leave and talks and laughs like a human being one should never cut down the treeIf an impure and defiled person comes to the place a tiger appears and guards the area through the nightIf the person does not leave the tiger will attack and hurt themIf you were to look at this bird during the day its form is that of an ordinary birdListening to it at night the sound is also that of an ordinary birdWhen pleasureseekers arrive these creatures take on human form three feet in height harvest crabs from a creek and roast them at the newcomers fireThe people cannot touch the creaturesThe people of Yue call these birds the ancestors of the priests in the Yue regionJi Huanzi dug a well and obtained an earthenware pot which contained a yangma He asked Confucius I dug a well and obtained a dogWhat does this mean Confucius said From what I have heard it should have been a sheepI heard that the spirits of wood and stones are called quqi and wangliang  the spirit in the water is longmang  and the spirit in the ground is called biyang The Xiading zhi says that the water monster Wangxiang looks like a threeyearold child its eyes are red it is black in color it has large ears long arms and red nailsIf you catch this creature you can eat itThe Wangzi says The spirit of wood is floating light the spirit of metal is clear brilliance During the Yuangang period of the Jin dynasty  in Huai Yaos house in the Lou district of Wu Commandery the sound of puppies was suddenly heardThe place over the sound had a small hole like a hole made by an earthwormYao poked into the hole with a stickThe stick went in for several feet and then struck somethingYao then dug up the place and found one male and one female puppyTheir eyes had not yet openedTheir size was that of ordinary dogsYao fed the dogs and they ateNeighbors all came to see the dogsAn elder said These dogs are called Xi dogsIf one obtains them his family will prosper Because their eyes had not opened Yao put the puppies back and covered the surface of the ground with soil patting it down so that the spot was flatWhen Yao looked for the place after a while there was no hole and he could not find its exact locationFor many years there was no particular fortune or misfortune in Yaos familyDuring the Daxing period  in the government office of Wu Commandery two animals similar to the two dogs described above were foundAfter that the governor Zhang Mao was killed by the soldiers of WuxingThe Shizi says There is a dog in the groundThe dog is called Ground WolfThere is a man in the groundThe man is called No Harm The Xiading zhi says If one digs the ground and obtains a dog the dog is called Gu if one digs the ground and obtains a pig the pig is called Xie if one digs the ground and obtains a man the man is called Ju Ju is the same as No Harm mentioned aboveAll these are natural creatures we should not call them spirits or treat them as if they were monstersThe dogs in the ground described here have been called by names other than Ground Wolf but their substance is one and sameThe book Wanbi by the Prince of Huainan says The liver of the one thousandyearold sheep becomes the minister of the earth  if a toad obtains gu grass at that time the toad becomes a quail These are all the products of the transformation of material substance Cosmic responses cause these confusing phenomenaAn old woman of the Gaoxin clan lived in a kings palaceShe suffered from an ear disease and a doctor later treated her digging out a worm the size of a silk cocoon from her earAfter the lady left the doctor placed the worm inside a gourdshaped fence and covered it with a bowlSuddenly the worm became a dog with a pattern of five colorsTherefore the people called the dog Panhu  and kept itAt that time the barbarous people called Wu were very powerful and frequently invaded the border regionThe king sent his generals against the invaders but they could not achieve victory and capture the barbariansSo the king announced publicly that if some able person were to obtain the head of the general of the Wu barbarians he would be rewarded with one thousand ounces of gold a tract of land with ten thousand families and even the kings own young daughterLater Panhu came to the palace gate holding a severed human headWhen the king inspected it the head turned out to be none other than the head of the general of the Wu barbarians What should the king doAll the ministers said Panhu is an animal he should not be given the income of an official nor should he be given a wifeAlthough he has performed a meritorious service we should give him nothing The young daughter of the king heard this and said to the king The great king offered me to anyone in the realm under heavenPanhu came holding the head in his mouth having removed a harmful enemy for the sake of the stateHeaven has caused thisHow could such a deed be attributed to the intelligence of a dogThe king treats faithfulness to his words as a weighty matter The military leader treats his credibility before the people as a weighty matterYou should not renege on your promise made clearly to everyone in the realm under heaven just for the sake of the insignificant body of a young daughterThat would lead to misfortunes in the state The king was afraid and obeyed her allowing his young daughter to go with PanhuPanhu took the woman to Mount Zhongnan where the grasses and trees were dense and there were no traces of human pathsThereupon the woman removed her top robe and took on the appearance of a young servant carrying a spear with a single twisted pointFollowing Panhu she climbed the mountain entered the valley and they finally stopped at a rock caveThe king yearned for her and sent people to look for her but the winds and rains came and the peaks quaked under the dark clouds None of those who went  ever found herIn this way three years or so passed during which the woman gave birth to six sons and six daughtersAfter Panhus death their sons and daughters married each otherThey wove cloth with wood bark and dyed them with grass seedsThey liked clothing of five colors and so they cut and sewed the materials they prepared to wear as clothesAfter a while the woman returned and spoke to the kingThe king sent for the men and women who were the womans offspring and it did not rain anymoreThese people wore loose clothes spoke a foreign language and drank and ate while crouchingThey loved the mountain and hated the capital cityThe king followed their wishes and granted them famous mountains and wide marshesHe called them the Manyi barbariansManyi barbarians appear ignorant from the outside but they are intelligent within The king granted land to them again and againBecause they were endowed with an unusual substance from heaven these creatures were treated differently by the rulerThey sold the products of their fields and were exempt from government taxationAll the heads of their villages were provided with a sealThey use otter skin for their crowns and live in leisure near waterThe barbarians who presently live in the Liang Han Ba Shu Wuling Changshe and Lu Jiang regions are their descendantsThey mix different kinds of fish and meat and sing while banging on buckets and they sacrifice to Panhu regularlyThis custom is preserved even todayTherefore people say that the Jigan and Hengrun people are Panhus descendantsThe Record of the Western Regions by Dharma Master Xuanzang TThe kingdom of Siṃhala Note This is not a kingdom in India but since it is on the route to India its description is appended was originally a treasure islandThere are many rare treasures and ghosts and spirits dwell thereLater there was a king in South India whose daughter visited a neighboring state She was sent back on an auspicious day but encountered a lion on the roadHer guards abandoned her and fledThe woman was in a carriage and she accepted the fate of deathThe lion king carried her away on his backHe entered deep mountains and dark valleys catching deer and collecting fruit to provide for her needs regularlyMonths and years later the woman gave birth to a boy and a girlThey looked human in appearance but their nature was like that of animalsWhen the boy grew up his physical power matched that of carnivorous animalsWhile he was still young he displayed human intelligenceSo he asked his mother What am IMy father is a wild animal and my mother is humanAs I do not belong to one category how am I to marry The mother then told her son the events of the pastThe son said Humans and animals belong to two different categories of existenceWe must escape as soon as possible The mother said I once tried to escape but I could not succeed by myself Thereafter the son followed his lion father climbing mountains from peak to peak observing how his father roamed and rested so that he would know how to escape from himFinally when the father was away he carried his mother on his back and went to a villageThe mother said Lets be careful about the secret and not tell others about your originIf people learn our past they will despise us In the kingdom of the womans fathers the government was no longer ruled by her family and the ancestral shrine had been destroyedSo they stayed with a villagerPeople asked them Which is your kingdom They said We originally were from this kingdom but we have been roaming around in foreign regionsTogether we a son and his mother have now returned to our home village All the people took pity on them and gave them foodWhen the lion king returned he found his lair emptyHe missed his wife and child and became angrySo he went out into the mountains and valleys roaming around the villages and uttering frightening roarsHe attacked people and animals with great crueltyWhen the villagers were away from their village and let down their guard he caught and killed themOnly when they struck drums and blew conch shells carried arrows on their backs and held shields and traveled in groups could they avoid being harmedThe king feared that his humane government was being disrupted and undisciplined hunters wanted to capture the lionThe king himself led four divisions of soldiers and tried many different strategies laying ambushes in forests and bushes and traveling across mountains and valleysYet when the lion roared both people and animals fled in fearBecause he could not capture the lion the king made an announcementWhoever catches the lion and removes this pest from the kingdom will be heavily rewarded and honored with flags When the son heard the kings announcement he said to his mother We have suffered from hunger and cold for a long time I should respond to the announcementIf I can catch the lion I can provide comfort for you The mother said What you say is not rightIf it is that lion even if it is an animal it is still your fatherHow can you commit the eternal sin of patricide because of lifes hardships The son said Humans and animals belong to different species How could there be ceremonial conduct and righteousness in this case We have already disobeyed himWhy should we change our minds Thereupon he drew a dagger and went out to respond to the announcementAt this time thousands of soldiers and horsemen were gathering together like clouds or fogThe lion huddled in the forest and nobody dared to approach himBecause the lion was his former father however the son could approach himThe lion became affectionate and forgot his angerThereupon the son thrust the dagger into the lions bellyThe lion still loving and free from anger and with his belly cut open and bearing his pain diedThe king said Who is this manHow extraordinary is this He tempted him with rewards and threatened him with horrifying punishmentThereupon the son described the details of his circumstances The king said This amounts to the crime of patricide You went so far as to kill your father How much more willing would you be to kill those who are not your parentsAnimals are difficult to tame and they are easily affected by evil emotions The king turned to the others and said But this man has also performed the highly meritorious service of removing the lion that was harming everyones livesHe has committed a crime by terminating his fathers lifeReward him greatly to match his serviceExile him afar as punishment for his crimeThen we shall not counter the law of the state and at the same time we are not reversing my earlier promise of a reward On hearing these words the people filled two boats with a great deal of food and suppliesThe mother remained in the country and was provided generously with rewardsThe son and the daughter set off in separate boats drifting along with the wavesThe boat carrying the son floated into the ocean and reached the treasure island Seeing plentiful rare types of jade the son settled thereLater a merchant traveling to gather treasures also reached this islandThe son killed the merchant and kept his children and womenThus the sons descendants increased and eventually they established the ranks of ruler and ministers to maintain hierarchical orderThey linked the cities and built villages forming a feudal territoryBecause their ancestor had captured a lion this ancestral feat was used as the name of the stateThe daughters boat drifted to PārṣaThere bewitched by spirits she gave birth and raised numerous daughtersThe consequence of this is the current Western Country of Big WomenFor these reasons the people of Lion Country are dark and base in appearance with square jaws and large foreheadsThey have a violent temperament and are resistant to poisoningThis is all because they inherited something of animal natureIt is also said that these people are often courageous and strongIn the Buddhist records if one follows the Qishi jing in the past five hundred female demons lived within an iron city on this treasure islandFurthermore  in a large dragon pond in front of the divine shrine to the north of the city at the eastern border of the state of Kucha dragons transformed their appearance and mated with maresThis led to the birth of the hybrid dragon horseThey were then tamed and riddenFor this reason this state produced many good horsesWe heard the following story from an early gazetteerNot too long ago there was a king called Suvarṇapuṣpa who established an enlightened government and who communed with and rode a dragonWhen the king wished to go underground he touched the dragons ear with his whipIt then disappeared into hidden placesThe city does not have wells even now so people used the water of the dragon pondThe dragon changed his appearance into that of a human being and mated with many womenThe children born from this union were brave and could run as fast as horsesThrough this contamination all of the people in this state came to have the dragon seedBeing so strong they terrified others and they did not honor the kings orderThereupon the king plotted and brought in some Turks to murder themBoth young and old were massacred and there were no survivorsTheir city is now deserted and no smoke which would indicate human communities is ever seen to rise from thereCompilers CommentI have frequently heard ignorant people of wrong views say There is a difference between noble and humble humans and animals differ from each otherHow could a human being become an animal or an animal a human beingThe teaching of the Buddha is empty and false not based on reality Why do you hold on to ignorant views and not believe the sayings of the BuddhaThe above examples are described in detail in secular scriptures and historiesIf you were to see the phenomenon with your own eyes would you still disbelieve itIf ones conduct is compassionate and patient then the outcome will be exactly like that of Zhi Prince of Chu whose chronic diseases were all curedOr it will be like the case of the Duke of Song even though he did not pray the inauspicious stars disappeared in the eveningIf ones conduct is evil then the consequence is illustrated by events such as the following The Han people poisoned Ruyi Prince of Zhao and a blue dog appeared the Qi people murdered Pengsheng and the wild boar became the curseEven shortlived consequences illustrate the principleHow much more clearly does the relationship between ones conduct as cause and good and evil karmic results prove the truthfulness of the principle sentient beings rise and fall among different realms of existence and receive punishments through many eonsThe Six Realms of Rebirth Introduction Explanation of the Name Karmic Retribution Duration The Hell Kings The City of the King of Hell Karmic Causes  and Warning Signs Now to come to the hells The hell realms are dark and difficult and the pain creatures suffer there is acute and distressingForests of swords rise as high as the sun the peaks of mountains of swords merge with the sky aboveBoiling cauldrons raise waves cauldrons of fire go up in flamesIron city walls enclose the hells during the day copper pillars glimmer dully during the nightThese places are filled with frightened sinners suffering great pain screaming and shoutingPrison guards with the heads of oxen malicious eyes and frightful fangs pierce the torsos of the sinners and pound their livers and heartsFiercely burning flames lap at the sinners bodies and destroy their skin completelySome sinners have their heads and legs ground up and their spirits cookedTheir gall bladders are split in pieces and their intestines are pulled out Their slaughtered bodies are cut up into pieces a delicious mealThe pain that sinners suffer in hell is beyond words and thoughtThus the sinners bob up and down in cauldrons of boiling water they look up and down in fear and despair inside furnaces of burning coalTheir flesh is pierced by spears and swords their bones are crushed and left at the side of other old corpsesHow could anyone sleep peacefully on an iron bedHow could one get used to staying around copper pillars for a long timeBecause the fire gets into their eyes no tears flow when they cry because smoke gets into their mouths they utter no sound when they screamWhen someone is in such a place very small things can give reliefif he encounters a warm wind in the midst of cold ice or if he senses cool air in the midst of a coal fire he is immediately pleased and happySomeone in Avīci Hell suffers excessive bodily painThe iron wall there is eighty thousand yojanas long and wideExplosive sounds cause the sinner to shake foulsmelling smoke rises up everywhereThe sinner is like a fish in a frying pan his fat and blood are burned and scorchedThere are no temporary pleasures here everything someone touches gives painHe cannot move or turn around he is bound up tightly in chainsHe is moved about in every directionwhen the fire that destroys the world at the end of the world age burns in one place he is moved to another place when the world age ends in the second place he is returned to the first placeCycling in this manner he passes through an infinite number of world agesIf a person makes the vow to cultivate the Buddhist Way and repents all his past evil deeds then at the moment he makes this vow the boiling water in the cauldron becomes clear and pure and the cauldron turns into a flower pondThe thick smoke rising from the coal furnace becomes an umbrella of incense smokeThe tall sword trees become a jade forestThe mountains covered with knives become Vulture PeakThe copper pillars change their color and the banner of the Dharma is raised up foreverSteel nets change forms and a vision of the Pure Land appearsThe oxheaded jail guards throw away their swords and take the Three RefugesThe soldiers in the jail put down their whips and instead take up the five preceptsFamilies in conflict are reconciled peacefully and no longer display angry facesCreditors are satisfied and there is no one in distressThe sojourner in these hells who has lost his head and neck becomes whole again because of this changeOne whose bones were crushed into powder and whose muscles were torn into pieces is restored to his original form due to the vowQuestionWhy is this realm called hell AnswerAccording to the Lishi apitan lun  its Sanskrit name is niraya there is no playful pleasure no joy no path to liberation and no meritorious deeds and a creature is reborn there because he has not stopped committing evil deedsAnother explanation is that this realm is the most inferior one in the realm of desireIt is called the negative realmFor this reason hell is called nirayaAccording to the Posha lun  the term hell means not free The sinners there are controlled by the officials of hell and are not freeTherefore that place is called hellThe term hell also means not able to love and enjoy This is why the place is called hellDi in the Chinese word for hell diyu means bottom Hell is located at the absolute bottom of all thingsThis is why the place is described as the bottomYu means room The sinners are confined in a room and have no freedomFor this reason hell is called diyuFurthermore the term for hell in Sanskrit is nir which marks negationThere is no way of improving or benefiting ones present and future lives when one is in jailTherefore hell is described as negationQuestion There are many kinds of hellsSome are in the ground some are above ground and some are located in the skyWhy are they all called diyu AnswerAccording to old translations diyu means a narrow space that does not have access to the ground and the skyAccording to the new translation of scriptures and treatises however the Sanskrit term for hell is rendered as naraka This term refers to all places where human beings suffer excessive painThis is why it is appropriate to call hell narakaFor this reason the new Posha lun says QuestionWhy is this realm called narakaAnswer There sentient beings do not have happiness love tastes material benefits or joyTherefore it is called narakaAnother view is that sinners have committed excessively violent evil deeds of body speech and mind before they go there so they go there and continue to stay thereThis is why it is called narakaAnother view is that sinners go to that realm by falling into itThis is the reason for calling it narakaThe following verse illustrates this pointSinners fall into hell With their feet up and heads down Because they reviled holy men Who were happily and quietly practicing ascetic deedsAnother view explains that nara means man and ka means evil Evil people are born thereThis is why the realm is called naraka QuestionWhy is the lowest and greatest among all the hells called No Interruption Hell Answer Sinners in that hell suffer pain constantlyThere are no moments of pleasure interrupting the painTherefore it is called No Interruption QuestionIn other hells sinners cannot enjoy singing dancing drinking or eating Yet it could be thought that they might have these pleasures as the morally neutral fruit of karmic retribution If they had such pleasures in the other hells that would have constituted interruptions but as a matter of fact denizens of those other hells do not have any interruptions in them eitherWhy are the other hells also not called No Interruption AnswerAlthough in the other hells there are no yishu pleasures or the karmic retribution of the morally neutral fruit of acts performed in previous lives  there are still the dengliu pleasures or karmic retribution that produces the same effect continually from passing causesAs the Shishe lun says In Equally Reviving Hell cool breezes sometimes blow and restore the flesh and bloodSometimes there is a voice saying denghuo and those sentient beings are suddenly revived When the flesh and blood are thus restored and sentient beings are revived this hell brings pleasure and joy so there is an interruption of pain and sufferingThus this hell is not called No InterruptionThe new Posha lun saysQuestionWhere are the hells Answer They are mostly below this world Question Why are they said to be securely standingAnswerAccording to one view if you go forty thousand yojanas under our continent  you will reach the base of No Interruption HellThis hell is twenty thousand yojanas high and twenty thousand yojanas wide and deepLocated in the nineteen thousand yojanas above this hell are the other seven hells called securely standingfirst is the Hell of Extreme Heat above that is the Hell of Heat above that the Great Hell of Screaming above that the Hell of Screaming above that the Hell of Gathered Multitude above that the Hell of Black Rope and above that the Equally Reviving HellEach of these hells is ten thousand yojanas wide and deepAbove these hells there remains a space of one thousand yojanasFive hundred yojanas of this space is white clay and the other five hundred yojanas is soilAccording to another view under the soil there is No Interruption Hell at the centerThe other seven hells surround it in the same way that villages surround a great city todayQuestionIf so how does this accord with what the Shishe lun saysThis text says that this world is six thousand yojanas or three and a half yojanas in peripheryEach hell is very largeHow can they all be contained underneath the continent of JambudvīpaAnswerThis world is narrow at the top and wide at the bottom shaped like a pile of grain so it can contain all these hells at the bottomThus the scripture says that just as when one enters any of the four seas from the shore the sea becomes deeper as one goes in further so each of the hells has sixteen spheres of increasing intensityNamely each hell has four gates and outside each gate are four spheres of increasing intensityFirst there is the sphere of buried embers where there are kneedeep embers buried in ashSecond there is the sphere of corpses and excrement which is filled with corpses and excrementThird there is the sphere of sharp swordsIn this sphere there are three kinds of difficultiesThe first is a road of sword blades where swords are spread with the blade tips pointing upward to form a roadThe second is a forest of sword leavesHere all the leaves are as sharp as the blades of swordsThe third is the forest of steel needles made of sixteeninchlong sharp steel needlesAlthough these three kinds  such as the road of sword blades and so on are distinct they form part of the same steel forest Therefore they are contained in the same sphereFourth there is the sphere of dangerous waterThis sphere is filled with hot saltwaterTogether with the original hell there are seventeen spheresThus the eight great hells with their accompanying spheres add up to one hundred and thirtysix placesTherefore the scripture says There are one hundred and thirtysix narakas Thus the Chang ahan jing saysThere are altogether eight great hellsEach of these eight great hells has sixteen smaller hells surrounding itThis configuration is similar to that of the four realms under heaven which is surrounded by eighty thousand realms under heavenBeyond these eighty thousand realms under heaven is the great oceanBeyond the ocean is Great Vajra Mountain Beyond this mountain is another mountain also called Vajra The Loutan jing calls the latter Great Iron Ring Mountain Between these two mountains are the deities of the sun and moon but their light does not shine forthThe eight great hells are Illusory Thought Hell Black Rope Hell Crushing Hell Screaming and Howling Hell Loud Screaming and Howling Hell Roasting Hell Intense Roasting Hell and No Interruption HellThe Loutan jing and other scriptures give different names for the hells due to differences in translation The general meanings of the differing translations of the names of the hells are the same The sixteen subsections of the first Illusory Thought Hell are as followsIn this hell sentient beings grow iron claws and when they become angry at each other they scratch at each other Where they touch the bodies of their opponents the flesh is torn off and the victims then think that they have diedThis is why this hell is called Illusory Thought HellThen the sentient beings in this hell conceive the thought of harming each otherThey grab swords and knives and cut and pierce each otherTheir skin splits and their flesh is cut into pieces their bodies collapse into a pile on the groundThey then think that they have died but cold breezes blow and they subsequently reviveThen they think to themselves Now that I have revived the long period of punishment is over I am going to leave Illusory Thought Hell They fearfully cry out for helpSuddenly without realizing what is happening they arrive at Black Sand HellHot winds rise violently and blow hot black sandWhen the sand touches their bodies it sticks to them burning their skin and penetrating to their bonesA flame is ignited and the fire spreads all over their bodies which become singedYet the punishment is not over and these sinners are purposely not allowed to die After they have suffered for a long time they leave Black Sand Hell and reach Boiling Excrement HellHere boiling excrement and iron balls appear everywhere in front of them advancing quickly toward themIf they touch an iron ball it singes their hands and bodyIf they take it into their mouth everything is burned as it passes from their throat to their stomachThere are insects with iron mouths in this hell and these insects eat their flesh until they reach the bone marrowThis is infinitely painful Yet the punishment is not over and the sinners are not allowed to dieAfter they have suffered for a long time they leave Boiling Excrement Hell and reach Iron Nail HellThe jailors of this hell hit them and make them lie facedown on a hot iron bedStretching their bodies out on the bed the jailors then nail them down through their hands and feetThe jailors put five hundred nails all over their bodiesThey are in great pain and scream but they still do not dieAfter they have suffered for a long time they leave Iron Nail Hell and reach Hunger Hell of IronThe jailors in this hell put them on a hot iron bed and pour melted copper into their mouths and as the copper flows from mouth to stomach it burns everything as it goes downYet their remaining sins are not exhausted and they do not dieAfter they have suffered for a long time they leave Hunger Hell and reach Thirst HellThere they are placed on a hot iron bed and jailors put hot iron balls in their mouths which burn their lips and tongues As the iron balls go down to their stomachs they burn everythingThe sinners cry and scream in great painAfter they have suffered for a long time they leave Thirst Hell and reach Copper Cauldron HellJailors glare at them with angry eyes and seizing them by the legs they throw them into a cauldronAs the water in the cauldron boils they bob up and down in the water and their bodies are cooked until they are about to fall apartThey experience all kinds of pain simultaneously but purposely they are not allowed to dieAfter they have suffered for a long time they leave Copper Cauldron Hell and reach Many Cauldrons HellJailors seize them by the legs and throw them into a cauldronAs the water in the cauldron boils they bob up and down in the water and their bodies are cooked until they are about to fall apartThen a jailor picks them up with an iron hook and throws them into another cauldronThey cry and scream in great pain but purposely they are not allowed to dieAfter they have suffered for a long time they leave Many Cauldrons Hell and reach Stone Mill HellJailors seize them and hit them and then they place them on a heated stoneThey spread out their arms and legs and press on their bodies with another large heated stoneThen they turn the top stone and grind up their bodies crushing the bones and flesh into small piecesThe pain is excruciating yet they purposely are not allowed to dieAfter they have suffered for a long time they leave Stone Mill Hell and reach Pus and Blood Hell Here there is boiling pus and blood everywhere and as the sinners run from east to west across the blood and pus it covers their bodiesTheir faces are burned and become shapelessThey also eat the pus and blood and as they swallow it they experience unbearable pain Yet purposely they are not allowed to dieAfter they have suffered for a long time they leave Pus and Blood Hell and reach Measuring Fire HellThere is a huge fire and the violent flames press toward themThey must take up a hot iron measuring vessel to measure the size of the fireAs they do this the fire burns their bodies all over and the heat and pain cause excessive sufferingThey scream and cry aloud yet they purposely are not allowed to dieAfter they have suffered for a long time they leave Measuring Fire Hell and reach the Ash RiverThe river of hot ash is five hundred yojanas wide and deepThe water mixed with hot ash boils up and a foul smell permeates everywhereThe sound the river makes is frighteningEverywhere from the bottom to the top of this hell there are iron spikes placed both vertically and horizontallyOn the banks of Ash River is the Sword ForestThe branches flowers and fruits of the trees in this forest are all made of knives and swordsThe sinners must enter the river and following the waves they bob up and down in the water as iron spikes pierce their bodiesAs their bodies are pierced blood and pus flow outThey feel pain all over their bodies yet purposely they are not allowed to dieThen they come out of the Ash River and climbing up the bank they reach the Sword ForestHere they are cut and pierced by the swords and their bodies suffer severe injuriesThere are also wild dogs and wolves that attack the sinners and eat their flesh while they are aliveWhen the sinners climb up a sword tree the sword blades on the tree are pointed downward when they climb down the sword blades are pointed upwardIf they raise their hands they are cut off when they take a step their feet are severedTheir skin and flesh fall offOnly white bones sinews and veins remain to connect the skeletons togetherThe ironbeaked bird on the sword trees pecks at the sinners heads and eats their brainsThe sinners scream in pain but purposely they are not allowed to dieThen they return to the Ash River and pushed by the current and bobbing up and down in the waves are pierced by the iron spikes in the water They feel pain all over their bodiesTheir skin and flesh are destroyed and lose their original shape pus and blood ooze outOnly their skeletons of white bones float in the waterWhen a cool breeze blows the sinners that have been reduced to skeletons immediately stand upPulled by the force of their past karma they suddenly reach Iron Ball Hell without realizing itHere there are hot iron balls and the jail guards chase them and make them grab these iron ballsTheir hands and feet are burned beyond shape their bodies rise up all aflameAll kinds of pain are simultaneously experienced yet purposely they are not allowed to dieAfter they have suffered for a long time they leave Iron Ball Hell and reach Ax HellJail guards seize the sinners and hit them they place them on a hot iron table and cut off their hands legs ears noses tongues and the rest of their bodiesThey scream in extreme pain yet they still are not allowed to dieAfter they have suffered for a long time they leave Ax Hell and reach Wild Dogs and Wolves HellHere packs of wild dogs and wolves come one after the other to attack and tear up the bodies of the sinnersTheir flesh falls off and their bones are cracked pus and blood ooze outThey feel pain all over their bodies yet they are purposely not allowed to dieAfter they have suffered for a long time they leave Wild Dogs and Wolves Hell and reach Sword Tree HellWhen the sinners enter the sword forest a violent windstorm arises and blows the sword leaves down which drop onto the bodies of the sinnersall over their heads faces and bodies there is nowhere that is not injuredThe ironbeaked bird pecks at their eyesThe sinners scream wildly in extreme pain but purposely they are not allowed to dieAfter they have suffered for a long time they leave Sword Tree Hell and reach Cold Ice Hell where icy cold winds blow over their bodies freezing them all over and their skin and flesh drop offThe sinners scream in pain and then their life endsIf ones physical bodily acts have not been good and his speech and thought are likewise not good then a sinner will fall into Illusory Thought HellThe prospect of this is so frightening that it makes the hair on ones body stand up The second great hell is Black Rope Hell  and it is surrounded by sixteen smaller hells each of which is five hundred yojanas wide and deepWhy is this great hell called Black RopeHere the jailors of hell seize the sinner beat him and place him on a hot iron bed with his body stretched outThen they stretch him with hot iron ropes and following the pattern of the ropes they cut the sinner with an ax into one hundred thousand piecesThen they saw him with a stretched iron ropeThen they hang hot iron ropes in all directions crossing each other at innumerable pointsThe jailors chase the sinner through these ropesA windstorm arises and causes the ropes to tangle around the sinners body and they burn the sinners skin and penetrate into his flesh scorching the bones and boiling the bone marrowThe sinner suffers extreme pain all over his bodyThe remaining effects of his sins from previous lives are not exhausted however so purposely he is not allowed to dieThis is the reason this hell is called Black RopeAfter the sinner has suffered for a long time he leaves Black Rope hell and reaches Black Sand Hell In this manner he goes through different hells until he reaches Cold Ice Hell where his life ends We will not describe all of the hells in detail hereThe sinner suffers great pain in the remaining sixteen hells in a manner similar to the case of Illusory Thought Hell aboveOnly the severity of the pain increasesA person falls into Black Rope Hell from entertaining evil thoughts against his parents the Buddha or arhatsThe pain one suffers in that hell is immeasurable The third great hell is Pressing and Crushing HellThis hell also has sixteen smaller hells surrounding it each of which is five hundred yojanas deep and wideWhy is it called Pressing and CrushingThere are two great rock mountains facing each other and when a person enters the space between them the mountains spontaneously come together pressing and crushing his bodyWhen the bones and flesh have been crushed and ground into small particles the mountains return to their original placesThe sinner suffers extreme pain all over his body but he is purposely not allowed to dieThere is also a huge iron elephant and its entire body is ablaze in flamesIt screams and comes running and stepping upon the sinner it then rolls on top of himThe sinners body is crushed and pus and blood ooze outThe sinner howls and wails in pain but he is purposely not allowed to dieFurthermore the jail guards seize the sinner and make him lie down on a large rock They then crush his body with another large rockOr they put him down on the ground and pound him with an iron pestleFrom head to toe the skin and flesh are crushed and ground and pus and ooze flow outHe experiences all sorts of pain and yet the remaining effects of his sins in previous lives are not exhausted so purposely he is not allowed to dieThese are the reasons this hell is called Pressing and CrushingAfter he has suffered for a long time the sinner leaves Pressing and Crushing Hell and reaches Black Sand Hell and the other hells finally arriving at Cold Ice Hell where his life endsA person falls into Pressing and Crushing Hell for committing the three kinds of evil deeds and failing to perform the three kinds of good deedsThe pain he suffers there is immeasurableThe fourth great hell is Screaming and Howling HellThis hell also has sixteen smaller hells surrounding it each five hundred yojanas long and wideWhy is this hell called Screaming and HowlingThe jailors of this hell seize the sinner and throw him into a large cauldron of boiling water and it cooks the sinnerThe pain is excruciating and the sinner cries outThen they take the sinner out of the cauldron and throw him into a large hot pan in which he is jostled back and forth as if being stirfriedAfter he has suffered for a long time the sinner leaves Screaming and Howling Hell and reaches the other hells starting with Black Sand and ending up at Cold Ice and then his life endsA person falls into Screaming and Howling hell for committing evil deeds out of anger and resentmentThe fifth great hell is Loud Screaming and Howling HellThis hell also has sixteen smaller hells surrounding it The size of this hell is the same as the earlier ones Why is this hell called Loud Screaming and HowlingThe jail guards seize the sinner and put him in a large iron potThe sinner is in the cauldron for a long time and the boiling water cooks himThe sinner is then thrown into a large iron pan and jostled back and forth over and overThe pain is excruciating and the sinner cries and screams loudlyThe remaining effects of the sins he committed in his previous lives are not exhausted however so he is purposely not allowed to die For this reason this hell is called Loud Screaming and HowlingAfter he has suffered for a long time the sinner leaves Loud Screaming and Howling Hell and after going through many hells he eventually reaches Cold Ice Hell where his life endsA person falls into Loud Screaming and Howling Hell because he held many heterodox views and was dragged around by the net of attachments and committed base actsThe sixth great hell is Roasting HellThis hell also has sixteen smaller hells surrounding it The size of this hell the same as the earlier ones Why is this hell called RoastingThe jailors of this hell seize the sinner and put him in an iron cityThe city burns glowing red both inside and outside and the sinner is roastedThey then attach him to an iron building which burns glowing red both inside and outsideThey then throw him into an iron kilnThe fire burns and the kiln glows red both inside and outside and the sinner is roastedHis skin and flesh are scorched out of shape and he experiences all sorts of painThe remaining effects of the sins he committed in his previous lives are not exhausted however and he purposely is not allowed to dieFor this reason this hell is called RoastingAfter the sinner has suffered for a long time he leaves Roasting Hell and after going through many hells he eventually reaches Cold Ice Hell where his life endsA person falls into Roasting Hell because he has roasted other sentient beings so he suffers the pain of being roasted for the duration of a period of a long nightThe seventh great hell is Intense Roasting HellThis hell also has sixteen smaller hells surrounding it The size of this hell is the same as the earlier ones Why is it called Intense RoastingIt is so called because the jail guards of this hell seize the sinner and put him in an iron city which burns glowing red both inside and outsideThe sinner is roasted his skin and flesh are scorched out of shape and he experiences pain all over his bodyThere is a large fire tunnel containing a brightly burning fireAt both ends of the tunnel is a large mountain of fireThe jail guards seize the sinner pierce him with an iron fork and put him upright into the fire and he roasts in the flames his skin and flesh scorched out of shape The remaining effects of the sins he committed in his previous lives are not exhausted however so purposely he is not allowed to dieAfter he has suffered for a long time he leaves Intense Roasting Hell and after going through many hells he reaches Cold Ice Hell where his life endsA person falls into Intense Roasting hell because he has abandoned doing deeds that produce good karma and has committed evil deedsThe eighth great hell is No Interruption This hell also has sixteen smaller hells surrounding it The size of this hell is the same as the earlier ones Why is it called AvīciThis term means that the hell continue without interruptionWhy is it said to have no interruptionThe jail guards of this hell seize the sinner and flay him from head to toeThen they bind the sinners body with strips of his own flayed skin and attach the body to a burning vehicleAs the wheels of the vehicle turn hitting the hot ground again and again the body is crushed and the skin and flesh fall offThe sinner experiences all kinds of pain yet he is purposely not allowed to dieThere is also an iron city in which fire burns from four directionsThe flames from the eastern end reach the western end and the flames from the western end reach the eastern endSimilarly the flames all reach from the southern to the northern ends and from top to bottomThe fire burns intensely and advances quickly There is no empty space that the fire does not reachThe sinner runs around from east to west  but his body is burned the skin and flesh are scorched and lose their shape and he feels sharp and excruciating painThe sinner experiences all sorts of painAfter he has been inside the city for a long time the jail guards open the gates of the cityThe sinner runs toward the gates flames coming out of all his joints but just as he is about to reach the gates they automatically closeThe remaining effects of the sins that the person committed in his previous lives have not been exhausted and for this reason he is purposely not allowed to dieFurthermore in this hell if a sinner opens his eyes to see he perceives only unpleasant formsHis ears perceive only unpleasant sounds his nose only unpleasant smells his body feels only pain and his mind generates only unpleasant thoughtsThere is not even a period of time as brief as it takes to snap ones fingers when the sinner feels no painTherefore this hell is called No InterruptionAfter the sinner has suffered for a long time he leaves No Interruption Hell and after going through the other hells he finally reaches Cold Ice Hell where his life endsA person falls into No Interruption Hell because he repeatedly committed sinful deeds that led to rebirths in inferior realmsThe punishments a sinner receives in this hell are beyond measure and descriptionThese hells are called the eight great hellsIn each of them the sinner goes through sixteen smaller hells and suffers as described aboveFurthermore the Guanfo sanmei hai jing saysAvīci Hell is eight thousand yojanas long and wideThis hell is surrounded by seven iron city walls and covered by seven layers of iron nets Seven sections divided into eighteen units surround the hellThere are also seven lines forests of swords in this hell In the four corners of this hell are four large bronze dogs forty yojanas long and wideTheir eyes are like flashes of lightning their fangs are like trees of swords their teeth are like mountains of swords their tongues are like steel daggers the fur all over their bodies is ablaze with a fierce fire emitting foulsmelling smokeThere are eighteen jail guards of this hell their mouths are like the mouths of the most hideous demonsTheir sixtyfour eyes project iron ballsDog fangs protrude from their mouths pointing upward to a distance of four yojanas above their mouthsFrom the tip of their fangs fire shoots out and spews forth burning iron carriagesThe hoops of the carriage wheels are ablaze and tongues of the fire form sharp swords and halberds which set the city of Avīci Hell on fireAs the city burns it glows red like molten copperThe jail guards of this hell have eight heads and sixtyfour horns and fire burns at the tip of their hornsThe flames turn into steel which in turn becomes a wheel of swordsThese wheels emerge one after another between the flames and fill up the city of Avīci HellThere are seven iron flags in the cityFire springs up as if it were boiling and melted iron flows everywhereOn top of the four gates are melting pots from which molten copper overflows spreading throughout the cityThere are eightyfour thousand iron dragons and snakes between divided sectionsThese creatures spit poison into all the fire and their bodies fill the entire cityThey make howling sounds like thunder and lightning in the sky and large iron balls rain downThere are five hundred demons and fifty billion insectsFire pours from the heads of eightyfour thousand creatures like rain and fills up Avīci HellWhen the insects descend a ferocious fire blazes brilliantly illuminating eightyfour thousand yojanas above this hellAbove Avīci Hell is a great ocean and the water pours down into the hell in drops as large as chariot axles that fill the Avīci fortressWhen someone who has killed his father harmed his mother or insulted the six classes of close relatives dies the bronze dogs transform themselves into eighteen carriages with jeweled tops and the flames in this hell become jade womenWhen he sees these things from a distance he is delighted and wants to go thereAs the wind breaks up the corpse the sinner feels extremely cold and says I should go get the fire on the carriages When the sinner goes to a carriage the burning fire explodes and his life ends inside the golden carriageThe creatures that he saw as jade women earlier all take up iron axes and cut up his bodyThe sinner immediately falls directly into Avīci Hell falling like a spinning wheel of fire from the highest section of the hell down to the lowestWhen his body reaches the lowest section the bronze dogs howl loudly bite into the bones and eat the bone marrowA hell demon picks up an iron fork and pierces the head of the sinner to pull him upThe flames covering the sinners body fill up Avīci HellYama the King of Hell declares in a loud voice A stupid person fated for hellWhen you were in the world you were unfilial to your parents and immoral in other waysThis place where you have now been reborn is call Avīci Hell In this way everything unfolds and the sinner experiences great suffering that is beyond descriptionOne day and night of punishment in hell is equivalent to sixty shorter world ages in this world which is equal to one great world ageThose who have committed one of the five grave sins are punished here for five world agesThere are also sentient beings who have committed one of the four grave sinsThey may have eaten almsfood obtained from lay believers under false pretenses while holding heterodox views that revile the proper authorities and out of ignorance about causes and conditions they abandoned the study of perfect wisdom Or they have destroyed images of the Buddha in any of the ten directions Or they may have stolen monastic propertyOr they may have immorally engaged in licentious acts coercing and violating nuns who were upholding precepts of purity or sisters and other relatives committing numerous evil deedsThese peoples sins are such that they are punished just before their lives end in the following waysFor a period of eightyfour thousand great world ages they enter the eighteen eastern sections of the hell and are punished in the manner described above similarly in the southern western and northern sectionsTheir bodies fill Avīci Hell and their four limbs fill the eighteen sections of hellAvīci Hell contains eighteen smaller hells and in each of these smaller hells there are eighteen Cold Ice hells eighteen Darkness hells eighteen Heat hells eighteen Wheels of Knives hells eighteen Wheels of Swords hells eighteen Carriages on Fire hells eighteen Boiling Excrement hells eighteen Cauldrons of Boiling Water hells eighteen Ash River hells fifty billion Forest of Swords hells fifty billion Forest of Daggers hells fifty billion Copper Pillar hells fifty billion Steel Mechanism hells fifty billion Iron Net hells eighteen Iron Cave hells eighteen Iron Ball hells eighteen Pointed Stones hells and eighteen Drinking Molten Copper hellsThus in Avīci Hell there are these eighteen hells and within each of these hells there are eighteen subhellsFrom the Cold Ice hell to Drinking Molten Copper hell altogether there are one hundred and fortytwo subhellsEach is connected with different past evil deeds but those who experience Avīci Hell visit them allAgain the Qishi jing saysThe Buddha told the monks Inside the large Avīci Hell are sixteen smaller hells that are subordinate to it and surround itEach of these is five hundred yojanas in sizeAll sentient beings who are born or emerge or live there are born there because of the fruit of past evil karmaJailors seize the bodies of the sinners in this hell with both hands and violently throw them on a ground of redhot ironFierce flames immediately rise and spread quickly covering the groundThen the jailors take sharp knives and starting from the heels and going upward they cut apart the sinners bodies and remove their musclesThey take the muscles in their hands and pull themThey pull and pull all the muscles together all the way up to the sinners headsAs they are being pulled the muscles rip through the heart and the pain the sinners experience is beyond wordsAfter having pulled out the muscles in this manner the jailors put the sinners on iron carriages and run with them very fastThe carriages are very hot with blazing bright flamesEverywhere they go it is empty like a caveA narrow road of hot iron goes on and onThe carriages follow the will of the guards in hell and do not stop even for a short whileWherever they want the carriages to go the carriages go accordingly and everywhere they go the jailors pull out the sinners musclesThe jailors never leave the sinners even for a moment and everywhere they go they remove more from the sinners bodies until there is no flesh or blood left in their bodiesThe sinners experience the karmic consequences of all the deeds that they committed either as a human being or a nonhuman creatureAs retribution for evil deeds a great fire suddenly appears in the eastern directionGlowing bright red this large and ferocious fire blazes upThe same thing happens in each of the other directions in the south west north in the four intermediate directions and above and belowThe sinners are surrounded by all these large masses of fire which gradually come closer causing them to experience all sorts of painFrom the eastern wall a large flaming fire emerges immediately shoots toward the western wall and stays there after reaching itFrom the western wall a large flame emerges and immediately shoots toward the northern wallFrom the northern wall a large flame emerges and immediately shoots toward the southern wallFlames shoot from below to above and from above to belowHorizontal lines of shooting flames touch each other and vertical lines cross over themThe space is filled with intensely bright light and redhot heat Flames fly and hit each otherAt this point the jailors of hell throw the sinners into the middle of these masses of six kinds of flying fire and the sinners experience extreme painStill their life does not endThe karmic effects of their evil deeds are not yet exhausted so they suffer in the midst of this hell with all its painBecause of the consequences of their evil deeds in past lives sentient beings in Avīci Hell suffer pain for an infinitely long period of time Then the four gates of hell open againWhen the gates open the sinners hear the sound and see the gates openRunning toward the gates they thinkNow we will surely be able to get out When a sinner runs in great speed his body burns ferociously ablazeIt is as if a person carrying a torch of dried grass ran against the wind the flames of the torch would surely blaze up The sinner stops running and then resumes runningHis body falls into pieces and burns even more brightlyWhen he raises his feet the flesh and blood drop and scatterWhen he is about to put down his feet the flesh and blood are restored againJust as he arrives at the gates of hell the gates close againBecause he cannot get out he is mentally tortured and deranged falls on the groundFire burns all over his body first burning his skin then the flesh and bones and finally the fire penetrates to the marrowAs if in a chimneylike empty tunnel a great quantity of smoke arises and the fire burns brightlyThe smoke and flames mix and the heat tortures the sinner with redoubled intensityThe sinner suffers extreme pain in this hell yet the karmic effects of his past evil deeds is not yet exhausted and he experiences all the pain inflicted on him thereIn this great hell of Avīci a sinner does not have even as brief a moment of happiness as the time it takes to snap ones fingersIn this manner the sinner suffers this pain The Worldhonored One said to the monks You should know that in the midst of the world there are ten other hellsWhat are the tenThe first is Arbuda Hell the second Nirarbuda Hell the third Aho Hell the fourth Huhuva Hell the fifth Aṭaṭa Hell the sixth Saugandhika Hell the seventh Utpala Hell the eighth Padma Hell the ninth Puṇḍarīka Hell and the tenth Kumuda HellDue to what causes and conditions is the first hell called ArbudaHere the bodies of sentient beings are like bubbles For this reason it is called Arbuda HellAgain due to what causes and conditions is the second hell called Nirarbuda Here the bodies of sentient beings are like chunks of meatFor this reason it is called Nirarbuda HellAgain for what causes and conditions is the third hell called Aho HellHere sentient beings are pressed with grave and severe pains they cry out Aho aho The pain is excruciatingThus it is called Aho HellAgain for what causes and conditions is the fourth hell called Huhuva HellHere when sentient beings are pressed with the excessive pains of this hell they cry out saying Huhuva huhuva For this reason it is called Huhuva HellAgain for what causes and conditions is the fifth hell called Aṭaṭa HellWhen sentient beings are pressed with extreme pains in their body they can only chant Aṭaṭa aṭaṭa But the sound that their tongues make does not come out of their mouthsFor this reason it is called Aṭaṭa HellAgain for what causes and conditions is the sixth hell called Saugandhika HellWhen sentient beings are in this hell they see flames of ferocious fire with the color of the saugandhika flowerFor this reason it is called Saugandhika HellAgain for what causes and conditions is the seventh hell called Utpala HellWhen sentient beings are in this hell they see flames of ferocious fire with the color of the blue lotus flower For this reason it is called Utpala HellAgain for what causes and conditions is the tenth hell called Kumuda HellWhen sentient beings are in this hell they see flames of ferocious fire with the color of the yellow lotus flower For this reason it is called Kumuda HellAgain for what causes and conditions is the ninth hell called Puṇḍarīka HellWhen sentient beings are in this hell they see flames of ferocious fire with the color of the white lotus flower For this reason it is called Puṇḍarīka HellAgain for what causes and conditions is the eighth hell called Padma HellWhen sentient beings are in this hell they see flames of ferocious fire with the color of the red lotus flower For this reason it is called Padma Hell Furthermore according to the Sanfadu lun jing  There are three hellsthe first is Hot Hell the second is Cold Hell and the third is Borderland Hell As for the Hot Hell the Sarvāstivāda school speaks of eight great hellsThe first is Repeatedly Reviving Hell It is also called Againrevived Hell Sometimes the jail guards in this hell chant and revive the sinnersSometimes a cold wind blowsAlthough these two conditions differ they both equally revive the sinnersTherefore this hell is called Repeatedly RevivingThe second hell is called Black Rope HellSoldiers in this hell first bind the sinner with ropes and later cut him up with an axThe third hell is called Gathered Multitude HellIt is also called Mass Knocking Hell This is because two mountains come together and the sinners are ground against each other at the bottom of the mountainsThe fourth is called Shouting HellIt is also called Howling HellHere the guards of hell come and chase the sinners and the sinners shout and runThe fifth hell is called Loud Shouting Hell It is also called Loud Howling HellFour large masses of fire blaze up and even though the sinner wants to escape there is no way outTherefore it is called Great Howling HellThe sixth hell is called Hot Hell It is also called Burning HellFlaming pieces of iron closely surround the sinner and he feels hot surrounded by themThe seventh hell is called Intense Heat HellIt is also called Great Burning HellA mountain of fire breaks out and the sinners are roasted on skewersThe eighth hell is called No Choice Hell It is also called No Interruption HellOnce a sinner is thrown into the fire in which he feels pain there is no moment of pleasureSince there is no moment of pleasure where would there be any room for choiceThese eight hells exist in a layered manner within this worldAccording to the Sanfadu lun   torturers play a prominent role in the first two  a limited role in the next three  and no role in the last three These eight hells are the main hellsEach of these main hells has sixteen hells surrounding it four minor hells on each side of the main hellAltogether including the main hell there are seventeen hells in each caseEight sets of seventeen hells make one hundred and thirtysix altogetherSinners suffer the pain of heat in these placesSecond there are also eight kinds of Cold HellThe first is called Arbuda Hell so called because the pain of coldness cuts through the flesh and causes chilblainsThe second is called Nirarbuda Hell so called because a cold wind blows and chilblains appear all over the bodyThe third is called Aṭaṭa Hell so called because the sinners cannot move their lips they can only move their tongues and so they produce the sound aṭaṭaThe fourth is called Apapa Hell so called because the sinners there cannot move their tongues they can only move their lips and therefore they make the sound apapaThe fifth is called Ouhou Hell so called because the sinners can move neither lips nor tongues and therefore they make the sound ouhou in their throatsThe sixth is called Utpala HellThis term means blue lotus flower and the petals of this flower are narrowThis hell is so called because the flesh of a sentient being in this hell has fine edges and resembles the utpala flower opening under the bright sunThe seventh is called Padma HellThis term means red lotus flowerIt is so called because the flesh of sentient beings in this hell has rough edges and resembles a padma flower when it is openThe eighth is called Puṇḍarīka HellThis term means white lotus flowerIt is so called because the edges of the bones of beings in this hell resemble a puṇḍarīka flower when it is openThe first two hells are named in reference to the appearance of the body the next three hells are named in reference to the sounds the sinners there make the last three are named in reference to the appearance of the wounds they receive there The Jushe lun saysIn these eight hells sentient beings are oppressed by extreme cold their bodies their sounds and their wounds manifest unusual changes therefore these hells are given these namesAccording to the Sanfadu lun   in the first two hells the sinners can scream in the second three hells the sinners cannot scream and in the last three hells sinners do not screamThese eight hells are situated between the continents at the bottom of the Iron Ring Mountain and face upwardSinners suffer the pain of cold temperatures and freezing in these hells Third the Borderland Hell is also of three kindsAccording to the Sanfadu lun  the first is in the mountains the second is in the water and the third is in a deserted fieldSentient beings receive different retributions of their previous deeds in these three placesHere sentient beings are punished by a combination of cold and heatAs for the length of life the life span of a sentient being in these places varies It is sometimes long and sometimes shortFurthermore the Lishi apitan lun saysThe Worldhonored One said There is a great hell called Darkness Outside of each worldsystem there is always one example of this hell This hell is always without a cover on topIn this hell sentient beings hold their arms up to get their bearings because they cannot see anything with their eyesAlthough the sun and moon are endowed with great mysterious powers their light does not illuminate this placeWhen the Buddha appears in the world a great light illumines all directionsThis light enables sentient beings in this hell to see each otherThis hell is located between two mountains outside the Iron Ring Mountains surrounding the world Thus it is said to be outside the worldsystem It is a cold hellBetween the mountains there are ten places with different names beginning with the first hell called Arbuda Hell and ending with the tenth hell called Padma HellSentient beings in these hells walk on their sides and like a lizard they strain to face upwardOutside the Iron Ring Mountains everyone walks sidewaysThe size of their bodies is like that of a bubble If a cold wind touches them their bodies break apart just like a ripe fruit when hit by a cold windA sinner walking among the reeds here is burned up by an intense fireThe sound of explosions is heard repeatedly all over the place and when the sinners are touched by a cold wind their bones break and the breaking sound is heard repeatedly throughout the placeBecause of this sound sentient beings in this hell come to know of each others presenceMany of the sentient beings who die in our world are reborn in this hellCold Ice Hell is located outside of the Iron Ring MountainsWhen sentient beings die in a world other than our own and are to be reborn in Cold Ice Hell they are reborn outside of the Iron Ring Mountains of that worldThe closest point between the two worlds is eighty thousand yojanasThere is no bottom and no cover above this spaceThe widest point measures sixteen thousand yojanas According to the Qishi jing The Buddha said the followingSuppose a person measures sesame seeds with a measuring unit of the state of Kośala and fills twenty hu measures without leveling them at the topNow suppose that someone were to pick up one sesame seed after a hundred yearsHe does this again after one hundred years and each time he throws the seed awayEven by the time the person has thrown away all twenty hu units of sesame seeds in this way when compared to the time measurement of hell one life span in hell will not yet have been exhaustedTo calculate roughly with this number twenty life spans in Arbuda Hell are equivalent to one life span in Nirarbuda Hell twenty life spans in Nirarbuda Hell are equivalent to one life span in Aho Hell twenty life spans in Aho Hell are equivalent to one life span in Huhuva Hell twenty life spans in Huhuva Hell are equivalent to one life span in Aṭaṭa Hell twenty life spans in Aṭaṭa Hell are equivalent to one life span in Saugandhika Hell twenty life spans in Saugandhika Hell are equivalent to one life span in Utpala Hell twenty life spans in Utpala Hell are equivalent to one life span in Kumuda Hell twenty life spans in Kumuda Hell are equivalent to one life span in Puṇḍarīka Hell twenty life spans in Puṇḍarīka Hell are equivalent to one life span in Padma Hell twenty life spans in Padma Hell are equivalent to one intermediate world age Furthermore the Naxian biqiu wenfo jing saysThe fire in this world is not as hot as the fire in hellIf a person were to put a small stone on a fire in this world it would not melt away even if he waited until the end of the day If he takes a large stone and puts it in the fire of hell the stone immediately melts awayIf a person commits evil deeds he enters hell at death and will not die even after several millions of yearsVarious large and small dragons eat sands and stones that melt away  when human beings are pregnant there is a child in the abdomen yet the child does not melt away thereAll these things are due to the fact that the power of retribution resulting from good and evil deeds in previous lives determines what will melt away and what will notThe good and evil deeds a person has committed in previous lives follow him just as a shadow follows their bodyWhen a person dies he only loses his body he does not lose his past deedsThe relationship may be compared to the situation of writing by the light of a burning fire at night Even though the fire burns out by morning the writing remains The effect of the fire lingers long after the fire is goneThe deeds a person commits in this world linger into a later worldAgain when the fire is fully ablaze in Padma Hell a sinner even one hundred yojanas away from it is still roasted if he is sixty yojanas away he becomes deaf in both his ears and he does not hear anythingIf he is fifty yojanas away both his eyes are blinded and he does not see anymoreThe monk Kokālika held evil thoughts in his mind and reviled āriputra and MaudgalyāyanaWhen his body disintegrated and his life ended he fell into this Padma Hell The Qishi jing saysAround the place where Padma Hell is located if a sentient being is one hundred yojanas away from the hell the flames of the fire there reach him if he is fifty yojanas away he will be completely blinded by the smoke if he is twentyfive yojanas away his flesh and blood will be scorched and destroyedBecause those who have renounced the world and practice the religious path occasionally entertain defiled thoughts tormenting thoughts poisonous evil thoughts unmeritorious thoughts uncompassionate thoughts and impure thoughts they automatically suffer such calamitiesConversely all those who follow the religious path and know only compassionate actions of body speech and mind always receive pleasure later onAt this time the Worldhonored One uttered the following versePeople of this world while they live in this world without even thinking make their tongues sharp and biting instruments If a person says poisonous evil things he is in turn weakened and harms his own body Not praising what one should praise wrongly praising what one should not praisesuch is called causing strife with speech Because of thus causing strife one does not receive pleasure If a person gambles and obtains wealth this is a minor matter of worldly strife If a person follows the pure religious path nourishes defiled thoughts this is called major strife and struggle For such a person there are three hundred and sixty thousand Nirarbuda Hells and five Arbuda Hells Again that person falls into Padma Hell If one reviles a saintly person they reap these consequences These consequences arise because that person has committed evil deeds of speech and thoughtAccording to the Wendiyu jing and the Jingdu sanmei jing hell has altogether one hundred and thrityfour realmsTo give the name of the chief of hells and his dwelling place first King Yama in the past was King BimbisāraDuring a battle with King Weituosheng his military strength did not match that of his opponent and therefore he made an oath to become king of the hellsKing Bimbisāras eighteen assisting ministers led one million soldiers with horns for ears who were easily provoked to angerThese soldiers joined in the kings oath saying that they would later offer assistance in punishing the sinners thereKing Bimbisāra became the present King Yama the eighteen ministers became the present eighteen minor kings of hell the one million soldiers became the hell soldiersFurthermore the Chang ahan jing saysTo the south of this world is Vajra MountainInside the mountain is the palace of King YamaThe palace is sixty yojanas long and wideThe Wendiyu jing says that the city in hell is three hundred thousand miles long and wide and made of gold and silver Three times during the day and night a large cauldron spontaneously appearsIf the cauldron ends up inside the palace the king becomes frightened and throws it outside the palaceIf the cauldron is outside the palace and the king enters the palace a huge soldier from hell forces the king to lie down on a hot iron bed and forcing open the kings mouth with a steel hook pours molten copper into his mouthFrom the throat all the way down the kings internal organs are all scorched and burned beyond recognitionWhen this is over the king goes back to enjoying the pleasures of the company of the women in his courtThe ministers who enjoy pleasures with the king are also treated in the same wayThe Wendiyu jing says Eighteen kings rule over the eighteen hellsJiayan is in charge of Niraya HellQuzun is in charge of Knife Mountain HellFeijinshou is in charge of Blowing Sand HellFeishi is in charge of Boiling Excrement HellJiashi is in charge of Black Ear HellGaicuo is in charge of Fire Chariot HellTangwei is in charge of Boiling Water Cauldron HellTiejiaran is in charge of Iron Floor HellEsheng is in charge of Kai Mountain HellCold Ice Hell Note The scripture does not give the name of the king of this hell Pijia is in charge of Peeling Skin HellYaotou is in charge of Animal HellTibo is in charge of Soldiers with Swords HellYida is in charge of Iron Mortar HellYuetou is in charge of Water Hell Iron Rods Hell NoteThe scripture does not give the name of the king of this hell Mingshen is in charge of Worm HellGuanshen is in charge of Molten Copper HellThe Jingdu sanmei jing says that there are thirty more hells and each of these hells has someone in chargeTheir names are not listed here in detail I will list only the names of five officialsfirst is the fish official who prohibits killing second is the water official who prohibits stealing third is the iron official who prohibits licentiousness fourth is the earth official who prohibits divisive speech and fifth is the heavenly official who prohibits drinking alcoholThe Wendiyu jing says To the east west south and north of the city of King Yama are various hellsThe light of the sun and moon shines but does not illuminate anything The light does not shine only in Black Ear HellWhen a persons life ends he is first in an intermediate existenceA sentient being in this intermediate existence has already gone through the moment of death but has not yet reached the moment of rebirthThe sinner acquires a body of intermediate existence and enters the city of Niraya Hell Note Niraya means densely branched city or closed city where sinners gather together before they receive their punishmentsAs the cleverly discriminating wind blows the sinners receive bodies of different sizes according to the effects of the deeds they committed in their previous livesIf a foulsmelling wind blows sinners take coarse and ugly formsIf a wind with a good fragrance blows fortunate people receive fine and subtle bodies According to the Qishi jing Outside of the two Iron Ring Mountains to the south of this world is the palace of King YamaThe length and width of the residence is exactly six thousand yojanasSevenfold walls sevenfold balustrades sevenfold nets with bells and outside of these sevenfold lines of palm trees surround the citySeven jewels produce a beautiful combination of colorsThere are gates in each of the four directionsEach gate has a tower for defenseThe palace buildings gardens and ponds are all filled with many kinds of beautiful fruitFragrant breezes carry distant fragrances and many birds sing in harmonyBecause the kings evil deeds in his previous lives resulted in bad consequences both during the three time periods of the night and the three periods of the day red molten copper appears in front of himThe palace changes into a building made of ironAll pleasurable objects of the five senses disappearWhen the king sees this he becomes frightened and anxious His hair stands on end and he immediately leaves the palaceIf he happens to be outside when this happens he immediately runs insideAt this time the guardians of hell take hold of the king and raise him up high then throw him down onto a redhot iron floorThis floor is fiercely ablaze glowing red with flames shooting from itAfter throwing him onto the floor and ordering him to lie down the guardians of hell then force open his mouth with an iron instrument and pour molten red copper down his mouthAt this time King Yamas lips and mouth are burned then his tongue and finally his throat are burnedHis bowels and intestines are gradually scorchedGoing downward the molten copper eventually passes out of his bodyAt this time the king entertains the following thought Any sentient being who has committed evil deeds of body speech and mind receives this suffering with other sentient beings who have committed similar deedsLet me make a vow that from now on I will renounce this body that I will be reborn only among humans and that I will follow the teaching of the Buddha and obtain the correct faith and understanding shave off my beard and hair and don a monks robeAfter I have obtained correct faith and understanding I will renounce the householders life and after I have renounced the householders life I vow to attain penetrating enlightenmentThen I will have exhausted life and death and will have become firm in the pure practiceAll that has to be done will have been doneI shall not have any further births When the king nourishes such a transformative thought the seven jewels are restored in the palace where he lives The palace becomes like the heavens and the pleasurable objects of the five senses are fully manifested before the kingBecause of the effects of the three good deeds of body speech and mind that he performed in his previous lives the king immediately enjoys all of these pleasuresAgain the new Posha lun saysQuestion Are the guards of hell to be counted among sentient beings or are they counted among nonsentient beingsAnswer The guards of hell who bind sentient beings with iron chains when they are first born in hell and take them to King Yama are themselves counted among sentient beingsBut those who harm sentient beings with various instruments of torture are counted among nonsentient beingsUnder the continent of this world are the great hells above the continent of this world also are the borderland hells and the isolated hellsSome hells are in valleys some are on top of mountains some are in deserted fields and some are in the skyIn the other three continents there are only borderland hells and isolated hells there are no great hellsOnly the people of the continent of this world accomplish great good deedsThey also commit excessively evil deedsOther continents are different This is why the hells are differentSome say that the northern Uttarakuru continent lacks the borderland hells too and that this is because it is the place for receiving the effects of pure deeds QuestionIf the other continents have no great hells where do those sentient beings who have committed extremely grave sins and cut off the roots for good deeds go to receive the karmic consequences of their deedsAnswer They receive them in the great hells beneath the Jambudvīpa continentQuestion What is the form of the sentient beings in the hells likeAnswer Their form is like that of human beings QuestionWhat is their languageAnswer When sentient beings are first born there they all speak SanskritLater when they are tortured they utter various sounds of pain but not one word is understandableThere are only the sounds of cutting piercing breaking and splittingAccording to the Shilun jing The five grave sins are the most serious sinsWhat are these fiveTo intentionally kill ones father mother or an arhat to destroy the affairs of the harmonious monastic community of hearers  and to maliciously shed the blood of the Buddhathese are called the five grave sinsIf one commits any of these grave sins he may not renounce the householders life and receive the complete preceptsIf a person has been permitted to renounce the householders life and then commits a grave sin he must be expelled from the monastic communityIn the case of those who have renounced the householders life and received the precepts we should not use whips on them nor bind them in confinement There are also four kinds of great sins which are identical with the four crimes of the fundamental sinsWhat are these fourKilling a pratyekabuddhathis is called the fundamental sin of killingCommitting licentious acts with a nun who has attained the status of arhatthis is called the fundamental sin of licentiousnessIf people have made a gift of their goods or property to the Buddha Dharma and Sangha and a person in charge of the property uses it for his own private purpose this is called the fundamental sin of theftIf a person who holds heterodox views does damage to the community of monks this is called the fundamental sin of damaging the sanghaIf someone commits any of these four fundamental sins without exception he will not be allowed to renounce the householders life according to the Buddhas teachingIf he has already renounced the householders life he will not be allowed to receive the complete set of preceptsIf he has already received the precepts he must be expelled Because of the monastic rules pertaining to those who have renounced the householders life one should not whip bind in confinement or take the life of any one who had received the precepts when he commits one of these sinsThese are all fundamental sinsThey are not identical with the grave sinsThere are cases where an act is both a fundamental sin and a grave sinThere are cases where an act is a grave sin but not a fundamental sinThere are cases where an act is neither a fundamental sin nor a grave sinWhat is the case of an act that is both a grave sin and a fundamental sinIf a person has renounced the householders life received the complete precepts and succeeded in attaining the way of the truth to cut off this persons life is called both a grave sin and a fundamental sinThe person who commits such a sin should be expelled according to my rulesWhat is the case of an act that is a fundamental sin but not a grave sinIf a person renounces the householders life according to my teaching but harms the life of such an ordinary sentient being by poison for example or through aborting his fetus when he is reborn among humans in a later life this is called a fundamental sin but not a grave sinA person who has committed such a sin must not be given a share of the monastic property food and drink and floor mats that offered to any monk as common benefitsIf a sentient being gives rise to doubt concerning the Buddha Dharma and Sangha yet renounces the householders life according to them or if seeing others reciting the scriptures interferes with the recitation of even one verse this fault is neither a fundamental sin nor a grave sinThese offenses are said to be extremely evil They are similar to the grave sinsIn the case of such sentient beings unless they repent and remove the root of their sins we can never allow them to renounce the householders life according to the Buddhas teachingIf they happen to have renounced the householders life or have received the complete precepts those among them who do not repent their faults are to be expelledTo not have faith in the right Dharma to revile the three vehicles to harm the Dharma eye to wish to terminate the lamp of the teaching and to cut off the seed of the Three Jewelsthese all drastically reduce the possibility of rebirth in the realms of humans or gods and have no benefits The result  is to fall into inferior realms of existenceThe two kinds of people mentioned above ie those who doubt and those who revile the hearers pratyekabuddhas or the Mahayana are designated as those who revile the right Dharma and as those who belittle sages and holy ones Their life spans in hell increaseThese evil deeds are called major fundamental sinsWhat are the fundamental sins contrary to the preceptsIf a monk deliberately commits licentious deeds or kills or an ordinary person does not give but only takes or deliberately commits the sin of lyingif a monk or an ordinary person commits any one of these fundamental sins they are not allowed to participate in any of the religious ceremonies performed by the monks and they may not take a share of the use of common property drinks food and bedding belonging to the monasteryHowever the imperial ruler ministers and officials may not impose the punishment of whipping and confinement and they may not take the life These offenses are called the substance nature and appearance of fundamental sinsWhy are they called fundamental sinsIf a person commits these sins when his body dissolves at the end of life he falls into inferior realms of existenceTo commit these deeds is the root of  inferior realmsFor this reason they are called fundamental sins Thus there are eleven kinds of sinsthe five grave sins the four major prohibitions and the sins committed by sentient beings who either destroyed the right Dharma or reviled the wise and holy onesIf a person commits any one of these sins when his body dissolves at the end of life he will fall into Avīci Hell Just as an iron ball when thrown into space does not stay there but quickly falls to the ground so will such a sinner fall into this hellAccording to the Zhengfanian jing Ta b c The suffering in Avīci Hell is one thousand times greater than that in the previous seven hellsThe life span there is one world ageThe body grows as large as five hundred yojanas tallThose who have committed four grave sins are four hundred yojanas tall those three grave sins are three hundred yojanas tall those two grave sins are two hundred yojanas tall and those one grave sin are one hundred yojanas tallWhen a person who has committed the five grave sins is about to die he screams loses control of his bowels and his breath passes out of his throatA color not seen during his lifetime appears on his corpseHis body becomes like that of an eightyearold childKing Yama takes a flaming iron net ties the persons throat and binds his handsThe head is held downward and the legs upwardFor a period of two thousand years all such sinners move downwardOften their headdresses burn full of flamesFirst the head burns then the body burnsWhen the gods of the six heavens of the realm of desire smell the air of Avīci Hell they all disappearBecause the creatures of Avīci Hell have a strong unpleasant smellFurthermore the Guanfo sanmei hai jing has the following passageThe Buddha told nanda If a sentient being kills their father harms their mother or abuses and humiliates one of their relatives in the sixfold classification of relations such sinners when their life ends very quickly in the time that it takes a powerful man takes to bend and stretch out his armfall directly into Avīci HellKing Yama appearing as a phantom decrees in a loud voice Ignorant people bound for hell while you were in the world you were not filial to your parents and committed evil and arrogant deeds of lawlessnessThe place you are now born in is called Avīci Hell After saying this he disappears immediately and is not seen anymoreAt that time the jail guards hurry them around taking them from lower to higher sections of hell going through eightyfour sections  altogetherBending their bodies they pass through these sections of hell until they reach the boundary protected by steel netsIt takes an entire day and night to go around Avīci HellAn entire day and night in this hell is the equivalent of sixty small world ages according to the measurement of time in our world According to the way time is measured in hell life in Avīci Hell lasts for one great world ageIf a person has committed the five grave sins his punishment will last for five world agesIf a sentient being has violated the four major prohibitions received a gift of almsfood while guilty of violating the precepts reviled the truth by holding heterodox views been ignorant of causes and conditions terminated their study of the Perfection of Wisdom broken images of the buddhas of the ten directions stolen common property of the monastery engaged in lawless licentious deeds raped nuns who were upholding the precepts sisters or other relatives and yet without repentance abused and humiliated those who are close to himif someone has committed these evil deeds their punishment is as followsAt the time of death winds as sharp as knives blow and cut up his body in an instant his body becomes an iron flower that fills up the eighteen sections of hellEach flower has eightyfour thousand petals and each petal has a head a body and armsEach is located in different sections of the hell This hell is not large and this body is not smallConsequently the body fills this great hell for a period of eight thousand four hundred great world agesWhen this Niraya Hell disappears the sinner enters the eighteen sections in the eastern direction and is punished in the same manner as beforeIn this way he goes through the eighteen sections in the southern western and northern parts of Avīci HellReviling the Mahayana scriptures committing the five grave sins destroying the monastic community defiling nuns cutting off the roots of good deedssinners who have committed these sins acquire a body that fills Avīci Hell their four limbs fill the eighteen sections of hellSentient beings sent to Avīci Hell burn without interruptionWhen the world age is about to end the eastern gate opensAs the sinner looks out of the eastern gate he sees that a beautiful spring running water and a forest of trees bearing flowers and fruit have all appearedAt this sight the sinner runs upward from below and when he reaches the top section he raises a ring of swords with his handsAt that time hot iron balls rain down from the skyThe sinner runs toward the eastern gate but the gate closes when he arrivesA demon guard of this hell picks up steel forks with his hands and pierces the eyes of the sinnerAn iron dog tears into the sinners heart The sinner falls unconscious in convulsions and diesAfter dying the sinner revives and this time he sees the southern gate reopenYet the situation is the same as before there is no difference The western gate and the northern gate are also the sameIn this manner time passes for half a world ageAfter dying in Avīci Hell the sinner is born in Cold Ice HellAfter dying in Cold Ice Hell the sinner is reborn in Dark Place HellFor eighty million years his eyes see nothingHe receives the body of a large worm and he must crawl on his belly twisting aroundAll his sense organs are dulled in the darkness and he knows and understands nothingOne hundred thousand foxes and wolves seize the bodies of the sinners and eat themWhen this life ends the sinner is reborn among animalsFor fifty million lives he receives the bodies of birds and animalsThen he is reborn among humans but he is blind and deaf and suffers from leprosy and tumorsHe is extremely poor and marked by every sign of declineAfter five hundred lives in this ignoble form such a person is reborn among the hungry ghostsIn the realm of hungry ghosts he encounters good friends who are great bodhisattvasThey reprimand him saying In your former lives over an infinite number of lifetimes you committed boundless sinsBecause you reviled the teaching and lacked true faith you fell into Avīci Hell and received tortures that cannot be described in detailNow you should give rise to compassion in your mind When the hungry ghost hears these words he praises the name of the Buddha and the power of the Buddhas loveThereupon his life ends and he is reborn in the dwelling place of the gods of the four directionsOnce he has been born in this realm he repents his previous sins and feels a desire for enlightenment arise within himselfFrom their compassionate hearts many buddhas emit light onto such sentient beings and do not abandon such people as this oneThe buddhas assist people like this just as the Buddha once assisted RāhulaWith their compassionate eyes and ears they teach him to avoid the hells Therefore in the Qishi jing  the Buddha says in verse If a person does wrong either in physical acts or through speech or even in his own mind Then as a result of such an action he is born into inferior realms of existence In this way he is reborn in the Reviving Hell It is the most fearful place it makes your hair stand on end After experiencing this hell for millions of years beyond the possibility of counting The person dies but immediately revives Hatred invites hatred and so sentient beings kill one another without ceaseIf sentient beings cherish evil feelings toward their parents Or toward the buddhas bodhisattvas and hearers They will all fall into Black Rope Hell The suffering experienced there is extremely grave and terrible Those who mislead others who are practicing correct deeds and cause them to enter wrong paths And those who always destroy good deeds as soon as they see them Such people also fall into Black Rope Hell Doubletongued evilmouthed and constant liars who enjoy committing the three kinds of grave evil deeds And who do not cultivate the three roots of good deeds These ignorant people will necessarily fall into the great hell of Clashing and Grinding and suffer punishment for a long time Or if someone kills sheep horses cows or other kinds of animals chickens or pigs And even if he kills insects he will fall into Clashing and Grinding Hell If through the many ways that frighten people in this world A person oppresses and tortures sentient beings This person will fall into Mortar Mountain Hell And receive the punishment of being pressed against the ground and pounded If because of the bondage of greed desire anger and ignorance A person perverts the real truth and makes it into something different Judging that which is correct to be wrong and deviating from the norms and rules This person is in turn destined to be harmed by knives and swords If someone relying on his strength steals from others taking from both the powerful and powerless If in these ways such a person commits many oppressive acts He is destined to be kicked and stomped upon by an iron elephant If someone enjoys killing sentient beings his body and hands stained with blood and with a very evil mind If such a person constantly commits such impure deeds He will be reborn in Screaming and Howling Hell Because they have tormented sentient beings in various ways These sinners are roasted and cooked in Screaming and Howling Hell Within this hell furthermore is the Great Screaming and Howling Hell Here are people who are given to flattery and who have crafty minds Which are obscured by wrong views as if with a dense forest They are bound tighter and tighter by the taut nets of attachment and pulled downward Those who commit the most base deeds fall into Great Screaming and Howling Hell When a person arrives at the Great Screaming and Howling Hell an iron city ablaze his hair stands on end There are iron halls and iron buildings there and those who come and enter these places are completely consumed by fire If those who while performing their worldly duties constantly torment sentient beings They will fall into the place of torture by heat They endure torture by heat for an infinitely long time Monks and brahmans in the world parents superiors and elders If people constantly torment such worthies and do not please them they will all fall into Heat Hell Not having cultivated the pure deeds that lead to rebirth in heaven always rejecting those who are closest and to be loved If people commit these crimes with pleasure they will enter Heat Hell Those who commit evil deeds toward monks and brahmans and other good people and parents Or who harm other honorable ones will fall into the place of torture by heat where a fire constantly blazes Those who constantly commit evil deeds And have never even for an instant harbored a good thought in their minds These people go directly to Avīci Hell and receive an infinite number of punishments If a person says that the right Dharma is wrong And various wrong teachings are correct And he does not contribute to the good cause Such a person will enter Avīci Hell Reviving Hell Black Rope Hell and the two hells If one adds to these such hells as Screaming and Howling  the number becomes five With Heat Torture Hell and Great Heat Hell there are seven hells Avīci Hell makes the number eight These eight are called the great hells Where sinners burn violently and their suffering is intense and unbearable A person will be reborn because of the evil deeds he committed Within each there are also sixteen smaller hellsThe Qishi jing says the following The Buddha said to the monks There are three kinds of heavenly messengers in the worldWhat are these threeThe first is old age the second is illness and the third is deathIf a person is selfindulgent and commits the three kinds of evil deeds he will be reborn in hell when his body dissolves and life endsThe guardians of hell come immediately and drive such sentient beings into King Yamas presenceThey say Great king these sentient beings were unrestrained and selfindulgent when they lived among people in their previous livesThey did not make their three acts  goodWould the great king properly instruct them The king asks the sinners When you lived among humans in your previous lives the first heavenly messenger instructed and reprimanded you wellHow could you have failed to see him appear in life The sinners answer Great god indeed we did not see him The king says When you had a human body you should have seen the followingThe decline of old age appeared to you sometimes in the form of a man and sometimes in the form of a woman with their teeth fallen out white hair loose and wrinkled skin and black spots all over their body so that it looked like a sesame plantTheir arms were crooked and their backs were bent and as they walked crippled their legs did not follow the body which leaned to the left and then to the rightTheir necks were narrow and their skin was loose hanging down on both sides like a cows jowlsTheir lips and mouths were parched their throats and tongues dryTheir bodies were bent and weak and their vitality was ebbingThey gasped when they tried to speak making a rasping sound like a sawFaltering they walked clinging to a stickThe vigorous years of their lives had declined and their blood and flesh had been reduced to the point of drying up skinny exhausted and weak they were ready for the passage to the next lifeTheir movements were slow and there was no longer even a trace left of their former vigorBoth body and mind were all atrembleAll their limbs were scrawny and slack held together only with difficultyHave you never seen such an apparition The sinners answered Great god we have indeed seen this Then the king says You are slow and ignorant people and have no wisdomWhen you saw such a sight in the past why did you not think as followsI too have ahead of me this inevitable fate of old age I have not transcended it yetI should perform good deeds so that I will be able to enjoy benefits and pleasure for a long time The people answer Great god indeed we did not think such thoughts because our minds were excessively selfindulgent and our behavior was undisciplined King Yama then says You are slow and ignorant people and you have not cultivated good deedsYou should receive all the punishments for undisciplined indulgenceThese painful punishments are not the result of what others did they are the results of your actionsThe sum total of what you did now returns to you and you will suffer the consequences At that time King Yama reprimanding the sinners for the second time says Did you people not see the second heavenly messenger appear in the world They answer Great god indeed we did not see him The king then says In the past when you had a human body in the world did you not see the followingWhether one has the body of a woman or of a man the harmony of the four great elements is suddenly disturbedDisease enters and clings to the body causing great painsLying in a large or small bed the sick person tosses back and forth soiled with urine and excrementHe no longer has control of his bodyLying down asleep or sitting up awake he looks to someone to stay close by and look after himHe requires others assistance to wash to wipe himself to hold something to eat or drinkHave you not seen such a sight The people say Great god indeed we did see this King Yama then tells them Ignorant people when you saw such a sight why did you not think the followingI will also meet such a fate and I have not transcended the fate of diseaseI should perform good deeds that will enable me to obtain great benefits and pleasure for a long time in the future The people say No indeed we did not think such a thought because our minds were lazy and our behavior was undisciplined The king tells the ignorant men You were lazy and did not perform good deedsYou will receive these bad retributions not because of what others didWhat you did returns to you and you will thus receive these retributions Then King Yama reprimanding them for the third time says You slow and ignorant men when you were human beings in the past did you not see the third heavenly messenger appear in the world They answer Great god indeed we did not see himThe king says again When you were human beings did you also not see the followingWhether in the case of a woman or a man when life ends they place the body on a bed and cover it with cloths of many colorsWhen the body is to be taken outside the village it is awesomely decorated with flags and umbrellasRelatives surround the corpse their hands held aloft their hair all in disarrayCovering their heads with ashes they lament greatlyWailing ceaselessly they scream loudlyStriking their chests in sorrow they sob in sharp griefHave you not seen this They answer Great god indeed we saw this Then the king says to them Ignorant men when you saw such a sight in the past why did you not think the following thoughtWe too will die we have not been liberated from deathWe should now perform good deeds to obtain great benefits for a long time They answer Great god indeed we did not think such thoughtsBecause we were undisciplined and indulgent Then King Yama says You were undisciplined and indulgent and did not perform good deedsYou created these bad retributions yourself these retributions were not created by othersWhen you receive these retributions you are receiving the results of your earlier deeds After he instructs and reprimands the sinners with regard to the above three messengers the king orders them to be taken awayThereupon the guardians of hell seize the sinners by their legs and arms and holding them with the sinners heads downward and their legs up they throw them far into the midst of the many hells Now the best way to stop a stream is to cut off its sourceThe best way to stop boiling water from boiling is to put out the fireThe source provides the water if the source is not cut off the water is never exhaustedThe fire boils the water If the fire is not extinguished how could the boiling stopTherefore if the source that feeds a spring is cut off the water dries up by itself if the fire that boils the hot water is extinguished the boiling will stop by itselfA discussion of these analogies makes us understand the issues at hand betterIf one dislikes a result it is best to cut off its causeIf one fears suffering wouldnt it be best to give up evil deedsThe cause provides the substance for the resultsIf the cause is not uprooted the result will not be exhaustedEvil deeds give rise to sufferingIf one does not give up doing evil deeds how could suffering ceaseTherefore if a person cuts off the cause the result will never come about even if the person feels no If a wise person gives up doing evil deeds suffering disappears even if he never feared Have a hundred noble ones not written books about this in order to warn usThe verse says Having been born a person returns to death When the sun goes down the moon returns Someone who has been exiled while very young is easily moved by the evening wind He roams around following changing objectsAn ignorant person loses his way and Floating and sinking falls into a great abyss Immediately he falls into the dark place and experiences sharppointed weapons for ten thousand ages Beings in the six realms of rebirth revolve in the cycle of rebirth in the world and suffer Yet the effects of the three types of evil deeds are not yet exhausted As they follow this stream of rebirths no one can save them In great sorrow they can only rely on themselves to show pity Only by returning to sincerity and meditating on the form of things Can they learn the empty and false nature of objects The ocean of suffering is deepwhere would it take us We wish to board the ship of perfect wisdom Miracle Stories From the Jin dynasty  Layman Zhao Tai and the monk Zhi Faheng from the Zhao dynasty  the ghost at Hangu Pass the sound of wailing in the Lu Jiang district and the boiling caldron in Tibet from the Tang dynasty  Liu Zhigan serves as a judge in hellJin Dynasty Zhao Tai styled Wenhe was a man from Beiqiu of QingheHis grandfather had been the governor of the capital districtHis commandery recommended Tai for government service as a morally upright person and the government invited him but he did not serveHe studied the scriptures a great deal and was famed for his scholarship in his home districtLater he accepted official appointments and ended his career as the Grand Master of Palace LeisureWhen Tai was thirtyfive years old he experienced a sudden pain in his heart and moments later he diedWhen people lowered his corpse to the ground his heart was still warm and his body bended and stretched when people moved itThe corpse was left there for ten days and then a sound like falling rain came from his throat He suddenly revived and told the following storyRight after his death Tai dreamed that a man came and stooped over him at heartlevelThere were two other people riding yellow horses and these two servants supported Tai on either sideThe path led eastward but he did not know how many miles they traveledThen they reached a large city high and precipitous which was colored blue and black like zincThey led Tai to the city gate and passed through two heavy doorsInside there were thousands of tiled houses and also thousands of men and women of all ages standing in linesFive or six officials wearing silk clothes read out names from a list of categoriesThey were to present these people to the Commandery Governor according to the categoriesTais name was under the twentieth categorySoon they took Tai and several thousand other men and women to present them togetherThe Commandery Governor sat facing westward After examining the list he sent Tai south to go through the black gateA man wearing red clothes was sitting under a large roofHe called out the names one by one and asked what they had done in their previous livesWhat sins did you commit What good deeds did you performClearly you should tell the truthHere we send messengers to the six branches of the governmentThese messengers remain in the human world and constantly record good and evil deedsTheir lists include all events without exceptionYou should not lie Tai answered My father and elder brother served as government officialsBoth received two thousand gallons of riceSince I was young I only studied at home and have not served in any officeI have not committed any evil deeds either Thereupon the man dispatched Tai to serve as an overseer in the Office of Waterways where he supervised more than two thousand men who worked hard day and night carrying sand to repair riverbanksLater the man promoted Tai to CommissionerinChief of the Office of Waterways and placed the affairs of the jail under his chargeThey gave Tai horses and soldiers and ordered him to visit the various hells for inspectionThe torture in the different hells Tai visited took different formsIn one case the tongue of a sinner was pierced with needles and blood completely covered his bodyIn another case people with disheveled hair and without headdresses naked and barefooted were dragged along while guards with large sticks prodded them from behindAn iron floor and copper pillars burned with blazing flames making hollow soundsThe people were driven there and forced to embrace the pillars and lie down on the floorWhen they rose they were all burned into shapeless forms but they were immediately brought back to lifeIn still another case sinners were roasted and cooked in a flaming stove and a huge cauldronHeads and bodies were crushed and had fallen apart and were roiling around in the water as it boiledDemons holding forked spears stood nearby and three or four hundred people stood to one side awaiting their turn to enter the cauldron crying aloud and embracing each otherThen there was a tree of swords tall and wide and extending beyond any visible limitAt its outermost points the trunk branches and leaves of the tree were all made of swordsPeople abused each other and each climbed the tree one by one as if he was delighted to compete with the othersAs they climbed their heads and bodies were cut up into pieces from a few inches to a foot longTai saw his grandparents and two brothers in this hell and they cried when they saw each otherWhen Tai was going out of the gate of hell he saw two people bring a document to the jail official and say There are three people whose family raised banners and burned incense at the temple in order to remove their sinsThey may be released from hell and allowed to go to a residence of good fortune Suddenly Tai saw three people come out of the gate of hellImmediately their clothes appeared on their bodies in perfect orderThey went to a gate called the Great Hall of Opening LightThe threefold gate was illuminated in a bright red colorWhen they saw this gate the three people immediately entered the hallTai followed themBefore him Tai saw a great hall decorated throughout with rare treasures shining brilliantly to the observers eyeThe floor was made of gold and jadeHe saw one supernatural person whose appearance was extraordinarily awesome and propitiousThis man was sitting on a seat and there were many monks standing in attendance around his seatTai saw the Commandery Governor come and pay respect to the man with humility and reverenceTai asked to whom the Commandery Governor had extended reverence and an official said He is called the Worldhonored Master Who Saves Humanity After a while all the people in hell were brought out to listen to the scripturesAt that time they were said to be one million and nine thousand in numberThey all came out of hell and entered the city which was a hundred miles in sizeAs they arrived they paid respect to the teaching and sat in large groupsEven if there are shortcomings in a persons religious practice he or she can still obtain salvationFor this purpose the teaching of the scriptures in hell had been establishedWithin seven days the people achieved release from hell in the order determined by whether their deeds in previous lives had been good or evilBefore Tai came out he saw one thousand people rise up into space and disappearAfter Tai came out of this hall he saw another city over two hundred miles in size called the City of Changing FormsThe people who had completed the examination in hell enter this city and receive new forms for rebirthEntering the city Tai saw several thousand sections of houses with clay tiles each house had rooms and corridorsRight in the middle of the city was a brick house with a high floor and decorated balustradesThe house had several hundred roomsThe officials matching each case with documents said Murderers will become dayflies born in the morning and dying in the eveningThieves will become pigs and sheep to be butchered by people Sexual offenders will become cranes and deerLiars will become owlsDebtors will become camels oxen and horses After Tai returned from the inspection tour the chief of the Office of Waterways said to him You are the son of a noble familyFor what sins have you come here Tai answered My grandfather father and brothers all have a fief that produced two thousand shi of riceI was selected for service in government but turned it downCultivating my mind and meditating on good deeds I did not become defiled by various forms of evil deeds The chief said You have not committed any sinsThat is why you have been made CommissionerinChief of the Office of WaterwaysOtherwise there would have been no difference between yourself and those who are in hell Tai asked the chief What must a person do to assure happiness after death The chief said only If disciples who honor the Dharma practice it diligently and uphold the precepts they obtain the karmic rewards of happiness and will not be punished Tai again asked After someone has submitted himself to the service of the Dharma can the sins he committed before submitting be removed The answer was Yes all sins can be removed After this conversation the chief opened the sealed box and checked Tais yearsThere were still thirty years left so he sent Tai back to the human worldAs they parted the chief said You have seen what the punishment for sins in hell is likeYou must tell the people in the world about it and encourage them to perform good deedsThe effects of good and evil deeds follow people just like shadows and echoes Shouldnt everyone be careful about them Tai then reported his experience to friends and strangers who visited himFifty or sixty people heard him speak about his experience at one timeTai also wrote down his experiences and showed the document to his contemporariesThe time was the thirteenth day of the seventh month of the fifth year of Taishi Then Tai requested a monastery to arrange for a large celebration on behalf of his grandparents and two brothersHe ordered all of his descendants to change their faith and honor the Buddhist Dharma and practice Buddhism diligentlyPeople heard that Tai had died and come back to life after seeing many instances of the consequences of good and evil deeds and they visited him one after anotherAt that time the Superior Grand Master of the Palace Sun Feng of Wucheng the Marquis of Guannei Ho Boping of Changshan and others altogether ten people gathered together at Tais house and questioned him in detailEveryone was filled with fear and submitted themselves to the Buddhist DharmaThe monk Zhi Faheng belonged to the beginning of the rule He was ill for ten days and then diedThree days later he came back to life and told the following storyWhen he died a man came to take him awayHe saw several places which looked like government residences but he was not accepted in any of themSuddenly he saw an iron wheel with steel claws come around from the western directionNo one was pulling the wheel yet it turned and traveled as fast as the windAn official called a sinner and made him stand facing the wheel and the wheel ran over the sinnerIn this manner the wheel turned repeatedly and crushed several peopleThe official called to Faheng saying The man of the Way should come and stand facing the wheel Faheng was afraid and blaming himself he said Because I did not practice diligently I must now face this wheel After he spoke these words the official said to Faheng The man of the Way may go Then Faheng looked up and saw that there was a hole in the skyWithout any sensation he rose up quickly and his head went through the hole while his hands touched both sides of the holeFaheng looked around in the four directions and saw a palace decorated with seven jewels occupied by heavenly beingsFaheng kicked and jumped but could not get up further to reach the palaceExhausted he went down again and returned to where he had beenThe man who had taken Faheng laughed and said What did you see that prevented you from going up Thereupon he handed Faheng over to a boat captainThe captain piloted the boat and ordered Faheng to operate the rudder Faheng said I cannot hold the rudder but the captain forced him to do soSeveral hundred boats followed Faheng was onNot knowing how to hold the rudder Faheng steered the boat into a sandbarThe captain shoved Faheng saying You made a mistake guiding the boatAccording to the law you should be executed Dragging Faheng onto the shore to the sound of beating drums the captain was about to execute FahengSuddenly two fivecolored dragons pushed the boat and made it float againThe captain then pardoned Faheng and they continued traveling northward for about thirty milesFaheng saw a village and on the riverbank there were tens of thousands of houses The captain said that the village was a refugeFaheng slipped out and landed on the bankA large dog in the village was about to attack him and Faheng was very frightenedWhen he looked in the northwest direction he saw a lecture hall where many monks had gatheredHearing the sound of sutras being recited Faheng hurried toward the hall which had a twelvestep staircaseFaheng climbed the first step and saw the deceased teacher Fazhu sitting on a chairSeeing Faheng he said You are my discipleWhy did you come Turning and rising toward the staircase the teacher slapped Faheng in the face with a hand cloth and said Do not come up Faheng was very anxious to continue up the staircase and again raised his feet to climb the steps but Fazhu again pushed him back downAfter the third time Faheng gave upFaheng then saw a well on the flat ground three or four zhang deep and covered completely with bricksFaheng thought This is a natural well A man at the side of the well said If it is not natural how could it be a well Faheng saw Fazhu deliberately lean and look toward him and Fazhu said to him You should return by the same route you came onThe dog will not attack you Faheng went back to the riverbank but he did not see the boat on which he had arrivedHe was very thirsty and tried to drink from the river and thereupon he fell into the waterThen Faheng revivedBecause of this experience he renounced the householders life upheld the precepts and did not eat meatDiligently practicing day and night he became a monk of superior conductFaqiao is a disciple of FahengZhao Dynasty Shi Changhe was a native of Gao in the state of ZhaoAt the age of nineteen he became ill and after one month and a few days he diedHis family was poor and could not perform the proper ritual of preserving the body in a coffin prior to burialFour days later he revived and told the following storyAs soon as he died Changhe walked in the southeastern direction and saw two people leading the wayThey were fifty paces ahead of himAs he walked slowly or quickly they accordingly changed their walking speed still leading the way slowly or quickly always maintaining the same distance of fifty paces aheadOn both sides of the road was a thick growth of thorny shrubs Each thorn was like the talon of an eagleHe saw a large group of people running into the thorny shrubs their bodies were injured and torn and their blood flowed all over the groundSeeing Changhe walking on the flat road they all sighed and said Only followers of the Buddha can walk in the middle of the Great Way Further along the road he saw buildings with tiled roofsThere must have been one thousand roomsThere was one very tall building and in this building a very large man wearing a ceremonial black jacket was sitting facing the windowChanghe paid respects to himThe man above in the watchtower said Lord Shi has arrivedIt has been twenty years since we parted Changhe then felt as if he remembered the time of their partingAmong his acquaintances was a man called Mamu MengchengIt had been many years since he and his wife had diedThe man above in the watchtower said Do you know Mengcheng Changhe said that he didThe man in the watchtower said When he was alive Mengcheng failed to practice the Buddhist teaching diligentlyHe is now serving as a house cleaner for me all the timeMengchengs wife was diligent and she now lives in a very pleasant place Pointing with the finger of one hand to a room in the southwest corner he said Mengchengs wife is there Mengchengs wife then opened the window and seeing Changhe she asked very politely how he was doingAfter inquiring about the welfare of the old and young in her extended family she said When Lord Shi returns you should write to me of what you see Suddenly Changhe saw Mengcheng coming from the west of the building holding a broom and dustpan in his handsHe also asked for news of his familyThe man above in the watchtower said I have heard that fish and dragons perform excessively diligently as proof of their faithWhat have you practiced Changhe said I have not eaten fish and meat I have never drunk wineI constantly recite the honored scriptures to seek release from illness and pain The man in the watchtower said You have not forgotten what has been taught to you He spoke for a long timeand then asked the man in charge of the complete records Examine Lord Shis recordDo not make any mistakes The man consulted the record and said His has more than thirty more years of life left The man in the watchtower said Does Lord Shi wish to return or not Changhe answered that he wanted to go backThereupon the man above in the watchtower ordered the man in charge of the records to send him back on a carriage with mounted soldiers and two accompanying officialsChanghe paid respects to the man above in the watchtower took his leave boarded the carriage and returnedAlong the road he had traveled on before there were again the hostels where officials and private guests were eating and drinking what had been provided for them earlierSuddenly he reached homeHe hated the smell of his corpse and did not wish to approach itWhile he was standing by the corpse he was pushed from behind by his deceased sister and fell on top of the corpse and thus revivedThe man of the Way Zhi Fashan had not yet renounced the householders life at that timeWhen he heard Changhes story he decided to enter the WayFashan lived during the Xianhe period Han Dynasty Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty traveled eastward but had not yet gone over Hangu PassOn the road there was a creature several tens of zhang in height and shaped like an oxIt had shining blue eyes and its four feet were buried in the groundYou could not move it even if you pushed with all your mightAll the officials were amazed and frightenedThereupon Dong Fangshuo requested that they pour wine as an offeringThey poured several tens of hu  and the monster then disappearedThe emperor asked the reason for all of thisDong Fangshuo answered This is called the result of suffering from distressed qiThis must have been a place of the jail of the Qin ruling houseIf not it must have been a place where prisoners were gathered together to laborWine causes one to forget distressTherefore the wine could make the monster disappear The emperor said What a knowledgeable scholar On the border between the two districts of Wan and Chuangyang in the Lu Jiang Commandery lived dark blue creaturesThese creatures some larger and others smaller lived in the wild mountains and fields and sometimes the sounds of them weeping could be heardVoices of a group of several tens of people at most both male and female young and old which sounded just like the sorrowful wailing of people who have just lost someone used to be heardPeople who lived nearby would be surprised and go running to the place where the voices were heard but they never saw any human beings thereHowever at the place where the weeping voices were heard there would always be deaths laterIf many voices were heard then a large family would die there later if fewer voices were heard then a small family died thereThe travel record of Wang Xuance relates the following storyIn southwestern Tibet there is a springOn a flat area very hot water shoots forth reaching a height of four or five feetIf you cook meat in this hot spring it becomes well done right awayThe vapor reaches to heaven looking like mistOne old Tibetan says Ten years ago the water shot up to the height of over ten zhang and spread out all over at the topA man riding a horse chasing a deer came directly to the springSince that time the water has not risen up high any more Frequently human skeletons bubble up in the springIf you cover the spring with a piece of thick cloth the cloth rots immediatelyThe spring is sometimes called Cauldron Spring Sixty or seventy yojanas northwest of this spring is another one about as hot as this oneSometimes the spring shoots up violently sounding like a clap of thunderMany smaller hot springs like this are often foundIn China today there are many hot springsIf we infer from the above cases these springs in China are also cauldron springs The reason is as followsIn the Fourpart Vinaya there is this passageThe Buddha said To the north of the city of Rājagṛha there is a hot spring that comes out of hellThe water is very hot when it first comes out but later as it reaches distant places it becomes coolerThe reason it becomes cooler is because other water mixes with it Tang Dynasty Liu Zhigan of Hetong became a Probationary District Magistrate at the beginning of the Zhenguan period One evening he died suddenlyThe following morning he revived and told the following storyAt first he had been chased by an official of hell and reached a big government buildingAfter seeing Zhigan the official said At the present time there is a vacancy in one official positionTherefore we have especially arranged to appoint you to that position Zhigan declined to take the position giving his parents old age as the reasonThen he described his meritorious deeds which should have indicated that he should not yet have diedThe official of the ruler of the hells checked his record and Zhigans words were correctTherefore the official said You are not yet to dieWe could appoint you as an Acting Administrative Assistant Zhigan accepted the position and taking leave of the official he withdrew and went to his officeIn the office five administrative assistants were sitting together Zhigan was the sixthThis office was conducted under a senior officialEach of the three chambers had a platformThe volume of business was quite heavyThere was a seat on the western end where there was no administrative assistant and an official led Zhigan there to take the vacant seatMany officials brought official documentsChoosing his branch they left the documents on the desk and withdrew to the bottom of the staircaseZhigan asked them why they withdrewThey answered The bad air that we carry might distress you They stayed some distance away and answered questions about matters in the documentsZhigan read the documents very carefully and these documents were just like those in the world of living human beingsThen Zhigan wrote down some legal judgmentsAfter a while food was broughtAll the administrative assistants gathered together to eatZhigan also wanted to join them but the Other administrative assistants said Since you are an Acting Administrative Assistant you should not eat this food Zhigan followed their advice and in the end did not eatAt the end of the day an official sent him back home and Zhigan revived Dawn was just breaking in the world of living human beings When the sun went down and it became dark in the world of living human beings the official returned to take Zhigan back to the other world where another day was just startingThus he learned that between the two worlds days and nights are reversedThereafter Zhigan ruled on matters of the world of the dead as an Acting Administrative Assistant at night and occupied the position of District Magistrate during the dayEventually this became his regular patternOne winter Zhigan was in the office of the world of the dead and stood up to go to the lavatoryAt the western end of the hall he saw a woman over thirty years in age handsome in appearance and wearing colorful clothesShe stood there cryingZhigan asked her who she wasShe answered I am the wife of the Administrator and Director of Granaries of the Xingzhou regionI was brought here and was separated from my husbandThat is the reason for this grief Zhigan asked an official of the world of the dead about this and the official said Among those whom the office has brought here is the one you enquired about This confirmed what the woman had said about her husbandZhigan then said to the woman for a long time I have been holding the position of District MagistrateIf your husband happens to be examined fortunately my section is not crowdedI will make sure that the Director of Granaries will not be drawn into this and made to die with you for no purpose The woman said I sincerely wish not to draw him into this but I fear that the officials might persecute him Zhigan said If you do not wish to draw him in you need not worry about anyone else persecuting him When Zhigan went back to the region he first asked the Director of Granaries whether his wife was ill or notThe Director of Granaries said My wife is young and healthy Zhigan then told him what he had seen describing her clothes and appearance and he advised the Director of Granaries to perform meritorious spiritual deedsThe director returned home in a hurry and saw his wife weaving fabric at her loom and he did not take Zhigans words seriouslyMore than ten days later the wife of the Director of Granaries suddenly became ill and diedFrightened the director then performed meritorious spiritual deeds and sacrificesOn another occasion two scholars in the Xingzhou region who had passed the local examinations were going to the capital to be assigned their positionsThey said to Zhigan You serve as a judge in the netherworldPlease tell us the positions to which we will be assigned Zhigan went to his office in the netherworld and asked a minor secretary about the matter giving the family and personal names of the two candidatesThe secretary said The files are sealed in a stone boxAfter looking into the matter I will be able to report back to you in two days When the time came the secretary gave his report describing in detail the names of the positions that the two candidates were going to obtain later that yearZhigan told the two people about thisWhen they came to the capital and received the appointments both of the positions assigned by the Ministry of Personnel were completely different from those that Zhigan had told them aboutThe official of the Xingzhou region heard about this and told Zhigan what had happenedZhigan later asked the minor secretary who checked the files again and said Definitely there is no mistake in the results of my earlier investigation When the names of those who received appointments went to the higher office of the Chancellery for final approval the Chancellery rejected the recommendations of the Office of Personnel and revised the two candidates assignmentsThe new assignments matched the records in the files in the netherworldWhenever Zhigan saw the names circumstances and dates of death of his relatives and acquaintances he reported back to those concerned who could then perform meritorious spiritual deeds and avoid painful experiences after deathAfter Zhigan had served for three years as Acting Administrative Assistant the official from his branch in the netherworld came to him and said We have been able to appoint Li Sihu of the Longzhou region as a regular official to replace youDo not write any more judgments Returning to the regional office in the world of the living Zhigan therefore told Regional Inspector Li about what he had learnedLi Defeng sent a man to the Longzhou region to enquire about the matterA man called Sihu had died thereThe date of his death matched the time given by the official in the netherworld Zhigans contact with the netherworld ceased from this time onLater the Regional Office ordered Zhigan to take prisoners to the capital cityWhen they came to the border of the Fengzhou region all four of the prisoners escaped Zhigan was distressed fearing that they would not be able to recapture the escaped prisonersWhile he stayed in the residence at night the old official from the netherworld suddenly appeared and said We have all of the prisonersOne is dead the other three are in the western valley of the Southern MountainThey have all been capturedPlease do not trouble yourself about this matter any more After saying these words the official took his leave and departedZhigan immediately asked the secular officials and soldiers to go to the western valley of the Southern Mountain and they found the four prisoners as predictedKnowing that they could not escape the prisoners came out to fight the search partyZhigan overcame them killing one and capturing the other three just as he had been told would be the caseAt the present time Zhigan is assigned to a post in the south in the Cizhou region and is in charge of legal mattersLiu Heng Chief Minister of Splendid Happiness told this story to Tang Ling Heng had once been Regional Inspector of Qiongzhou and on seeing Zhigan he questioned him directly himselfRoyal Scribe Pei Tongjie is also said to have seen ZhiganSeveral people say that they can confirm these

and show the shadow and traces of the Perfected PersonLike wind in a valley that follows the roaring of tigers or auspicious clouds that rise after jumping dragons stimuli and responses correspond to each otherMiraculous incidents occur simply following unchanging principlesfrom the time the trees at the Deer Park first gave expression to the light until the Gold River marked the concealment of the bright lightSentient beings of the period of the imitation Dharma turn toward auspicious manifestationsThough one thousand buddhas differ in their traces their wisdom and path are one and the sameCompassionate without discrimination they follow natural desires and bring benefit to living beingsHaving made the universal vow to establish the buddha land they steer the boat of compassion in order to save those who are drowning Sentient beings respond to this because their capacities and external conditions match each other CommentThe present belongs to the world age of the wise Time is divided into four periods formation duration destruction and emptinessOf these four periods of time the world age of formation has already passed but the world age of destruction has not yet arrivedThe present is the world age of durationOne thousand buddhas appear during this periodSpeaking broadly three buddhas have already gone byThe present is the period of the teaching left by the fourth buddha ākyamuniEach of the four periods is divided into twenty minor world ages There are altogether eighty minor world agesThe first is the world age of the great flood conflagration and windsThe present is called the world age of the wise but more specifically the present is part of one of the twenty minor world ages distinguished within the world age of durationThe Lishi apitan lun says Eleven world ages are in the future and eight world ages are in the pastThe present ākyamuni Buddha attained buddhahood in the ninth world ageQuestion In the present world age of the wise the buddhas do not appear in the world during the world ages of formation destruction and emptinessThey choose only the world age of duration Again within this world age only eleven minor world ages are still left in the futureHow can it be that nine hundred and ninetysix buddhas are yet to appear together in the remaining eleven world agesAnswerThis is indeed difficult to understandEven the ancient buddhas had such restrictions The meaning is obscureLet us learn the outline of this matter by consulting the Yaowang yaosheng jing and the Foming jing We will first record a passage from the Yaowang yaosheng jing and then confirm it by quoting from the Foming jingThere are differences in the timing of world agesThe Yaowang yaosheng jing saysAt that time ākyamuni Buddha told the congregation Innumerable world ages ago in the last period of the Dharma of the Buddha of Wondrous Light I renounced the householders life and studying the Way heard the names of these fiftythree buddhasWhen I heard them I joined my hands together in reverence and felt joyful at heartFurthermore I taught others and made them remember them After hearing these names of the buddhas others also taught them in their turnIn this way three thousand people recited these same sounds of the names of the buddhas with their three thousand mouths and paid respect to them with deep devotionThus they could overcome the sins committed during their rebirths in innumerable numbers of world agesThe list of the first one thousand buddhas begins with Huaguang Buddha and ends with Viśvabhū BuddhaThey attained buddhahood during the world age of ornamentation just preceding the present world age of the wiseThese buddhas are the one thousand buddhas of the pastThe list of the one thousand buddhas of the present world age begins with Krakucchanda Buddha and ends with Ruci TathāgataThese buddhas will attain buddhahood one after another during the present world age of the wiseThe list of the last one thousand buddhas begins with Riguang Tathāgata and ends with Xumixiang BuddhaThese buddhas will attain buddhahood during the future world age of the lunar stations If we follow the Foming jing In the ninetyfirst world age counted backward from the present there was a buddha called Vipaśyin in the thirtieth world age counted backward from the present a buddha came into the world the name of this buddha was ikhin in this same world age another buddha came into the world the name of this buddha was Viśvabhū TathāgataQuestionAre these ninetyone world ages major world ages or minor world agesAnswer They are major world agesQuestionHow do you know that Answer According to the old Posha lun ākyamuni Bodhisattva planted the seeds of good works for the primary and secondary marks of the buddhahood since Vipaśyin BuddhaHe had lived through ninetyone major world ages before he reached the present ninth world age of durationAccording to the old Jushe lun  because of the vigorous efforts of worshiping Tiṣya Buddha ākyamuni Bodhisattva was able to skip the nine major world ages to ultimately attain buddhahood Therefore we know that the nine world ages are major world agesHow could the remaining ninetyone world ages not also be major world agesIn addition according to the Yaowang yaoshang jing he past world age of ornamentation the present world age of the wise and the future world age of the lunar stations will each see the appearance of one thousand buddhasThus we learn that these world ages are major immeasurable world agesAgain it is said in the Yaowang jing If good men and women and all other beings hear these fiftythree names of the buddhas these people will not be reborn in the lower realms of beings during the subsequent trillion immeasurable world agesThe text continues in this manner turning one by one to the past world age of ornamentation present world age of the wise and the future world age of the lunar stations each of which sees the appearance of one thousand buddhasThus we learn that these creatures pass through the major world ages or immeasurable world agesAs for the present world age of the wise in which four buddhas have already appeared this is also an immeasurable world age not a minor world age of durationSince it is a major world age there is no doubt about the fact that in the present world age of the wise one thousand buddhas will appearThe Chang ahan jing says In the ninetyfirst world age going back into the past there was a buddha called VipaśyinIn the thirtyfirst world age back into the past a buddha appeared in the world who was called ikhinIn the thirtyfirst world age back into the past a buddha appeared in the world who was called ViśvabhūThe buddhas ikhin and Viśvabhū are none other than the two buddhas mentioned in the Foming jing which says that in the same world age two buddhas appeared in the worldIt may be that the translator of the Chang ahan jing repeated the expression in the thirtyfirst world ages into the past by mistakeThere is also another viewAccording to the Lishi apitan lun refT There have already been three buddhas that appeared in the worldākyamuni appeared in the present ninth world ageThus in the past nine world ages four buddhas have already appearedThere are still eleven world ages in the futureHow could anyone know that there wont be many more buddhas appearing in this future periodA scripture says Sometimes incalculable numbers of buddhas appear during one world age sometimes an infinite number of world ages passes without a single buddha appearing in the world To infer from this even in a minor world age many buddhas may appear in the worldNothing prevents thisSince the capacities of sentient beings differ in strength at different times the frequency of auspicious events also differs It is difficult to learn what this means The meaning becomes clear after further inference CommentThe realm where these one thousand buddhas of the world age of the wise teach includes the realm under the rule of the Zhou dynasty but it is extended to include the entire universe covering the three thousand great chiliocosmsThe land in which the buddhas dwell is at the very centerThis is so that the teaching of the Buddha is initiated at the center of the empty space of the human mind and reaches externally human beings in all placesBecause this land is the center of everything the vajra throne is located thereSuch a seat is absent in other areas Therefore the buddhas do not dwell thereThe Ruiying jing says This land is at the center of three thousand suns and moons and twelve thousand heavens and earthsThe august Buddha does not appear in peripheral areasIf he were to dwell on the periphery the ground would incline as a consequenceTherefore when buddhas appeared in the past they always appeared hereMiraculous responses all occur in the same wayThis passage demonstrates the truth of our observation aboveThe Chang ahan jing saysIn the ninetyfirst world age going back into the past a buddha appeared in the world His name was VipaśyinAt that time the life span of human beings was eighty thousand yearsIn the thirtyfirst world age in the past a buddha appeared in the world His name was ikhinAt that time the life span of human beings was seventy thousand yearsIn the thirtyfirst world age in the past a buddha appeared in the world His name was ViśvabhūAt that time people lived sixty thousand yearsEarlier in the world age of the wise a buddha appeared into the world His name was KrakucchandaAt that time the life span of human beings was fifty thousand yearsAlso during the world age of the wise a buddha appeared in the world His name was KanakaAt that time the life span of human beings was forty thousand yearsAlso during the world age of the wise a buddha appeared in the world His name was called KāśyapaAt that time the life span of human beings was twenty thousand yearsI now appear in the world At this time the life span of human beings is one hundred years A few people live longer but the majority live for a time span shorter than thisAccording to the Zhidu lun and Katyāyanas Treatise  ākyamuni was to appear when human beings lived ten thousand yearsHe observed the sentient beings in the world but from the time of the ten thousandyear life span on there were no beings with the appropriate capacity for salvationWhen the time came when sentient beings had a life span of one hundred years he saw that their suffering was intense and that the world age was about to endTherefore he came into the worldThese treatises therefore say that at the end of a world age a buddha makes the world flourish at the beginning of a world age a universal monarch appears these two circumstances are different The topic is discussed below in the section on the universal monarch ref Fayuan zhulin TabThe information below is based on the Zengyi ahan jing  and the Qifo fumu xingzi jing The first buddha Vipaśyin the second buddha ikhin the third buddha Viśvabhūthese three buddhas had the same surname Kuru NoteThe Chang ahan jing Tc says that the first buddha had the name Vipaśyin  the second ikhin and the third Viśvabhū The fourth buddha Krakucchanda the fifth buddha Kanakamuni the sixth buddha Kāśyapathese three buddhas had the same surname KāśyapaThe Chang ahan jing Ta says that the fourth had the name Krakucchanda Buddha  the fifth Kanaka Buddha and the sixth had the name Kāśyapa Buddha which is the same as above The seventh buddha is our present ākyamuniHis surname is GautamaThe Qifo fumu xingzi jing Tbc refChang ahan jing Ta says The first buddha Vipaśyin the second buddha ikhin and the third buddha Viśvabhūthese three buddhas were equally of the warrior class The fourth buddha Krakucchanda the fifth buddha Kanakamuni and the sixth buddha Kāśyapathese three buddhas were equally of the priestly class The seventh buddha ākyamuni whom I now have become is of the warrior classAs for the first Vipaśyin Buddha his fathers name was Warrior King Bandhumant his mothers name was Bandhumatī the name of the state they governed was BandhumatīAs for the second ikhin Buddha his fathers name was Warrior King Aruṇavan his mothers name was Prabhāvatī the name of the state they governed was AruṇavatīAs for the third Viśvabhū Buddha his fathers name was Warrior King Supratīta his mothers name was Yaśavatī the name of the state they governed was AnupamaAs for the fourth Krakucchanda Buddha his fathers name was Agnidatta Brahman his mothers name was Vaiśākha the name of the state they governed was Kṣemāvatī the name of the king was KṣemaAs for the fifth Kanakamuni Buddha his fathers name was Yajñadatta Brahman his mothers name was Uttarā the name of the state they governed was obhavatī the name of its king was obhaAs for the sixth Kāśyapa Buddha his fathers name was Agnidatta Brahman  his mothers name was Dhanavatī the name of the state they governed was Vārāṇasī the name of its king was KṛkiAs for the seventh ākyamuni Buddha whom I now have become the fathers name is Warrior King uddhodana the mothers name is Mahāmāyā the name of the state they govern is Kapilavastu and the name of the previous great king was PantiTo speak from a broader point of view there are four classesfirst the priests  second the warriors  third the merchants and farmers  and fourth the serfs The last two classes are inferior and not the vehicle for the Great SageThe earlier two are noble and are vehicles for the birth of the truly enlightened onesThe moral conduct of the priests is pure and loftyThe fearsome authority and kindness of the warriors are widely known The Zhidu lun says that the Buddha was born among the class that was most honored at the timeākyamuni appeared in the world when it was governed by strengthHe was incarnated as a warrior king to demonstrate his fearsome authorityKāśyapa was born at a time when everyone was good and obedientHe dwelled in pure conduct and became a model of virtueWhen the first Vipaśyin Buddha attained the Way and became the Buddha it was under a pātaliya treeWhen the second ikhin Buddha attained the Way and became the Buddha it was under a puṇḍarīka treeWhen the third Viśvabhū Buddha attained the Way and became the Buddha it was under a śāla treeWhen the fourth Krakucchanda Buddha attained the Way and became the Buddha it was under a śirīṣa treeWhen the fifth Kanakamuni Buddha attained the Way and became the Buddha it was under an udumbara treeWhen the sixth Kāśyapa Buddha attained the Way and became the Buddha it was under the a nyagrodha treeWhen the seventh ākyamuni Buddha whom I have now become became the Buddha it was under an apeituoluo treeBeautiful temple buildings do not count as accomplishments for those who have renounced the householders lifeThe regulations of purity for those who have entered the Way specify pine forests and grasses as suitable dwelling places Why is this soThe people of the world value their bodies and therefore dwell in beautiful housesThe people of the Way consider household life to be bondage and therefore abandon and reject itNone of those who engage in the hundred trades and services could have attained enlightenment earlierThe teacher who trains us is said to have been wise by birth His attainment of the Way final extinction  birth and preaching all took place under a treeThe meaning of this fact is He cut off his hair pulled out the hair pin rejected all honors and shaved his headhow could anyone fail to look up to him and place their trust in himAccording to the Guanfo sanmei jing Ta b  Vipaśyin Buddhas height was sixty yojanas and the halo of light around his head was one hundred and twenty yojanas in diameter ikhin Buddhas height was forty yojanas the halo of light around his head was fortyfive yojanas in diameter and the light around his body extended for one hundred yojanas Viśvabhū Buddhas height was thirtytwo yojanas the halo of light around his head was fortytwo yojanas in diameter and the light around his body extended for sixtytwo yojanas Krakucchanda Buddhas height was twentyfive yojanas the halo of light around his head was thirtytwo yojanas in diameter and the light around his body extended for fifty yojanas Kanakamuni Buddhas height was twentyfive yojanas the halo of light around his head was thirty yojanas in diameter and the light around his body extended for forty yojanas Kāśyapa Buddhas height was sixteen zhang the halo of light around his head was twenty yojanas in diameter ākyamuni Buddhas height is six zhang and the halo of light around his head is seven zhang in diameterThe color of the bodies of these seven buddhas is purplish gold To enquire into the matter respectfully there is no distinction and order of superiority and inferiority among the Dharma bodies of the buddhasTheir manifestations are different only because they follow the capacities and karmic conditions of their listenersTherefore when he appeared in the world ākyamunis color was purplish gold but a thousand monks all saw it as redSixteen lay believers with their biases saw it as greyThe difference is due to the differences between the monks and the laypeople The Buddha was always the sameIf you understand the matter on the basis of this example you will be free from error The Mile xiasheng jing says The height was one thousand chi and the halo around the head was twenty zhang in diameter The first Vipaśyin Buddha preached on three occasions altogetherOn the first occasion one hundred thousand monks attained arhatship on the second occasion ninety thousand monks attained arhatship on the third occasion eighty thousand monks attained arhatshipThe Chang ahan jing Tb saysOn the first occasion of the preaching of Vipaśyin Buddha there were one hundred and sixtyeight thousand disciples on the second occasion there were one hundred thousand disciples and on the third occasion there were three hundred and sixtyeight thousand disciples The second ikhin Buddha taught on three occasionsOn the first occasion of his preaching ninety thousand monks attained arhatship on the second occasion eighty thousand monks attained arhatship on the third occasion seventy thousand monks attained arhatshipThe Chang ahan jing Tb saysikhin Buddha on the first occasion of his preaching had one hundred thousand disciples the number on the second and third occasions was the same The third Viśvabhū Buddha preached on two occasionsOn the first occasion of his preaching seventy thousand monks attained arhatship on the second occasion sixty thousand monks attained arhatshipThe fourth Krakucchanda Buddha preached on one occasionForty thousand monks attained arhatshipThe fifth Kanakamuni Buddha preached on one occasionThirty thousand monks attained arhatshipThe sixth Kāśyapa Buddha preached on one occasionTwenty thousand monks attained arhatshipThe seventh ākyamuni Buddha whom I have now become preached on one occasion and one thousand two hundred and fifty monks attained arhatshipComment According to the list given above the seven buddhas preached and saved different numbers of peopleThese numbers are based on the Small Vehicle teachingWhen the Tathāgata first attained buddhahood he saved the followers of wrong teachings they rejected their mistaken views and adopted the correct one as hearers and disciples they intimately served himThe number of these people was limited to those given hereIf one bases their calculation on the entire lifetime of the Buddhas preaching in which he saved followers of the three vehicles and caused them to enter the Way then the number is infiniteThus Dharma Master Xuanzang says the followingAccording to the view prevalent in the West the teaching life of ākyamuni is divided into three periods during the first period he preached the teaching of form for the sake of the hearers in order to destroy their attachment to nonBuddhist teachings and awaken and lead them to attain the Way in the second period he preached the teaching of nonform for the sake of the bodhisattvas of minor attainment in order to destroy their views of hearers and cause them to awaken to the Great Vehicle of nonform in the third period he preached the teaching of both form and nonform for the sake of the bodhisattvas of greater attainment in order to destroy the teaching of form and of nonform and cause them to awaken to the Middle Way and the ultimate and perfect teachingDuring each of these three periods he adapted his teaching to his audiences capacities and taught widely and without limitsSome followed the disciples of these teachings of the three vehicles and then the disciples of these disciples and so on as the transmission spreadThose who heard the teaching in this manner and attained the Way were as numerous as the infinite number of particles of dust and grains of sandThe Buddhas teaching cannot be fixed in one piece of writing and cannot be limited to one meaningThe Chang ahan jing saysVipaśyin Buddha had two disciples one was called Khaṇḍa the other Tiṣyaikhin Buddha had two disciples one was called Abhibhū the other SaṃbhavaViśvabhū Buddha had two disciples one was called Fuyou  the other UttaraKrakucchanda Buddha had two disciplesone was called Sañjīva the other VidhuraKanaka Buddha had two disciples one was called Youboxianduo  the other Yuduolou Kāśyapa Buddha had two disciples one was called Tiṣya the other BharadvājaI now have two disciplesone is called āriputra and the other MahāmaudgalyāyanaThe list above gives the names of two disciples for each buddhaThis is because they were the first among the hearers and therefore are mentioned separately from others Vipaśyin Buddha had an attendant disciple called Aśoka ikhin Buddha had an attendant disciple called Kṣemaṅkura Viśvabhū Buddha had an attendant disciple called Upaśāntā Krakucchanda Buddha had an attendant disciple called Buddhija Kanaka Buddha had an attendant disciple called Svaskika Kāśyapa Buddha had an attendant disciple called Sarvamitra I now have an attendant disciple called nandaVipaśyin Buddha had a son called Fangying ikhin Buddha had a son called Wuliang Viśvabhū Buddha had a son called Miaojue Kraku cchanda Buddha had a son called Shangsheng Kanaka Buddha had a son called Daoshi Kāśyapa Buddha had a son called Jinjun I now have a son called RāhulaThe Pusa benxing jing saysAfter the tathāgata Vipaśyin Buddha disappeared the true Dharma remained in the world for twenty thousand years after the tathāgata Shenwenfo Buddha disappeared the true Dharma remained in the world for sixty thousand years  after the tathāgata Krakucchanda Buddha disappeared the correct teaching remained in the world for five hundred years after Kanakamuni Tathāgata disappeared the true Dharma remained in the world for twentynine days after the tathāgata Kāśyapa Buddha disappeared the true Dharma remained in the world for seven days after the tathāgata ākyamuni Buddha disappeared the true Dharma remained in the world for four hundred years the imitation Dharma also remained in the world for five hundred years NoteAccording to the Shanjian lun  the true Dharma remained in the world for one thousand years Introduction Scriptural Evidence and Karmic CausesThe vehicles of one thousand buddhas are bright ten thousand spirits look up to their light The buddhas observe beings capacities and attend to their worksThe buddhas are most holy and their love is allencompassingTherefore the holy ones describe happiness in order to encourage good deeds and point to disasters to warn about evil onesInferior people say that good deeds produce no benefits and they do not perform them they say that evil deeds do no harm and they do not control themThus mere statements of disastrous or happy consequences are only flowery words without substance arguments that insist that there are no beneficial or harmful consequences are believed and considered to be proven by evidenceFor this reason the great holy ones full of great love and compassion take pity on these ignorant and deluded beingsThey widely promote the teaching of the six perfections of wisdom to guide all beings of the different types of birth they broadly declare the teaching of the two truths and end the poisonous effects in the three realms of existenceTherefore they show infinite compassion and attend to the karmic conditions of the present age of the wiseThe Wuxianren jing saysInnumerable world ages ago holy people lived in a forest four of them were masters and one was a servantThe latter was never unhappy about his statusOne day he went to gather fruit and juice and by mistake failed to return on time Since it was past midday the holy people could not eatResentment in someones mind can work as evil magic The holy one who was a servant to the others felt the effects of their resentment and diedHe was then born among humansA brahman who could read facial features predicted that he would become a kingLater he in fact became a kingthe Buddha said The king was none other than I myselfThe four holy people were Krakucchanda Buddha Kanakamuni Buddha Kāśyapa Buddha and Maitreya BuddhaThe brahman was Devadatta The Zhidu lun saysWhen the world age ends in fire everything is reduced to emptinessBecause of the power of sentient beings beneficial merit a wind blows in all directions and holds up a great body of waterThere is a being with one thousand heads and two thousand arms and legsHe is called the god ViṣṇuOut of his navel a golden lotus flower of most precious jewels with one thousand petals appearsIts light is as bright as ten thousand suns shining at the same timeIn the middle of the flower there is a person sitting with legs crossed and he is also infinitely brightHe is called King BrahmāEight children are born from his mindThese eight children give birth to heaven earth and peopleKing Brahmā sits upon a lotus flowerFor this reason because the buddhas follow the ways of the world they are said to sit on lotus flowers with crossed legs and preach the six perfections of wisdom The Dabei jing saysThe Buddha said to nanda Why is the present world age called the world age of the wiseIt is for the following reason These three thousand great chiliocosms were all one mass of water when this world age was about to beginAt that time the uddhāvāsa deities observed with their divine eyes that the world was only a great mass of waterThey saw that there were one thousand stems of lotus flowersEach of the lotus flowers was called one thousand petals The lotus flowers color was golden and their golden light illumined everywhere and the fragrance in the air was extremely pleasurableWhen the uddhāvāsa deities saw this joy arose in their heartsPraising this vision they said How extraordinaryIn this world age one thousand buddhas will appear in the world Because of this the present world age is called the world age of the wiseAfter I disappear nine hundred and ninetysix buddhas will appear in the world during the world age of the wiseKrakucchanda Buddha was the first and I am the fourthMaitreya will then take my place In this way buddhas will continue to appear until Ruci TathāgataYou should know this sequence The Qianfo yinyuan jing saysAt that time the Buddha was coming out of a rock cave in Mount Gṛdhra kūṭa in RājagṛhaHe asked nanda What doctrines are the hearers and bodhisattvas preaching now nanda replied to the Buddha Worldhonored One each of the bodhisattvas is preaching the conditions of his own previous lives At that time Bhadrapāla Bodhisattva said to the Buddha I would like to ask a few questions todayPlease Worldhonored One explain these things to me When he uttered these words eightyfour thousand bodhisattvas all took off their precious necklaces and scattered them around the Buddha as offeringsThe necklaces scattered around the Buddha stayed on top of the Buddhas headThey looked like Mount Sumeru awesome to observeAt that time one thousand buddhas manifested themselves sitting in the middle of the mountain caveAt that time bodhisattvas said to the Buddha Worldhonored One what sort of meritorious seeds did these one thousand buddhas of the present world age of the wise plant in the past world for all of them to be born in the same place together in the same household and in one and the same world age to obtain enlightenment one after another in order to teach and save sentient beings At that time the Worldhonored One said to the bodhisattvas I will explain this in detail for youYou should now know that infinite numbers of trillions of infinite world ages ago or again twice that long a time ago this world was called Great AdornmentThe world age was called Great TreasureThere was a buddha called Baodengyanwang  TathāgataThe lifetime of that buddha was half a world age After the buddhas disappearance the period of instruction of the world with the true Dharma lasted for one world age the period of instruction of the world with the imperfect Dharma after that lasted for two world agesDuring the period of the imperfect Dharma there was a king called Guangde  who instructed people by performing the ten types of good deeds and was like a universal monarchAt that time the great king instructed people to recite the Pituolun There were then one thousand youths in schoolall aged fifteen intelligent and knowledgeableThey heard the monks praise the Buddha Dharma and SanghaA boy named Lianhuade said to the monk Shancheng  What are the Buddha Dharma and Sangha The monk answered  Fully endowed with the perfections His pure nature realizes wisdomSince he has achieved the superior state of mind He is called the Buddha Undefiled its nature is pure And forever detached from the world Not contemplating the world which is nothing but the five skandhas  It is eternal and is called the Dharma bodies and minds permanently in a state of nonaction And forever rejecting the four types of food  They serve as the field of merit for the world Therefore these monks are called the SanghaWhen the one thousand youths heard the name of the Three Jewels each of them holding incense and flowers followed the monks and entered the stupa to worshipOn seeing the Buddhas physical appearance they all threw themselves onto the floor bowing their heads to the ground and elbows and knees in the act of worshipIn front of the image they made the universal vow of bodhisattvasEach cherished the aspiration for supreme enlightenment After many world ages will all attain buddhahood without failThey will succeed just as the present Worldhonored One succeededTheir lives differ in length but when they are about to die because of the meritorious causal condition of hearing the names of the Three Jewels the karmic effects of births and deaths lasting for fiftyone world ages will be removed from them and when their lives end they will attain rebirth in Brahmā HeavenRecalling that in their past lives they heard the names of the Three Jewels they will achieve rebirth in heaven one thousand kings of Brahmā gods each on top of his palace and holding flowers of seven treasures arrived at the stupa and presented offerings to the buddha imageThe one thousand kings of the Brahmā gods unanimously proclaimed the following verseIf we pronounce the Great Name of the Buddha  We dwell in the good and quiet land of nirvana forever If we hear the Name of the Buddha and remove all evils We are spontaneously reborn in Brahmā Heaven We now kneel to pay respect And take refuge in the Great Liberation After saying this verse each king returned to Brahmā HeavenBhadrapāla you must now know the followingThe king of that state who instructed people by performing the ten types of good deeds has long since attained buddhahoodHe is Vipaśyin TathāgataThe monk Shan cheng is ikhin TathāgataThe one thousand youths of that time are none other than the tathāgatas of the present age starting with Kraku cchanda Buddha and leading to the very last tathāgata RuciBhadrapāla you should now know the followingMyself and the one thousand bodhisattvas of the present world age of the wise heard the name of the Three Jewels at the place of that buddha and first cherished the aspiration for supreme enlightenmentThis is how the matter stands The Buddha said to Bhadrapāla An innumerable number of immeasurable world ages ago in this sahā world there was a large kingdom called VārāṇasīThe name of the king was Fande The king always taught the people the good DharmaAfter handing the kingdom over to his son he renounced the householders life studied the Way and became a pratyekabuddhaLeaping up into the sky he performed eighteen miraculous featsAt that time one thousand kings of the Brahmā gods each wearing a heap of beautiful flowers on his shoulder scarf went to the udumbara forest and offered the flowers to the pratyekabuddhaThey said to the Buddha Virtuous One please preach the teaching to us Then the prat yeka buddha leaped up into the sky and performed the eighteen miraculous feats stretching his arms and showing his legsAmong the kings of Brahmā gods was one called HuijianHe said to the other Brahmā kings I see that the pratyekabuddha upholds the five precepts of lay followersFollowing the teaching of mental and bodily purity we should perform the ten types of good deeds and contemplate the doctrine of causality If we transfer the merits of these good roots toward the goal of attaining that extremely profound supreme enlightenment and make the vow that we shall attain buddhahood that would be trillions of times better than the attainments of this pratyekabuddha Then after the lives of the one thousand Brahmā kings came to an end they were reborn as one thousand universal monarchs in one thousand sets of the four cosmic continents in the sahā worldTheir life span was eightyfour thousand yearsWhen were about to die there was at that time a brahman in the HimalayasHe was intelligent and knowledgeable and had a life span of half a world ageEarlier in a scripture he had heard of the past buddha called Zhantanzhuangyan TathāgataThat buddha preached the very profound teaching of the perfection of giving if one transcends the artificially conceived distinction between giving and receiving ones mind will be in peaceThe great holy man came out of the Himalayas when he heard about this and visited the one thousand holy kings to praise the teaching of givingThereupon each of the one thousand holy kings handed his kingdom over to his son and renounced the householders life in order to study the WayAt that time each of the one thousand holy kings built a hut in the Himalayas and sought the supreme WayThey attained the five supernatural powers and flew up into the skyTheir life span became one world ageAt that time there was a large demon in the HimalayasIts body was four thousand li long and its fangs extended eighty li in an upward directionIts face was twelve li wide and bloodcolored light which resembled molten copper came out from its eyesThe demon held a sword in his left hand and a trident in his rightStanding in front of the holy kings he shouted loudly I am now hungry and thirsty but there is nothing to eat or to drinkKings please take pity on me and give me some food and drink The one thousand holy kings then said to the demon We have made the vow to give everything as an offering They each poured water on the demons hands and gave him fruit to eat such as holy men themselves eatWhen he received the fruit the demon became very angry and threw it on the groundHe said to the kings My father was a demon and ate the vital parts of human beingsMy mother was a demoness and always ate the hearts of human beings and drank their warm bloodI am now very hungry and need the hearts and blood of human beingsWhat can I do with fruit The one thousand holy kings then said to the demon Nothing is more difficult to give as an offering than ones own bodyToday we cannot give up our hearts and bring them to you for your use Thereupon the demon said in verseContemplate that the heart has no real characteristic of a heart That it is only the product of the four elements of matter Only if one can give up everything Should what he practices be called the bodhisattva practice At that time there was a brahman in the Himalayas whose name was LaodubatiHe said to the demon Great master please preach the teaching for meI now do not begrudge you either my heart or my blood With these words he took off his clothes and spread them to make a high seat and asked the demon to sit thereThereupon the great demon spoke in verse Desiring to seek the unconditioned Way Do not begrudge having bodies or minds cut apart Cutting them up feel pain But can bear that pain with a firmness that is like the Firmness of the very earth on which walkNot feeling pain There is no regret in mind that seeks the Way Not begrudging anything Just as if saving head that is on fire Rescue many who are hungry and thirsty without discrimination Only then should what do be called the bodhisattva practice When Laodubati heard this verse his body and mind were filled with joyImmediately he took a sharp dagger and pierced his chest to take out his heartAt that very moment the goddess of the earth emerged from the ground and said to Laodubati Please great holy one take pity on us and on the gods of the treesDo not give up your body and life for the sake of a demon Laodubati said to the gods in verse The body is like an illusory flame It appears due to karmic conditions and then changes and disappears It is like the echo of a voice Once the calling stops there is no more response It is based on the powers of the four elements and the five skandhas Their force does not remain foreverDuring trillions of years there has never been anyone who died Because he did something for the Dharma For the Dharma I now sacrifice my heart and blood Do not hinder me and deprive me of supreme wisdom As the reward for this sacrificial gift I vow wishing to attain the Buddhas path That if I later attain buddhahood I will first bring salvation to youAfter saying these verses Laodubati lay down in front of the demon and piercing his neck with a sword he made an offering of his blood to the demonThen he cut open his chest removed his heart and gave it to the demonAt that moment heaven and earth shook greatly the sun lost its light and lightning flashed in the sky although there were no cloudsFive demons appeared from the four directions and scrambled to eat the offering grabbing pieces of the tornup heartAfter they ate the offering they flew up into the sky and said to the one thousand holy kings Who could perform an act of giving like LaodubatiOnly if you can perform the act of giving like this can you become a buddha Then the one thousand holy kings were frightened and withdrew no longer desiring enlightenmentFull of regret they all wanted to return to their kingdomsThen the five demons said in verse Not to kill is the seed of buddhahood A compassionate mind is the best medicine The Great Compassionate One is eternally in a state of peace He is forever free from the illusion of old age and deathAll those who receive bodies fear others who kill and poison For this reason bodhisattvas teach us the precept of not killing If you now fear death Constantly practice the precept of not killing Why do you want to return to your kingdoms  Giving up quietude and seeking the noisy worldWhen the one thousand holy kings heard these words they all fell silent The Buddha said to Bhadrapāla Bodhisattva You must now know the followingThe first brahman who praised the perfection of giving is the past buddha Dingguangmingwang Laodubati is the past buddha DīpaṅkaraThe one thousand holy kings left the householders life and studied the Way and they met Dīpaṅkara BuddhaThey practiced austerities and then had regret in their minds they fell into the Great Hell and stayed there for a period of one world ageEven though they had fallen into hell however because their minds had once been adorned by the power of their vows to attain enlightenment the fires in hell could not burn themAfter this period of time they again met Dingguangmingwang Bodhisattva and thanks to his preaching they came out of hellThey extensively praised the liberation of the past one thousand buddhas and ornamented those buddhasAt the time of Zizaiwang Buddha the one thousand holy kings heard the names of the one thousand buddhas and overjoyed they reverently worshiped the buddhasBecause of this karmic condition they were released from the sins that would have resulted in births and deaths as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River multiplied by nine hundred million nayutasBhadrapāla you must now knowthe one thousand holy kings are none other than the one thousand buddhas of our world age of the wise Introduction The Royal Tribe The Clan and MarriageTo enquire respectfully the lineage of King uddhodana begins with King IkṣuvākuUniversal monarchs followed one after another and millions of clanspeople shone in light like so many leaves of a treeTherefore when ākyamuni appeared temporarily in this world he chose to be born in this prominent lineage even more greatly manifesting its later generationsAppearing in Kapilavastu as a golden figure six zhang in height and manifesting the thirtytwo marks of a buddha he took charge of spiritual instruction for three thousand great chiliocosmsTaking pity on those who are submerged in the four violent streams of defilement he sends out the boat of the six perfections for their salvationThe Chang ahan jing saysWhen heaven and earth were formed the heavenly deities came down and eating food they became human beingsBecause conflicts arose human beings after discussion established a rulerElecting one person as the one most honored among nobles they installed him as the head of the kingdom to govern the peopleThis person was the king who became the ancestor of the ākya tribe Details were presented in the section on the world ages above Fayuan zhulin Tc The Loutan jing saysLater kings did not govern as well as the first kings and their life span decreasedThe human life span used to be eighty thousand yearsAfter this development the life span became ten thousand years and eventually one hundred yearsAt the beginning of the world age there was a king called Mahāsammata According to the Sifen l  there were altogether eightyfour thousand two hundred and fiftythree kings who appeared in the worldAmong these were the ten universal monarchs who ruled over the four realms under heavenOther kings cannot be listed in detailOnly the names of the seven ancestors of the Tathāgata are listedThe Wufen lThere was a past king called Yumo Note The Sifen l Tb calls him Yishimo This king had four sons the first was called Zhaomu NoteThe Chang ahan jing Tc calls him Mianguang the second was called Congmu Note The same scripture calls him Shizhong  the third was called Tiaoxiang Note The same scripture calls him Luzhi and the fourth was called Nilou  King Nilou had a son called WutouluoKing Wutouluo had a son called JutouluoKing Jutouluo had a son called ShixiuluoKing Shixiuluo had four sonsthe first was called Jingfan  the second Bofan the third Hufan  and the fourth Ganlufan The Chang ahan jing  the Sifen lTb called King uddhodana and he had two sons NoteOne was the Bodhisattva and the other Nanda the second was called Bofan and he had two sons  the third was called King Drotodana and he had two sons Note One was Mahānāma and the other Aniruddha and the fourth was called Amṛtādana and he had two sonsThe Zhidu lun says King Siṃhahanu had a daughter called Ganluwei and she had a son called Shipoluo  According the Za ahan jing  The son of the Worldhonored Ones aunt was called the monk Tiṣyā The Fenbie gongde lun saysnanda had a sister who left the householders life and became a nun She disliked Kāśyapa who had disparagingly called nanda a small childThe Dafangbian jing says From the beginning of the world age each successor in the lineage of uddhodana became a universal monarchThose in the last two generations however did not become universal monarchs but became the kings of this world The Youposaijie jing saysI first had the thought of enlightenment under ākya Buddha then spent the first of the three infinitely long  required before attaining buddhahood under Baoding Buddha the second under Dīpaṅkara and the third under Kāśyapa says that going backward the Buddha encountered Vipaśyin Buddha Dīpaṅkara Buddha and Ratnaśikhin Buddhafulfilled the three infinitely long periods under Vipaśyin Buddha and he would have had finished fulfilling them well before the time of KāśyapaThe scripture and the treatise disagree on this point yet both have their own separate sourcesTruly because of the ākya clans unprecedented nobility they had planted the seeds of merit earlier and they now receive their good retribution The Shieryou jing saysAn immeasurable period of time ago the Bodhisattva became a kingWhen he lost his father and mother early in his life he abdicated the throne and gave the kingdom to his brother in order to seek the WayFrom a great distance he saw a brahman whose name was Gautama So the Bodhisattva followed the brahman and studied the WayThe brahman said Take off your royal apparel and dress like me and accept the surname Gautama Thereupon the Bodhisattva accepted the name Gautama went deep into the mountains subsisted on berries and water and sat in meditation calming his thoughtsThe Bodhisattva wandered around almsbegging and eventually reached his kingdom but none of the officials and the people recognized him and they called him small Gautama The Bodhisattva built a residence in Ikṣuvāku GardenThe Fosoxingzan jing  speaks of the descendant of Ikṣuvāku Since King Wushengjing of the ākya clan was endowed with both talent and virtue he was called uddhodanauddhodanas distant ancestor was a descendant of Gautama Because the clan had lived in Ikṣuvāku Garden earlier the scripture regards the king as a descendant of Ikṣuvāku There meditated by himselfAt that time five hundred thieves stole objects from the palace and their escape route passed by the Bodhisattvas hutThe next day people captured the thieves and since their footprints were found near the Bodhisattvas residence the people detained the BodhisattvaOne after another as dictated by law the bodies of the thieves were pierced with a wooden pillar that was raised up in the sky for all to seeBlood flowed down to the groundThe brahman teacher Great Gautama saw this with his divine eye and immediately came flying using his magical powerHe asked What is the crime you committed to receive this cruel punishmentYou have no descendantsHow will your family line be continued The Bodhisattva answered My life is about to endHow can I speak about my descendants The king ordered his attendants to shoot the Bodhisattva with their bows and arrows to kill himThe brahman teacher Gautama in great sorrow wept and placed the corpse in a coffinHe collected the blood on the ground and formed it into balls with soilHe placed these balls in two vessels and took them back to the deceased Gautamas residenceThe blood that had been on the left side of the corpse was placed in the vessel to the left and the blood from the right side in the vessel to the rightThe brahman teacher Great Gautama said If the religious aspiration of this practitioner of the Way was sincere the gods in the heavens will transform this blood into human beings Ten days later the blood in the left vessel became a man and that in the right vessel became a womanThereupon they were given the surname GautamaThey were also given the name Sheyi Note Sheyi is an aristocratic name for the Western Region Blood becoming a human beingthis is an event in the pastI cannot explain this transformation in detail here because it would require a long discussionThe Pusa benxing jing saysBefore King Ikṣuvāku was a king called Damaocao He entrusted the throne to his ministersPeople surrounded the king as he left the city The king shaved his head cut off his beard and put on the robes of those who have renounced the householders lifeAfter renouncing the householders life the king upheld the precepts and maintaining purity he practiced with great concentration and effort thus mastering the four degrees of dhyāna  and became endowed with the five supernatural powersHe became a royal sage and lived for an extremely long timeReaching a great age he began to decline physically he lost his vigor and his back became bentHe could not walk very far even if he used a staffAt that time the royal sage had many disciplesOnce his disciples were about to travel to the east and to the west seeking food and drinkThey collected soft grass put it in a basket placed the royal sage in the basket and then hung the basket from a tree branchWhy did they do thisBecause they feared that insects and animals might come and bother the royal sageAfter the disciples left to beg for almsfood a hunter who had been wandering in the fields and mountains saw the royal sage from a distanceHe thought that what he saw was a swan and he shot at himThe royal sage was hit two drops of blood fell on the ground and he immediately diedThe disciples came back from almsbegging and saw that the royal sage had been shot and had diedThey also saw the two drops of blood on the groundImmediately they lowered the basket and placed the king on the groundGathering firewood they cremated the kings corpse collected the bones and built a stupaThey also offered various kinds of fine incense and flowers at the stupaWith reverence and praise they completed their devotions to the royal sageJust at the places where the two drops of blood had fallen on the ground two sugarcanes sproutedIn time they grew and when the sugarcanes had matured the sun scorched them and split them openA boy came out of one of the canes and a girl came out of the otherThey were wonderfully handsome more attractive than anyone else in the worldThe disciples then thought When the royal sage lived in this world he did not have any childrenThese two children are the descendants of the royal sageWe shall look after them The disciples reported this event to the ministersThey then called in a great brahman who could read facial features The ministers ordered the brahman to read the facial features of the two children and also to choose names for themThe brahman said Since this boy was born when the sun scorched the mature sugarcane and made it split open his first name will be Shansheng Also because he was born from sugarcane his second name will be Kanzhesheng Furthermore because he was born when the sun scorched the sugarcane he will be called Rizhong The circumstances of the birth of the girl were entirely the sameTherefore we shall name her Shanxian We shall also name her Shuibo The ministers then accepted the boy who was born from the sugarcane and at an early age anointed him as their kingWhen the girl Shanxian became old enough to serve him they honored her as the first queenThe Pusa benxing jing saysAt that time not far from the city of Kapilavastu was another city called DevadahaIn that city a very wealthy man of the ākya clan named Suprabuddha livedHe was extremely wealthy and had accumulated a great deal of rare treasuresBecause of his great wealth he wielded awesome authorityEverything went as he wished without any effort on his part there was no area in which he suffered from any shortageHis residence was just like the palace of the deity VaiśravaṇaThis elder of the ākya clan had eight daughtersthe first was called Weiyi the second Wubiyi the third Dayi the fourth Wubianyi the fifth Fayi the sixth Heiniu the seventh Shouniu and the eighth Mahāprajāpatī NoteIn Chinese Dahui  she was also called Fantian  Dahui was the youngest of the daughtersThe day she was born brahman teachers capable of reading physiological features examined her body and said If this girl marries and gives birth to a boy he will without fail become an universal monarch and rule over the four continents under heavenHe will obtain the seven treasures of the universal monarch without any effort and he will be endowed with one thousand childrenHe will govern people without the use of whips and sticks When the daughter of Suprabuddha grew up and was of age to be married King uddhodana heard that a very wealthy man of his own ākya clan had eight daughters who were incomparably beautiful and that a reader of physiological features had predicted that one of them would give birth to a noble childWhen King uddhodana heard this he said I should seek out this woman and make her my queen so that my lineage of Ikṣuvāku universal monarchs will not be terminated NoteThis is the view of the Vinaya specialistsThey also say that Dahui is the mother of the BodhisattvaThe text of the avadāna scripture says King uddhodana is my father Lady Māyā is my mother avadāna scripture is borne out through the examination of various scriptures King uddhodana sent a messenger to visit the house of the great elder Suprabuddha requesting that Mahāprajāpatī become his queen to be called Prajāpati Suprabuddha said to the messenger Good messenger on my behalf ask the king this questionI have eight daughters The first is called Weiyi and so onThe eighth daughter is called MahāprajāpatīWhy does the great king ask for the youngestThe great king must wait until I have taken care of the seven older daughtersOnly then will I give him my youngest daughter Mahā prajā patī to become his queen At this King uddhodana sent the messenger back with the following messageI will not wait until you marry the seven older daughters one by one before I take Mahāprajāpatī as my queenI will take all of your eight daughters Suprabuddha a man of the ākya clan then replied to the great king If this is your wish I will obey the kings orderPlease take my daughters at your convenience King uddhodana sent men to bring the eight daughters to the palaceWhen they arrived at the palace he took two daughters as his queensThe name of the first of these two daughters was Weiyi and the second was MahāprajāpatīHe gave the remaining six daughters to his three younger brothers two daughters for each brotherEach brother married the two daughters given to him and made them princessesThen King uddhodana brought the daughters into the inner chambers of his palace and enjoyed to his content the pleasures they gave himHe followed the laws of kingship in governance and brought spiritual guidance to the realm under his ruleThe Pusa benxing jing saysAt that time King Ikṣuvāku had a second queenShe was incomparably beautiful and bore four sonsthe first was called Jumen  the second Jinse  the third Xiangzhong  and the fourth Biecheng The first queen Shanxian  had only one son called Changshou He was extremely goodlooking few in the world could compete with him in appearanceHowever his facial structure was such that it clearly indicated that he was not suited to becoming a kingAt that time Queen Shanxian entertained the following thought The king of the Ikṣuvāku clan already has four sonsThese brothers Jumen and the others are a strong groupI have only one son and while he is extremely handsome and there is no one to compete with him in that regard his features show that he is not suitable to become a kingBy what means can I assure that this child of mine succeeds to the throne She also thought The present King Ikṣuvāku is now with meHe loves me greatly and is deeply attached to me reveling in this emotion without any selfcontrolI will now make myself up as elaborately as I know how and cause the king to become besotted with love and desire for meOnce I induce this condition in him I will make my request to him in private Having entertained this thought she decorated herself as described above and she was incomparably beautifulQueen Shanxian went to the king and when the king saw her approaching he felt great love and was overcome by desireSeeing that the king was feeling such desire the king and the queen The queen said to the king Great king you should know that I am now going to make a requestPlease grant it to me The king said Great queen I will follow your wish without resistanceI will grant you whatever you want The queen then said to the king again to make sure After you have granted me my request you must not change your mind and regret that you have given me my wish The king said If I grant the queens request and regret it later on may my head split into seven pieces The queen said Great king please expel your four sons Jumen and the others and make my son Changshou the king King Ikṣuvāku immediately said to the queen These four sons of mine have not committed any crimeAre there any inauspicious signs in the kingdom that indicate they should not be allowed to stay The queen in turn said again The king has already made a solemn vow saying that if he changed his mind and regretted granting my wish his head should split into seven pieces The king told the queen As I promised I grant the queens request After the night was over and the morning came King Ikṣuvāku gathered the four brothers together and gave them this royal orderYou my four sons must leave the territory I governYou must not live hereGo far away to another kingdom The four boys knelt on their right knees and holding their palms together said to their father Great kingYou must know that we four have not committed any crimeWe are free from blameWhy does our father the king suddenly expel us banishing us beyond the limits of his kingdom The king said I know you have not in fact committed any crimeIt was not my idea to impose expulsion on youIt was the idea of great queen ShanxianThe queen begged me to grant this requestI did not refuse her request so I now order you to leave the kingdom Thereupon each of the mothers of the four princes begged for permission to leave with her sonThe king answered the ladies Go if you wish Then the relatives of the four ladies the ministers and some common people said to the king If you order these four sons to leave the kingdom we who are your subjects also wish to leave with them The king said You may leave if you wish Then King Ikṣuvāku said to the princes From now on when you wish to marry you must not take a wife from another clanYou must take a wife who has the same surname as yourselfYou must not let the lineage and surname of Ikṣuvāku die out Having received this instruction from their father the king each of the four princes left with his own mother and her relatives their property and carriages and went northwardWhen they arrived at the base of the Himalayas they stopped for a whileThere was a large river called BhāgīrathīAfter crossing the river they climbed to the top of the Himalayas where they roamed around and stayed for a long timeThe river below was broad and peaceful and the ground was flat without deep valleys or sharp hillsSoft and fine grass clean and lovely covered the ground everywhereTrees flowering and bearing fruit grew densely over a large areaWhen the princes saw all of this they said to each other We should build a city here and govern it After the princes established secure living conditions they remembered the words of their father the king who had instructed them to find wives to marry from their own clanSince they could not find such women outside they married their own aunts and sisters with all the proper ceremonyThey did this first to obey the kings instruction and second to prevent the lineage of the ākya clan from being mixed with other clans which would destroy the purity of their lineageOne day the king of the Ikṣuvāku clan of the sun lineage invited a great brahman state teacher Great brahman where are my four princes now The state teacher said Great king you should know that your four sons left the kingdom and went northwardNow they have  given birth to handsome male and female children Then King Ikṣuvāku wanted to see them because he loved his four sons the princesHe became very happy and said These princes are capable of managing state affairs and they will govern very well In this way the four princes established the surname ākyaBecause the ākya people lived in the shade of the spreading branches of a great tree they were called ākhiyaBecause they originated from where the Kapila ascetics lived their city was called Kapilavastu Then three of the sons of King Ikṣuvāku died and only one son was left whose name was Nirpura The Chang ahan jing saysThey lived in a forest of straight trees which was also called by the name Shilin The name of the forest was used as their surnameThe text also says that when their father the king heard that the four sons were handsome he said that they were true ākya sonsIntroduction Signs of Decline in Heaven Contemplating Capacities Manifestation of Auspicious Signs Descending into the Womb and Guidance When a sincere mind is stimulated from within true enlightenment will soon occurWhen the external powers of the physical body are destroyed the spiritual body is very near at handFor this reason ākyamuni Buddha the original teacher followed karmic conditions and adapted to the capacities of sentient beingsTaking pity on that burning house that was already engulfed in flames sharing the pain of the endless miasma that is the flow of desire he embodied himself in the palace of King  and descended into Māyās wombHe radiated golden light and dispelled the darkness of ignoranceHe dwelled in this world of the three poisons and exposed the falsity of the picturebook life of the palaceGoing out of the four gates he warned of the transience of floating clouds The Yinguo jing saysAt that time Shanhui Bodhisattvas practice had been completed and he had ascended to the tenth stageIn his last birth he was nearing the complete wisdom of the buddhasBorn in Tuṣita Heaven he was called ShengshanTo the heavenly rulers he taught the practice of those who occupy the rank of the last birth before achieving the goal and appeared in many different forms in many lands in all directions in order to properly preach to sentient beings according to their circumstancesWhen the time approached for him to descend and become the Buddha he contemplated the following five thingsFirst he contemplated whether the capacities of sentient beings had matured or notSecond he contemplated whether the appropriate time had arrived or notThird he contemplated which kingdom among many was located at the centerFourth he contemplated which clan and tribe among many clans and tribes was most prosperousFifth he contemplated past karmic causes and conditions to determine who had the true qualifications to become his parentsAfter he had contemplated these five things and was reborn below he would no longer be able to benefit the gods in heavenHe then manifested five signs in the heavenly palace in order to let the gods know that the time had arrived for the Bodhisattva to descend and attain buddhahoodThe first sign was that the Bodhisattvas eyes flutteredThe second sign was that the flowers on his head wiltedThe third sign was that his clothing became covered with dustThe fourth sign was sweat that appeared under his armpitsThe fifth sign was that he was not comfortable sitting on his own seatWhen gods saw the Bodhisattva manifest these unusual signs they were frightened and blood poured out like rain from all the pores of their skinThey said to each other The Bodhisattva will soon leave us At that time the Bodhisattva also manifested five auspicious signsFirst he sent forth light to illuminate the three thousand great chiliocosmsSecond the earth moved in eighteen ways Mount Sumeru the waters of the ocean and the heavenly palace buildings all shook and quakedThird the palatial buildings of the māras disappearedFourth the sun moon and stars lost their lightFifth the eight categories of supernatural beings in the universe all trembled and could not control themselvesWhen these deities saw that the Bodhisattvas body had already manifested the five signs and also that the five extraordinary events had occurred in the universe they all gathered at the Bodhisattvas placeThey knelt before him touching their heads to his feet to show their respect for him and said Venerable One today we have seen these signs and our bodies tremble all over we cannot rest in peacePlease explain the meaning of these events in terms of karmic causes and conditions Answering the gods the Bodhisattva said Good sons you should know that all conditioned things are impermanentNow I am about to leave this heavenly palace to be born in the world  When the gods heard these words they cried loudly weeping tearsThey were greatly distressedBlood appeared all over their bodies and they writhed in agony on the ground In this way they lamented the impermanence of all thingsThen one deity spoke in verse The Bodhisattva was here and opened our spiritual eyes Now he is about to leave us far behind We are like the blind who have lost their guide Or like those who were about to cross a river and suddenly lost their bridge or ferryboat We are also like orphans who have lost their loving mother We are like all these having lost our place of refuge drifting aimlessly along the current of life and death There is absolutely no condition under which we can escape this roiling current Our life is like a long nightHaving been pierced by the arrow of ignorance we are losing the great King of Physicians Who else can save us now Asleep on a bed of ignorance forever drowning in the ocean of love and desire If we are forever deprived of the teaching of the Venerable One We cannot see any hope of ever escaping from this world The Bodhisattva then replied in verse I will not stay here for long I am about to descend into the world In the kingdom of Kapilavastu I will be born in the palace of King uddhodana Then taking leave of my parents and relatives renouncing the throne of the universal monarch I will leave the householders life and pursue the spiritual path Achieving the complete wisdom of a buddha I will establish the banner of the right Dharma Able to terminate desires as vast and endless as the ocean and closing the gate to the realms of inferior births I will open the eightfold correct path of purity and benefit for all gods and humans infinite in number These developments caused by karmic causes and conditions should not cause you anxiety and distressThe Zhidu lun says Question Why was the Bodhisattva born in Tuṣita Heaven and not in higher or lower heavensThis person of great merits and virtues should have been free to be born anywhereAnswerSome people say that it is because the karmic effects matured in this way that he had to be reborn in the middle heavenThey also say that bondage in the lower heavens is heavy and impure while bondage in the higher heavens is excessively sharpIn the case of Tuṣita Heaven is neither too heavy nor too sharp and the wisdom of the Bodhisattva is safe and secure thereSome also say that the Buddha did not wish to miss the time for appearing in the worldIf he had been born in the lower heavens because the life span in those heavens is brief when his life there ended it would still not have been the appropriate time for the Buddha to appear in the worldIf he had been born in the higher heavens because the life span in those heavens is very long before his life there ended he would have missed the time for the Buddha to appear in the worldTuṣita Heaven is located in the middle of the six heavens plus Brahmā HeavenThere are three heavens above it and three below itthe Bodhisattva had to be born in the world in the Middle Kingdom descend there in the middle of the night and leave the kingdom of Kapilavastu in the middle of the nightHe had to practice the Middle Way in order to attain enlightenment teach the middle path to people and enter complete extinction at midnightBecause he preferred the teaching of the Middle  he was born in the middle heavenWhen the Bodhisattva entered the womb he contemplated the human world in four waysFirst he contemplated the timeSecond he contemplated the landThird he contemplated the clanFourth he contemplated the place of birthAs for the contemplation of time mentioned first in the list above there are eight kinds of timeThese include the first period of the Buddhas birth when the human life span is eightyfour thousand years as well as the eighth period when the human life span is more than one hundred yearsThe Bodhisattva entertained the following thoughtWhen the human life span is one hundred years the time for the Buddha to appear has arrived This is called the contemplation of timeAs for the contemplation of the land mentioned second in the list above the important principle is that buddhas are always born in the Middle Kingdom which is rich in wealth and whose land is pureAs for the contemplation of the clan mentioned third in the list above the important principle is that buddhas are born in one of the two classes ie kṣatriyas and brahmansThis is because kṣatriyas are powerful and brahmans are wiseThe Buddha is born to the clan that is more prestigious at the time of his birthAs for the contemplation of the place of birth mentioned fourth in the list above the Bodhisattva examined which mothers would be able to carry a bodhisattva of godlike powers and protect themselves by keeping the precepts of purityWhen the Bodhisattva finished contemplating in these four ways it became clear that only the queen of King uddhodana of Kapilavastu in the Middle Kingdom could carry the BodhisattvaHaving thought thus the Bodhisattva descended from Tuṣita Heaven and without losing correct wisdom entered his mothers wombThe Fobenxing jing saysAt that time among the multitude of deities in Tuṣita Heaven was one called JintuanHe had in the past descended to the world A bodhisattva who was in his last birth before attaining buddhahood whose name was Huming  said to him Deity Jintuan you have descended to the world several timesYou should already know the cities the village communities and the royal clansIn which family should this bodhisattva who is in his last birth before attaining buddhahood be reborn The deity Jintuan replied Venerable One I know it very wellVenerable One please listen wellI will now speak Huming said Good Jintuan said In these three thousand chiliocosms there is only one place of enlightenmentThe place is located inside the territory of the kingdom of Magadha in JambudvīpaThis is the place where buddhas attained enlightenment in the pastI have traveled everywhere in the realms under heaven but no other places ruled by other kings are appropriate for what the Bodhisattva intends to do Jintuan continued The world is filled with kingdoms villages kingdoms and citiesEverywhere kṣatriyas live in the cities and are engaged in all kinds of activitiesI have visited them for the sake of the Venerable One and I am now exhausted and distressedMy mind is confused and I cannot see any other places anymoreThere is only one kṣatriya familyThis ruling family was originally established by the populace through peaceful consensus and has been the lineage that produced a universal monarch in each generationThe Ikṣuvāku branch of this family has lived for generations in KapilavastuThey belong to the ākya clan and the kings name is Siṃhahanu his son is called uddhodanaThey have a great reputation among the gods and humans in all the worldsVenerable One please be born as a son and prince of that king Huming Bodhisattva answered Jintuan Well done well doneDeity Jintuan you have examined many royal familiesI too have thought of being born in that familyI am now deeply persuaded by what you have saidJintuan you should know that I will definitely go to that family and be born as their sonJintuan in the past the families that a bodhisattva in the last birth before achieving

reborn for the last time before achieving buddhahood the mother must go through the purification of the eight preceptsThen the Bodhisattva enters her womb Huming Bodhisattva also said It is not for the sake of worldly wealth or the pleasures of the five senses that I accept this birth among humansI do this only because I wish to bring peace and happiness to sentient beings and I have compassion for suffering sentient beingsThe Fobenxing jing saysWhen the winter was over and the most pleasant season of early spring had arrived all kinds of trees flowered everywhere the air was clear neither too warm nor too cold and numerous plants sprouted soft and shining in their fresh color and covering the entire groundHuming Bodhisattva chose an astrologically auspicious time and preached the essence of the Dharma to the gods causing them all to rejoiceThe deity uddhāvāsa told the multitude of deities You will now see that Huming Bodhisattva is about to be born below but do not be distressedIn his life in the realm below he will attain supreme enlightenment without failAfter he is enlightened he will return to this heavenly palace and preach the Dharma for youExactly the same things will happen as in the past when both Vipaśyin Buddha and Kāśyapa Buddha left this place and then returned to preach for you Then the Bodhisattva descended to be reborn at nightWhen he was about to enter the womb in that very night Māyā said to King uddhodana Great king you should know that from tonight on I wish to uphold the eight precepts of purityThese rules are not killing not stealing not engaging in sexual acts not lying not ingesting intoxicants not slandering others not speaking in a harsh and aggressive manner and not uttering meaningless and only superficially beautiful wordsI also vow not to be greedy not to get angry not to be ignorant and deluded and not to harbor heterodox viewsI will uphold the correct viewsI will now uphold the prohibitions and precepts to be upheld by all sentient beingsI will now concentrate on constant practice and nourish compassion toward other sentient beings King uddhodana answered his wife Practice what your mind loves and delights in freelyI too will give up the royal throne and follow what you practice A verse saysWhen the king saw the mother of the Bodhisattva He stood up from his seat respectfully As if she were his mother or sister No desire moved in his mindThe Bodhisattva entertained the thought of descending from Tuṣita Heaven and entered the right side of the first queen of King uddhodanaAt that time the queen was sleeping and dreamed of a white elephant with sixteen tusks a red head and seven limbs holding the groundThe elephants tusks were decorated with goldThen it flew into the sky and entered her right sideThe queens dream endedThe next morning she told King uddhodana Great king you should know that I had the following dream last nightWhen the elephant entered my right side I felt a pleasure I had never before experiencedFrom now on I will indeed give up worldly pleasuresWho among the oracle readers can interpret the meaning of this auspicious sign for me King uddhodana called for the attendant women in the palace and told them Go quickly outside to the Office of Issuing Royal Edicts and tell National Teacher Danamozi to call in eight great brahman dream interpreters They did as they were ordered by the king and eight brahmans were called inWhen the eight brahmans heard the kings words they knew the signs well and could read the auspicious meaning of the dreamThey said to the king Great king please listen carefullyWe will explain the auspicious meaning of the dream in detailIn the record of the scriptures of the ancient holy ones and gods that we have seen there is a verseIf a mother dreams the sun deity enters her right side Then the child she bears will become a universal monarch without fail If a mother dreams the moon deity enters her right side Then the child she bears will be the best among all kings If a mother dreams a white elephant enters her right side Then the child she bears will become the Most Honorable One in the three realms of the universe He will be capable of benefiting sentient beings without discriminating between those who are close to him and those who are hostile He will bring salvation to billions of people causing them to cross over the deep ocean of desiresThen the brahman teachers said to the great king The signs of the queens dream are very auspiciousGreat king you should now congratulate yourselfThe queen will certainly bear a holy childLater he will surely complete the path of becoming a buddhaHis reputation will spread widely When King uddhodana heard the oracle readers utter these verses he was overjoyed and presented them with a large giftAfter King uddhodana heard the oracle readers interpret the queens dream as a very auspicious sign he held a great feast outside of the four gates of the city of KapilavastuIn all large and small streets where people walked he gave gifts providing all kinds of desirable food drink treasures buildings and animalsThere was also Asita a holy man who possessed the five supernatural powersHe heard the Bodhisattva in Tuṣita Heaven entertain the thought of descending to be born to King uddhodana and enter the queens right sideWhen he entered the womb he radiated light illuminating everywhere throughout all the worlds of humans and godsLater the great earth moved in eighteen waysWhen Asita saw these events that had never before taken place he was frightened and all his hair stood on endWhat conditions caused the earth to quakeWhat are the consequences of these events The holy man thought for a while and then calmed downA great joy arose in his heart and he was infinitely delightedUnable to control himself he uttered the following words A rare sage beyond our comprehensionA great person will appear in the world When the Bodhisattva first descended from Tuṣita Heaven entered the his mothers right side and settled in her womb a god called Suwang went down to hell saying loudly You should all know the followingThe Bodhisattva has descended from Tuṣita Heaven and has entered his mothers wombTherefore you should all quickly make the vow to be reborn among humans The sentient beings in hell heard these wordsIn the past all these sentient beings had performed good deeds as well as deeds of mixed character but because the effects of their evil deeds were stronger they had fallen into hellEvery one of these beings showed by the expression on their face that they hated being in hellHaving seen the light their bodies and minds felt at peace and on hearing the great deity Suwangs voice they abandoned their bodies in hell and were reborn among humansAmong all sentient beings in the three thousand chiliocosms those who had performed good deeds in the past were all reborn in areas around the city of KapilavastuThe Niepan jing saysWhen the Bodhisattva descended all the gods of the realms of form and desire came and bade farewellThey praised the Bodhisattva loudly and the breath from their mouths caused the earth to quake and moveThe Nianfo sanmei jing says When the Bodhisattva was about to descend into his mothers womb the three thousand great chiliocosms all shook in six ways The Yinguo jing saysThe Bodhisattva was about to descend into his mothers wombRiding on the sixtusked elephant he left Tuṣita HeavenInnumerable gods danced and played music burned many kinds of superior incense and scattered beautiful heavenly flowersThey followed after the Bodhisattva filling up the sky and sent forth great light that illuminated all the directionsOn the eighth day of the fourth month when the morning star Venus appeared descended into his mothers wombAt that time Queen Māyā saw the Bodhisattva riding on the white elephant with six tusks come flying to her bedside and enter the right side of her body You could see through the queens body and see the Bodhisattvas body inside her just as one can see through a piece of transparent blue jade The queen felt peaceful and experienced pleasure as if she had drunk heavenly dewLooking at her own body sending forth light like the sun and moon she was overjoyed and felt infinite delightWhen she saw this sight she thought how extraordinary it was and reported it to King uddhodanaKing uddhodana saw the auspicious sign and could not restrain himself in his great joy and delightHe then called in a brahman who was good at reading signs and ordered him to divine its significanceHe learned that the Bodhisattva was in the womb that when he was born in the world he would attain buddhahood and that the merit and benefit that would be brought by this event were beyond descriptionAt that point the gods in Tuṣita Heaven thought aloud The Bodhisattva is now born in the palace of King uddhodanaWe should also descend and be born among humansWhen the Bodhisattva attains buddhahood we will become his first attendants and listen to the teaching When they had finished this thought they were immediately reborn belowThe gods who descended from Tuṣita Heaven and were born among humans numbered nine billion nine hundred millionThere were also gods from the uppermost heaven in the realm of desire as well as the four deva kings and the deva kings of the realm of formThey descended with their attendants their number was beyond calculationThe Bodhisattva walked stood sat and laid down in his mothers womb without any obstruction to his movementsNeither did he cause his mother any pain or sufferingFrom within his mothers womb the Bodhisattva preached to the gods of the realm of form in the morning to the gods of the realm of desire at midday and to the demons and spirits at the end of the dayHe followed the same order for the three periods of night The Puyao jing T mothers womb for ten months and taught for thirtysix years in order to establish the practice of the hearers and the Great Vehicle for gods and humans The Huayan jing saysWhen the Bodhisattva was in his mothers womb the sentient beings of the three thousand great chiliocosms could see him in the womb as if they were looking at his image in a clear mirrorThe Pusa chutai jing Tca bc c The Buddha told Xijian Bodhisattva Do you wish to know whether the past buddhas in the state of nirvana stayed in their buddha landsYou should know that my past births were infinite and incalculable in numberBy means of supernatural powers I entered into the realm of the moisturebornEndowed with all the characteristics of the moistureborn I preached to the moistureconscious sentient beings for innumerable ages enabling those moistureconscious beings to achieve liberation according to their wishesI entered into other realms such as that of the eggborn and just as above enabled the beings in these realms to achieve liberation according to their wishesThrough supernatural powers I manifest future worlds and enter into the realms of the four types of living beings and as above enable each being to achieve liberation according to his wishToday I am in my mothers womb and preach the rare teaching of nonretrogression for bodhisattvas of supernatural powers throughout the ten directionsI also enter the realms of the four types of living beings in heaven hell among the hungry ghosts and among the animalsAmong the four types of living beings the wombborn and those born through spontaneous generation are quick to exhaust the impure outflows of their mindsThe moistureborn and the eggborn are slowerThe wombborn and those born through spontaneous generation are creatures of sharp capacitiesThe moistureborn and the eggborn are creatures of dull capacities Another passage from the same scripture saysThe Buddha said to nanda Listen and think carefullyI will now distinguish one by one the rare teachings of great beings nanda said to the Buddha I wish to hear that The Buddha said to nanda At a distance as many worlds away as the number of grains of sand in one billion eleven thousand and sixtytwo Ganges Rivers southeast from here there is a world called SileThe name of the buddha there is Xiangyan TathāgataHe attained final extinction there and then came to the palace of Trāyastriṃśa HeavenDuring the long period of innumerable ages he returned thirtysix times to become the great divine king Brahmā thirtysix times to appear in the body of the god akra  and thirtysix times to become a universal monarchNone of the sentient beings saved by him fell into the wrong teachings of the two vehicles nor were reborn in inferior realms of existenceBecause they are all mysteriously informed by the divine wisdom of all the buddhas The Buddha said to nanda Does the body of the Tathāgata have a period of sojourn in a womb or not nanda replied to the Buddha The Tathāgatas body does not have a period of sojourn in the womb The Buddha said to nanda If the Tathāgata does not have a period of sojourn in the womb why it is said that the Tathāgata stayed in the womb for ten months to teach and preach nanda replied to the Buddha If the Tathāgata has a period of sojourn in the womb nonetheless he still dwells in nirvana if he does not have it he also dwells in nirvana Then the Worldhonored One used his supernatural powers and appeared within Māyās bodyHe sat lay down and walked around There he found a great high throne eight thousand yojanas long and wide a stairway of gold and silver and a canopy of heavenly silk hanging from an empty skyThe pleasure there was beyond descriptionBodhisattvas and mahā sattvas eight thousand worlds away in the eastern direction from this sahā world all used their supernatural capacity to travel quickly and gather there similarly from the south west north and from the four cardinal directions betweenAlso from six billion two hundred million worlds below bodhisattvas with supernatural powers came to the great gatheringFrom seven billion two hundred million sky spaces above bodhisattvas also gathered and swarmed into the wombAt that time Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva asked the Worldhonored One These bodhisattvas and mahāsattvas gathered together like a cloudThey wish to hear the Worldhonored One preach the teaching beyond comprehensionOf the innumerable number of different types of concentrated trance states  which concentrated trance has the Tathāgata now entered dwelling in the womb and preaching the teaching beyond comprehension to the great beings  The Buddha said to Mañjuśrī You should now observe the bodhisattvas of the first stage the second stage and so on up to the bodhisattvas of the tenth stage who are in their last birthObserve them according to their correct ranks and without mixing them upNow all the beings in this crowd are completely pure and free from impure admixturesThe branches and leaves on which they dwell are also free from defilementOn these seats there is none who is defiled or has regressedBecause those with sharp capacities do not dwell in the realms of life and deathThe Buddha also asked Maitreya When the mind produces a thought how many thoughts and consciousnesses are formed Maitreya said In a period of time as brief it takes to raise ones hand or snap ones fingers three billion two hundred million thoughts take shape and each thought this formed has consciousnessConscious thought is so fine that one cannot get hold of itThe Buddhas mysterious power enters into that fine consciousness and leads each one to salvation Here he teaches consciousness It is not that there is no consciousness One Thousand Buddhas Introduction The Queens Return to Her Fathers Home Auspicious Signs Before the Birth The Birth Auspicious Signs Worship by the Gods Simultaneous Births and Calculation of Numbers I respectfully entertain the following thought Dīpaṅkara Buddha predicted attainment of buddhahood and conferred on him the name Nengren beforehandWhen conditions were mysteriously met he was embodied in the ākya clanAuspicious signs appeared before he was born and traces of truth appeared after his birthThese signs and traces illumined the worlds of humans and gods and spread everywhere in a chainlike formationTheir source is deep and superiorTherefore the earth shook in six ways and the infant took seven steps as soon as he was bornFive kinds of pure rain fell and nine dragons poured water over himSupernatural signs of good fortune appeared and all kinds of auspicious signs were also presentThese signs were unprecedented in the past one hundred generationsThus was conceived in a different way from how the ancient rulers Yao and Xuan and he was born in a different way from the later rulers Yu and Xie who founded the Yin peopleSigns such as the Black Emperor appearing in a dream or white light filling the room are not really auspicious signs How could these be compared to the auspicious signs that appeared at the time of the birth of the BuddhaAround his body there was light that extended one zhang and a fivefootlong white hair was curled between his eyebrowsThe auspicious sign wan was written on his chestHe walked with one thousand wheels under his feetThere were thirtytwo major marks such as theseThe auspicious signs that accompanied the Chinese rulersfor example in the case of Emperor Yao his dragon face tiger nose and eightcolored eyebrows and for Emperor Shun two pupils in each eyeare nothing compared to the superior signs of the BuddhaThe Fobenxing jing saysWhen Queen Māyā the holy mother of the Bodhisattva having conceived him and almost completed the ten months of her pregnancy was about to give birth the queens father Suprabuddha sent a messenger to King uddhodana in KapilavastuThe queens fathers name is given as Shanzhi in another tradition His message to the great king said I am informed that my daughter the great queen Māyā is carrying the Holy One in her wombHis powerful virtue is greatOnce he is born my daughters life will be shortened she will die soon after giving birthI want to bring my daughter Māyā back to my palace and let her stay in peace at Lumbinī where we may share pleasurable moments with each other and indulge the natural sentiments of affection between father and daughterI beseech the great king not to obstruct this wishPlease have pity on us and release my daughterOnce she gives birth in my house I will send her back immediately When King uddhodana heard Suprabuddhas messenger utter these words he issued an edict ordering officials to repair and grade the road between Kapilavastu and Devadaha  decorate it with flags and flowers and have music played thereAn innumerable number of servants and other people accompanied the queen when the king sent her back to her homeThe Puyao jing saysWhen the Prince completed his ten months in the womb and was about to be born thirtysix auspicious signs appearedtrees in the back garden spontaneously bore fruit blue lotus flowers as large as carriage wheels appeared on dry ground all the dead trees on the ground sprouted flowers and leaves gods appeared pulling a carriage covered with seven jewels and dew a treasure house containing twenty thousand jewels appeared from the ground famous scents and pleasant fragrances spread all over five hundred white lions appeared in the Himalayas and lined up in front of the city gate but they did not bother or harm anyone five hundred white elephants lined up in front of the palace heaven sent down a light and nourishing rain which was fragrant wherever it fell a spring opened inside the kings palace and provided water of one hundred flavors to the thirsty dragons and jade women appeared in sky showing the top half of their bodies thousands of jade women from heaven appeared on the palace wall holding peacock dusters gods and jade women stood in the empty sky holding ten thousand gold jars filled with sweet dew ten thousand jade women from heaven held ten thousand jars filled with fragrant water ten thousand jade women from heaven held a canopy in their hands and stood in attendance gods and jade women lined up and stood making hundreds and thousands of different kinds of music with their drums and staying in the empty sky in great harmony the water in the rivers and channels became clear but did not flow the sun and moon stopped their movement under the Puṣya lunar station stars appeared guarding it a jeweled net sprinkled with dew covered the palace a supernatural jewel as clear as the bright moon hung from the palace building shining very brightly lamps in the palace could no longer shine brightly clothing that had been stored in boxes appeared on clothes hangers precious necklaces and all other such treasures appeared poisonous insects went into hiding and auspicious birds uttered sounds of fortune in hell all punishment stopped and no one suffered pain there was a great earthquake that flattened the hills streets and fourway crossings were evenly leveled and flowers were scattered over them deep holes and gullies were all filled in fishermen and hunters became disgusted by their evil professions and for a while harbored compassion for all creatures pregnant women inside the territory all gave birth to boys and the dead blind mute and those who suffered from any of the one hundred diseases were all cured and tree deities showed the top half of their bodies from all the trees and paid respect by lowering their headsThese were the thirtytwo auspicious signsAt that time everyone without exception expressed wonder at these unprecedented eventsThe Yinguo jing saysThe Bodhisattva was in the womb for almost ten months and the limbs of his body as well as all the marks of his superior destiny were completedThe queen wished to go into the garden for sightseeingThe king ordered eightyfour thousand beautiful palace women to accompany Queen MāyāHe also chose eightyfour thousand beautiful young girls to go to the Lumbinī Garden holding incense and flowersThe king also ordered all of his ministers officials and their wives to follow herThereupon the queen stepped into the decorated carriage and accompanied by the attending officials and women both in front and back of the queens carriage they went to the Lumbinī GardenAt that time the eight kinds of heavenly beings such as gods and dragons  filled the sky and followed the queens carriageWhen the period of ten months was completed and the Bodhisattva was about to appear on the eighth day of the fourth month the queen saw a big tree called aśoka in the back gardenIts flowers were colorful and fragrant and its branches and leaves spread widely growing thickly and profuselyAs the queen raised her right hand to grasp a branch of the tree the Bodhisattva emerged slowly from her right sideThe Pusa chutai jing saysThe Buddha said to Maitreya You should know that you also received the prediction to attain highest enlightenment under this large tree the king among all trees five million six hundred and seventy years from nowI was born from the right side of the queens bodyYou Maitreya will be born from the top of your mothers headI had a life span of one hundred yearsYou Maitreya will have a life span of eight thousand four hundred yearsMy land was made of earthYour land will be made of goldMy land was full of sufferingYour land will be full of pleasure The Pusa benxing jing saysWhen the Bodhisattva saw his mother standing on the ground taking hold of a branch of the tree with her hand there in the womb he concentrated on the thought of birth and rose from his positionWhen the mothers of all other sentient beings are about to give birth their bodies ache all over and they suffer greatlySitting down and standing up over and over again they cannot get comfortableThe Bodhisattvas mother was happy and peaceful and she felt a great pleasurable sensation in her bodyAt that time Queen Māyā stood on the ground took hold of a branch of the palāśa tree with her hand and gave birth to the BodhisattvaThis was a remarkable event entirely unprecedented that could only happen to the BodhisattvaIt gave expression to the fact that after the Tathāgata has attained buddhahood he would tirelessly remove the root of all desire and cut off the bondage of desire just as when the tops of tāla trees are cut off they do not grow againHis will be the teaching of characterlessness formlessness and the absence of subsequent birthsSuch is the auspicious sign that accompanies the birth of a tathāgataAgain because of oppressive pain inside the womb all sentient beings move around from place to placeThe Bodhisattva was differentHe entered his mothers body from her right side and stayed on the right sideHe did not move around inside the womb at allWhen the time came for him to be born he emerged from the right side of his mothers bodyHis birth was not characterized by painful pressure such as other sentient beings experienceSuch was the unprecedented birth that happened only in the Bodhisattvas case and which gave expression to the fact that after he achieves buddhahood future religious practices will forever be free from fear always filled with pleasure and devoid of painAgain when the Bodhisattva in the right side of his mothers womb first concentrated on the thought of birth great light issued forth and illuminated everywhereThis was an unprecedented event that happened only in the Bodhisattvas caseIt gave expression to the fact that after achieving buddhahood he would destroy the dark net of ignorance and would cause the clear and pure light of wisdom to issue forthAgain when the Bodhisattva had just emerged from the right side of his mothers body and remembered the past through concentration his mothers body was not in any discomfort as usual and was not injured damaged wounded or painedThe Bodhisattvas mothers body had undergone no changeThis was an unprecedented event that happened only in the case of the birth of the BodhisattvaIt gave expression to the fact that after he has achieved buddhahood those who engage in religious cultivation would lack nothing and be well provided forAgain when the Bodhisattva had just emerged from his mothers womb he stood up feeling no pain distress or illness None of the many defilements of the mothers body could pollute himHe was different from other sentient beingsTo describe the matter with a metaphor he was like a vaiḍūrya jewel wrapped in Kāśi cloth Neither the jewel nor the cloth is defiledThis was an unprecedented occurrence that happened only in the case of the Bodhisattvas birth It gave expression to the fact that after achieving buddhahood he would remain in the world and while the precious teaching remained in the world no worldly defilements could pollute or stain itAgain when the Bodhisattva had just emerged from his mothers womb the heavenly deity akra wrapped him in the heavenly fine fabric called Kauśika clothReceiving the Bodhisattvas body before anyone else akra held it up reverentlyThis was an unprecedented event that happened only in the Bodhisattvas caseIt gave expression to the fact that after the Bodhisattva achieved buddhahood and became master of the sahā world the great god Brahmā would first request the Tathāgata to preach the truthAgain when the Bodhisattva had just been born from the right side of his mothers body the four great deva kings held him and turning toward the mother to show him to her they said Great queen you should now rejoiceThe child you have given birth to has now attained a human birthGods are rejoicing in praise of himHow could it be otherwise with human beings This was an unprecedented event that happened only the Bodhisattvas caseIt gave expression to the fact that after he achieved buddhahood the fourfold Buddhist community  with an incalculable number of members would turn toward the Tathāgata and listen to his teachingThey will follow the Tathāgatas teaching and will not deviate from it in any wayAgain as soon as the Bodhisattva stood upon the ground and standing there looked at his mothers right side he said I will not receive a human form again after todayI will not enter the womb from the side of my mothers bodyThis is my last human bodyIn this body I will become a buddha This was an unprecedented event that happened only in the case of the Bodhisattvas birthIt gave expression to the fact that after attaining buddhahood he will utter the following wordsMy births have been completely exhausted my spiritual practice has been established and what has to be done has already been doneI will not receive future rebirths These are the auspicious signs that first accompany the birth of a tathāgataThe Niepan jing saysWhen the Bodhisattva had just been born he took seven steps in each of the ten directionsThe dragon generals Maṇibhadra and Pūrṇabhadra held flags and a canopy over him and shook the innumerable worlds of infinite extensionGolden light shone and filled the skyThe dragon kings Nanda and Upananda bathed the Bodhisattvas body using their supernatural powers Gods manifested themselves and worshiped the BodhisattvaThe sage Asita reverently joined his palms and paid his respectsWhen he grew up to be a young man the Bodhisattva renounced the objects of human desire just as if he was spitting out salivaNot deluded by worldly pleasures he left the householders life and found happiness in the spiritual life of quietudeHe refuted heterodox teachings and practiced austerities for six years He adopted the attitude of complete equanimity toward all sentient beingsConstantly meditating in his mind he was from the beginning never disturbedSpecial marks awesome and beautiful ornamented his bodyWherever he went the hills and hollows were leveledHis clothes floated four inches off his body but they never fell downWhen he walked he looked straight ahead and did not glance left or rightWhen he sat down or stood up the grass under him did not become crushedIn order to guide sentient beings he went forth and taughtHis mind was free from arroganceThe Yinguo jing saysWhen the Prince was born a lotus flower decorated with seven jewels and supported by seven stalks appeared under the treeThis flower was as large as a carriage wheelThe Bodhisattva then fell into this lotus flower and without any assistance took seven stepsThe Dashanquan jing says that the seven steps taken by the Bodhisattva correspond to the sevenfold practices of awakening He raised his right hand and uttered the lions roar I am the most honorable and superior being among all gods and humansInnumerable births and deaths are now over When he had uttered these words the four deva kings wrapped the Princes body in a heavenly silk cloth and placed him on a table filled with treasuresThe god akra held a jeweled canopy great Brahmā held a white duster They stood to the Princes right and left sidesThe dragon kings Nanda and Upananda sprayed pure water from their mouths into the sky bathing the Princes body with warm and cool waterThe Puyao jing says The gods akra and Brahmā rained many kinds of famous perfumes nine dragons went up and poured down the perfumed water to bathe the Bodhisattvas body The Ruiying benqi jing says akra and Brahmā waited upon him from below the four deva kings took the Bodhisattvas body and placed it on the table The Xiuxing benqi jing says The dragon king brothers rained down warm water on his left side and cool water on his right side akra and Brahmā covered the Bodhisattvas body with a piece of cloth The Bodhisattvas body was golden in color and adorned with thirtytwo marksIt emitted a great light that illuminated the three thousand great chiliocosmsThe state of Kapilavastu stood at the center of three thousand suns and moons and twelve thousand heavens and earths There are ten billion suns and moons and forty billion realms under heavenThe number three thousand is given as a shorthand expression Therefore the relative location of China and the barbarian countries may also be explained in more detailThe Hainei jing says that Shendu is the country where the Yellow Emperor livesGuo s commentary says that it refers to IndiaThese passages indicate that it is not entirely wrong to speak of India as the center of heaven and earthThe Houhan shu says that people designated as nine kinds of barbarians live beyond the Pamir MountainsTheir civilization is said to be more impressive and beautiful than that of China The Zhidu lun saysQuestion Why is the Buddha of golden colorAnswerIf one were to place iron next to gold it would not be noticeableNow if we were to place gold of today next to the gold of the Buddhas time the former would not be noticeableIf we were to place the gold of the Buddhas time next to the gold of the Jambu River the former would not be noticeableIf we were to place the Jambu

highest heaven of the realm of desire the former would not be noticeableIf we were to place the gold of Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven next to the golden color of the Bodhisattvas body the former would not be noticeableSuch a beautiful color is called the mark of golden color The Ruiying jing saysWhen the Bodhisattva was first born the eight kinds of supernatural beings such as gods and dragons manifested themselves in the sky playing heavenly music dancing and singing praisesThey burned incense and scattered flowersThey let an innumerable number of heavenly cloth and necklaces fall onto earth like rainUnder the tree near which the Bodhisattva was born there suddenly emerged four wells producing water of marvelous qualityThere were thirtyfour auspicious signsThese signs cannot be described in detail here These signs are roughly the same as those described above in the section on the thirtysix auspicious signs The Ruiying jing saysWhen the Prince was just born the great king immediately gathered the four divisions of his army and entered the garden with his ministersSeeing that the Princes birth had occasioned such miraculous signs the king was both pleased and afraidWith joined palms the king worshiped the deities and embracing the prince he placed him on an elephantmounted carriage decorated with seven jewelsAccompanied by his ministers and palace ladies and followed by dancing gods the king entered the royal cityBecause he was unfamiliar with the Three Jewels the king first took the prince to a temple of the godsWhen the prince entered the images of the god Brahmā all stood up and bowed at the Princes feetThey said to the king Great king you should know about thisThis Prince is honored among gods and humansThe gods in the sky are all paying respect to himHow could the great king have failed to see these signs and brought the Prince here to pay respect to us King uddhodana and his ministers marveled at this unprecedented turn of eventsThen the Prince left the temple of the gods and returned to the rear quarters of the palaceThe Puyao jing says When the Prince came to the temple he spoke in verseWhen I was just born I shook the three thousand chiliocosms Deities such as akra Brahmā and Sudarśana and All the heavenly beings such as the sun and moon came and paid me respect What heavenly deity is treated with greater respect When I arrived at the palace I was treated as a being higher than the gods a god among gods Among the gods none was superior to me Adapting myself to the world I manifested myself here I cause these auspicious signs to appear and the people are overjoyed I am nurtured respectfully by members of a small clan yet I am holier than a god among all the godsThereupon the heavenly kings akra and Brahmā and the four deva kings came down from their thrones and throwing themselves down to the ground they worshiped at the feet of the BodhisattvaHundreds of thousands of gods and people were amazed and loudly uttered praises exclaiming at such an unprecedented event and danced in joyHeaven and earth shook flowers rained down from the sky and hundreds of thousands of musical tunes were heard as musical instruments played by themselves The statues of the gods transformed into the deities they represented and the gods paid respect by bowing down at the feet of the BodhisattvaThe deities then stood before the Bodhisattva and uttered the following verses of praise Just as Mount Sumeru is contrasted with a mustard seed So do the Bodhisattvas supernatural powers exceed those of the dragon king Would the sun and moon worship a dragon kingHow could the wise and virtuous pay respect to the dragon king Three thousands worlds offer homage to the Bodhisattva on their own initiative Just as a mustard seed is contrasted with Mount Sumeru or The footprint of an ox is compared to the great ocean So does the Most High and Honored One transcend the sun and moon If one pays respect to this Honored One their merit will be incalculable Everyone will obtain spiritual peace The Bodhisattvas virtue is infinitely richThe Ruiying jing says At that time on the same day five hundred male children were born into various branches of the ākya clan The Xiuxing benqi jing saysA child was born to each of the eightyfour thousand elders in the state and they were all male childrenFoals were

and sheep also gave birth to fivecolored offspring The same thing happened to five hundred different speciesThe Princes servants also gave birth to five hundred children who would later serve as the Bodhisattvas servantsThe Puyao jing says that five hundred servants gave birth to strong soldiers At that time five hundred hidden treasure houses spontaneously opened up in the palaceMany merchants came back from traveling the seas where they had gathered treasures and they presented rare objects to the kingIn the light of all these auspicious signs they wished to name the Prince Xida At that time just as the Prince was born to King uddhodana a child was born to eight princes in the realmThey were all overjoyed and chose good names for these newbornsThe Fobenxing jing saysThe kingdom of Kapilavastu had eight cities and altogether nine million householdsDevadatta was born on the seventh day of the fourth monthThe Buddha was born on the eighth day of the fourth month The Buddhas younger brother Nanda was born on the ninth day of the fourth monthnanda was born on the tenth day of the fourth monthDevadattas height was one zhang five chi and four cunThe Buddhas height was one

of the Bodhisattvas wifes mother was YuenShe lived in a neighborhood of the cityWhen she was about to give birth to her daughter the sun was about to set but the remaining light illuminated the house

there and coming out with correct knowledge when entering and staying there but without correct knowledge when coming out with correct knowledge in all three  and without correct knowledge in any of the three The first refers to universal monarchs the second to selfenlightened buddhas  the third to bodhisattvas and the fourth to all other sentient beingsA verse in the Baoxing lun saysWithdrawing from heaven and entering the womb He was born here to a mother and father While living in the household he took the form of a child He studied various arts and skills Played happily and went on excursions After he renounced the householders life he practiced austerities Having mastered the nonBuddhist teachings He conquered the heavenly Māra He attained buddhahood and turned the wheel of Dharma He showed the path to nirvana Sentient beings with little merit Cannot see the TathāgataThe Ruiying jing says The prince was born during the night of the eighth day of the fourth month when the morning star appeared The Xingzan says On the eighth day of the third month the Bodhisattva appeared from the right side of his mothers body The Guoqu xianzai yiguo jing saysOn the eighth day of the second month the queen went to the Lumbinī GardenShe saw an aśoka flower and picked it raising her right handAt that moment the prince was born from the right side of the queens bodyNow this matter belongs to a time many generations agoThe disagreement about the date among the translators cannot be easily sorted out in terms of the texts themselves but we may be able to settle the matter by looking into nonBuddhist scripturesThe Chunjiu says The seventh year of the reign of Duke Chuang of Lu ie the eleventh year of Prince ChuangOn one day in the fourth month one star disappeared and meteors fell like rainComparing Buddhist and nonBuddhist texts we may determine that the fourth month was the correct date of the Buddhas birthRaising the Child Introduction Raising the Child and Auspicious Signs Mysterious processes work through everything in silence perfect wisdom illumines in quietudeThe Way transcends the realms of form and consciousness the principle is beyond the spheres of changesHaving transcended form and consciousness long ago how could he in reality have been reborn in a kings palaceHaving gone beyond changes would he be guarded by illusory attendantsYet the Great One was born responding to cosmic conditions in order to benefit all beings as he promised at the beginning He appeared thus due to cosmic conditions yet he sees all the profound truthsThere are many ways of teaching and those who receive the teaching are manySome are enlightened through means of quiet meditationSome open their minds with the help of wisdom and understandingSome hold the baby and some feed the baby milk to nourish his bodyThe conditions for enlightenment are many and cannot be limited to one example In these many ways all living beings can be motivated to seek salvation and salvation may be brought skillfully to the worldThe Fobenxing jing saysWhen seven days had passed after the birth of the Prince his mother Queen Māyā came to the end of her lifeSome teachers say that the queens lifetime just happened to be only seven more days and that is why she died at that timeHowever there is an ancient rule that the Bodhisattvas mother dies after he has lived seven days The reason why the mothers die so early is as followsthe Bodhisattvas renounce the householders life at a very early age and when their mothers see this event their hearts are broken and their lives endThe Sarvāstivāda teachers say that when the mother saw that the child born to her had an unprecedentedly beautiful body she could not bear the joy and her life immediately endedAfter her life ended she was reborn in the Heaven of the Thirtythree GodsWhen King uddhodana saw that the queens life had ended he called the ākya clan together and they all gathered like a cloudHe told them You are all relatives and parents of the stateNow this boy has lost his mother while still a babyTo whom should I entrust him to provide him with milk Whom shall I order to raise the babyWho will be able to love him as if he were her own childAt that time there were five hundred new wives in the ākya clan and they all said I can raise himI can look after him The elders of the ākya clan told them All of you are young and vigorous You indulge in sense desiresYou cannot nourish him at the appropriate times and love him in a manner that accords with the correct teachingOnly Mahāprajāpatī happens to be the true aunt of the PrinceTherefore she is capable of raising the baby Thereupon King uddhodana entrusted the Prince to his aunt and said to her WelcomeYou should raise the childGuard him well and help him to grow upBathe him at the appropriate times He also chose thirtytwo other women to assist in raising the Princeeight women to hold him eight women to bathe him eight women to give milk and eight women to play with himThen Mahāprajāpatī said to King uddhodana I will respectfully follow the kings orders and not deviate from them The Fobenxing jing saysAfter the Prince was born King uddhodanas household became more prosperous day by dayAs they were more than sufficiently provided with all kinds of wealth such as gold silver and rare treasures those in the household uttered the following verseFive kinds of grain and other wealth and treasures Such as gold silver and all kinds of clothing Some produced by human beings and some not produced by humans These have been provided spontaneously without any effort on our part For both the child and his loving mother Milk and its products are always richly provided Nursing mothers who did not have sufficient milk before Now all produce milk plentifully At that time King uddhodanas enemies all felt the universal and equal love toward everyone and gradually came to feel as if the Pprince was a family member or someone very closeWind and rain came at the appropriate times and no natural disasters such as hailstorms occurredThere was no disruptive weatherPeople sowed few seeds yet the harvest was largeEveryone in the realm obeyed the lawsMany kinds of spiritual gifts brought numerous benefitsThere were no evil people and everyone was happyIt was just like heavenIt was due to the Princes awesome power of virtue that all these things happenedVerses say The world of humans followed the Honored Ones teaching People were neither stingy nor ungenerous They did everything according to the teachingBeing compassionate they did not kill When hungry or thirsty they were immediately relieved of these needs Both food and drink were provided in sufficient quantity Everyone was joyous and partook of heavenly pleasures The Puyao jing saysSeven days after the Bodhisattva was born his mothers life ended and she was happily reborn in the Heaven of the Thirtythree GodsWhen she arrived at that heaven fifty thousand Brahmā deities held precious jars and twenty thousand Brahmā deities and māras held precious clothing and attended the Bodhisattvas motherThe Ruiying benqi jing says The Bodhisattva knew of his mothers virtue from the beginning and could not bear to become the object of her worshipTherefore he chose to be born when her life was about to endThe Dashanquan jing says Seven days later his mother passed away and because of her merits ascended to heavenThe Bodhisattva was not to blame for this The Yinguo jing says The Princes aunt Mahāprajāpatī nursed and raise the prince just as if she were his own mother Introduction Ordering the Prognostication Presenting the Prince to a Holy Person Marks Karmic Causes Comparisons Calculation and Merit The Holy One follows the karmic conditions in ways that may be either manifest or mysteriousHis mind is clear and illuminates without obstructionHe responds to stimuli as if it were an echoIn his quietude he does not move yet he responds to stimuli and reaches everywhereThus he descended from Tuṣita Heaven and was incarnated in the kingdom of KapilavastuThe ruling family of that kingdom had produced universal monarchs for many generationsThe reputation of the family was appropriate for the One Who Treads the Holy PathOf the three thousand realms on earth the kingdom was even superior to the Chinese city of LuoyangThere were numerous branch families too many to be described in detail here In ancient China when LWen read the extraordinary features of the founding ruler Gaozu of the Han dynasty and predicted the latters future success people treated him as someone who had superior knowledge of human beingsHowever compared to Asitas prognostication about the future of Our Teacher  LWens accomplishments were like nothingThe Ruiying jing says King uddhodana ordered five hundred oracle readers to read the Princes featuresThe readers said This child of the king is the Eye of the WorldHe is like pure gold His extraordinary marks are very clearif he renounces the householders life he will achieve perfect knowledge of all things if he remains in the world he will become a universal monarch and govern the four realms under heavenHe will be the highest among rulers They also said to the king There is a brahman holy man called Asita who is equipped with five supernatural powers he lives GandhamādanaHe can remove all doubts the king might have about the future of the prince At that time the king thought to himself The road to Gandhamādana is extremely dangerous Ordinary people cannot reach that placeHow will I be able to send an invitation for him to come here When the king was entertaining this thought the holy man Asita learned of the kings thoughts from a distance and came flying to read the Princes marks for the kingWhen the king saw that the holy man had arrived he was inexpressibly happy and relievedThe king and queen brought the Prince out and wanted to make him pay respect to the holy man but the holy man stopped the king saying This child is the Most Honored One in the three realms of gods and humans
