Inconstant with regard to the inconstant is a nonperversion of perception a nonperversion of mind a nonperversion of viewStressful with regard to the stressful Notself with regard to notself Unattractive with regard to the unattractive is a nonperversion of perception a nonperversion of mind a nonperversion of viewThese are the four nonperversions of perception nonperversions of mind nonperversions of viewThese four O Monks are distortions of perception distortions of thought distortions of viewThese verses from the Numerical Discourses give the traditional list of the vipallasasThis Pali word is sometimes translated as perversions of the mind but I find this language too strong and prefer the expression distortions of the mindThe term is composed of a prefix which carries the sense of division separation or removal another prefix meaning around or complete and a verb which can be taken as meaning to throw Putting all this together we have the image of the mind taking something up turning it around and throwing it back down  a perversion or distortion of reality by the perceptual and cognitive apparatus of the brainThe distortions are fundamental to the Buddhist notion of ignorance or delusionIt is not that we are inherently flawed in our nature it is just that we make some serious errors on many levels as we attempt to make sense of the world around usAs we come to recognize  through meditation practice  some of the ways we misconstrue things about our experience we become more able to correct for these errors and gain greater clarityThe distortions of the mind work on three levels of scaleFirst distortions of perception cause us to misperceive the information coming to us through the sense doorsWe might mistake a rope by the path as a snake for exampleNormally such errors of vision are corrected by a more careful scrutiny but sometimes these sensory mistakes are overlooked and remainDistortions of thought have to do with the next higher level of mental processing when we find ourselves thinking about or pondering over things in our mindsThe mind tends to elaborate upon perception with these thought patterns and if our thoughts are based upon distortions of perception then they too will be distortedEventually such thought patterns can become habitual and evolve into distortions of viewWe might become so convinced that there is a snake by the path that no amount of evidence to the contrary from our own eyes or reason nor the advice of others will shake our beliefs and assumptionsWe are stuck in a mistaken viewFurthermore these three levels of distortion are cyclical  our perceptions are formed in the context of our views which are strengthened by our thoughts and all three work together to build the cognitive systems which make up our unique personalityYou will no doubt recognize that the particular distortions mentioned in this text correspond to the three characteristicsTaking what is impermanent as permanent what is inherently unsatisfactory as a source of satisfaction and what is without a self to constitute a self  these are the primary ways we distort reality to the profound disadvantage of ourselves and othersSeeing the unlovely as lovely rounds out the traditional list of four vipallasasI like the way these verses say that when under the influence of these distortions we have lost our senses and our mind is broken or thrownWhen the distortions are corrected by right view clear thinking and careful perception then the text says that we have gotten back our true mindThis is the Buddhist view of mental disease and mental healthDelusion is a mental illness that causes all sorts of suffering mental health can be restored by correcting the flaws in how the mind operatesFortunately Buddhas arise to make things bright and illustrate in detail how this recovery of our natural health can be accomplishedOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen Rohitassa the son of a deva in the far extreme of the night his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he stood to one sideAs he was standing there he said to the Blessed One Is it possible lord by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappearI tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappearIt is amazing lord and awesome how well that has been said by the Blessed One I tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear Once I was a seer named Rohitassa a student of Bhoja a powerful skywalkerMy speed was as fast as that of a strong archer  welltrained a practiced hand a practiced sharpshooter  shooting a light arrow across the shadow of a palm treeMy stride stretched as far as the east sea is from the westTo me endowed with such speed such a stride there came the desire I will go traveling to the end of the cosmos I  with a onehundred year life a onehundred year span  spent one hundred years traveling  apart from the time spent on eating drinking chewing  tasting urinating  defecating and sleeping to fight off weariness  but without reaching the end of the cosmos I died along the waySo it is amazing lord and awesome how well that has been said by the Blessed One I tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear I tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappearBut at the same time I tell you that there is no making an end of suffering  stress without reaching the end of the cosmosYet it is just within this fathomlong body with its perception  intellect that I declare that there is the cosmos the origination of the cosmos the cessation of the cosmos and the path of practice leading to the cessation of the cosmosSee also ANThere are these four ways of answering questionsWhich fourThere are questions that should be answered

concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  nowThere is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the attainment of knowledge  visionThere is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to mindfulness  alertnessThere is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the effluentsAnd what is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  nowThere is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painThis is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  nowAnd what is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the attainment of knowledge  visionThere is the case where a monk attends to the perception of light and is resolved on the perception of daytimeDay is the same as night night is the same as dayBy means of an awareness open  unhampered he develops a brightened mindThis is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the attainment of knowledge  visionAnd what is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to mindfulness  alertnessThere is the case where feelings are known to the monk as they arise known as they persist known as they subsidePerceptions are known to him as they arise known as they persist known as they subsideThoughts are known to him as they arise known as they persist known as they subsideThis is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to mindfulness  alertnessAnd what is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the effluentsThere is the case where a monk remains focused on arising  falling away with reference to the five clingingaggregates Such is form such its origination such its passing awaySuch is feeling such its origination such its passing awaySuch is perception such its origination such its passing awaySuch are fabrications such their origination such their passing awaySuch is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance This is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the effluentsThese are the four developments of concentrationAnd it was in connection with this that I stated in Punnakas Question in the Way to the Far ShoreEndowed with four qualities a monk is incapable of falling away and is right in the presence of UnbindingWhich fourThere is the case where a monk is consummate in virtue guards the doors to his sense faculties knows moderation in eating  is devoted to wakefulnessAnd how is a monk consummate in virtueThere is the case where a monk is virtuousHe dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in his behavior  sphere of activityHe trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faultsThis is how a monk is consummate in virtueAnd how does a monk guard the doors to his sense facultiesThere is the case where a monk on seeing a form with the eye does not grasp at any theme or variations by

for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival  continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking I will destroy old feelings  not create new feelingsThus I will maintain myself be blameless  live in comfort This is how a monk knows moderation in eatingAnd how is a monk devoted to wakefulnessThere is the case where a monk during the day sitting  pacing back  forth cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in checkDuring the first watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in checkDuring the second watch of the night reclining on his right side he takes up the lions posture one foot placed on top of the other mindful alert with his mind set on getting upDuring the last watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in checkThis is how a monk is devoted to wakefulnessEndowed with these four qualities a monk is incapable of falling away and is right in the presence of UnbindingOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha at the Bamboo Grove in the Squirrels SanctuaryThen Vassakara the brahman the chief minister of Magadha went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama we declare a person endowed with four qualities to be one of great discernment a great manWhich fourThere is the case where he is learnedWhatever he hears he immediately understands the meaning of the statement This is the meaning of that statementThis is the meaning of that statementHe is mindful able to remember  recollect what was done  said a long time agoHe is adept in the affairs of the household life diligent endowed with enough ingenuity in their techniques to manage them and get them doneMaster Gotama we declare a person endowed with these four qualities to be one of great discernment a great manIf you think that I am worthy of agreement Master Gotama may you agree with meIf you think I am worthy of criticism criticize meI neither agree with you brahman nor do I criticize youI declare a person endowed with four qualities to be one of great discernment a great manWhich fourThere is the case brahman where he practices for the welfare  happiness of many people and has established many people in the noble method ie the rightness of what is admirable the rightness of what is skillfulHe thinks any thought he wants to think and doesnt think any thought he doesnt want to thinkHe wills any resolve he wants to will and doesnt will any resolve he doesnt want to willHe

the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the herenowWell brahman you have taken certainly liberties and spoken presumptuous words but still I will respond to youYes brahman I practice for the welfare  happiness of many people and have established many people in the noble method ie the rightness of what is admirable the rightness of what is skillfulAnd yes I think whatever thought I want to think and dont think any thought I dont want to thinkI will any resolve I want to will and dont will any resolve I dont want to

right in the herenowOn one occasion the Blessed One was traveling along the road between Ukkattha and Setabya and Dona the brahman was also traveling along the road between Ukkattha and SetabyaDona the brahman saw in the Blessed Ones footprints wheels with spokes together with rims and hubs complete in all their featuresOn seeing them the thought occurred to him How amazingHow astoundingThese are not the footprints of a human beingThen the Blessed One leaving the road went to sit at the root of a certain tree  his legs crossed his body erect with mindfulness established to the foreThen Dona following the Blessed Ones footprints saw him sitting at the root of the tree confident inspiring confidence his senses calmed his mind calmed having attained the utmost control  tranquility tamed guarded his senses restrained a nagaOn seeing him he went to him and said Master are you a devaNo brahman I am not a devaAre you a gandhabbaNo  a yakkhaNo  a human beingNo brahman I am not a human beingWhen asked Are you a deva you answer No brahman I am not a deva When asked Are you a gandhabba you answer No brahman I am not a gandhabba When asked Are you a yakkha you answer No brahman I am not a yakkha When asked Are you a human being you answer No brahman I am not a human being Then what sort of being are youBrahman the fermentations by which  if they were not abandoned  I would be a deva Those are abandoned by me their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThe fermentations by which  if they were not abandoned  I would be a gandhabba a yakkha a human being Those are abandoned by me their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingJust like a red blue or white lotus  born in the water grown in the water rising up above the water  stands unsmeared by the water in the same way I  born in the world grown in the world having overcome the world  live unsmeared by the worldRemember me brahman as awakenedIts also possible that the Buddhas answers to Donas questions  which like the questions are put in the future tense  are a form of wordplay in which the Buddha is using the future tense in both its meanings to refer both to his present and to his future stateThe Buddhas refusal to identify himself as a human being relates to a point made throughout the Canon that an awakened person cannot be defined in any way at allOn this point see MN SN SN and the article A Verb for Nirvana Because a mind with clinging is located by its clinging an awakened person takes no place in any world this is why heshe is unsmeared by the world like the lotus unsmeared by waterThere are these four grounds for the bonds of fellowshipWhich fourGenerosity kind words beneficial help consistencyThese are the four grounds for the bonds of fellowshipThere are these four wheels endowed with which human beings  devas develop a fourwheeled

praise of being content with any old robe cloth at allHe does not for the sake of robe cloth do anything unseemly or inappropriateNot getting cloth he is not agitatedGetting cloth he uses it not tied to it uninfatuated guiltless seeing the drawbacks and discerning the escape from themHe does not on account of his contentment with any old robe cloth at all exalt himself or disparage othersIn this he is skillful energetic alert and mindfulThis monks is said to be a monk standing firm in the ancient original traditions of the Noble OnesFurthermore the monk is content with any old almsfood at

longstanding traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning  which are not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and are unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives and brahmansAnd furthermore a monk endowed with these four traditions of the Noble Ones if he lives in the east conquers displeasure and is not conquered by displeasureIf he lives in the west the north the south he conquers displeasure and is not conquered by displeasureWhy is thatBecause the wise one endures both pleasure and displeasureThis is what the Blessed One saidHaving said this he said furtherThere are these four ways of going off courseWhich fourOne goes off course through desireOne goes off course through aversionOne goes off course through delusionOne goes off course through fearThese are the four ways of going off courseThere are these four ways of not going off courseWhich fourOne does not go off course through desireOne does not go off course through aversionOne does not go off course through delusionOne does not go off course through fearThese are the four ways of not going off courseOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Saketa at Kalakas parkThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said Monks whatever in the cosmos  with its devas Maras  Brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans royalty  common people  is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect That do I knowWhatever in the cosmos  with its devas Maras  Brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their royalty  common people  is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect That I directly knowThat has been realized by the Tathagata but in the Tathagata it has not been establishedIf I were to say I dont know whatever in the cosmos is seen heard sensed cognized pondered by the intellect that would be a falsehood in meIf I were to say I both know and dont know whatever in the cosmos is seen heard sensed cognized pondered by the intellect that would be just the sameIf I were to say I neither know nor dont know whatever in the cosmos is seen heard sensed cognized pondered by the intellect that would be a fault in meThus monks the Tathagata when seeing what is to be seen doesnt construe an seenHe doesnt construe an unseenHe doesnt construe an tobeseenHe doesnt construe a seerWhen hearingWhen sensingWhen cognizing what is to be cognized he doesnt construe an cognizedHe doesnt construe an uncognizedHe doesnt construe an tobecognizedHe doesnt construe a cognizerThus monks the Tathagata  being the same with regard to all phenomena that can be seen heard sensed  cognized  is Such And I tell you Theres no other Such

wordsTranslators note This discourse presents a picture of life in the early Buddhist community shortly after the Buddhas passing awayOn the one hand it shows the relationship between the monastic community and the political powers that be the monks are polite and courteous to political functionaries but the existence of this discourse shows that they had no qualms about depicting those functionaries as a little denseOn the other hand it shows that early Buddhist practice had no room for many practices that developed in later Buddhist traditions such as appointed lineage holders elected ecclesiastical heads or the use of mental defilements as a basis for concentration practiceI have heard that on one occasion VenAnanda was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary not long after the Blessed Ones total UnbindingNow at that time King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha suspicious of King Pajjota was having Rajagaha fortifiedThen in the early morning VenAnanda having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe went into Rajagaha for almsThe thought occurred to him Its too early to go for alms in RajagahaWhat if I were to go to the brahman Moggallana the Guardsman at his construction site So he went to Moggallana the Guardsman at his construction siteMoggallana the Guardsman saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said to him Come Master AnandaWelcome Master AnandaIt has been a long time since Master Ananda has found the time to come hereSit down Master AnandaHere is a seat made ready for youSo VenAnanda sat down on the seat made readyMoggallana the Guardsman taking a lower seat sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenAnanda Master Ananda is there any one monk endowed in each  every way with the qualities with which Master Gotama  worthy  rightly selfawakened  was endowedNo brahman there isnt any one monk endowed in each  every way with the qualities with which the Blessed One  worthy  rightly selfawakened  was endowedFor the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path the begetter of the unbegotten path the expounder of the unexpounded path the knower of the path the expert with regard to the path adept at the pathAnd now his disciples follow the path and become endowed with it after himAnd then VenAnandas discussion with Moggallana the Guardsman was interrupted in midcourse for the brahman Vassakara the Magadhan administrator on an inspection tour of the construction sites in Rajagaha went to VenAnanda at Moggallana the Guardsmans construction siteOn arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with VenAnandaAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenAnanda Just now for what discussion were you sitting together when you were interrupted in midcourseJust now brahman Moggallana the Guardsman said to me Master Ananda is there any one monk endowed in each  every way with the qualities with which Master Gotama  worthy  rightly selfawakened  was endowed And when this was said I said to him No brahman there isnt any one monk endowed in each  every way with the qualities with which the Blessed One  worthy  rightly selfawakened  was endowedFor the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path the begetter of the unbegotten path the expounder of the unexpounded path the knower of the path the expert with regard to the path adept at the pathAnd now his disciples follow the path and become endowed with it after him This was my discussion with the brahman Moggallana the Guardsman that was interrupted in midcourse when you arrivedMaster Ananda is there any one monk appointed by Master Gotama He will be your arbitrator after I am gone to whom you now turnNo brahmanThere isnt any one monk appointed by the Blessed One  the one who knows the one who sees worthy  rightly selfawakened  He will be your arbitrator after I am gone to whom we now turnThen is there any one monk authorized by the Sangha and appointed by a large body of elder monks He will be our arbitrator after the Blessed One is gone to whom you now turnNo brahmanThere isnt any one monk authorized by the Sangha and appointed by a large body of elder monks He will be our arbitrator after the Blessed One is gone to whom we now turnBeing thus without an arbitrator Master Ananda what is the reason for your concordIts not the case brahman that were without an arbitratorWe have an arbitratorThe Dhamma is our arbitratorWhen asked Master Ananda is there any one monk appointed by Master Gotama He will be your arbitrator after I am gone to whom you now turn you said No brahmanThere isnt any one monk appointed by the Blessed One to whom we now turnWhen asked Then is there any one monk authorized by the Sangha to whom you now turn you said No brahmanThere isnt any one monk authorized by the Sangha to whom we now turnWhen asked Being thus without an arbitrator Master Ananda what is the reason for your concord you said Its not the case brahman that were without an arbitratorWe have an arbitratorThe Dhamma is our arbitrator Now how is the meaning of what you have said to be understoodBrahman there is a training rule laid down by the Blessed One  the one who knows the one who sees worthy  rightly selfawakened  a Patimokkha that has been codifiedOn the uposatha day all of us who live dependent on a single township gather together in one placeHaving gathered together we invite the one to whom it fallsIf while he is reciting a monk remembers an offense or transgression we deal with him in accordance with the Dhamma in accordance with what has been instructedWere not the ones who deal with that venerable oneRather the Dhamma is what deals with usIs there Master Ananda any one monk you now honor respect revere  venerate on whom  honoring  respecting  you live in dependenceYes brahman there is a monk we now honor respect revere  venerate on whom  honoring  respecting  we live in dependenceWhen asked Master Ananda is there any one monk appointed by Master Gotama He will be your arbitrator after I am gone to whom you now turn you said No brahmanThere isnt any one monk appointed by the Blessed One to whom we now turnWhen asked Then is there any one monk authorized by the Sangha to whom you now turn you said No brahmanThere isnt any one monk authorized by the Sangha to whom we now turnWhen asked Is there Master Ananda any one monk you now honor respect revere  venerate on whom  honoring  respecting  you live in dependence you said Yes brahman there is a monk we now honor respect revere  venerate on whom  honoring  respecting  we live in dependence Now how is the meaning of what you have said to be understoodBrahman there are ten inspiring qualities expounded by the Blessed One  the one who knows the one who sees worthy  rightly selfawakenedIn whoever among us those ten qualities are found we now honor respect revere  venerate him honoring  respecting him we live in dependence on himWhich tenThere is the case where a monk is virtuousHe dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in his behavior  sphere of activityHe trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faultsHe has heard much has retained what he has heard has stored what he has heardWhatever teachings are admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end that  in their meaning  expression  proclaim the holy life entirely perfect  pure those he has listened to often retained discussed accumulated examined with his mind and wellpenetrated in terms of his viewsHe is content with robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for curing the sickHe attains  whenever he wants without strain without difficulty  the four jhanas that are heightened mental states pleasant abidings in the herenowHe experiences manifold supranormal powersHaving been one he becomes many having been many he becomes oneHe appearsHe vanishesHe goes unimpeded through walls ramparts  mountains as if through spaceHe dives in  out of the earth as if it were waterHe walks on water without sinking as if it were dry landSitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged birdWith his hand he touches  strokes even the sun  moon so mighty  powerfulHe exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsHe hears  by means of the divine earelement purified  surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine  human whether near or farHe knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awarenessHe discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passionHe discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversionHe discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusionHe discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mindHe discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mindHe discerns an excelled mind as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mindHe discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mindHe discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mindHe recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction  expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes  detailsHe sees  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kammaThrough the ending of the mental fermentations he remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having known  made them manifest for himself right in the here  nowThese brahman are the ten inspiring qualities expounded by the Blessed One  the one who knows the one who sees worthy  rightly selfawakenedIn whoever among us these ten qualities are found we now honor respect revere  venerate him honoring  respecting him we live in dependence on himWhen this was said the brahman Vassakara the Magadhan administrator turned to General Upananda and said What do you think generalDo these venerable ones honor what should be honored respect what should be respected revere what should be revered venerate what should be veneratedOf course they honor what should be honored respect what should be respected revere what should be revered venerate what should be veneratedFor if they did not honor respect revere or venerate a person like this then what sort of person would they honor respect revere  venerate on what sort of person honor  respecting would they live in dependenceThen the brahman Vassakara the Magadhan administrator said to VenAnanda But where are you staying now Master AnandaI am now staying at the Bamboo Grove brahmanI trust Master Ananda that the Bamboo Grove is delightful quiet free of noise with an air of isolation remote from human beings  appropriate for retreatCertainly brahman the Bamboo Grove is delightful quiet free of noise with an air of isolation remote from human beings  appropriate for retreat because of guardians  protectors like yourselfCertainly Master Ananda the Bamboo Grove is delightful quiet free of noise with an air of isolation remote from human beings  appropriate for retreat because of venerable ones who are endowed with mental absorption who make mental absorption their habitYou venerable ones are both endowed with mental absorption  make mental absorption your habitOnce VenAnanda Master Gotama was staying near Vesali in the Peaked Roofed Pavilion in the Great WoodI went to him at the Peaked Roofed Pavilion in the Great Wood and there he spoke in a variety of ways on mental absorptionMaster Gotama was both endowed with mental absorption  made mental absorption his habitIn fact he praised mental absorption of every sortIt wasnt the case brahman that the Blessed One praised mental absorption of every sort nor did he criticize mental absorption of every sortAnd what sort of mental absorption did he not praiseThere is the case where a certain person dwells with his awareness overcome by sensual passion seized with sensual passionHe does not discern the escape as it actually is present from sensual passion once it has arisenMaking that sensual passion the focal point he absorbs himself with it besorbs resorbs  supersorbs himself with itHe dwells with his awareness overcome by ill willHe dwells with his awareness overcome by sloth  drowsinessHe dwells with his awareness overcome by restlessness  anxietyHe dwells with his awareness overcome by uncertainty seized with uncertaintyHe does not discern the escape as it actually is present from uncertainty once it has arisenMaking that uncertainty the focal point he absorbs himself with it besorbs resorbs  supersorbs himself with itThis is the sort of mental absorption that the Blessed One did not praiseAnd what sort of mental absorption did he praiseThere is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the

praisedIt would seem VenAnanda that Master Gotama criticized the mental absorption that deserves criticism and praised that which deserves praiseWell now Master Ananda I must be goingMany are my duties many the things I must doThen do brahman what you think it is now time to doSo the brahman Vassakara the Magadhan administrator delighting  rejoicing in what VenAnanda had said got up from his seat  leftThen not long after he had left Moggallana the Guardsman said to VenAnanda Master Ananda you still havent answered what I asked youDidnt I just tell you brahmanThere isnt any one monk

takes the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma set rolling by the Tathagata and keeps it rolling rightlyThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsFor a discussion of how insight can be developed in the context of jhana see The Wings to Awakening IIIFI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migaras mother together with many wellknown elder disciples  with VenSariputta VenMaha Moggallana VenMaha Kassapa VenMaha Kaccana VenMaha Kotthita VenMaha Kappina VenMaha Cunda VenRevata VenAnanda and other wellknown elder disciplesOn that occasion the elder monks were teaching  instructingSome elder monks were teaching  instructing ten monks some were teaching  instructing twenty monks some were teaching  instructing thirty monks some were teaching  instructing forty monksThe new monks being taught  instructed by the elder monks were discerning grand successive distinctionsNow on that occasion  the Uposatha day of the fifteenth the fullmoon night of the Pavarana ceremony  the Blessed One was seated in the open air surrounded by the community of monksSurveying the silent community of monks he addressed themMonks I am content with this practiceI am content at heart with this practiceSo arouse even more intense persistence for the attaining of the asyetunattained the reaching of the asyetunreached the realization of the asyetunrealizedI will remain right here at Savatthi through the White Waterlily Month the fourth month of the rainsThe monks in the countryside heard The Blessed One they say will remain right there at Savatthi through the White Waterlily Month the fourth month of the rains So they left for Savatthi to see the Blessed OneThen the elder monks taught  instructed the new monks even more intenselySome elder monks were teaching  instructing ten monks some were teaching  instructing twenty monks some were teaching  instructing thirty monks some were teaching  instructing forty monksThe new monks being taught  instructed by the elder monks were discerning grand successive distinctionsNow on that occasion  the Uposatha day of the fifteenth the fullmoon night of the White Waterlily Month the fourth month of the rains  the Blessed One was seated in the open air surrounded by the community of monksSurveying the silent community of monks he addressed themMonks this assembly is free from idle chatter devoid of idle chatter and is established on pure heartwood such is this community of monks such is this assemblyThe sort of assembly that is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect an incomparable field of merit for the world such is this community of monks such is this assemblyThe sort of assembly to which a small gift when given becomes great and a great gift greater such is this community of monks such is this assemblyThe sort of assembly that it is rare to see in the world such is this community of monks such is this assembly  the sort of assembly that it would be worth traveling for leagues taking along provisions in order to seeIn this community of monks there are monks who are arahants whose mental effluents are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal laid to waste the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosis such are the monks in this community of monksIn this community of monks there are monks who with the wasting away of the five lower fetters are due to be reborn there to be totally unbound destined never again to return from that world such are the monks in this community of monksIn this community of monks there are monks who with the wasting away of three fetters and with the attenuation of passion aversion  delusion are oncereturners who  on returning only once more to this world  will make an ending to stress such are the monks in this community of monksIn this community of monks there are monks who with the wasting away of three fetters are streamwinners steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakening such are the monks in this community of monksIn this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the development of the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for awakening the noble eightfold path such are the monks in this community of monksIn this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the development of good will compassion appreciation equanimity foulness the perception of inconstancy such are the monks in this community of monksIn this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to mindfulness of inout breathingMindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is of great fruit of great benefitMindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued brings the four frames of reference to their culminationThe four frames of reference when developed  pursued bring the seven factors for awakening to their culminationThe seven factors for awakening when developed  pursued bring clear knowing  release to their culminationNow how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefitThere is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to rapture He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to rapture He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in calming mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the mind He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the mind He trains himself I will breathe in satisfying the mind He trains himself I will breathe out satisfying the mind He trains himself I will breathe in steadying the mind He trains himself I will breathe out steadying the mind He trains himself I will breathe in releasing the mind He trains himself I will breathe out releasing the mind He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on dispassion He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on dispassion He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on cessation He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on cessation He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on relinquishmentThis is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefitAnd how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination On whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long discerns I am breathing out long or breathing in short discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short discerns I am breathing out short trains himself I will breathe in out sensitive to the entire body trains himself I will breathe inout calming bodily fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI tell you monks that this  the inout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world On whatever occasion a monk trains himself I will breathe inout sensitive to rapture trains himself I will breathe inout sensitive to pleasure trains himself I will breathe inout sensitive to mental fabrication trains himself I will breathe inout calming mental fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI tell you monks that this  careful attention to inout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world On whatever occasion a monk trains himself I will breathe inout sensitive to the mind trains himself I will breathe inout satisfying the mind trains himself I will breathe inout steadying the mind trains himself I will breathe inout releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI dont say that there is mindfulness of inout breathing in one of lapsed mindfulness and no alertness which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world On whatever occasion a monk trains himself I will breathe inout focusing on inconstancy trains himself I will breathe inout focusing on dispassion trains himself I will breathe inout focusing on cessation trains himself I will breathe inout focusing on relinquishment On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe who sees with discernment the abandoning of greed  distress is one who watches carefully with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culminationAnd how are the four frames of reference developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world on that occasion his mindfulness is steady  without lapseWhen his mindfulness is steady  without lapse then mindfulness as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development Remaining mindful in this way he examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernmentWhen he remains mindful in this way examining analyzing  coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development In one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment persistence is aroused unflagginglyWhen persistence is aroused unflaggingly in one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then persistence as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development In one whose persistence is aroused a rapture notoftheflesh arisesWhen a rapture notoftheflesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused then rapture as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development For one enraptured at heart the body grows calm and the mind grows calmWhen the body  mind of a monk enraptured at heart grow calm then serenity as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development For one who is at ease  his body calmed  the mind becomes concentratedWhen the mind of one who is at ease  his body calmed  becomes concentrated then concentration as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development He carefully watches the mind thus concentrated with equanimityWhen he carefully watches the mind thus concentrated with equanimity equanimity as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentThis is how the four frames of reference are developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culminationAnd how are the seven factors for awakening developed  pursued so as to bring clear knowing  release to their culminationThere is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishmentHe develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening serenity as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishmentThis is how the seven factors for awakening are developed  pursued so as to bring clear knowing  release to their culminationThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was

he censures right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration right knowledge If he censures right release then he would honor any contemplatives  brahmans who are of wrong release he would praise themIf any contemplative or brahman might think that this Great Forty Dhamma discourse should be censured  rejected there are these ten legitimate implications of his statement that would form grounds for censuring him here  nowEven Vassa  Bhañña  those teachers from Okkala who were proponents of nocausality noaction  noexistence  would not think that this Dhamma discourse on the Great Forty should be censured  rejectedWhy is thatFor fear of criticism opposition  reproachThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThus I have heard At one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the palace of Migaras mother in the Eastern MonasteryThen the brahman GanakaMoggallana approached the Lord having approached he exchanged greetings with the Lord having conversed in a friendly and courteous way he sat down at a respectful distanceAs he was sitting down at a respectful distance GanakaMoggallana the brahman spoke thus to the Lord Just as good Gotama in this palace of Migaras mother there can be seen a gradual training a gradual doing a gradual practice that is to say as far as the last flight of stairs so too good Gotama for these brahmans there can be seen a gradual training a gradual doing a gradual practice that is to say in the study so too good Gotama for these archers there can be seen a gradual practice that is to say in archery so too good Gotama for us whose livelihood is calculation there can be seen a gradual training a gradual practice that is to say in accountancyFor when we get a pupil good Gotama we first of all make him calculate One one two twos three threes four fours five fives six sixes seven sevens eight eights nine nines ten tens and we good Gotama also make him calculate a hundredIs it not possible good Gotama to lay down a similar gradual training gradual doing gradual practice in respect of this dhamma and disciplineIt is possible brahman to lay down a gradual training a gradual doing a gradual practice in respect of this dhamma and discipline Brahman even a skilled trainer of horses having taken on a beautiful thoroughbred first of all gets it used to the training in respect of wearing the bitThen he gets it used to further training  even so brahman the Tathagata having taken on a man to be tamed first of all disciplines him thusCome you monk be of moral habit live controlled by the control of the Obligations endowed with behavior and posture seeing peril in the slightest fault and undertaking them train yourself in the rules of training As soon brahman as the monk is of moral habit controlled by the control of the Obligations endowed with behavior and posture seeing peril in the slightest fault and undertaking them trains himself in the rules of training the Tathagata disciplines him further sayingCome you monk be guarded as to the doors of the senseorgans having seen a material shape with the eye do not be entranced with the general appearance do not be entranced with the detail for if one dwells with the organ of sight uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind may flow inSo fare along controlling it guard the organ of sight achieve control over the organ of sightHaving heard a sound with the ear Having smelt a smell with the nose Having savored a taste with the tongue Having felt a touch with the body Having cognized a mental state with the mind do not be entranced with the detailFor if one dwells with the organ of mind uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind may flow inSo fare along controlling it guard the organ of mind achieve control over the organ of mindAs soon brahman as a monk is guarded as to the doors of the senseorgans the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk be moderate in eating you should take food reflecting carefully not for fun or indulgence or personal charm or beautification but taking just enough for maintaining this body and keeping it going for keeping it unharmed for furthering the Brahmafaring with the thought Thus will I crush out an old feeling and I will not allow a new feeling to arise and then there will be for me subsistence and blamelessness and abiding in comfortAs soon brahman as a monk is moderate in eating the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk dwell intent on vigilance during the day while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental states during the middle watch of the night lie down on the right side in the lion posture foot resting on foot mindful clearly conscious reflecting on the thought of getting up again during the last watch of the night when you have arisen while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental statesAs soon brahman as a monk is intent on vigilance the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk be possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness acting with clear consciousness whether you are approaching or departing acting with clear consciousness whether you are looking ahead or looking round acting with clear consciousness whether you are bending in or stretching out acting with clear consciousness whether you are carrying the outer cloak the bowl or robe acting with clear consciousness whether you are eating drinking munching savoring acting with clear consciousness whether you are obeying the calls of nature acting with clear consciousness whether you are walking standing sitting asleep awake talking or being silentAs soon brahman as he is possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness the Tathagata disciplines him further saying Come you monk choose a remote lodging in a forest at the root of a tree on a mountain slope in a glen a hill cave a cemetery a woodland grove in the open or on a heap of straw On returning from almsgathering after the meal the monk sits down crosslegged holding the back erect having made mindfulness rise up in front of himHe getting rid of covetousness for the world dwells with a mind devoid of covetousness he cleanses the mind of covetousnessGetting

the mind of restlessness and worryGetting rid of doubt he dwells doubtcrossed unperplexed as to the states that are skilled he cleanses his mind of doubtHe by getting rid of these five hindrances which are defilements of the mind and deleterious to intuitive wisdom aloof from pleasures of the senses aloof from unskilled states of mind enters and abides in the first meditation which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought is born of aloofness and is rapturous and joyfulBy allaying initial thought and discursive thought his mind subjectively tranquilized and fixed on one point he enters and abides in the second meditation which is devoid of initial thought and discursive thought is born of concentration and is rapturous and joyfulBy the fading out of rapture he

third meditationBy getting rid of anguish by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows he enters and abides in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish nor joy and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulnessBrahman such is my instruction for those monks who are learners who perfection being not yet attained dwell longing for the incomparable security from the bondsBut as for those monks who are perfected ones the cankers destroyed who have lived the life done what was to be done shed the burden attained to their own goal the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed and who are freed by perfect profound knowledge  these things conduce both to their abiding in ease here and now as well as to their mindfulness and clear consciousnessWhen this had been said the brahman GanakaMoggallana spoke thus to the LordNow on being exhorted thus and instructed thus by the good Gotama do all the good Gotamas disciples attain the unchanging goal  nibbana or do some not attain itSome of my disciples brahman on being exhorted and instructed thus by me attain the unchanging goal  nibbana some do not attain itWhat is the cause good Gotama what the reason that since nibbana does exist since the way leading to nibbana exists since the good Gotama exists as adviser some of the good Gotamas disciples on being exhorted thus and instructed thus by the good Gotama attain the unchanging goal  nibbana but some do not attain itWell then brahman I will question you on this point in replyAs it is pleasing to you so you may answer meWhat do you think about this brahmanAre you skilled in the way leading to RajagahaYes sir skilled am I in the way leading to RajagahaWhat do you think about thisA man might come along here wanting to go to RajagahaHaving approached you he might speak thus I want to go to Rajagaha sir show me the way to this Rajagaha You might speak thus to him Yes my good man this road goes to Rajagaha go along it for a whileWhen you have gone along it for a while you will see a village go along for a while when you have gone along for a while you will see a market town go for a whileWhen you have gone along for a while you will see Rajagaha with its delightful parks delightful forests delightful fields delightful pondsBut although he has been exhorted and instructed thus by you he might take the wrong road and go westwardsThen a second man might come along wanting to go to Rajagaha you will see Rajagaha with its delightful ponds Exhorted and instructed thus by you he might get to Rajagaha safelyWhat is the cause brahman what the reason that since Rajagaha does exist since the way leading to Rajagaha exists since you exist as adviser the one man although being exhorted and instructed thus by you may take the wrong road and go westwards while the other may get to Rajagaha safelyWhat can I good Gotama do in this matterA shower of the way good Gotama am IEven so brahman nibbana does exist the way leading to nibbana exists and I exist as adviserBut some of my disciples on being exhorted and instructed thus by me attain the unchanging goal  nibbana some do not attain itWhat can I brahman do in this matterA shower of the way brahman is a TathagataWhen this had been said the brahman GanakaMoggallana spoke thus to the LordGood Gotama as for those persons who in want of a way of living having gone forth from home into homelessness without faith who are crafty fraudulent deceitful who are unbalanced and puffed up who are shifty scurrilous and of loose talk the doors of whose senseorgans are not guarded who do not know moderation in eating who are not intent on vigilance indifferent to recluseship not of keen respect for the training who are ones for abundance lax taking the lead in backsliding shirking the burden of seclusion who are indolent of feeble energy of confused mindfulness not clearly conscious not concentrated but of wandering minds who are weak in wisdom drivelers  the good Gotama is not in communion with themBut as for those young men of respectable families who have gone forth from home into homelessness from faith who are not crafty fraudulent or deceitful who are not unbalanced or puffed up who are not shifty scurrilous or of loose talk the doors of whose senseorgans are guarded who know moderation in eating who are intent on vigilance longing for recluseship of keen respect for the training who are not ones for abundance not lax shirking backsliding taking the lead in seclusion who are of stirred up energy selfresolute with mindfulness aroused clearly conscious concentrated their minds onepointed who have wisdom are not drivelers  the good Gotama is in communion with themAs good Gotama black gum is pointed to as chief of rootscents as red sandalwood is pointed to as chief of the pithscents as jasmine is pointed to as chief of the flower scents  even so is the exhortation of the good Gotama highest among the teachings of todayExcellent good Gotama excellent good GotamaAs good Gotama one might set upright what had been upset or disclose what had been covered or show the way to one who had gone astray or bring an oillamp into the darkness so that those with vision might see material shapes  even so in many a figure is dhamma made clear by the good GotamaI am going to the revered Gotama for refuge and to dhamma and to the Order of monks May the good Gotama accept me as a layfollower going for refuge from today forth for as long as life lastsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in the Kuru countryNow

VenAnanda said to the Blessed One There is the case lord where a monk having practiced in this way  It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to meWhat is what has come to be that I abandon  obtains equanimityNow would this monk be totally unbound or notA certain such monk might Ananda and another might notWhat is the cause what is the reason whereby one might and another might notThere is the case Ananda where a monk having practiced in this way  It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to meWhat is what has come to be that I abandon  obtains equanimityHe relishes that equanimity welcomes it remains fastened to itAs he relishes that equanimity welcomes it remains fastened to it his consciousness is dependent on it is sustained by itWith clingingsustenance Ananda a monk is not totally unboundBeing sustained where is that monk sustainedThe dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThen indeed being sustained he is sustained by the supreme sustenanceBeing sustained Ananda he is sustained by the supreme sustenance for this  the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  is the supreme sustenanceThere is the case where a monk having practiced in this way  It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to meWhat is what has come to be that I abandon  obtains equanimityHe does not relish that equanimity does not welcome it does not remain fastened to itAs he does not relish that equanimity does not welcome it does not remain fastened to it his consciousness is not dependent on it is not sustained by itWithout clingingsustenance Ananda a monk is totally unboundIts amazing lordIts astoundingFor truly the Blessed One has declared to us the way to cross over the flood by going from one support to the nextBut what is the noble liberationThere is the case Ananda where a disciple of the noble ones considers this Sensuality here  now sensuality in lives to come sensual perceptions here  now sensual perceptions in lives to come forms here  now forms in lives to come formperceptions here  now formperceptions in lives to come perceptions of the imperturbable perceptions of the dimension of nothingness perceptions of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception that is an identity to the extent that there is an identityThis is deathless the liberation of the mind through lack of clingingsustenanceNow Ananda I have taught the practice conducive to the imperturbableI have taught the practice conducive to the dimension of nothingnessI have taught the practice conducive to the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionI have taught the way to cross over the flood by going from one support to the next the noble liberationWhatever a teacher should do  seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them  that have I done for youOver there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellingsPractice jhana AnandaDont be heedlessDont later fall into regretThis is our message to you allThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified VenAnanda delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migaras motherAnd on that occasion  the uposatha of the fifteenth the night of a very full moon  he was sitting out in the open with the community of monksThen a certain monk rising from his seat arranging his robe over one shoulder and placing his hands palmtopalm over the heart said to the Blessed One Lord there is an area where if the Blessed One would give me leave I would like the answer to a questionVery well then monkSit back down in your seat and ask whatever you wantResponding to the Blessed One Yes lord the monk sat back down in his seat and said to the Blessed One Arent these the five clingingaggregates ie form as a clingingaggregate feeling perception fabrications consciousness as a clingingaggregateMonk these are the five clingingaggregates ie form as a clingingaggregate feeling perception fabrications consciousness as a clingingaggregateSaying Very good lord the monk delighted  approved of the Blessed Ones words and then asked him a further question But in what lord are these five clingingaggregates rootedMonk these five clingingaggregates are rooted in desireSaying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question Is clinging the same thing as the five clingingaggregates or is clinging separate from the five clingingaggregatesMonk clinging is neither the same thing as the five clingingaggregates nor is it separate from the five clingingaggregatesJust that whatever passion  delight is there thats the clinging thereSaying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question Might there be diversity in the desire  passion for the five clingingaggregatesThere might monkThere is the case where the thought occurs to someone May I be one with such a form in the futureMay I be one with such a feeling perception fabrications such a consciousness in the futureThis is how there would be diversity in the desire  passion for the five clingingaggregatesSaying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question To what extent does the designation aggregate apply to the aggregatesMonk whatever form is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of formWhatever feeling is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of feelingWhatever perception is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of perceptionWhatever fabrications are past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near those are called the aggregate of fabricationWhatever consciousness is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of consciousnessThis is the extent to which the term aggregate applies to the aggregatesSaying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question Lord what is the cause what the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of formWhat is the cause what the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of feeling perception fabrications consciousnessMonk the four great existents are the cause the four great existents the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of formContact is the cause contact the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of feelingContact is the cause contact the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of perceptionContact is the cause contact the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of fabricationsNameform is the cause nameform the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of consciousnessSaying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question Lord how does selfidentity view come aboutThere is the case monk where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feelingHe assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perceptionHe assumes fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabricationsHe assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessThis monk is how selfidentity view comes aboutSaying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question Lord how does selfidentity view no longer come aboutThere is the case monk where a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe does not assume feeling to be the self does not assume perception to be the self does not assume fabrications to be the self He does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessThis monk is how selfidentity view no longer comes aboutSaying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question What lord is the allure of formWhat is its drawbackWhat is the escape from itWhat is the allure of feeling perception fabrications consciousnessWhat is its drawbackWhat is the escape from itMonk whatever pleasure  joy arises dependent on form that is the allure of formThe fact that form is inconstant stressful subject to change that is the drawback of formThe subduing of desire  passion the abandoning of desire  passion for form that is the escape from formWhatever pleasure  joy arises dependent on feeling that is the allure of feelingWhatever pleasure  joy arises dependent on perception that is the allure of perceptionWhatever pleasure  joy arises dependent on fabrications that is the allure of fabricationsWhatever pleasure  joy arises dependent on consciousness that is the allure of consciousnessThe fact that consciousness is inconstant stressful subject to change that is the drawback of consciousnessThe subduing of desire  passion the abandoning of desire  passion for consciousness that is the escape from consciousnessSaying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question Knowing in what way seeing in what way is there  with regard to this body endowed with consciousness and with regard to all external signs  no longer any Imaking or mymaking or obsession with conceitMonk one sees any form whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  every form as it actually is with right discernment This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amOne sees any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoeverOne sees any consciousness whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  every consciousness  as it actually is with right discernment This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I am Monk knowing in this way seeing in this way there is  with regard to this body endowed with consciousness and with regard to all external signs  no longer any Imaking or mymaking or obsession with conceitNow at that moment this line of thinking appeared in the awareness of a certain monk So  form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself fabrications are notself consciousness is notselfThen what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notselfThen the Blessed One realizing with his awareness the line of thinking in that monks awareness addressed the monks Its possible that a senseless person  immersed in ignorance overcome with craving  might think that he could outsmart the Teachers message in this way So  form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself fabrications are notself consciousness is notselfThen what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notself Now monks havent I trained you in counterquestioning with regard to this  that topic here  thereWhat do you think  Is form constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lord Is feeling constant or inconstant Inconstant lord Is perception constant or inconstant Inconstant lord Are fabrications constant or inconstant Inconstant lordWhat do you think monks  Is consciousness constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lordThus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amAny feeling whatsoeverAny perception whatsoeverAny fabrications whatsoeverAny consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amSeeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousnessDisenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world That is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the minds of sixty monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentationsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali in the Great Forest at the Peaked PavilionNow at that time a large number of monks had declared final gnosis in the Blessed Ones presence We discern that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world Sunakkhatta the Licchavin heard that A large number of monks it seems have declared final gnosis in the Blessed Ones presence We discern that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world Then Sunakkhatta the Licchavin went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I have heard lord that a large number of monks have declared final gnosis in the Blessed Ones presence We discern that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world Now have they rightly declared final gnosis or is it the case that some of them have declared final gnosis out of overestimationSunakkhatta of the monks who have declared final gnosis in my presence it is the case that some have rightly declared final gnosis whereas others have declared final gnosis out of overestimationAs for those who have rightly declared final gnosis that is their truthAs for those who have declared final gnosis out of overestimation the thought occurs to the Tathagata I will teach them the Dhamma Yet there are cases when the thought has occurred to the Tathagata I will teach them the Dhamma but there are worthless men who come to him having formulated question after question so that his thought I will teach them the Dhamma changes into something elseNow is the time O Blessed OneNow is the time O One WellGone for the Blessed One to teach the DhammaHaving heard the Blessed One the monks will remember itThen in that case Sunakkhatta listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord Sunakkhatta the Licchavin responded to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One said Sunakkhatta there are these five strings of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingSounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingThese are the five strings of sensualityNow theres the possible case where a certain person is intent on the baits of the worldWhen a person is intent on the baits of the world that sort of talk interests him his thinking  evaluating follow along those lines he feels at home with that sort of person and his mind gets along with that sort of personBut when talk concerning the imperturbable is going on he does not listen does not lend ear and does not exert his mind to knowHe does not get along with that sort of person his mind does not feel at home with himSuppose that there were a man who had left his home village or town a long time agoAnd he were to meet with a man who had left the village or town only a short time agoHe would ask if the people in the village or town were secure wellfed  free of disease and the second man would tell him if they were secure wellfed  free of diseaseNow what do you think SunakkhattaWould the first man listen to the second man lend ear and exert his mind to knowWould he get along with the second man would his mind feel at home with himYes lordIn the same way it is possible that there is the case where a certain person is intent on the baits of the worldWhen a person is intent on the baits of the world that sort of talk interests him his thinking  evaluating follow along those lines he feels at home with that sort of person and his mind gets along with that sort of personBut when talk concerning the imperturbable is going on he does not listen does not lend ear and does not exert his mind to knowHe does not get along with that sort of person his mind does not feel at home with himThis is how it can be known that This person is intent on the baits of the worldNow theres the possible case where a certain person is intent on the imperturbableWhen a person is intent on the imperturbable that sort of talk interests him his thinking  evaluating follow along those lines he feels at home with that sort of person and his mind gets along with that sort of personBut when talk concerning the baits of the world is going on he does not listen does not lend ear and does not exert his mind to knowHe does not get along with that sort of person his mind does not feel at home with himJust as a yellow leaf released from its stem is incapable of ever again becoming green in the same way when a person is intent on the imperturbable he is released from the fetter of the baits of the worldThis is how it can be known that This person disjoined from the fetter of the baits of the world is intent on the imperturbableNow theres the possible case where a certain person is intent on the dimension of nothingnessWhen a person is intent on the dimension of nothingness that sort of talk interests him his thinking  evaluating follow along those lines he feels at home with that sort of person and his mind gets along with that sort of personBut when talk concerning the imperturbable is going on he does not listen does not lend ear and does not exert his mind to knowHe does not get along with that sort of person his mind does not feel at home with himJust as a thick rock broken in two cannot be put back together again in the same way when a person is intent on the dimension of nothingness he has broken the fetter of the imperturbableThis is how it can be known that This person disjoined from the fetter of the imperturbable is intent on the dimension of nothingnessNow theres the possible case where a certain person is intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionWhen a person is intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception that sort of talk interests him his thinking  evaluating follow along those lines he feels at home with that sort of person and his mind gets along with that sort of personBut when talk concerning the dimension of nothingness is going on he does not listen does not lend ear and does not exert his mind to knowHe does not get along with that sort of person his mind does not feel at home with himSunakkhatta suppose that a person having eaten some delicious food were to vomit it upWhat do you think  would he have any desire for that foodNo lordWhy is thatBecause he would consider that food to be disgustingIn the same way when a person is intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception he has vomited up the fetter of the dimension of nothingnessThis is how it can be known that This person disjoined from the fetter of the dimension of nothingness is intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionNow theres the possible case where a certain person is rightly intent on UnbindingWhen a person is rightly intent on Unbinding that sort of talk interests him his thinking  evaluating follow along those lines he feels at home with that sort of person and his mind gets along with that sort of personBut when talk concerning the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception is going on he does not listen does not lend ear and does not exert his mind to knowHe does not get along with that sort of person his mind does not feel at home with himJust as a palm tree with its top cut off is incapable of further growth in the same way when a person is rightly intent on Unbinding he has destroyed the fetter of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception has destroyed it by the root made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThis is how it can be known that This person disjoined from the fetter of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception is intent on UnbindingNow theres the possible case where a certain monk thinks Craving is said by the Contemplative to be an arrowThe poison of ignorance spreads its toxin through desire passion  ill willI have abandoned the arrowI have expelled the poison of ignoranceI am rightly intent on Unbinding Because this is not true of him he might pursue those things that are unsuitable for a person rightly intent on UnbindingHe might pursue unsuitable forms  sights with the eyeHe might pursue unsuitable sounds with the ear unsuitable aromas with the nose unsuitable flavors with the tongue unsuitable tactile sensations with the bodyHe might pursue unsuitable ideas with the intellectWhen he pursues unsuitable forms  sights with the eye pursues unsuitable ideas with the intellect lust invades the mindWith his mind invaded by lust he incurs death or deathlike sufferingSuppose that a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poisonHis friends  companions kinsmen  relatives would provide him with a surgeonThe surgeon would cut around the opening of the wound with a knife and then would probe for the arrow with a probeHe then would pull out the arrow and extract the poison leaving a residue behindKnowing that a residue was left behind he would say My good man your arrow has been pulled outThe poison has been extracted with a residue left behind but it is not enough to do you harmEat suitable foodDont eat unsuitable food or else the wound will festerWash the wound frequently smear it with an ointment frequently so that blood  pus dont fill the opening of the woundDont walk around in the wind  sun or else dust  dirt may contaminate the opening of the woundKeep looking after the wound my good man and work for its healingThe thought would occur to the man My arrow has been pulled outThe poison has been extracted with a residue left behind but it is not enough to do me harm He would eat unsuitable food so the wound would festerHe wouldnt wash the wound or smear it with an ointment frequently so blood  pus would fill the opening of the woundHe would walk around in the wind  sun so dust  dirt would contaminate the opening of the woundHe wouldnt keep looking after the wound or work for its healingNow both because of these unsuitable actions of his and because of the residue of the dirty poison left behind the wound would swellWith the swelling of the wound he would incur death or deathlike sufferingIn the same way theres the possible case where a certain monk thinks Craving is said by the Contemplative to be an arrowThe poison of ignorance spreads its toxin through desire passion  ill willI have abandoned the arrowI have expelled the poison of ignoranceI am rightly intent on Unbinding Because this is not true of him he might pursue those things that are unsuitable for a person rightly intent on UnbindingHe might pursue unsuitable forms  sights with the eyeHe might pursue unsuitable sounds with the ear unsuitable aromas with the nose unsuitable flavors with the tongue unsuitable tactile sensations with the bodyHe might pursue unsuitable ideas with the intellectWhen he pursues unsuitable forms  sights with the eye pursues unsuitable ideas with the intellect lust invades the mindWith his mind invaded by lust he incurs death or deathlike sufferingFor this is death in the discipline of the noble ones when one renounces the training and returns to the lower lifeAnd this is deathlike suffering when one commits a defiled offenseNow theres the possible case where a certain monk thinks Craving is said by the Contemplative to be an arrowThe poison of ignorance spreads its toxin through desire passion  ill willI have abandoned the arrowI have expelled the poison of ignoranceI am rightly intent on Unbinding Because he is rightly intent on Unbinding

looking after the wound my good man and work for its healingThe thought would occur to the man My arrow has been pulled outThe poison has been extracted with no residue left behind so it is not enough to do me harm He would eat suitable food so the wound wouldnt festerHe would wash the wound and smear it with an ointment frequently so blood  pus wouldnt fill the opening of the woundHe would not walk around in the wind  sun so dust  dirt wouldnt contaminate the opening of the woundHe would keep looking after the wound and would work for its healingNow both because of these suitable actions of his and because of there being no residue of the poison left behind the wound would healWith the healing of the wound and its being covered with skin he wouldnt incur death or deathlike sufferingIn the same way theres the possible case where a certain monk thinks Craving is said by the Contemplative to be an arrowThe poison of ignorance spreads its toxin through desire passion  ill willI have abandoned the arrowI have expelled the poison of ignoranceI am rightly intent on Unbinding Because he is rightly intent on Unbinding he wouldnt pursue those things that are unsuitable for a person rightly intent on UnbindingHe wouldnt pursue unsuitable forms  sights with the eyeHe wouldnt pursue unsuitable sounds with the ear unsuitable aromas with the nose unsuitable flavors with the tongue unsuitable tactile sensations with the bodyHe wouldnt pursue unsuitable ideas with the intellectWhen he doesnt pursue unsuitable forms  sights with the eye doesnt pursue unsuitable ideas with the intellect lust doesnt invade the mindWith his mind not invaded by lust he doesnt incur death or deathlike sufferingI have given this simile to convey a meaningThe meaning is this the wound stands for the six internal sense media the poison for ignorance the arrow for craving the probe for mindfulness the knife for noble discernment the surgeon for the Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakenedNow when a monk  maintaining restraint over the six spheres of contact knowing that Acquisition is the root of stress  is free from acquisition released in the total ending of acquisition its not possible that with regard to acquisition he would stir his body or arouse his mindSuppose there were a beverage in a bronze cup  consummate in its color smell  flavor  but mixed with poisonAnd suppose a man were to come along wanting to live not wanting to die desiring pleasure  abhorring painWhat do you think Sunakkhatta  would he drink the beverage in the bronze cup knowing that Having drunk this I will incur death or deathlike sufferingNo lordIn the same way when a monk  maintaining restraint over the six spheres of contact knowing that Acquisition is the root of stress  is free from acquisition released in the total ending of acquisition its not possible that with regard to acquisition he would stir his body or arouse his mindSuppose there were a deadly poisonous viper and a man were to come along wanting to live not wanting to die desiring pleasure  abhorring painWhat do you think Sunakkhatta  would he give his hand or finger to the snake knowing that Having been bitten by this I will incur death or deathlike sufferingNo lordIn the same way when a monk  maintaining restraint over the six spheres of contact knowing that Acquisition is the root of stress  is free from acquisition released in the total ending of acquisition its not possible that with regard to acquisition he would stir his body or arouse his mindThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified Sunakkhatta the Licchavin delighted in the Blessed Ones words There are five ideas that ripen here and now in two waysWhat fiveFaith preference hearsaylearning arguing upon evidence and liking through pondering a viewNow something may have faith well placed in it and yet be hollow empty and false and again something may have no faith placed in it and yet be factual true and no other than it seems and so with preference and the restIf a man has faith then he guards truth when he says My faith is thus but on that account draws no unreserved conclusion Only this is true the other is wrong In this way he guards the truth but there is as yet no discovery of truthAnd so with preference and the restHow is truth discoveredHere a bhikkhu lives near some village or townThen a householder or his son goes to him in order to test him in three kinds of ideas in ideas provocative of greed of hate and of delusion wondering Are there in this venerable one any such ideas whereby his mind being obsessed he might not knowing say I know unseeing say I see or to get others to do likewise which would be long for their harm and suffering While thus testing him he comes to find that there are no such ideas in him and he finds that The bodily and verbal behavior of that venerable one are not those of one affected by lust or hate or delusionBut the True Idea that this venerable one teaches is profound hard to see and discover yet it is the most peaceful and superior of all out of reach of logical ratiocination subtle for the wise to experience such a True Idea cannot be taught by one affected by lust or hate or delusionIt is as soon as by testing him he comes to see that he is purified from ideas provocative of lust hate and delusion that he then plants his faith in himWhen he visits him he respects him when he respects him he gives ear one who gives ear hears the True Idea he remembers it he investigates the meaning of the ideas rememberedWhen he does that he acquires a preference by pondering the ideasThat produces interestOne interested is actively committedSo committed he makes a judgmentAccording to his judgment he exerts himselfWhen he exerts himself he comes to realize with the body the ultimate truth and he sees it by the penetrating of it with understandingThat is how there is discovery of truthBut there is as yet no final arrival at truthHow is truth finally arrived atFinal arrival at truth is the repetition the keeping in being the development of those same ideasThat is how there is final arrival at truth Now at that time the Blessed One was sitting  exchanging courtesies  conversation with some very senior brahmansIt so happened that a brahman student named Kapadika was seated in the assembly young shavenheaded sixteen years old a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology  etymologies and the histories as a fifth skilled in philology  grammar wellversed in cosmology  the marks of a great manWhile the very senior brahmans were conversing with the Blessed One he kept breaking in  interrupting their talkSo the Blessed One scolded him Venerable Bharadvaja dont break in  interrupt while the very senior brahmans are conversingWait until they are finished talkingWhen this was said the brahman Canki said to the Blessed One Master Gotama dont scold the brahman student KapadikaHe is a clansman learned wise with good deliveryHe is capable of taking part in this discussion with Master GotamaThen the thought occurred to the Blessed One Yes this brahman student Kapadika must be accomplished in the texts of the Three Vedas inasmuch as the brahmans honor him soThen the thought occurred to Kapadika When Gotama the contemplative meets my gaze with his I will ask him a questionAnd so the Blessed One encompassing Kapadikas awareness with his awareness met his gazeKapadika thought Gotama the contemplative has turned to meSuppose I ask him a question So he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama with regard to the ancient hymns of the brahmans  passed down through oral transmission  included in their canon  the brahmans have come to the definite conclusion that Only this is true anything else is worthless What does Master Gotama have to say to thisTell me Bharadvaja is there among the brahmans even one brahman who says This I know this I see only this is true anything else is worthless No Master GotamaAnd has there been among the brahmans even one teacher or teachers teacher back through seven generations who said This I know this I see only this is true anything else is worthless No Master GotamaAnd among the brahman seers of the past the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymns  those ancient hymns sung repeated  collected which brahmans at present still sing still chant repeating what was said repeating what was spoken  ie Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa  Bhagu was there even one of these who said This we know this we see only this is true anything else is worthless No Master GotamaSo then Bharadvaja it seems that there isnt among the brahmans even one brahman who says This I know this I see only this is true anything else is worthless And there hasnt been among the brahmans even one teacher or teachers teacher back through seven generations who said This I know this I see only this is true anything else is worthless And there hasnt been among the brahman seers of the past the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymns even one who said This we know this we see only this is true anything else is worthless Suppose there were a row of blind men each holding on to the one in front of him the first one doesnt see the middle one doesnt see the last one doesnt seeIn the same way the statement of the brahmans turns out to be a row of blind men as it were the first one doesnt see the middle one doesnt see the last one doesnt seeSo what do you think Bharadvaja this being the case doesnt the conviction of the brahmans turn out to be groundlessIts not only out of conviction Master Gotama that the brahmans honor thisThey also honor it as unbroken traditionBharadvaja first you went by convictionNow you speak of unbroken traditionThere are five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenowWhich fiveConviction liking unbroken tradition reasoning by analogy  an agreement through pondering viewsThese are the five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenowNow some things are firmly held in conviction and yet vain empty  falseSome things are not firmly held in conviction and yet they are genuine factual  unmistakenSome things are wellliked truly an unbroken tradition wellreasoned Some things are wellpondered and yet vain empty  falseSome things are not wellpondered and yet they are genuine factual  unmistakenIn these cases it isnt proper for a knowledgeable person who safeguards the truth to come to a definite conclusion Only this is true anything else is worthlessBut to what extent Master Gotama is there the safeguarding of the truthTo what extent does one safeguard the truthWe ask Master Gotama about the safeguarding of the truthIf a person has conviction his statement This is my conviction safeguards the truthBut he doesnt yet come to the definite conclusion that Only this is true anything else is worthless To this extent Bharadvaja there is the safeguarding of the truthTo this extent one safeguards the truthI describe this as the safeguarding of the truthBut it is not yet an awakening to the truthIf a person likes something holds an unbroken tradition has something reasoned through analogy has something he agrees to having pondered views his statement This is what I agree to having pondered views safeguards the truthBut he doesnt yet come to the definite conclusion that Only this is true anything else is worthless To this extent Bharadvaja there is the safeguarding of the truthTo this extent one safeguards the truthI describe this as the safeguarding of the truthBut it is not yet an awakening to the truthYes Master Gotama to this extent there is the safeguarding of the truthTo this extent one safeguards the truthWe regard this as the safeguarding of the truthBut to what extent is there an awakening to the truthTo what extent does one awaken to the truthWe ask Master Gotama about awakening to the truthThere is the case Bharadvaja where a monk lives in dependence on a certain village or townThen a householder or householders son goes to him and observes him with regard to three mental qualities  qualities based on greed qualities based on aversion qualities based on delusion Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on greed that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say I know while not knowing or say I see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for hisher longterm harm  pain As he observes him he comes to know There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on greed His bodily behavior  verbal behavior are those of one not greedyAnd the Dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wiseThis Dhamma cant easily be taught by a person whos greedyWhen on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on greed he next observes him with regard to qualities based on aversion Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on aversion that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say I know while not knowing or say I see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for hisher longterm harm  pain As he observes him he comes to know There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on aversion His bodily behavior  verbal behavior are those of one not aversiveAnd the Dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wiseThis Dhamma cant easily be taught by a person whos aversiveWhen on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on aversion he next observes him with regard to qualities based on delusion Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on delusion that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say I know while not knowing or say I see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for hisher longterm harm  pain As he observes him he comes to know There are in this venerable one no such qualities based

tobeexperienced by the wiseThis Dhamma cant easily be taught by a person whos deludedWhen on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on delusion he places conviction in himWith the arising of conviction he visits him  grows close to himGrowing close to him he lends earLending ear he hears the DhammaHearing the Dhamma he remembers itRemembering it he penetrates the meaning of those dhammasPenetrating the meaning he comes to an agreement through pondering those dhammasThere being an agreement through pondering those dhammas desire arisesWith the arising of desire he becomes willingWilling he contemplatesContemplating he makes an exertionExerting himself he both realizes the ultimate meaning of the truth with his body and sees by penetrating it with discernmentTo this extent Bharadvaja there is an awakening to the truthTo this extent one awakens to the truthI describe this as an awakening to the truthBut it is not yet the final attainment of the truthYes Master Gotama to this extent there is an awakening to the truthTo this extent one awakens to the truthWe regard this as an awakening to the truthBut to what extent is there the final attainment of the truthTo what extent does one finally attain the truthWe ask Master Gotama about the final attainment of the truthThe cultivation development  pursuit of those very same qualities to this extent Bharadvaja there is the final attainment of the truthTo this extent one finally attains the truthI describe this as the final attainment of the truthYes Master Gotama to this extent there is the final attainment of the truthTo this extent one finally attains the truthWe regard this as the final attainment of the truthBut what quality is most helpful for the final attainment of the truthWe ask Master Gotama about the quality most helpful for the final attainment of the truthExertion is most helpful for the final attainment of the truth BharadvajaIf one didnt make an exertion one wouldnt finally attain the truthBecause one makes an exertion one finally attains the truthTherefore exertion is most helpful for the final attainment of the truthBut what quality is most helpful for exertionWe ask Master Gotama about the quality most helpful for exertionContemplating is most helpful for exertion BharadvajaIf one didnt contemplate one wouldnt make an exertionBecause one contemplates one makes an exertionTherefore contemplating is most helpful for exertionBut what quality is most helpful for contemplating Being willing If one werent willing one wouldnt contemplate But what quality is most helpful for being willing Desire If desire didnt arise one wouldnt be willing But what quality is most helpful for desire Coming to an agreement through pondering dhammas If one didnt come to an agreement through pondering dhammas desire wouldnt arise But what quality is most helpful for coming to an agreement through pondering dhammas Penetrating the meaning If one didnt penetrate the meaning one wouldnt come to an agreement through pondering dhammas But what quality is most helpful for penetrating the meaning Remembering the Dhamma If one didnt remember the Dhamma one wouldnt penetrate the meaning But what quality is most helpful for remembering the Dhamma Hearing the Dhamma If one didnt hear the Dhamma one wouldnt remember the Dhamma But what quality is most helpful for hearing the Dhamma Lending ear If one didnt lend ear one wouldnt hear the Dhamma But what quality is most helpful for lending ear Growing close If one didnt grow close one wouldnt lend ear But what quality is most helpful for growing close Visiting If one didnt visit one wouldnt grow close But what quality is most helpful for visitingWe ask Master Gotama about the quality most helpful for visitingConviction is most helpful for visiting BharadvajaIf conviction didnt arise one wouldnt visitBecause conviction arises one visitsTherefore conviction is most helpful for visitingWe have asked Master Gotama about safeguarding the truth and Master Gotama has answered about safeguarding the truthWe like that  agree with that and so we are gratifiedWe have asked Master Gotama about awakening to the truth and Master Gotama has answered about awakening to the truthWe like that  agree with that and so we are gratifiedWe have asked Master Gotama about finally attaining the truth and Master Gotama has answered about finally attaining the truthWe like that  agree with that and so we are gratifiedWe have asked Master Gotama about the quality most helpful for finally attaining the truth and Master Gotama has answered about the quality most helpful for finally attaining the truthWe like that  agree with that and so we are gratifiedWhatever we have asked Master Gotama Master Gotama has answered itWe like that  agree with that and so we are gratifiedWe used to think Who are these baldheaded contemplatives these menial dark offspring of the Kinsmans feetWho are they to know the Dhamma But now Master Gotama has inspired within us a contemplativelove for contemplatives a contemplativeconfidence in contemplatives a contemplativerespect for contemplativesMagnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for lifeSee also AN ANIn this sutta the Buddha refutes the theories of the Jains  here called the Niganthas  an order of contemplatives flourishing in India during his timeAlthough on the surface this sutta may seem to be of strictly historical interest it makes two important points that are very relevant to some common misunderstandings about Buddhism alive todayThe first point concerns the Buddhist teaching on action or kammaThe general understanding of this teaching is that actions from the past determine present pleasure and pain while present actions determine future pleasure and painOr to quote a recent book devoted to the topic Karma is the moral principle that governs human conductIt declares that our present experience is conditioned by our past conduct and that our present conduct will condition our future experience This however does not accurately describe the Buddhas teaching on karma and is instead a fairly accurate account of the Nigantha teaching which the Buddha explicitly refutes hereAs he interrogates the Niganthas he makes the point that if all pleasure and pain experienced in the present were determined by past action why is it that they now feel the pain of harsh treatment when they practice asceticism and no pain of harsh treatment when they dontIf past action were the sole determining factor then present action should have no effect on their present experience of pleasure or painIn this way the Buddha points to one of the most distinctive features of his own teaching on kamma that the present experience of pleasure and pain is a combined result of both past and present actionsThis seemingly small addition to the notion of kamma plays an enormous role in allowing for the exercise of free will and the possibility of putting an end to suffering before the effects of all past actions have ripenedIn other words this addition is what makes Buddhist practice possible and makes it possible for a person who has completed the practice to survive and teach it with full authority to othersFor more on these points see the articles Karma A Refuge in Skillful Action and Five Piles of Bricks see also the Introduction to The Wings to Awakening along with the introductions to the sections on Skillfulness and Kamma  the Ending of Kamma in that bookThe second important point touched on in this sutta  how to put an end to pain and suffering  relates to the firstIf the cause of present suffering were located exclusively in the past no one could do anything in the present moment to stop that suffering the most that could be done would be to endure the suffering while not creating any new kamma leading to future sufferingAlthough this was the Jain approach to practice many people at present believe that it is the Buddhist approach as wellMeditation according to this understanding is the process of purifying the mind of old kamma by training it to look on with nonreactive equanimity as pain arisesThe pain is the result of old kamma the equanimity adds no new kamma and thus over time all old kamma can be burned awayIn this sutta however the Buddha heaps ridicule on this ideaFirst he notes that none of the Niganthas have ever come to the end of pain by trying to burn it away in this way then he notes that they have based their belief in this practice entirely on their faith in their teacher and their approval of his ideas but neither faith nor approval can act as guarantees of the truthAs he illustrates with his simile of the man shot with an arrow only a person who has succeeded in going beyond pain would be in a position to speak with authority of the method that actually puts an end to painThe Buddha then provides his own account of how meditation actually works in putting an end to pain and sufferingHis discussion shows that the problem underlying pain is not past action but passion  in the present  for the causes of painIn other words pain is not inevitablePresent suffering can be prevented by changing ones understanding of and attitude toward the cause of suffering in the presentThe Buddha illustrates this principle with the simile of a man in love with a woman As long as he feels passion for her he will suffer when he sees her enjoying the company of another man when seeing the connection between his suffering and his passion he abandons that passion he will no longer suffer from that causeThus the practice must focus on ways to understand and bring about dispassion for the causes of stress and pain here and nowAs the Buddha points out in MN equanimity plays an important role in this practice but it can also become an object for passion and delight which would then stand in the way of true releaseThus he notes here that in some cases dispassion can arise simply from onlooking equanimity directed at the causes of stressIn other cases it can come only through exertion the mental effort  through the fabrications of directed thought evaluation and perception  to develop the discernment needed to see through and abandon any and all passionThe remainder of the sutta is devoted to a standard map of how the practice develops over time showing how the proper mixture of onlooking equanimity combined with fabrication and exertion can lead to dispassion and through dispassion to release from all stress and sufferingI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the SakyansNow the Sakyans have a city named Devadaha and there the Blessed One addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said Monks there are some brahmans  contemplatives who teach in this way who have this view Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the pastThus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the futureWith no flow into the future there is the ending of actionWith the ending of action the ending of stressWith the ending of stress the ending of feelingWith the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted Such is the teaching of the NiganthasGoing to Niganthas who teach in this way I have asked them Is it true friend Niganthas that you teach in this way that you have this view Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the pastThus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the futureWith no flow into the future there is the ending of actionWith the ending of action the ending of stressWith the ending of stress the ending of feelingWith the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhaustedHaving been asked this by me the Niganthas admitted it YesSo I said to them But friends do you know that you existed in the past and that you did not not existNo friendAnd do you know that you did evil actions in the past and that you did not not do themNo friendAnd do you know that you did suchandsuch evil actions in the pastNo friendAnd do you know that soandso much stress has been exhausted or that soandso much stress remains to be exhausted or that with the exhaustion of soandso much stress all stress will be exhaustedNo friendBut do you know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenowNo friendSo friends it seems that you dont know that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist you dont know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenowThat being the case it is not proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the pastThus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the futureWith no flow into the future there is the ending of actionWith the ending of action the ending of stressWith the ending of stress the ending of feelingWith the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhaustedIf however you knew that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist if you knew that you did evil actions in the past and that you did not not do them if you knew that you did suchandsuch evil actions in the past you dont know that soandso much stress has been exhausted or that soandso much stress remains to be exhausted or that with the exhaustion of soandso much stress all stress will be exhausted if you knew what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenow then  that being the case  it would be proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the pastThus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the futureWith no flow into the future there is the ending of actionWith the ending of action the ending of stressWith the ending of stress the ending of feelingWith the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhaustedFriend Niganthas its as if a man were shot with an arrow thickly smeared with poisonAs a result of being shot with the arrow he would feel fierce sharp racking painsHis friends  companions kinsmen  relatives would provide him with a surgeonThe surgeon would cut around the opening of the wound with a knifeAs a result of the surgeons cutting around the opening of the wound with a knife the man would feel fierce sharp racking painsThe surgeon would probe for the arrow with a probeAs a result of the surgeons probing for the arrow with a probe the man would feel fierce sharp racking painsThe surgeon would then pull out the arrowAs a result of the surgeons pulling out the arrow the man would feel fierce sharp racking painsThe surgeon would then apply a burning medicine to the mouth of the woundAs a result of the surgeons applying a burning medicine to the mouth of the wound the man would feel fierce sharp racking painsBut then at a later time when the wound had healed and was covered with skin he would be well  happy free master of himself able to go wherever he likedThe thought would occur to him Before I was shot with an arrow thickly smeared with poisonAs a result of being shot with the arrow I felt fierce sharp racking painsMy friends  companions kinsmen  relatives provided me with a surgeon The surgeon cut around the opening of the wound with a knife probed for the arrow with a probe pulled out the arrow applied a burning medicine to the mouth of the woundAs a result of his applying a burning medicine to the mouth of the wound I felt fierce sharp racking painsBut now that the wound is healed and covered with skin I am well  happy free master of myself able to go wherever I likeIn the same way friend Niganthas if you knew that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist if you knew what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenow then  that being the case  it would be proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the pastThus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the futureWith no flow into the future there is the ending of actionWith the ending of action the ending of stressWith the ending of stress the ending of feelingWith the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted But because you do not know that you existed in the past you do not know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenow then  that being the case  it is not proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the pastThus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the futureWith no flow into the future there is the ending of actionWith the ending of action the ending of stressWith the ending of stress the ending of feelingWith the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhaustedWhen this was said the Niganthas said to me Friend the Nigantha Nataputta is allknowing allseeing and claims total knowledge  vision thus Whether I am walking or standing sleeping or awake knowledge  vision are continuously  continually established in me He has told us Niganthas there are evil actions that you have done in the pastExhaust them with these painful austeritiesWhen in the present you are restrained in body restrained in speech and restrained in mind that is the nondoing of evil action for the futureThus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the futureWith no flow into the future there is the ending of actionWith the ending of action the ending of stressWith the ending of stress the ending of feelingWith the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted We approve of that prefer it and are gratified by itWhen this was said I said to the Niganthas Friend Niganthas there are five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenowWhich fiveConviction liking unbroken tradition reasoning by analogy  an agreement through pondering viewsThese are the five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenowThat being the case what kind of conviction do you have for your teacher with regard to the pastWhat kind of likingWhat kind of unbroken traditionWhat kind of reasoning by analogyWhat kind of agreement through pondering views But when I said this I did not see that the Niganthas had any legitimate defense of their teachingSo I asked them further Friend Niganthas what do you think When there is fierce striving fierce exertion do you feel fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatmentAnd when there is no fierce striving no fierce exertion do you feel no fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatmentYes friend Then its not proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the pastThus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the futureWith no flow into the future there is the ending of actionWith the ending of action the ending of stressWith the ending of stress the ending of feelingWith the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhaustedIf it were the case that when there was fierce striving fierce exertion you felt fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment and when there was no fierce striving no fierce exertion you still felt fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment then  that being the case  it would be proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the pastThus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the futureWith no flow into the future there is the ending of actionWith the ending of action the ending of stressWith the ending of stress the ending of feelingWith the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted But because when there is fierce striving fierce exertion you feel fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment and when there was no fierce striving no fierce exertion you feel no fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment then  that being the case  it is not proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the pastThus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the futureWith no flow into the future there is the ending of actionWith the ending of action the ending of stressWith the ending of stress the ending of feelingWith the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted But when I said this I did not see that the Niganthas had any legitimate defense of their teachingSo I asked them further Friend Niganthas what do you think Can an action to be experienced in the herenow be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced in the future lifeNo friendCan an action to be experienced in the future life be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced in the herenowNo friendWhat do you think Can an action to be experienced as pleasure be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced as painNo friendCan an action to be experienced as pain be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced as pleasureNo friendWhat do you think Can an action ripe to be experienced be turned through striving  exertion into an action not ripe to be experiencedNo friendCan an action not ripe to be experienced be turned through striving  exertion into an action ripe to be experiencedNo friendWhat do you think Can an action greatly to be experienced be turned through striving  exertion into an action barely to be experiencedNo friendCan an action barely to be experienced be turned through striving  exertion into an action greatly to be experiencedNo friendWhat do you think Can an action to be experienced be turned through striving  exertion into an action not to be experiencedNo friendCan an action not to be experienced be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experiencedNo friendSo friends it seems that an action to be experienced in the herenow cannot be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced in the future lifeAn action to be experienced in the future life cannot be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced in the herenow An action to be experienced cannot be turned through striving  exertion into an action not to be experiencedAn action not to be experienced cannot be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experiencedThat being the case the striving of the Niganthas is fruitless their exertion is fruitlessSuch is the teaching of the NiganthasAnd such being the teaching of the Niganthas ten legitimate deductions can be drawn that give grounds for censuring themIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on what was done in the past then obviously the Niganthas have done bad things in the past which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking painsIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on the creative act of a supreme god then obviously the Niganthas have been created by an evil supreme god which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking painsIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on sheer luck then obviously the Niganthas have evil luck which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking painsIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on birth then obviously the Niganthas have had an evil birth which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking painsIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on efforts in the herenow then obviously the Niganthas have evil efforts in the herenow which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking painsIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on what was done in the past the Niganthas deserve censureEven if not they still deserve censureIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on the creative act of a supreme god the Niganthas deserve censureEven if not they still deserve censureIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on sheer luck the Niganthas deserve censureEven if not they still deserve censureIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on birth the Niganthas deserve censureEven if not they still deserve censureIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on efforts in the herenow the Niganthas deserve censureEven if not they still deserve censureSuch is the teaching of the Niganthas monksAnd such being the teaching of the Niganthas these ten legitimate deductions can be drawn that give grounds for censuring themThis is how striving is fruitless how exertion is fruitlessAnd how is striving fruitful how is exertion fruitfulThere is the case where a monk when not loaded down does not load himself down with pain nor does he reject pleasure that accords with the Dhamma although he is not fixated on that pleasureHe discerns that When I exert a fabrication against this cause of stress then from the fabrication of exertion there is dispassionWhen I look on with equanimity at that cause of stress then from the development of equanimity there is dispassion So he exerts a fabrication against the cause of stress where there comes dispassion from the fabrication of exertion and develops equanimity with regard to the cause of stress where there comes dispassion from the development of equanimityThus the stress coming from the cause of stress for which there is dispassion through the fabrication of exertion is exhausted  the stress resulting from the cause of stress for which there is dispassion through the development of equanimity is exhaustedSuppose that a man is in love with a woman his mind ensnared with fierce desire fierce passionHe sees her standing with another man chatting joking  laughingWhat do you think monks As he sees her standing with another man chatting joking  laughing would sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise in himYes lordWhy is thatBecause he is in love with her his mind ensnared with fierce desire fierce passion Now suppose the thought were to occur to him I am in love with this woman my mind ensnared with fierce desire fierce passionWhen I see her standing with another man chatting joking  laughing then sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise within meWhy dont I abandon my desire  passion for that woman So he abandons his desire  passion for that woman and afterwards sees her standing with another man chatting joking  laughingWhat do you think monks As he sees her standing with another man chatting joking  laughing would sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise in himNo lordWhy is thatHe is dispassionate toward that woman In the same way the monk when not loaded down does not load himself down with pain nor does he reject pleasure that accords with the Dhamma although he is not infatuated with that pleasureHe discerns that When I exert a fabrication against this cause of stress then from the fabrication of exertion there is dispassionWhen I look on with equanimity at that cause of stress then from the development of equanimity there is dispassion So he exerts a fabrication against the cause of stress where there comes dispassion from the fabrication of exertion and develops equanimity with regard to the cause of stress where there comes dispassion from the development of equanimityThus the stress coming from the cause of stress for which there is dispassion through the fabrication of exertion is exhausted  the stress resulting from the cause of stress for which there is dispassion through the development of equanimity is exhaustedFurthermore the monk notices this When I live according to my pleasure unskillful mental qualities increase in me  skillful qualities declineWhen I exert myself with stress  pain though unskillful qualities decline in me  skillful qualities increaseWhy dont I exert myself with stress  pain So he exerts himself with stress  pain and while he is exerting himself with stress  pain unskillful qualities decline in him  skillful qualities increaseThen at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress  painWhy is thatBecause he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress  painThat is why at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress  painSuppose a fletcher were to heat  warm an arrow shaft between two flames making it straight  pliableThen at a later time he would no longer heat  warm the shaft between two flames making it straight  pliableWhy is thatBecause he has attained the goal for which he was heating  warming the shaftThat is why at a later time he would no longer heat  warm the shaft between two flames making it straight  pliableIn the same way the monk notices this When I live according to my pleasure unskillful mental qualities increase in me  skillful qualities declineWhen I exert myself with stress  pain though unskillful qualities decline in me  skillful qualities increaseWhy dont I exert myself with stress  pain So he exerts himself with stress  pain and while he is exerting himself with stress  pain unskillful qualities decline in him  skillful qualities increaseThen at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress  painWhy is thatBecause he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress  painThat is why at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress  painThis is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitfulFurthermore there is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakenedHe teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its endHe proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pureA householder or householders son hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects Household life is confining a dusty pathLife gone forth is the open airIt isnt easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shellWhat if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessnessSo after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessnessWhen he has thus gone forth endowed with the monks training  livelihood then  abandoning the taking of life  he abstains from the taking of lifeHe dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beingsAbandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not givenHe takes only what is given accepts only what is given lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pureThis too is part of his virtueAbandoning uncelibacy he lives a celibate life aloof refraining from the sexual act that is the villagers wayAbandoning false speech he abstains from false speechHe speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the worldAbandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speechWhat he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people hereWhat he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people thereThus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concordAbandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speechHe speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing and pleasing to people at largeAbandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatterHe speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma and the VinayaHe speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goalHe abstains from damaging seed and plant lifeHe eats only once a day refraining from the evening meal and from food at the wrong time of dayHe abstains from dancing singing instrumental music and from watching showsHe abstains from wearing garlands and from beautifying himself with scents and cosmeticsHe abstains from high and luxurious beds and seatsHe abstains from accepting gold and moneyHe abstains from accepting uncooked grain raw meat women and girls male and female slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle steeds and mares fields and propertyHe abstains from running messages from buying and selling from dealing with false scales false metals and false measures from bribery deception and fraudHe abstains from mutilating executing imprisoning highway robbery plunder and violenceHe is content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hungerJust as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hungerWherever he goes he takes only his barest necessities alongEndowed with this noble aggregate of virtue he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blamelessOn seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himOn hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odor with the nose On tasting a flavor with the tongue On touching a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himEndowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blamelessWhen going forward and returning he acts with alertnessWhen looking toward and looking away when bending and extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe and his bowl when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and remaining silent he acts with alertnessEndowed with this noble aggregate of virtue this noble restraint over the sense faculties this noble mindfulness  alertness he seeks out a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of strawAfter his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the foreAbandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousnessHe cleanses his mind of covetousnessAbandoning ill will and anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beingsHe cleanses his mind of ill will and angerAbandoning sloth and drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness mindful alert percipient of lightHe cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsinessAbandoning restlessness and anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilledHe cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxietyAbandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualitiesHe cleanses his mind of uncertaintyHaving abandoned these five hindrances  imperfections of awareness that weaken discernment  then quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluationThis too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitfulThen with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure onepointedness of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assuranceThis too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitfulThen with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding This too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitfulThen with the abandoning of pleasure and pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainThis too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitfulWith his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past livesHe recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and detailsThis too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitfulWith his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beingsHe sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kammaThis too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitfulWith his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentationsHe discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world This too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitfulSuch is the teaching of the TathagataAnd such being the teaching of the Tathagata ten legitimate deductions can be drawn that give grounds for praising himIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on what was done in the past then obviously the Tathagata has done good things in the past which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentationIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on the creative act of a supreme god then obviously the Tathagata has been created by an excellent supreme god which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentationIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on sheer luck then obviously the Tathagata has admirable luck which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentationIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on birth then obviously the Tathagata has had an admirable birth which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentationIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on efforts in the herenow then obviously the Tathagata has admirable efforts in the herenow which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentationIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on what was done in the past the Tathagata deserves praiseEven if not he still deserves praiseIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on the creative act of a supreme god Tathagata deserves praiseEven if not he still deserves praiseIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on sheer luck the Tathagata deserves praiseEven if not he still deserves praiseIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on birth Tathagata deserves praiseEven if not he still deserves praiseIf beings experience pleasure  pain based on efforts in the herenow the Tathagata deserves praiseEven if not he still deserves praiseSuch is the teaching of the TathagataAnd such being the teaching of the Tathagata these ten legitimate deductions can be drawn that give grounds for praising himThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryNow on that occasion VenSariputta was wandering in the Southern Mountains with a large community of monksThen a certain monk who had spent the Rains in Rajagaha went to the Southern Mountains to VenSariputtaOn arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with VenSariputta and  after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies  sat to one sideAs he was sitting there VenSariputta said to him I trust friend that the Blessed One is strong  free from illnessThe Blessed One friend is strong  free from illnessI trust that the community of monks is strong  free from illnessThe community of monks is also strong  free from illnessAt the Tandulapala Gate is a brahman named DhanañjaninI trust that he is strong  free from illnessDhanañjanin the brahman is also strong  free from illnessAnd I trust that Dhanañjanin the brahman is heedfulFrom where would our Dhanañjanin the brahman get any heedfulness friendRelying on the king he plunders brahmans  householdersRelying on the brahmans  householders he plunders the kingHis wife  a woman of faith fetched from a family with faith  has diedHe has fetched another wife  a woman of no faith  from a family with no faithWhat a bad thing to hear my friend  when we hear that Dhanañjanin the brahman is heedlessPerhaps sooner or later we might meet with Dhanañjanin the brahmanPerhaps there might be some conversationThen VenSariputta having stayed in the Southern Mountains as long as he liked wandered in the direction of RajagahaAfter wandering by stages he arrived at RajagahaThere he stayed near Rajagaha in the Squirrels SanctuaryThen early in the morning VenSariputta put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe went into Rajagaha for almsAnd on that occasion Dhanañjanin the brahman was milking cows in a cow pen outside the cityThen VenSariputta having gone for alms in Rajagaha after his meal on his way back from his almsround went to Dhanañjanin the brahmanDhanañjanin the brahman saw VenSariputta coming from afarOn seeing him he went to him and said Drink some of this fresh milk master SariputtaIt must be time for your mealThats all right brahmanI have finished my meal for todayMy days abiding will be under that tree over thereYou may come thereAs you say master Dhanañjanin responded to VenSariputtaThen after he had finished his morning meal he went to VenSariputtaOn arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with VenSariputta and  after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies  sat to one sideAs he was sitting there VenSariputta said to him I trust Dhanañjanin that you are heedfulFrom where would we get any heedfulness master when parents are to be supported wife  children are to be supported slaves  workers are to be supported friendcompanion duties are to be done for friends  companions kinsmenrelative duties for kinsmen  relatives guest duties for guests departedancestor duties for departed ancestors devata duties for devatas king duties for the king and this body also has to be refreshed  nourishedWhat do you think DhanañjaninThere is the case where a certain person for the sake of his mother  father does what is unrighteous does what is discordantThen because of his unrighteous discordant behavior hellwardens drag him off to hellWould he gain anything by saying I did what is unrighteous what is discordant for the sake of my mother  fatherDont me into hell hellwardens Or would his mother  father gain anything for him by saying He did what is unrighteous what is discordant for our sakeDont him into hell hellwardensNo master SariputtaEven right while he was wailing theyd cast him into hellWhat do you think DhanañjaninThere is the case where a certain person for the sake of his wife  children his slaves  workers his friends  companions his kinsmen  relatives his guests his departed ancestors the devatas the king does what is unrighteous does what is discordantThen because of his unrighteous discordant behavior hellwardens drag him off to hellWould he gain anything by saying I did what is unrighteous what is discordant for the sake of the kingDont me into hell hellwardens Or would the king gain anything for him by saying He did what is unrighteous what is discordant for our sakeDont him into hell hellwardensNo master SariputtaEven right while he was wailing theyd cast him into hellWhat do you think DhanañjaninThere is the case where a certain person for the sake of refreshing  nourishing his body does what is unrighteous does what is discordantThen because of his unrighteous discordant behavior hellwardens drag him off to hellWould he gain anything by saying I did what is unrighteous what is discordant for the sake of refreshing  nourishing my bodyDont me into hell hellwardens Or would others gain anything for him by saying He did what is unrighteous what is discordant for the sake of refreshing  nourishing his bodyDont him into hell hellwardensNo master SariputtaEven right while he was wailing theyd cast him into hellNow what do you think DhanañjaninWhich is the better one who for the sake of his mother  father would do what is unrighteous what is discordant or one who for the sake of his mother  father would do what is righteous what is concordantMaster Sariputta the one who for the sake of his mother  father would do what is unrighteous what is discordant is not the better oneThe one who for the sake of his mother  father would do what is righteous what is concordant would be the better one thereRighteous behavior concordant behavior is better than unrighteous behavior discordant behaviorDhanañjanin there are other activities  reasonable righteous  by which one can support ones mother  father and at the same time both not do evil and practice the practice of meritWhat do you think Dhanañjanin Which is the better one who for the sake of his wife  children his slaves  workers his friends  companions his kinsmen  relatives his guests his departed ancestors the devatas the king refreshing  nourishing his body would do what is unrighteous what is discordant or one who for the sake of refreshing  nourishing his body would do what is righteous what is concordantMaster Sariputta the one who for the sake of refreshing  nourishing his body would do what is unrighteous what is discordant is not the better oneThe one who for the sake of refreshing  nourishing his body would do what is righteous what is concordant would be the better one thereRighteous behavior concordant behavior is better than unrighteous behavior discordant behaviorDhanañjanin there are other activities  reasonable righteous  by which one can refresh  nourish ones body and at the same time both not do evil and practice the practice of meritThen Dhanañjanin the brahman delighting  rejoicing in VenSariputtas words got up from his seat and leftThen on a later occasion Dhanañjanin the brahman became diseased in pain severely illSo he said to one of his men Come my good manGo to the Blessed One and on arrival pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say Lord Dhanañjanin the brahman is diseased in pain severely illHe pays homage with his head to the Blessed Ones feet Then go to VenSariputta and on arrival pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say Venerable sir Dhanañjanin the brahman is diseased in pain severely illHe pays homage with his head to VenSariputtas feet Then say It would be good if VenSariputta would visit Dhanañjanins home out of sympathy for him Responding As you say lord to Dhanañjanin the brahman the man went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said Lord Dhanañjanin the brahman is diseased in pain severely illHe pays homage with his head to the Blessed Ones feet Then he went to VenSariputta and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said Venerable sir Dhanañjanin the brahman is diseased in pain severely illHe pays homage with his head to VenSariputtas feet Then he said It would be good if VenSariputta would visit Dhanañjanins home out of sympathy for him VenSariputta acquiesced through silenceThen VenSariputta having put on his robes and taking his bowl  outer robe went to Dhanañjanins homeOn arrival he sat down on a prepared seat and said to him I trust you are getting better DhanañjaninI trust you are comfortableI trust that your pains are lessening and not increasingI trust that there are signs of their lessening and not of their increasingI am not getting better Master SariputtaI am not comfortableMy severe pains are increasing not lesseningThere are signs of their increasing and not of their lesseningExtreme forces slice through my head just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword Extreme pains have arisen in my head just as if a strong man were tightening a turban on my head with a tough leather strap Extreme forces carve up my stomach cavity just as if an expert butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox with a sharp butchers knife There is an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men seizing a weaker man with their arms were to roast and broil him over a pit of hot embersI am not getting better venerable sirI am not comfortableMy severe pains are increasing not lesseningThere are signs of their increasing and not of their lesseningWhat do you think DhanañjaninWhich is better hell or the animal wombThe animal womb is better than hell Master Sariputta Which is better the animal womb or the realm of the hungry shades the realm of the hungry shades  the realm of the hungry shades or human beings human beings human beings or the Four Great King devasthe Four Great King devas the Four Great King devas or the devas of the Thirtythreethe devas of the Thirtythree the devas of the Thirtythree or the Yama devasthe Yama devas the Yama devas or the Tusita devasthe Tusita devas the Tusita devas or the Nimmanarati devasthe Nimmanarati devas the Nimmanarati devas or the Paranimmitavasavatti devasthe Paranimmitavasavatti devas the Paranimmitavasavatti devas or the Brahma worldDid Master Sariputta say Brahma worldDid Master Sariputta say Brahma worldThen the thought occurred to VenSariputta These brahmans are set on the Brahma worldWhat if I were to teach Dhanañjanin the brahman the path to union with the BrahmasDhanañjanin I will teach you the path to union with the BrahmasListen and pay careful attention to thatI will speakAs you say master Dhanañjanin the brahman responded to VenSariputtaVenSariputta said And what is the path to union with the BrahmasThere is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourthThus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill willHe keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion appreciation equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourthThus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill willThis Dhanañjanin is the path to union with the BrahmasIn that case Master Sariputta pay homage to the Blessed Ones feet with your head in my name and say Lord Dhanañjanin the brahman is diseased in pain severely illHe pays homage with his head to the Blessed Ones feet So VenSariputta  when there was still more to be done having established Dhanañjanin the brahman in the inferior Brahma world  got up from his seat and leftThen not long after VenSariputtas departure Dhanañjanin the brahman died and reappeared in the Brahma worldAnd the Blessed One said to the monks Monks Sariputta  when there was still more to be done having established Dhanañjanin the brahman in the inferior Brahma world  has gotten up from his seat and leftThen VenSariputta went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord Dhanañjanin the brahman is diseased in pain severely illHe pays homage with his head to the Blessed Ones feetBut why Sariputta  when there was still more to be done having established Dhanañjanin the brahman in the inferior Brahma world  did you get up from your seat and leaveThe thought occurred to me lord These brahmans are set on the Brahma worldsWhat if I were to teach Dhanañjanin the brahman the path to union with the Brahmas Sariputta Dhanañjanin the brahman has died and reappeared in the Brahma worldSee also MN SN SN SN AN ANI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monsteryAnd on that occasion five hundred brahmans from various provinces were staying at Savatthi on some business or otherThe thought occurred to them This Gotama the contemplative prescribes purity for the four castesNow who is capable of disputing with him on this statement And on that occasion the brahman student Assalayana was staying at SavatthiYoung shavenheaded sixteen years old he was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology etymology  histories as a fifth skilled in philology  grammar he was fully versed in cosmology and in the marks of a Great ManThe thought occurred to the brahmans This brahman student Assalayana is staying in Savatthi He is capable of disputing with Gotama the contemplative on this statementSo the brahmans went to the brahman student Assalayana and said to him Master Assalayana this Gotama the contemplative prescribes purity for the four castesCome and dispute with him on this statementWhen this was said the brahman student Assalayana said to the brahmans Sirs Gotama the contemplative is one who speaks DhammaAnd those who speak Dhamma are hard to dispute withI cant dispute with him on this statementA second time A third time the brahmans said to the brahman student Assalayana Master Assalayana this Gotama the contemplative prescribes purity for the four castesCome and dispute with him on this statement for you have lived the life of a wandererDont be defeated without being defeated in battleWhen this was said the brahman student Assalayana said to the brahmans Apparently sirs I dont get leave from you Gotama the contemplative is one who speaks DhammaAnd those who speak Dhamma are hard to dispute withI cant dispute with him on this statement But at your bidding I will goThen the brahman student Assalayana went with a large group of brahmans to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama the brahmans say Brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferiorOnly brahmans are the fair caste any other caste is darkOnly brahmans are pure not nonbrahmansOnly brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma What does Master Gotama have to say with regard to thatBut Assalayana the brahmans brahmanwomen are plainly seen having their periods becoming pregnant giving birth and nursingAnd yet the brahmans being born through the birth canal say Brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferiorOnly brahmans are the fair caste any other caste is darkOnly brahmans are pure not nonbrahmansOnly brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma Even though Master Gotama says that still the brahmans think Brahmans are the superior caste the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma What do you think AssalayanaHave you heard that in Yana  Kamboja and other outlying countries there are only two castes  masters  slaves  and that having been a master one become a slave and that having been a slave one become a masterYes Master Gotama So what strength is there Assalayana what assurance when the brahmans say Brahmans are the superior caste the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of BrahmaEven though Master Gotama says that still the brahmans think Brahmans are the superior caste the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma What do you think AssalayanaIs it only a noble warrior who  taking life stealing engaging in sexual misconduct telling lies speaking divisively speaking harshly engaging in idle chatter greedy bearing thoughts of ill will and holding wrong views  on the breakup of the body after death reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell and not a brahmanIs it only a merchantIs it only a worker who  taking life stealing engaging in sexual misconduct telling lies speaking divisively speaking harshly engaging in idle chatter greedy bearing thoughts of ill will and holding wrong views  on the breakup of the body after death reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell and not a brahmanNo Master GotamaEven a noble warrior Even a brahman Even a merchant Even a worker all four castes  if they take life steal engage in sexual misconduct tell lies speak divisively speak harshly engage in idle chatter are greedy bear thoughts of ill will  hold wrong views  on the breakup of the body after death

of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma What do you think AssalayanaIs it only a brahman who  refraining from taking life from stealing from sexual misconduct from telling lies from speaking divisive speech from harsh speech  from idle chatter not greedy bearing no thoughts of illwill  holding to right view  on the breakup of the body after death reappears in the good destination the heavenly world and not a noble warrior not a merchant not a workerNo Master GotamaEven a noble warrior Even a brahman Even a merchant Even a worker all four castes  if they

are the superior caste the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of BrahmaEven though Master Gotama says that still the brahmans think Brahmans are the superior caste the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma What do you think AssalayanaIs it only a brahman who is capable of taking a loofah  bath powder going to a river and scrubbing off dust  dirt and not a noble warrior not a merchant not a workerNo Master GotamaEven a noble warrior Even a brahman Even a merchant Even a worker all four castes are capable of taking a loofah  bath powder going to a river and scrubbing off dust  dirtSo what strength is there Assalayana what assurance when the brahmans say Brahmans are the superior caste Only brahmans are pure not nonbrahmansOnly brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of BrahmaEven though Master Gotama says that still the brahmans think Brahmans are the superior caste Only brahmans are pure not nonbrahmansOnly brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma What do you think AssalayanaThere is the case where a consecrated noble warrior king might call together one hundred men of different births Come mastersThose of you there born from a noble warrior clan from a brahman clan or from a royal clan taking an upper firestick of saala wood salala wood sandalwood or padumaka wood produce fire  make heat appearAnd come mastersThose of you there born from an outcast clan a trapper clan a wicker workers clan a cartwrights clan or a scavengers clan taking an upper firestick from a dogs drinking trough from a pigs trough from a dustbin or of castoroil wood produce fire  make heat appear What do you think AssalayanaWould the fire made by those born from a noble warrior clan a brahman clan or a royal clan  who had produced fire  made heat appear by taking an upper firestick of saala wood salala wood sandalwood or padumaka wood  be the only one with flame color  radiance able to do whatever a fire might be needed to doAnd would the fire made by those born those born from an outcast clan a trapper clan a wicker workers clan a cartwrights clan or a scavengers clan  who had produced fire  made heat appear by taking an upper firestick from a dogs drinking trough from a pigs trough from a dustbin or of castoroil wood  be without flame color  radiance unable to do what a fire might be needed to doNo Master GotamaThe fire made by those born from a noble warrior clan a brahman clan or a royal clan would have flame color  radiance able to do whatever a fire might be needed to doAnd the fire made by those born from an outcast clan a trapper clan a wicker workers clan a cartwrights clan or a scavengers clan would have flame color  radiance able to do whatever a fire might be needed to doFor all fire has flame color  radiance and is able to do whatever a fire might be needed to doSo what strength is there Assalayana what assurance when the brahmans say Brahmans are the superior caste Only brahmans are pure not nonbrahmansOnly brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of BrahmaEven though Master Gotama says that still the brahmans think Brahmans are the superior caste Only brahmans are pure not nonbrahmansOnly brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma What do you think AssalayanaThere is the case where a noble warrior youth might cohabit with a brahman maiden and from their cohabitation a son would be bornWould the son born from the noble warrior youth and brahman maiden be like the father and like the motherShould it be called a noble warrior  a brahmanYes Master Gotama What do you think AssalayanaThere is the case where a brahman youth might cohabit with a noble warrior maiden and from their cohabitation a son would be bornWould the son born from the brahman youth and noble warrior maiden be like the father and like the motherShould it be called a noble warrior  a brahmanYes Master Gotama What do you think AssalayanaThere is the case where a mare might mate with a donkey and from their mating a foal would be bornWould the foal born from the mare  the donkey be like the father and like the motherShould it be called a horse  a donkeyMaster Gotama from the mixed breeding it would be a muleHere I see that it makes a difference but there I dont see that it makes a differenceWhat do you think AssalayanaThere is the case where there might be two brahmanstudent brothers born of the same mother one learned  initiated the other not learned  uninitiatedWhich of the two would the brahmans serve first at a funeral feast a milkrice offering a sacrifice or a feast for guestsThe brahman student who was learned  initiated Master Gotama For what great fruit would there be for what is given to one who is not learned  uninitiatedWhat do you think AssalayanaThere is the case where there might be two brahmanstudent brothers born of the same mother one learned  initiated unvirtuous  of evil character the other not learned  uninitiated virtuous  of fine characterWhich of the two would the brahmans serve first at a funeral feast a milkrice offering a sacrifice or a feast for guestsThe brahman student who was not learned  uninitiated virtuous  of fine character Master Gotama For what great fruit would there be for what is given to one who is unvirtuous  of evil characterFirst Assalayana you went by birthThen having gone by birth you went by mantrasThen having gone by mantras putting them both aside you have come around to the purity of the four castes that I prescribeWhen this was said the brahman student Assalayana sat silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for wordsThen the Blessed One  seeing that the brahman student Assalayana was sitting silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words  said to him Once Assalayana this evil viewpoint arose in the seven brahman seers as they were consulting together in leaf huts in the wilderness Brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferiorOnly brahmans are the fair caste any other caste is darkOnly brahmans are pure not nonbrahmansOnly brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma Then the seer Devala the Dark heard This evil viewpoint has arisen in the seven brahman seers as they are consulting together in leaf huts in the wilderness Brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferior Only brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma So arranging his hair  beard putting on crimson garments wearing multilayered sandals and carrying a staff made of gold he appeared in the courtyard of the seven brahman seersThen he walked back  forth in the courtyard of the seven brahman seers saying Well now where have these masters the brahman seers goneWell now where have these masters the brahman seers goneThen the seven brahman seers said to the seer Devala the Dark Now who is this walking back  forth in the courtyard of the seven brahman seers like a village lout saying Well now where have these masters the brahman seers goneWell now where have these masters the brahman seers gone Lets curse him So the seven brahman seers cursed the seer Devala the Dark Be ashes dribblespitBe ashes dribblespitBe ashes dribblespit But the more they cursed him the more beautiful goodlooking  inspiring he becameThen the thought occurred to the seven brahman seers Our asceticism is in vainOur holylife is fruitlessFor before whenever we cursed anyone Be ashes dribblespit he would always become ashesBut the more we curse this one the more beautiful goodlooking  inspiring he becomesMasters your asceticism is not in vain and your holylife not fruitlessPlease masters abandon your hatred toward meWe abandon our hatred toward you masterWho are youHave you heard of the seer Devala the DarkYes masterI am heThen the seven brahman seers approached him to bow down to him and he said to them I have heard that this evil viewpoint has arisen in the seven brahman seers as they are consulting together in leaf huts in the wilderness Brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferior Only brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of BrahmaThat is so masterBut do you know masters if the mother who bore you went only with a brahman and not with a nonbrahmanNo masterAnd do you know if the mothers of the mother who bore you  back seven generations of mothers  went only with brahmans and not with nonbrahmansNo masterAnd do you know if the father who sired you went only with a brahman woman and not with a nonbrahman womanNo masterAnd do you know if the fathers of the father who bore you  back seven generations of fathers  went only with brahman women and not with nonbrahman womenNo masterDo you know how there is the descent of an embryoYes master we know how there is the descent of an embryoThere is the case where the mother  father have come together the mother is fertile and a gandhabba is standing presentThe coming together of these three is the descent of the embryoBut do you know for sure whether the gandhabba is a noble warrior a brahman a merchant or a workerNo masterThat being the case do you know who you areThat being the case master we dont know who we areNow Assalayana when those seven brahman seers couldnt defend their own birthstatement when interrogated pressed  rebuked by the seer Devala the Dark how can you now defend your own birthstatement when interrogated pressed  rebuked by me  you their lineage holder but not Punna their ladle holderWhen this was said the brahman student Assalayana said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryNow on that occasion Uggahamana a follower of Mundika the contemplative together with a large following of about wanderers had taken up residence in the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen MallikaThen Pañcakanga the carpenter left Savatthi in the middle of the day to see the Blessed One but the thought occurred to him Now is not the right time to see the Blessed One for he is in seclusionAnd it is not the right time to see the minddeveloping monks for they too are in seclusionWhy dont I go to the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen Mallika to see Uggahamana a follower of Mundika the contemplative So he headed to the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen MallikaNow on that occasion Uggahamana was sitting with his large following of wanderers all making a great noise  racket discussing many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state armies alarms  battles food  drink clothing furniture garlands  scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women  heroes the gossip of the street  the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world  of the sea talk of whether things exist or notThen Uggahamana saw Pañcakanga the carpenter coming from afar and on seeing him hushed his following Be quiet good sirsDont make any noiseHere comes Pañcakanga the carpenter a disciple of Gotama the contemplativeHe is one of those disciples of Gotama the contemplative clad in white who lives in SavatthiThese people are fond of quietude trained in quietude and speak in praise of quietudeMaybe if he perceives our group as quiet he will consider it worth his while to come our way So the wanderers fell silentThen Pañcakanga went to Uggahamana and on arrival greeted him courteouslyAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat down to one sideAs he was sitting there Uggahamana said to him I describe an individual endowed with four qualities as being consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainmentsWhich fourThere is the case where he does no evil action with his body speaks no evil speech resolves on no evil resolve and maintains himself with no evil means of livelihoodAn individual endowed with these four qualities I describe as being consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainmentsThen Pañcakanga neither delighted in Uggahamanas words nor did he scorn themExpressing neither delight nor scorn he got up from his seat  left thinking I will learn the meaning of this statement in the Blessed Ones presenceThen he went to the Blessed One and on arrival after bowing down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he told the Blessed One the entire conversation he had had with UggahamanaWhen this was said the Blessed One said to Pañcakanga In that case carpenter then according to Uggahamanas words a stupid baby boy lying on its back is consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainmentsFor even the thought body does not occur to a stupid baby boy lying on its back so from where would it do any evil action with its body aside from a little kickingEven the thought speech does not occur to it so from where would it speak any evil speech aside from a little cryingEven the thought resolve does not occur to it so from where would it resolve on any evil resolve aside from a little bad temperEven the thought livelihood does not occur to it so from where would it maintain itself with any evil means of livelihood aside from its mothers milkSo according to Uggahamanas words a stupid baby boy lying on its back is consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainmentsIf an individual is endowed with these four qualities I do not describe him as consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainmentsRather he stands on the same level as a stupid baby boy lying on its backWhich fourThere is the case where he does no evil action with his body speaks no evil speech resolves on no evil resolve and maintains himself with no evil means of livelihoodIf an individual is endowed with these four qualities I do not describe him as consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainmentsRather he stands on the same level as a stupid baby boy lying on its backAn individual endowed with ten qualities is one whom I describe as being consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative

describe as being consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainmentsThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified Pañcakanga the carpenter delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThe frame story of this sutta presents a gentle satire of royal lifeDespite his position King Pasenadi Kosala must still act the role of messenger for his wivesBecause of his position he finds himself surrounded by people he cannot trust  he never gets to the bottom of the question of who brought misinformation into the palace  and whose minds fasten on issues of overthrowing and banishing possibly himHe is so preoccupied with his responsibilities that he doesnt pick up on the Buddhas gentle joke about his servitude to the sisters Soma and Sakula cant stick with an issue for any length of time sometimes cant even phrase his questions properly and can arrive at no greater certainty about the Buddhas teachings than that they seem reasonableAt the end of the sutta he has to leave not because he has exhausted the issues he would like to discuss but because one of his courtiers tells him it is time to goAll in all not an enviable positionThe substance of the discussion however does touch on some serious issuesThe topic treated in greatest detail concerns the differences among the castes of the Buddhas time and the Buddhas remarks can profitably be applied to issues of racism in oursThe discussion and the frame story of course play off one anotherBecause of his social position King Pasenadi is unable to pursue the path to release that is open to all regardless of race or casteHis social advantages are a spiritual liabilityLike many people in the modern world he has plenty of things but no timeI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Udaññans in the Deer Park at KannakatthalaAnd at that time King Pasenadi Kosala had arrived at Udañña on some business or otherSo King Pasenadi Kosala said to one of his men Come my good manGo to the Blessed One and on arrival showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort saying King Pasenadi Kosala lord shows reverence with his head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort And then say Lord today King Pasenadi Kosala will come to see the Blessed One after his morning meal Having responded As you say sire the man went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to him King Pasenadi Kosala lord shows reverence with his head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort And then he said Lord today King Pasenadi Kosala will come to see the Blessed One after his morning mealNow the sisters Soma and Sakula heard Today they say King Pasenadi Kosala will go to see the Blessed One after his morning meal So they approached King Pasenadi while his meal was being served and on arrival said to him Well in that case great king show reverence with your head to his feet in our name too and ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort saying The sisters Soma and Sakula lord show reverence with their heads to your feet and ask whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort Then after his morning meal King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One The sisters Soma and Sakula lord show reverence with their heads to your feet and ask whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfortBut great king couldnt the sisters Soma and Sakula get another messengerLord the sisters Soma and Sakula heard Today they say King Pasenadi Kosala will go to see the Blessed One after his morning meal So they approached me while my meal was being served and on arrival said to me In that case great king show reverence with your head to his feet in our name too and ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort saying The sisters Soma and Sakula lord show reverence with their heads to your feet and ask whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort Lord the sisters Soma and Sakula show reverence with their heads to your feet and ask whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfortMay the sisters Soma and Sakula be happy great kingThen King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Lord I have heard that Gotama the contemplative says this It is not possible that a brahman or contemplative would claim a knowledge and vision that is allknowing and allseeing without exception Those who say this are they speaking in line with what the Blessed One has saidAre they not misrepresenting the Blessed One with what is unfactualAre they answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma would have grounds for criticizing themGreat king those who say that are not speaking in line with what I have said and are misrepresenting me with what is untrue and unfactualThen King Pasenadi Kosala turned to General Vidudabha General who brought this topic into the palaceSañjaya the brahman of the Akasa clan great kingSo King Pasenadi turned to one of his men Come my good manSummon Sañjaya the brahman of the Akasa clan saying King Pasenadi Kosala summons you Responding As you say sire the man went to Sañjaya the brahman of the Akasa clan and on arrival said to him King Pasenadi Kosala summons youThen King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Could it be that something was said by the Blessed One in reference to something else which a person could have misunderstoodIn what way does the Blessed One recall having said a statementGreat king I recall having said It is not possible that a brahman or contemplative could know everything and see everything all at once What the Blessed One says lord seems reasonableWhat the Blessed One says seems logical It is not possible that a brahman or contemplative could know everything and see everything all at onceLord there are these four castes noble warriors brahmans merchants  workersIs there any distinction or difference among themGreat king of these four castes two  noble warriors  brahmans  are held to be foremost in terms of receiving homage hospitality salutation  polite servicesIm not asking about the present life lordIm asking about the future lifeIs there any distinction or difference among these four castesGreat king there are these five factors for exertionWhich fiveThere is the case where a monk has conviction is convinced of the Tathagatas Awakening Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessedHe is free from illness  discomfort endowed with good digestion  not too cold not too hot of moderate strength  fit for exertionHe is neither fraudulent nor deceitfulHe declares himself to the Teacher or to his wise friends in the holy life in line with what he actually isHe keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualitiesHe is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualitiesHe is discerning endowed with discernment leading to the arising of the goal  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressThese are the five factors for exertionAs for the four castes great king If they were endowed with these five factors for exertion that would be for their longterm welfare  happinessLord if these four castes were endowed with these five factors for exertion would there be any distinction or difference among them in that respectI tell you great king the difference among them would lie in the diversity of their exertionSuppose that there were two tamable elephants tamable horses or tamable oxen that were welltamed  welltrained and two tamable elephants tamable horses or tamable oxen that were untamed  untrainedWhat do you think would the two tamable elephants tamable horses or tamable oxen that were welltamed  welltrained acquire the habits of the tamed and reach the status of the tamedYes lordAnd would the two tamable elephants tamable horses or tamable oxen that were untamed  untrained acquire the habits of the tamed and reach the status of the tamedNo lordIn the same way great king it is impossible that what could be attained by one who has confidence who is free from illness who is neither fraudulent nor deceitful whose persistence is aroused and who is discerning could also be attained by one who is without conviction who is sickly fraudulent  deceitful lazy and dullWhat the Blessed One says lord seems reasonableWhat the Blessed One says seems logicalBut with regard to these four castes if they were endowed with these five factors for exertion and they had right exertion would there be any distinction or difference among them in that respectI tell you great king that there would be no difference among them with regard to the release of one and the release of anotherSuppose that a man taking dry sala wood were to generate a fire and make heat appearAnd suppose that another man taking dry saka wood were to generate a fire and make heat appearAnd suppose that another man taking dry mango wood were to generate a fire and make heat appearAnd suppose that another man taking dry fig wood were to generate a fire and make heat appearNow what do you think great king among those fires generated from different kinds of wood would there be any difference between the glow of one and the glow of another the color of one and the color of another the radiance of one and the radiance of anotherNo lordIn the same way great king in the power that is kindled by persistence and generated by exertion I say that there is no difference with regard to the release of one and the release of anotherWhat the Blessed One says lord seems reasonableWhat the Blessed One says seems logicalBut lord are there devasBut why do you ask But lord are there devasWhether the devas come back to this life lord or whether they dontThose devas who are afflicted come back to this life whereas those devas who are unafflicted dont come back to this lifeWhen this was said General Vidudabha said to the Blessed One Lord can the afflicted devas oust or expel the unafflicted devas from that placeThen the thought occurred to VenAnanda This General Vidudabha is the son of King Pasenadi Kosala and I am the son of the Blessed OneNow is the time for the son to counsel the son So VenAnanda turned to General Vidudabha and said In that case general I will ask you a counter questionAnswer as you see fitThrough the extent of land conquered by King Pasenadi Kosala  where he exercises sovereign  independent kingship  is he able to oust or expel a brahman or contemplative from that place regardless of whether that person has merit or not or follows the holy life or notSir through the extent of land conquered by King Pasenadi Kosala  where he exercises sovereign  independent kingship  he is able to oust or expel a brahman or contemplative from that place regardless of whether that person has merit or not or follows the holy life or notAnd what do you think general Through the extent of land not conquered by King Pasenadi Kosala  where he does not exercise sovereign  independent kingship  is he able to oust or expel a brahman or contemplative from that place regardless of whether that person has merit or not or follows the holy life or notSir through the extent of land not conquered by King Pasenadi Kosala  where he does not exercise sovereign  independent kingship  he is not able to oust or expel a brahman or contemplative from that place regardless of whether that person has merit or not or follows the holy life or notAnd what do you think general Have you heard of the Devas of the ThirtythreeYes sir I have heard of the Devas of the Thirtythree as has King Pasenadi KosalaAnd what do you think general Could King Pasenadi Kosala oust or expel the Devas of the Thirtythree from that placeSir King Pasenadi Kosala cant even see the Devas of the ThirtythreeHow could he oust or expel them from that placeIn the same way general afflicted devas who will come back to this life cant even see the unafflicted devas who dont come back to this lifeHow could they oust or expel them from that placeThen King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Lord what is the name of this monkHis name is Ananda great kingWhat a joy he isWhat a true joyBut lord are there brahmasBut why do you ask But lord are there brahmasWhether the brahmas come back to this life lord or whether they dontThose brahmas who are afflicted come back to this life whereas those brahmas who are unafflicted dont come back to this lifeThen a man said to King Pasenadi Kosala Great king Sañjaya the brahman of the Akasa clan has comeThen King Pasenadi Kosala said to Sañjaya the brahman of the Akasa clan Who brought that topic into the royal palaceGeneral Vidudabha great kingGeneral Vidudabha said Sañjaya the brahman of the Akasa clan great kingThen a man said to King Pasenadi Kosala Time to go great kingSo King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Lord we have asked the Blessed One about omniscience the Blessed One has answered about omniscience and that is pleasing  agreeable to us and we are gratified because of itWe have asked the Blessed One about the purity of the four castes the Blessed One has answered about the purity of the four castes and that is pleasing  agreeable to us and we are gratified because of itWe have asked the Blessed One about the higher devas the Blessed One has answered about the higher devas and that is pleasing  agreeable to us and we are gratified because of itWe have asked the Blessed One about the higher brahmas the Blessed One has answered about the higher brahmas and that is pleasing  agreeable to us and we are gratified because of itWhatever we have asked the Blessed One about that he has answered and that is pleasing  agreeable to us and we are gratified because of itNow lord we must goMany are our duties many our responsibilitiesThen do great king what you think it is now time to doThen King Pasenadi Kosala delighting in and approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and  keeping him to his right  departedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryNow at that time a certain householders dear  beloved little son his only child had diedBecause of his death the father had no desire to work or to eatHe kept going to the cemetery and crying out Where have you gone my only little childWhere have you gone my only little childThen he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Householder your faculties are not those of one who is steady in his own mindThere is an aberration in your facultiesLord how could there not be an aberration in my facultiesMy dear  beloved little son my only child has diedBecause of his death I have no desire to work or to eatI keep going to the cemetery and crying out Where have you gone my only little childWhere have you gone my only

got up from his seat and went to Queen MallikaOn arrival he told her all that had been said in his conversation with the Blessed OneThen Queen Mallika went to King Pasenadi Kosala and on arrival said to him What do you think great king Is Princess Vajiri dear to youYes Mallika Princess Vajiri is dear to meAnd what do you think would sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise in you from any change  aberration in Princess VajiriMallika any change  aberration in Princess Vajiri would mean an aberration of my very lifeHow could sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair not arise in meGreat

are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear Its amazing MallikaIts astounding how deeply the Blessed One sees having pierced through as it were with discernmentCome Mallika Give me the ablution water Then King Pasenadi Kosala rising from his seat and arranging his upper robe over one shoulder paid homage in the direction of the Blessed One with his hands palmtopalm in front of his heart and exclaimed three timesI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryAnd at that time in King Pasenadis realm there was a bandit named Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beingsHe turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countrysideHaving repeatedly killed human beings he wore a garland made of fingersThen the Blessed One early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Savatthi for almsHaving wandered for alms in Savatthi and returning from his alms round after his meal he set his lodging in orderCarrying his robes  bowl he went along the road to where Angulimala was stayingCowherds shepherds  farmers saw him going along the road to where Angulimala was staying and on seeing him said to him Dont go along that road contemplative for on that road is Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beingsHe has turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countrysideHaving repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingersGroups of ten twenty thirty  forty men have gone along that road and even they have fallen into Angulimalas hands When this was said the Blessed One kept going in silenceA second time A third time cowherds shepherds  farmers said to the Blessed One Dont go along that road contemplative Groups of ten twenty thirty  forty men have gone along that road and even they have fallen into Angulimalas hands When this was said the Blessed One kept going in silenceThen Angulimala saw the Blessed One coming from afar and on seeing him this thought occurred to him Isnt it amazingIsnt it astoundingGroups of ten twenty thirty  forty men have gone along this road and even they have fallen into my hands and yet now this contemplative comes attacking as it were alone and without a companionWhy dont I kill him So Angulimala taking up his sword  shield buckling on his bow  quiver followed right behind the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One willed a feat of psychic power such that Angulimala though running with all his might could not catch up with the Blessed One walking at normal paceThen the thought occurred to Angulimala Isnt it amazingIsnt it astoundingIn the past Ive chased  seized even a swiftrunning elephant a swiftrunning horse a swiftrunning chariot a swiftrunning deerBut now even though Im running with all my might I cant catch up with this contemplative walking at normal pace So he stopped and called out to the Blessed One Stop contemplativeStopI have stopped AngulimalaYou stopThen the thought occurred to Angulimala These Sakyan contemplatives are speakers of the truth asserters of the truths and yet this contemplative even while walking says I have stopped AngulimalaYou stop Why dont I question himSo Angulimala the bandit addressed this verse to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One set out wandering toward Savatthi with VenAngulimala as his attendant monkAfter wandering by stages he reached Savatthi and there he lived near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryNow at that time a large crowd of people loud  noisy had gathered at the gates to King Pasenadi Kosalas inner palace There is a bandit in your realm sire named Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beingsHe has turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countrysideHaving repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingersThe king must stamp him outThen King Pasenadi Kosala with a cavalry of roughly horsemen drove out of Savatthi and entered the monasteryDriving as far as the ground was passable for chariots he got down from his chariot and went on foot to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him What is it great kingHas King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha provoked you or have the Licchavis of Vesali or some other hostile kingNo lordKing Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha hasnt provoked me nor have the Licchavis of Vesali nor has some other hostile kingThere is a bandit in my realm lord named Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beingsHe has turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countrysideHaving repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingersI am going to stamp him out Great king suppose you were to see Angulimala with his hair  beard shaved off wearing the ochre robe having gone forth from the home life into homelessness refraining from killing living beings refraining from taking what is not given refraining from telling lies living the holy life on one meal a day virtuous  of fine character what would you do to himWe would bow down to him lord or rise up to greet him or offer him a seat or offer him robes almsfood lodgings or medicinal requisites for curing illness or we would arrange a lawful guard protection  defenseBut how could there be such virtue  restraint in an unvirtuous evil characterNow at that time VenAngulimala was sitting not far from the Blessed OneSo the Blessed One pointing with his right arm said to King Pasenadi Kosala That great king is Angulimala Then King Pasenadi Kosala was frightened terrified his hair standing on endSo the Blessed One sensing the kings fear  hairraising awe said to him Dont be afraid great kingDont be afraidHe poses no danger to youThen the kings fear his terror his hairstandingonend subsidedHe went over to VenAngulimala and said Are you really Angulimala lordYes great kingWhat is your fathers clanWhat is your mothers clanMy father is a Gagga great king and my mother a MantaniThen may Master Gagga Mantaniputta delightI will be responsible for your robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for curing illnessNow it so happened that at that time VenAngulimala was a wildernessdweller an almsgoer wearing one set of the triple robe made of castoff clothSo he said to King Pasenadi Kosala Enough great kingMy triple robe is completeSo King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Its amazing lordIts astounding how the Blessed One has tamed the untamed pacified the unpeaceful and brought to Unbinding those who were not unboundFor what we could not tame even with blunt or bladed weapons the Blessed One has tamed without blunt or bladed weaponsNow lord we must goMany are our duties many our responsibilitiesThen do great king what you think it is now time to doThen King Pasenadi Kosala got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and  keeping him to his right  departedThen VenAngulimala early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Savatthi for almsAs he was going from house to house for alms he saw a woman suffering a breech birthOn seeing her the thought occurred to him How tormented are living beingsHow tormented are living beings Then having wandered for alms in Savatthi and returning from his alms round after his meal he went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord early in the morning having put on my robes and carrying my outer robe  bowl I went into Savatthi for almsAs I was going from house to house for alms I saw a woman suffering a breech birthOn seeing her the thought occurred to me How tormented are living beingsHow tormented are living beings In that case Angulimala go to that woman and on arrival say to her Sister since I was born I do not recall intentionally killing a living beingThrough this truth may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetus But lord wouldnt that be a lie for meFor I have intentionally killed many living beingsThen in that case Angulimala go to that woman and on arrival say to her Sister since I was born in the noble birth I do not recall intentionally killing a living beingThrough this truth may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetus Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Angulimala went to that woman and on arrival said to her Sister since I was born in the noble birth I do not recall intentionally killing a living beingThrough this may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetus And there was wellbeing for the woman wellbeing for her fetusThen VenAngulimala dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenAngulimala became another one of the arahantsThen VenAngulimala early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Savatthi for almsNow at that time a clod thrown by one person hit VenAngulimala on the body a stone thrown by another person hit him on the body and a potsherd thrown by still another person hit him on the bodySo VenAngulimala  his head broken open and dripping with blood his bowl broken and his outer robe ripped to shreds  went to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said to him Bear with it brahmanBear with itThe fruit of the kamma that would have burned you in hell for many years many hundreds of years many thousands of years you are now experiencing in the herenow Then VenAngulimala having gone alone into seclusion experienced the bliss of releaseAt that time he exclaimedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One on a wandering tour among the Kurus with a large community of monks arrived at Thullakotthita a town of the KurusThe brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita heard it said Gotama the contemplative  the son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clan  has arrived at ThullakotthitaAnd of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread He is indeed a Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessedHe has made known  having realized it through direct knowledge  this world with its devas maras  brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their rulers  common peopleHe has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pureIts good to see such a worthy one So the brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita went to the Blessed OneOn arrival some of them bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one sideSome of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one sideSome of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palmtopalm over their heartsSome of them sat to one side having announced their name  clanSome of them sat to one side in silenceAs they were sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused and encouraged them with a talk on DhammaNow at that time a clansman named Ratthapala the son of the leading clan in that same Thullakotthita was sitting in that assemblyThe thought occurred to him As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shellWhat if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessnessThen the brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed Ones talk on Dhamma delighted  rejoiced in his wordsRising from their seats bowing down to him they left keeping him on their rightThen Ratthapala not long after the brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita had left approached the Blessed One and on arrival said to him As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shellLord I want  having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe  to go forth from the household life into homelessnessMay I receive the goingforth in the Blessed Ones presenceMay I receive admissionDo you have your parents permission Ratthapala to go forth from the household life into homelessnessNo lord I haventRatthapala Tathagatas do not give the goingforth to anyone who doesnt have his parents permissionLord I will do what needs to be done so that my parents will give their permission for me to go forth from the household life into homelessnessThen Ratthapala rising from his seat bowing down to the Blessed One and keeping him on his right went to his parents and said Mom Dad as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shellI want  having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe  to go forth from the household life into homelessnessPlease give me your permission to go forth from the household life into homelessnessWhen this was said Ratthapalas parents said to him Ratthapala dear you are our only

while youre alive  give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessnessA second time A third time Ratthapala said to his parents Mom Dad as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One its not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shellI want  having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe  to go forth from the household life into homelessnessPlease give me your permission to go forth from the household life into homelessnessA third time Ratthapalas parents said to him Ratthapala dear you are

how could we  while youre alive  give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessnessThen Ratthapala not getting his parents permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness lay down right there on the bare floor Here will be my death or my goingforth And he went without food for one day two days three days four five six daysHe went without food for seven daysHis parents said to him Ratthapala dear you are our only son dear  appealing raised in comfort brought up in comfortYou know nothing of sufferingGet up dearEat drink  enjoy yourselfWhile

household life into homelessness where else will he goHell return right hereSo please give him permission to go forth from the household life into homelessnessThen dears we give our permission for Ratthapala to go forth from the household life into homelessnessBut when he has gone forth he must visit his parentsThen Ratthapalas friends went to him and said Get up RatthapalaYour parents give their permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessnessBut when you have gone forth you must visit your parentsThen Ratthapala got up and on regaining strength went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I have received my parents permission lord to go forth from the household life into homelessnessMay the Blessed One give me the goingforthThen Ratthapala the clansman obtained the goingforth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained admissionAnd not long after his admission one half month after his admission the Blessed Onehaving stayed at Thullakotthita as long as he liked  set out wandering to SavatthiWandering by stages he eventually arrived at SavatthiThere he lived at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryAs for VenRatthapala  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenRatthapala became another one of the arahantsThen VenRatthapala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I want to visit my parents if you give me permission Then the Blessed One encompassing VenRatthapalas awareness with his awareness considered  understood VenRatthapala is incapable of leaving the training and reverting to the lower life So he said to him Now is the time Ratthapala for you to do as you see fitThen VenRatthapala rising from his seat bowing down to the Blessed One and keeping him on his rightPutting his lodgings in order and carrying his bowl  robes set out wandering toward ThullakotthitaWandering by stages he eventually arrived at ThullakotthitaThere he stayed in Thullakotthita in King Koravyas MigaciraThen early in the morning  putting on his under robe and carrying his bowl  robes  he went into Thullakotthita for almsAs he went for alms from house to house in Thullakotthita he came to his own fathers houseNow at that time VenRatthapalas father was in the middle doorporch having his hair combedHe saw VenRatthapala coming from afar and on seeing him said It was by these shavenheaded contemplatives that our only son dear  appealing was made to go forth So VenRatthapala  instead of receiving a gift or a polite refusal at his own fathers house  got nothing but abuseJust then a slavewoman belonging to one of his relatives was about to throw away some dayold porridgeSo VenRatthapala said to her Sister if that is to be thrown away pour it here into my bowl While she was pouring the dayold porridge into this bowl she recognized his hands feet  voiceSo she went to his mother and said May it please you to know my lady that masterson Ratthapala has arrivedHey if what you say is true I give you your freedomThen VenRatthapalas mother went to his father and said May it please you to know householder that they say the

instead of receiving a gift or a polite refusal  we got nothing but abuseCome dear RatthapalaLets go homeEnough householderMy meal for today is finishedIn that case dear Ratthapala acquiesce to the meal for tomorrowSo VenRatthapala acquiesced in silenceUnderstanding VenRatthapalas acquiesence his father went to his house and having the floor coated with fresh cow dung had a great heap of gold  silver made two great heaps made  one of gold one of silver  so large that a man standing on the near side could not see a man standing on the far side just as a man standing on the far side could not see a man standing on the nearHiding them behind screens he set out a seat between them surrounded by a curtainAddressing VenRatthapalas former wives he said to them Come daughtersinlawAdorn yourself in the ornaments that our son Ratthapala used to find dear  appealingThen as the night was ending VenRatthapalas father had exquisite staple  nonstaple foods prepared in his own house and had the time announced to VenRatthapala Its time dear RatthapalaThe meal is readyThen early in the morning  putting on his under robe and carrying his bowl  robes  VenRatthapala went to his fathers house and on

heap of gold  silver loaded on carts and hauled away to be dumped midstream in the river GangesWhy is thatThis will be the cause of your sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairThen clasping each of his feet VenRatthapalas former wives said to him What are they like dear masterson those nymphs for whose sake you lead the holy lifeSisters we dont lead the holy life for the sake of nymphsSisters he calls us And they fell down right there in a faintThen VenRatthapala said to his father Householder if theres food to be given then give itDont harass usEat then my dear RatthapalaThe meal is readySo with his own hands VenRatthapalas father served and satisfied him with exquisite staple and nonstaple foodsWhen he had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl VenRatthapala stood up and recited these versesAfter reciting these verses while standing VenRatthapala went to King Koravyas MigaciraOn arrival he sat down in the shade of a tree for the days abidingThen King Koravya said to

RatthapalaOne has to pass on leaving everything behindNow Master Ratthapala you say The world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving How is the meaning of this statement to be understoodWhat do you think great king Do you now rule over the prosperous country of KuruThat is so Master RatthapalaI rule over the prosperous country of KuruWhat do you think great king Suppose a trustworthy reliable man of yours were to come to you from the eastOn arrival he would say to you May it please your majesty to know I have come from the eastThere I saw a great country powerful  prosperous

astounding how well that has been said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened The world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving For the world really is insufficient Master RatthapalaIts insatiable a slave to cravingThat is what VenRatthapala saidHaving said that he further said thisApparently there were some discrepancies in the original discourse that subsequent editors tried to correct but its hard to reach a definitive conclusion as to which version is closer to the originalOn the one hand it might be that the two extra heaps were mentioned in the original but later deleted in some editions to bring the description in line with the fact that the later passage mentions heap in the singular on the other hand it might be that the original described the father making one heap and the editors later amended the passage to account for his later reference to three inheritancesI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha on Vultures Peak Mountain in the Boars CaveThen LongNails the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one sideAs he was standing there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama I am of the view of the opinion that All is not pleasing to me But even this view of yours Aggivessana  All is not pleasing to me  is even that not pleasing to you Even if this view of mine were pleasing to me Master Gotama it would still be the same it would still be the sameWell Aggivessana there are more than many in the world who say It would still be the same it would still be the same yet they both do not abandon that view and they cling to another viewThere are fewer than few in the world who say It would still be the same it would still be the same and they both abandon that view and do not cling to another viewThere are some brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that All is pleasing to me There are some brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that All is not pleasing to me There are some brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that A part is pleasing to me a part is not pleasing to meWith regard to those brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that All is pleasing to me That view of theirs is close to being impassioned close to bondage close to delighting close to holding close to clingingWith regard to those brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that All is not pleasing to me That view of theirs is close to not being impassioned close to nonbondage close to notdelighting close to notholding close to notclingingWhen this was said LongNails the wanderer said to the Blessed One Master Gotama commends my viewpointMaster Gotama recommends my viewpointWith regard to those brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that A part is pleasing to me a part is not pleasing to me Whatever is pleasing to them their view is close to being impassioned close to bondage close to delighting close to holding close to clingingWhatever is not pleasing to them their view is close to not being impassioned close to nonbondage close to notdelighting close to notholding close to notclingingWith regard to those brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion All is pleasing to me A wise person among them considers that If I were to grasp and insist firmly on this view of mine that All is pleasing to me and to state that Only this is true all else is worthless I would clash with two  the brahman or contemplative who is of the view of the opinion that All is not pleasing to me and the brahman or contemplative who is of the view of the opinion that A part is pleasing to me a part is not pleasing to me I would clash with these twoWhere there is a clash there is disputeWhere there is a dispute quarrelingWhere there is quarreling annoyanceWhere there is annoyance frustration Envisioning for himself clash dispute quarreling annoyance frustration he both abandons that view and does not cling to another viewThus there is the abandoning of these

endowed with form composed of the four primary elements born from mother  father nourished with rice  porridge subject to inconstancy rubbing pressing dissolution and dispersion  should be envisioned as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notselfIn one who envisions the body as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself any desire for the body attraction to the body following after the body is abandonedThere are these three kinds of feeling a pleasant feeling a painful feeling and neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingOn the occasion when one feels a pleasant feeling one does not feel either a painful feeling or a neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingOne feels only a pleasant feeling on that occasionOn the occasion when one feels a painful feeling one does not feel either a pleasant feeling or a neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingOne feels only a painful feeling on that occasionOn the occasion when one feels a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling one does not feel either a pleasant feeling or a painful feelingOne feels only a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling on that occasionA pleasant feeling is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen subject to ending subject to vanishing fading ceasingA painful feeling is also inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen subject to ending subject to vanishing fading ceasingA neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling is also inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen subject to ending subject to vanishing fading ceasingSeeing this an instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with pleasant feeling disenchanted with painful feeling disenchanted with neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingDisenchanted he grows dispassionateFrom dispassion he is releasedWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world A monk whose mind is thus released does not take sides with anyone does not dispute with anyoneHe words things by means of what is said in the world but without grasping at itNow at that time VenSariputta was sitting behind the Blessed One fanning himThe thought occurred to him Indeed it seems that the Blessed One speaks to us of the abandoning of each of these mental qualities through direct knowledgeIndeed it seems that the One Wellgone speaks to us of the relinquishing of each of these mental qualities through direct knowledge As VenSariputta was reflecting thus his mind was released from fermentations through notclingingWhile in LongNails the wanderer there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationThen LongNails the wanderer  having seen the Dhamma having attained the Dhamma having known the Dhamma having fathomed the Dhamma having crossed over and beyond uncertainty having no more perplexity having gained fearlessness having becoming independent of others with regard to the Teachers message  said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeMagandiya suppose that there was a leper covered with sores and infections devoured by worms picking the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterizing his body over a pit of glowing embersHis friends companions  relatives would take him to a doctorThe doctor would concoct medicine for him and thanks to the medicine he would be cured of his leprosy well  happy free master of himself going wherever he likedThen suppose two strong men having grabbed him with their arms were to drag him to a pit of glowing embersWhat do you thinkWouldnt he twist his body this way  thatYes master GotamaWhy is thatThe fire is painful to the touch very hot  scorchingNow what do you think MagandiyaIs the fire painful to the touch very hot  scorching only now or was it also that way beforeBoth now  before is it painful to the touch very hot  scorching master GotamaIts just that when the man was a leper covered with sores and infections devoured by worms picking the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails his faculties were impaired which was why even though the fire was actually painful to the touch he had the skewed perception of pleasant In the same way Magandiya sensual pleasures in the past were painful to the touch very hot  scorching sensual pleasures in the future will be painful to the touch very hot  scorching sensual pleasures at present are painful to the touch very hot  scorching but when beings are not free from passion for sensual pleasures  devoured by sensual craving burning with sensual fever  their faculties are impaired which is why even though sensual pleasures are actually painful to the touch they have the skewed perception of pleasantNow suppose that there was a leper covered with sores  infections devoured by worms picking the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterizing his body over a pit of glowing embersThe more he cauterized his body over the pit of glowing embers the more disgusting foulsmelling  putrid the openings of his wounds would become and yet he would feel a modicum of enjoyment  satisfaction because of the itchiness of his woundsIn the same way beings not free from passion for sensual pleasures  devoured by sensual craving burning with sensual fever  indulge in sensual pleasuresThe more they indulge in sensual pleasures the more their sensual craving increases and the more they burn with sensual fever and yet they feel a modicum of enjoyment  satisfaction dependent on the five strings of sensualityNow what do you think MagandiyaHave you ever seen or heard of a king or kings minister  enjoying himself provided  endowed with the five strings of sensuality without abandoning sensual craving without removing sensual fever  who has dwelt or will dwell or is dwelling free from thirst his mind inwardly at peaceNo master GotamaVery good MagandiyaNeither have I ever seen or heard of a king or kings minister  enjoying himself provided  endowed with the five strings of sensuality without abandoning sensual craving without removing sensual fever  who has dwelt or will dwell or is dwelling free from thirst his mind inwardly at peaceBut whatever brahmans or contemplatives who have dwelt or will dwell or are dwelling free from thirst their minds inwardly at peace all have done so having realized  as it actually is present  the origination  disappearance the allure the danger  the escape from sensual pleasures having abandoned sensual craving and removed sensual feverThen at that moment the Blessed One exclaimedWhen this was said Magandiya the wanderer said to the Blessed One Its amazing master GotamaIts astounding how this too is wellstated by master Gotama Freedom from disease the foremost good fortuneUnbinding the foremost ease We have also heard this said by earlier wanderers in the lineage of our teachers Freedom from disease the foremost good fortuneUnbinding the foremost ease This agrees with thatBut as for what you have heard said by earlier wanderers in the lineage of your teachers Magandiya  Freedom from disease the foremost good fortuneUnbinding the foremost ease  which freedom from disease is that which UnbindingWhen this was said Magandiya the wanderer rubbed his own limbs with his handThis is that freedom from disease master Gotama he saidThis is that UnbindingFor I am now free from disease happy and nothing afflicts meMagandiya its just as if there were a man blind from birth who couldnt see black objects white blue yellow red or pink objects who couldnt see even or uneven places the stars the sun or the moonHe would hear a man with good eyesight saying How wonderful good sirs is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean He would go in search of something whiteThen another man would fool him with a grimy oilstained rag Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean The blind man would take it and put it onHaving put it on gratified he would exclaim words of gratification How wonderful good sirs is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean Now what do you think MagandiyaWhen that man blind from birth took the grimy oilstained rag and put it on and having put it on gratified exclaimed words of gratification How wonderful good sirs is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean Did he do so knowing  seeing or out of faith in the man with good eyesightOf course he did it not knowing  not seeing master Gotama but out of faith in the man with good eyesightIn the same way Magandiya the wanderers of other sects are blind  eyelessWithout knowing freedom from disease without seeing Unbinding they still speak this verseThis verse was stated by earlier worthy ones fully selfawakenedBut now it has gradually become a verse of runofthemill peopleThis body Magandiya is a disease a cancer an arrow painful an afflictionAnd yet you say with reference to this body which is a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction This is that freedom from disease master GotamaThis is that Unbinding for you dont have the noble vision with which you would know freedom from disease and see UnbindingIm convinced master Gotama that you can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I would know freedom from disease that I would see UnbindingMagandiya its just as if there were a man blind from birth who couldnt see black objects white blue yellow red the sun or the moonHis friends companions  relatives would take him to a doctorThe doctor would concoct medicine for him but in spite of the medicine his eyesight would not appear or grow clearWhat do you think MagandiyaWould that doctor have nothing but his share of weariness  disappointmentYes master GotamaIn the same way Magandiya if I were to teach you the Dhamma  This is that freedom from disease this is that Unbinding  and you on your part did not know freedom from disease or see Unbinding that would be wearisome for me that would be troublesome for meIm convinced master Gotama that you can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I would know freedom from disease that I would see UnbindingMagandiya its just as if there were a man blind from birth who couldnt see black objects white blue yellow red the sun or the moonNow suppose that a certain man were to take a grimy oilstained rag and fool him saying Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean The blind man would take it and put it onThen his friends companions  relatives would take him to a doctorThe doctor would concoct medicine for him purges from above  purges from below ointments  counterointments and treatments through the noseAnd thanks to the medicine his eyesight would appear  grow clearThen together with the arising of his eyesight he would abandon whatever passion  delight he felt for that grimy oilstained ragAnd he would regard that man as an enemy  no friend at all and think that he deserved to be killedMy gosh how long have I been fooled cheated  deceived by that man  his grimy oilstained rag Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  cleanIn the same way Magandiya if I were to teach you the Dhamma  This is that freedom from Disease this is that Unbinding  and you on your part were to know that freedom from Disease and see that Unbinding then together with the arising of your eyesight you would abandon whatever passion  delight you felt with regard for the five clingingaggregatesAnd it would occur to you My gosh how long have I been fooled cheated  deceived by this mindFor in clinging it was just form that I was clinging to it was just feeling just perception just fabrications just consciousness that I was clinging toWith my clinging as a requisite condition there arises becoming birth aging  death sorrow lamentation pains distresses  despairsAnd thus is the origin of this entire mass of stress Im convinced master Gotama that you can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might rise up from this seat cured of my blindnessIn that case Magandiya associate with men of integrityWhen you associate with men of integrity you will hear the true DhammaWhen you hear the true Dhamma you will practice the Dhamma in accordance with the DhammaWhen you practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma you will know  see for yourself These things are diseases cancers arrowsAnd here is where diseases cancers  arrows cease without traceWith the cessation of my clinging comes the cessation of becomingWith the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birthWith the cessation of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all ceaseSuch is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering  stressWhen this was said Magandiya the wanderer said Magnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksLet me obtain the going forth in Master Gotamas presence let me obtain admissionAnyone Magandiya who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth  admission in this doctrine  discipline must first undergo probation for four monthsIf at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth  admit him to the monks stateBut I know distinctions among individuals in this matterMaster Gotama if anyone who has previously belonged to another sect and desires the going forth  admission in this doctrine  discipline must first undergo probation for four months and if at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth  admit him to the monks state then I am willing to undergo probation for four yearsIf at the end of four years the monks feel so moved let them give me the going forth  admit me to the monks stateThen Magandiya the wanderer received the going forth  the admission in the Blessed Ones presenceAnd not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenMagandiya became another one of the arahantsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he asked the Blessed One How is it Master Gotama does Master Gotama hold the view The cosmos is eternal only this is true anything otherwise is worthlessno Then does Master Gotama hold the view The cosmos is not eternal only this is true anything otherwise is worthlessno Then does Master Gotama hold the view The cosmos is finite only this is true anything otherwise is worthlessno Then does Master Gotama hold the view The cosmos is infinite only this is true anything otherwise is worthlessno Then does Master Gotama hold the view The soul  the body are the same only this is true anything otherwise is worthlessno Then does Master Gotama hold the view The soul is one thing and the body another only this is true anything otherwise is worthlessno Then does Master Gotama hold the view After death a Tathagata exists only this is true anything otherwise is worthlessno Then does Master Gotama hold the view After death a Tathagata does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthlessno Then does Master Gotama hold the view After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthlessno Then does Master Gotama hold the view After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthlessno How is it Master Gotama when Master Gotama is asked if he holds the view the cosmos is eternal after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless he says no in each caseSeeing what drawback then is Master Gotama thus entirely dissociated from each of these ten positionsVaccha the position that the cosmos is eternal is a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of viewsIt is accompanied by suffering distress despair  fever and it does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation to calm direct knowledge full Awakening UnbindingThe position that the cosmos is not eternalthe cosmos is finitethe cosmos is infinitethe soul  the body are the samethe soul is one thing and the body anotherafter death a Tathagata existsafter death a Tathagata does not existafter death a Tathagata both exists  does not existafter death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation to calm direct knowledge full Awakening UnbindingDoes Master Gotama have any position at allA position Vaccha is something that a Tathagata has done away withWhat a Tathagata sees is this Such is form such its origination such its disappearance such is feeling such its origination such its disappearance such is perceptionsuch are fabricationssuch is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance Because of this I say a Tathagata  with the ending fading away cessation renunciation  relinquishment of all construings all excogitations all Imaking  minemaking  obsessions with conceit  is through lack of clingingsustenance releasedBut Master Gotama the monk whose mind is thus released Where does he reappearReappear Vaccha doesnt applyIn that case Master Gotama he does not reappearDoes not reappear Vaccha doesnt applyboth does  does not reappeardoesnt applyneither does nor does not reappeardoesnt applyHow is it Master Gotama when Master Gotama is asked if the monk reappears does not reappear both does  does not reappear neither does nor does not reappear he says doesnt apply in each caseAt this point Master Gotama I am befuddled at this point confusedThe modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscuredOf course youre befuddled VacchaOf course youre confusedDeep Vaccha is this phenomenon hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wiseFor those with other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers it is difficult to knowThat being the case I will now put some questions to youAnswer as you see fitWhat do you think Vaccha If a fire were burning in front of you would you know that This fire is burning in front of meyes And suppose someone were to ask you Vaccha This fire burning in front of you dependent on what is it burning Thus asked how would you replyI would reply This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass  timber as its sustenance If the fire burning in front of you were to go out would you know that This fire burning in front of me has gone outyes And suppose someone were to ask you This fire that has gone out in front of you in which direction from here has it goneEastWestNorthOr south Thus asked how would you replyThat doesnt apply Master GotamaAny fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass and timber being unnourished  from having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other  is classified simply as outEven so Vaccha any physical form by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him That the Tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingFreed from the classification of form Vaccha the Tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the seaReappears doesnt applyDoes not

classification of consciousness Vaccha the Tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the seaReappears doesnt applyDoes not reappear doesnt applyBoth does  does not reappear doesnt applyNeither reappears nor does not reappear doesnt applyWhen this was said the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One Master Gotama it is as if there were a great sala tree not far from a village or town From inconstancy its branches and leaves would wear away its bark would wear away its sapwood would wear away so that on a later occasion  divested of branches leaves bark  sapwood  it would stand as pure heartwoodIn the same way Master Gotamas words are divested of branches leaves bark  sapwood and stand as pure heartwoodMagnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or were to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen as VenMalunkyaputta was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness These positions that are undeclared set aside discarded by the Blessed One  The cosmos is eternal The cosmos is not eternal The cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul  the body are the same The soul is one thing and the body another After death a Tathagata exists After death a Tathagata does not exist After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist  I dont approve I dont accept that the Blessed One has not declared them to meIll go ask the Blessed One about this matterIf he declares to me that The cosmos is eternal that The cosmos is not eternal that The cosmos is finite that The cosmos is infinite that The soul  the body are the same that The soul is one thing and the body another that After death a Tathagata exists that After death a Tathagata does not exist that After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist or that After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then I will live the holy life under himIf he does not declare to me that The cosmos is eternal or that After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then I will renounce the training and return to the lower lifeThen when it was evening VenMalunkyaputta arose from seclusion and went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord just now as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness These positions that are undeclared set aside discarded by the Blessed One I dont approve I dont accept that the Blessed One has not declared them to meIll go ask the Blessed One about this matterIf he declares to me that The cosmos is eternal or that After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then I will live the holy life under himIf he does not declare to me that The cosmos is eternal or that After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then I will renounce the training and return to the lower lifeLord if the Blessed One knows that The cosmos is eternal then may he declare to me that The cosmos is eternal If he knows that The cosmos is not eternal then may he declare to me that The cosmos is not eternal But if he doesnt know or see whether the cosmos is eternal or not eternal then in one who is unknowing  unseeing the straightforward thing is to admit I dont knowI dont see If he doesnt know or see whether after death a Tathagata exists does not exist both exists  does not exist neither exists nor does not exist then in one who is unknowing  unseeing the straightforward thing is to admit I dont knowI dont see Malunkyaputta did I ever say to you Come Malunkyaputta live the holy life under me and I will declare to you that The cosmos is eternal or The cosmos is not eternal or The cosmos is finite or The cosmos is infinite or The soul  the body are the same or The soul is one thing and the body another or After death a Tathagata exists or After death a Tathagata does not exist or After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist or After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not existNo lordAnd did you ever say to me Lord I will live the holy life under the Blessed One and he will declare to me that The cosmos is eternal or The cosmos is not eternal or The cosmos is finite or The cosmos is infinite or The soul  the body are the same or The soul is one thing and the body another or After death a Tathagata exists or After death a Tathagata does not exist or After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist or After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not existNo lordThen that being the case foolish man who are you to be claiming grievancesmaking demands of anyoneMalunkyaputta if anyone were to say I wont live the holy life under the Blessed One as long as he does not declare to me that The cosmos is eternal or that After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist the man would die and those things would still remain undeclared by the TathagataIts just as if a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poisonHis friends  companions kinsmen  relatives would provide him with a surgeon and the man would say I wont have this arrow removed until I know whether the man who wounded me was a noble warrior a brahman a merchant or a worker He would say I wont have this arrow removed until I know the given name  clan name of the man who wounded me until I know whether he was tall medium or short until I know whether he was dark ruddybrown or goldencolored until I know his home village town or city until I know whether the bow with which I was wounded was a long bow or a crossbow until I know whether the bowstring with which I was wounded was fiber bamboo threads sinew hemp or bark until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was wild or cultivated until I know whether the feathers of the shaft with which I was wounded were those of a vulture a stork a hawk a peacock or another bird until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was bound with the sinew of an ox a water buffalo a langur or a monkey He would say I wont have this arrow removed until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was that of a common arrow a curved arrow a barbed a calftoothed or an oleander arrow The man would die and those things would still remain unknown to himIn the same way if anyone were to say I wont live the holy life under the Blessed One as long as he does not declare to me that The cosmos is eternal or that After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist the man would die and those things would still remain undeclared by the TathagataMalunkyaputta its not the case that when there is the view The cosmos is eternal there is the living of the holy lifeAnd its not the case that when there is the view The cosmos is not eternal there is the living of the holy lifeWhen there is the view The cosmos

Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Feeding GroundAt that time VenRahula was staying at the Mango StoneThen the Blessed One arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to where VenRahula was staying at the Mango StoneVenRahula saw him coming from afar and on seeing him set out a seat  water for washing the feetThe Blessed One sat down on the seat set out and having sat down washed his feetVenRahula bowing down to the Blessed One sat to one sideThen the Blessed One having left a little bit of water in the water dipper said to VenRahula Rahula do you see this little bit of leftover water remaining in the water dipperYes sirThats how little of a contemplative there is in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lieHaving tossed away the little bit of leftover water the Blessed One said to VenRahula Rahula do you see how this little bit of leftover water is tossed awayYes sirRahula whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away just like thatHaving turned the water dipper upside down the Blessed One said to VenRahula Rahula do you see how this water dipper is turned upside downYes sirRahula whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is turned upside down just like thatHaving turned the water dipper rightside up the Blessed One said to VenRahula Rahula do you see how empty  hollow this water dipper isYes sirRahula whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is empty  hollow just like thatRahula its like a royal elephant immense pedigreed accustomed to battles its tusks like chariot polesHaving gone into battle it uses its forefeet  hindfeet its forequarters  hindquarters its head  ears  tusks  tail but keeps protecting its trunkThe elephant trainer notices that and thinks This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king But when the royal elephant having gone into battle uses its forefeet  hindfeet its forequarters  hindquarters its head  ears  tusks  tail  his trunk the trainer notices that and thinks This royal elephant has given up its life to the kingThere is nothing it will not doIn the same way Rahula when anyone feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie there is no evil I tell you he will not doThus Rahula you should train yourself I will not tell a deliberate lie even in jestWhat do you think Rahula What is a mirror forFor reflection sirIn the same way Rahula

breathing is developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefitWhen mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued in this way even ones final inbreaths  outbreaths are known as they cease not unknownThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified VenRahula delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsOnce Carpenter Fivetools went to see the Venerable UdayiHaving saluted him respectfully he sat down at one sideThus seated he asked the Venerable UdayiHow many kinds of feelings reverend Udayi were taught by the Blessed OneThree kinds of feelings Carpenter were taught by the Blessed One pleasant painful and neutral feelingsThese are the three feelings taught by the Blessed OneAfter these words Carpenter Fivetools said Not three kinds of feelings reverend Udayi were taught by the Blessed OneIt is two kinds of feelings that were stated by the Blessed One pleasant and painful feelingsThe neutral feeling was said by the Blessed One to belong to peaceful and sublime happinessBut the Venerable Udayi replied It is not two feelings that were taught by the Blessed One but three pleasant painful and neutral feelingsbut neither was Carpenter Fivetools able to convince the Venerable Udayi nor could the Venerable Udayi convince Carpenter FivetoolsIt so happened that Venerable Ananda had listened to that conversation and went to see the Blessed One about itHaving saluted the Blessed One respectfully he sat down at one sideThus seated he repeated the entire conversation that had taken place between the Venerable Udayi and Carpenter FivetoolsThe Blessed One said Ananda Udayis way of presentation with which Carpenter Fivetools disagreed was correct indeedBut also Carpenter Fivetools way of presentation with which Udayi disagreed was correctIn one way of presentation I have spoken of two kinds of feelings and in other ways of presentation I have spoken of three of six of eighteen of thirtysix and of one hundred and eight kinds of feelingsSo the Dhamma has been shown by me in different ways of presentationRegarding the Dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who do not agree with do not consent to and do not accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will quarrel and get into arguments and disputes hurting each other with sharp wordsRegarding the Dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who agree with consent to and accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will live in concord and amity without dispute like milk with water looking at each other with friendly eyesThere are five strands of sense desireWhat are these fiveForms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sensual desire and tempting to lustSounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sense desire and tempting to lustThese are the five strands of sense desireThe pleasure and joy arising dependent on these five strands of sense desire that is called sensual pleasureNow if someone were to say This is the highest pleasure and joy that can be experienced I would not concede thatAnd why notBecause there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeAnd what is this pleasureHere quite secluded from sensual desires secluded from unwholesome states of mind a monk enters upon and abides in the first meditative absorption which is accompanied by thought conception and discursive thinking and has in it joy and pleasure born of seclusionThis is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeIf someone were to say This is the highest pleasure that can be experienced I would not concede thatAnd why notBecause there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeAnd what is that pleasureHere with the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking a monk enters upon and abides in the second meditative absorption in the sphere of the infinity of space of the infinity of consciousness of nothingness of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionIf someone were to say This is the highest pleasure that can be experienced I would not concede thatAnd why notBecause there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeAnd what is this pleasureHere by completely surmounting the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception a monk enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feelingThis is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeIt may happen Ananda that Wanderers of other sects will be saying this The recluse Gotama speaks of the Cessation of Perception and Feeling and describes it as pleasureWhat is this and how is thisThose who say so should be told The Blessed One describes as pleasure not only the feeling of pleasureBut a Tathagata describes as pleasure whenever and whereinsoever it is obtained In AN the venerable Sariputta exclaims Nibbana is happiness friend Nibbana is happiness indeed The monk Udayi then asked How can there be happiness when there is no feeling The venerable Sariputta replied Just this is happiness friend that therein there is no feeling The continuation of that Sutta may also be compared with our textOn Nibbana as happiness see also ANI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on a tour of Kasi with a large community of monksThere he addressed the monks I abstain from the nighttime mealAs I am abstaining from the nighttime meal I sense nexttono illness nexttono affliction lightness strength  a comfortable abidingCome nowYou too abstain from the nighttime mealAs you are abstaining from the nighttime meal you too will sense nexttono illness nexttono affliction lightness strength  a comfortable abidingAs you say lord the monks respondedThen as he was wandering by stages in Kasi the Blessed One eventually arrived at a Kasi town called KitagiriAnd there he stayed in the Kasi town KitagiriNow at that time the monks led by Assaji  Punabbasu were residing in KitagiriThen a large number of monks went to them and on arrival said to them The Blessed One and the community of monks abstain from the nighttime mealAs they are abstaining from the nighttime meal they sense nexttono illness nexttono affliction lightness strength  a comfortable abidingCome now friendsYou too abstain from the nighttime mealAs you are abstaining from the nighttime meal you too will sense nexttono illness nexttono affliction lightness strength  a comfortable abidingWhen this was said the monks led by Assaji  Punabbasu said to those monks Friends we eat in the evening in the morning  in the wrong time during the dayAs we are eating in the evening in the morning  in the wrong time during the day we sense nexttono illness nexttono affliction lightness strength  a comfortable abidingWhy should we abandoning what is immediately visible chase after something subject to timeWe will eat in the evening in the morning  in the wrong time during the dayWhen they were unable to convince the monks led by Assaji  Punabbasu those monks went to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monkIn my name call the monks led by Assaji  Punabbasu saying The Teacher calls you friends As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to the monks led by Assaji  Punabbasu on arrival he said The Teacher calls you friendsAs you say friend the monks led by Assaji  Punabbasu repliedThen they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them Is it true monks that a large number of monks went to you and you said Why should we abandoning what is immediately visible chase after something subject to timeWe will eat in the evening in the morning  in the wrong time during the day Yes lordMonks have you ever understood me to teach the Dhamma in this way Whatever a person experiences  pleasant painful or neitherpleasantnorpainful  his unskillful qualities decrease and his skillful qualities growNo lordAnd havent you understood me to teach the Dhamma

monksAnd if it were not known by me  not seen not observed not realized not touched through discernment  that For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease then would it be fitting for me not knowing that to say Abandon that sort of pleasant feelingNo lordBut because it is known by me  seen observed realized touched through discernment  that For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease I therefore say Abandon that sort of pleasant feelingIf it were not known by me  not seen not observed not realized not touched through discernment  that For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow then would it be fitting for me not knowing that to say Enter  remain in that sort of pleasant feelingNo lordBut because it is known by me  seen observed realized touched through discernment  that For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow I therefore say Enter  remain in that sort of pleasant feelingMonks I dont say of all monks that they have a task to do with heedfulness nor do I say of all monks that they have no task to do with heedfulnessMonks who are arahants whose mental fermentations are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosis I dont say of them that they have work to do with heedfulnessWhy is thatThey have done their task with heedfulnessThey are incapable of being heedlessBut as for monks in higher training who have not yet reached their hearts goal who still aspire for the unexcelled freedom from bondage I say of them that they have a task to do with heedfulnessWhy is thatPerhaps these venerable ones when making use of suitable resting places associating with admirable friends balancing their faculties will reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for themselves in the here  now

not say that the attainment of gnosis is all at onceRather the attainment of gnosis is after gradual training gradual action gradual practiceAnd how is there the attainment of gnosis after gradual training gradual action gradual practiceThere is the case where when conviction has arisen one visitsHaving visited one grows closeHaving grown close one lends earHaving lent ear one hears the DhammaHaving heard the Dhamma one remembers itRemembering one penetrates the meaning of the teachingsPenetrating the meaning one comes to an agreement through pondering the teachingsThere being an agreement through pondering the teachings desire arisesWhen desire has arisen one is willingWhen one is willing one contemplatesHaving contemplated one makes an exertionHaving made an exertion one realizes with the body the ultimate truth and having penetrated it with discernment sees itNow monks there hasnt been that conviction there hasnt been that visiting there hasnt been that growing close that lending ear that hearing of the Dhamma that remembering that penetration of the meaning of the teachings that agreement through pondering the teachings that desire that willingness that contemplation that exertionYou have lost the way monksYou have gone the wrong way monksHow far have you strayed foolish men from this Dhamma  DisciplineMonks there is a fourphrased statement that when it is recited a wise man will in no long time learn the meaning through discernmentI will recite it and you learn it from meBut lord who are we to be learners of the DhammaMonks even with a teacher devoted to material things an heir of material things who lives attached to material things this sort of haggling wouldnt be proper If we get this well do it if we dont we wont So how could it be with regard to the Tathagata who dwells entirely detached from material thingsFor a disciple who has conviction in the Teachers message  lives to penetrate it what accords with the Dhamma is this The Blessed One is the Teacher I am a discipleHe is the one who knows not I For a disciple who has conviction in the Teachers message  lives to penetrate it the Teachers message is healing  nourishingFor a disciple who has conviction in the Teachers message  lives to penetrate it what accords with the Dhamma is this Gladly would I let the flesh  blood in my body dry up leaving just the skin tendons  bones but if I have not attained what can be reached through human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing my persistence For a disciple who has conviction in the Teachers message  lives to penetrate it one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturnThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThe Pali phrase for monks led by Assaji and Punabbasu is assajipunabbusakaa bhikkhuuBoth The MiddleLength Sayings and The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha mistakenly treat this phrase as the names of two monks Assaji and PunabbasukaActually the kaa at the end of the name is a suffix that converts it into an adjective describing a group following Assaji and PunabbasuI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen Pañcakanga the carpenter went to VenUdayin and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenUdayin Venerable sir how many feelings has the Blessed One spoken ofHouseholder the Blessed One has spoken of three feelings a feeling of pleasure a feeling of pain a feeling of neither pleasure nor painThese are the three feelings the Blessed One has spoken ofWhen this was said Pañcakanga the carpenter said to VenUdayin The Blessed One has not spoken of three feelingsHe has spoken of two feelings a feeling of pleasure and a feeling of painAs for the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain the Blessed One has spoken of it as a refined pleasureA second time VenUdayin said to Pañcakanga the carpenter Householder the Blessed One has not spoken of two feelingsHe has spoken of three feelingsA second time Pañcakanga the carpenter said to VenUdayin The Blessed One has not spoken of three feelingsHe has spoken of two feelingsA third time VenUdayin said to Pañcakanga the carpenter Householder the Blessed One has not spoken of two feelingsHe has spoken of three feelingsA third time Pañcakanga the carpenter said to VenUdayin The Blessed One has not spoken of three feelingsHe has spoken of two feelingsNeither was VenUdayin able to convince Pañcakanga the carpenter nor was Pañcakanga the carpenter able to convince VenUdayinNow VenAnanda overheard this discussion between VenUdayin and PañcakangaSo he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he told the Blessed One of the entire discussion between VenUdayin and PañcakangaAnanda true was the exposition that Pañcakanga the carpenter would not accept from VenUdayinAnd true was the exposition that VenUdayin would not accept from Pañcakanga the carpenterThere is the exposition by which I have spoken of two feelings the exposition by which I have spoken of three feelings five feelings six feelings eighteen feelings feelings feelingsThus I have taught the Dhamma by means of expositionWhen I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition it can be expected that when there are those who do not consent to assent to or accept what is wellsaid and wellstated by one another there will be arguing quarreling  disputing and they will dwell wounding one another with the sword of the tongueThus I have taught the Dhamma by means of expositionWhen I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition it can be expected that when there are those who do consent to assent to  accept what is wellsaid and wellstated by one another they will live in harmony with courtesy without quarreling like milk mixed with water regarding one another with friendly eyesAnanda there are these five strings of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingSounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingNow whatever pleasure or happiness arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality that is called sensual pleasureThough some might say That is the highest pleasure that beings experience I would not grant them thatWhy is thatBecause there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than thatAnd what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than thatThere is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born

describes it as pleasureWhat is thisHow can this be When they say that they are to be told Its not the case friends that the Blessed One describes only pleasant feeling as included under pleasureWherever pleasure is found in whatever terms the Blessed One describes it as pleasure That is what the Blessed One saidGratified VenAnanda delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Anguttarapans at an Anguttarapan town named ApanaThen early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Apana for almsHaving wandered for alms in Apana and returning from his alms round after his meal he went to a certain forest grove for the days abidingPlunging into the grove he sat down for his days abiding at the root of a certain treeVenUdayin too early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Apana for almsHaving wandered for alms in Apana and returning from his alms round after his meal he went to that forest grove for the days abidingPlunging into the grove he sat down for his days abiding at the root of a certain treeThen as he was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness So many painful things has the Blessed One taken away from usSo many pleasant things has he brought usSo many unskillful qualities has the Blessed One taken away from usSo many skillful qualities has he brought usThen in the evening VenUdayin left seclusion and went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness So many painful things has the Blessed One taken away from usSo many pleasant things has he brought usSo many unskillful qualities has the Blessed One taken away from usSo many skillful qualities has he brought us For in the past lord we used to eat in the morning in the evening and in the day at the wrong timeThen there was the time when the Blessed One addressed the monks saying Monks please discontinue that daytime meal at the wrong time For just a day I was upset for just a day I was sad The exquisite staple  nonstaple foods that faithful householders give us during the day at the wrong time even those the Blessed One has us abandon even those the One Wellgone has us relinquish But considering our love  respect  shame  compunction around the Blessed One we abandoned that daytime meal at the wrong timeSo we ate both in the evening  in the morningThen there was the time when the Blessed One addressed the monks saying Monks please discontinue that evening meal at the wrong time For just a day I was upset for just a day I was sad The more exquisitely prepared of our two meals even that the Blessed One has us abandon even that the One Wellgone has us relinquishIt has happened lord that a man  obtaining some good curry ingredients during the day  would say to his wife Put this aside and well all eat it together in the evening All fine cooking is done in the evening and next to none during the dayBut considering our love  respect  shame  compunction around the Blessed One we abandoned that evening meal at the wrong timeIt has happened lord that monks wandering for alms in the pitch dark of the night have walked into a wastewater pool fallen into a cesspool stumbled over a thorn patch or stumbled over a sleeping cowThey have encountered young hooligans on the way to or from a crimeThey have been sexually propositioned by womenOnce I went for alms in the pitch dark of nightA woman washing a pot saw me by a lightning flash and on seeing me screamed out Im done forA demon is after me When this was said I said to her Im no demon sisterIm a monk waiting for alms Then youre a monk whose daddys dead and whose mommas deadBetter for you monk that your belly be slit open with a sharp butchers knife than this prowling for alms for your bellys sake in the pitch dark of night On recollecting that lord the thought occurred to me So many painful things has the Blessed One taken away from usSo many pleasant things has he brought usSo many unskillful qualities has the Blessed One taken away from usSo many skillful qualities has he brought us In the same way Udayin there are some worthless men who when I

perception nor nonperceptionDo you see any fetter large or small of whose abandoning I dont speakNo lordThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified VenUdayin delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThus have I heardOnce the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen Carpenter Fivetools went to see the Venerable UdayiHaving saluted him respectfully he sat down at one sideThus seated he asked the Venerable UdayiHow many kinds of feelings reverend Udayi were taught by the Blessed OneThree kinds of feelings Carpenter were taught by the Blessed One pleasant painful and neutral feelingsThese are the three feelings taught by the Blessed OneAfter these words Carpenter Fivetools said Not three kinds of feelings reverend Udayi were taught by the Blessed OneIt is two kinds of feelings that were stated by the Blessed One pleasant and painful feelingsThe neutral feeling was said by the Blessed One to belong to peaceful and sublime happinessBut the Venerable Udayi replied It is not two feelings that were taught by the Blessed One but three pleasant painful and neutral feelingsbut neither was Carpenter Fivetools able to convince the Venerable Udayi nor could the Venerable Udayi convince Carpenter FivetoolsIt so happened that Venerable Ananda had listened to that conversation and went to see the Blessed One about itHaving saluted the Blessed One respectfully he sat down at one sideThus seated he repeated the entire conversation that had taken place between the Venerable Udayi and Carpenter FivetoolsThe Blessed One said Ananda Udayis way of presentation with which Carpenter Fivetools disagreed was correct indeedBut also Carpenter Fivetools way of presentation with which Udayi disagreed was correctIn one way of presentation I have spoken of two kinds of feelings and in other ways of presentation I have spoken of three of six of eighteen of thirtysix and of one hundred and eight kinds of feelingsSo the Dhamma has been shown by me in different ways of presentationRegarding the Dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who do not agree with do not consent to and do not accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will quarrel and get into arguments and disputes hurting each other with sharp wordsRegarding the Dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who agree with consent to and accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will live in concord and amity without dispute like milk with water looking at each other with friendly eyesThere are five strands of sense desireWhat are these fiveForms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sensual desire and tempting to lustSounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sense desire and tempting to lustThese are the five strands of sense desireThe pleasure and joy arising dependent on these five strands of sense desire that is called sensual pleasureNow if someone were to say This is the highest pleasure and joy that can be experienced I would not concede thatAnd why notBecause there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeAnd what is this pleasureHere quite secluded from sensual desires secluded from unwholesome states of mind a monk enters upon and abides in the first meditative absorption which is accompanied by thought conception and discursive thinking and has in it joy and pleasure born of seclusionThis is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeIf someone were to say This is the highest pleasure that can be experienced I would not concede thatAnd why notBecause there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeAnd what is that pleasureHere with the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking a monk enters upon and abides in the second meditative absorption in the sphere of the infinity of space of the infinity of consciousness of nothingness of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionIf someone were to say This is the highest pleasure that can be experienced I would not concede thatAnd why notBecause there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeAnd what is this pleasureHere by completely surmounting the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception a monk enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feelingThis is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeIt may happen Ananda that Wanderers of other sects will be saying this The recluse Gotama speaks of the Cessation of Perception and Feeling and describes it as pleasureWhat is this and how is thisThose who say so should be told The Blessed One describes as pleasure not only the feeling of pleasureBut a Tathagata describes as pleasure whenever and whereinsoever it is obtained That is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsIn AN the venerable Sariputta exclaims Nibbana is happiness friend Nibbana is happiness indeed The monk Udayi then asked How can there be happiness when there is no feeling The venerable Sariputta replied Just this is happiness friend that therein there is no feeling The continuation of that Sutta may also be compared with our textOn Nibbana as happiness see also ANThe Buddha often likened himself to a doctor offering a treatment for the sufferings of the heartUnlike ordinary doctors however he could not show newcomers the state of health  nibbana  that his teaching was supposed to produceIf they followed his teaching they would see it for themselvesBut until they followed his teaching he could offer them no empirical proof that nibbana was a genuine possibilityAs he stated in MN the proof that he was awakened  and that awakening was a good thing  came with ones first taste of the Deathless at the first level of awakening called streamentryHowever streamentry could be attained only through a serious commitment to the practiceThus he had to provide other nonempirical means of persuasion to induce his listeners to give his teachings a serious tryOne of these means was the pragmatic argument which differs from empirical arguments as followsAn empirical argument presents facts that logically imply that A must be true or falseA pragmatic argument focuses not on the facts related to A but on the behavior that can be expected from a person who believes or rejects AThe Buddhas main pragmatic argument is that if one accepted his teachings one would be likely to pay careful attention to ones actions so as to do no harmThis in and of itself is a worthy activity regardless of whether the rest of the path was trueWhen applying this argument to the issue of rebirth and karmic results the Buddha sometimes coupled it with a second pragmatic argument that resembles Pascals wager If one practices the Dhamma one leads a blameless life in the hereandnowEven if the afterlife and karmic results do not exist one has not lost the wager for the blamelessness of ones life is a reward in and of itselfIf there is an afterlife with karmic results then one has won a double reward the blamelessness of ones life here and now and the good rewards of ones actions in the afterlifeThese two pragmatic arguments form the central message of this suttaThe Pali title of this sutta is an adjective that has no exact equivalent in EnglishIt is used in two different contextsIn the context of gambling it describes a die that has not been loaded to favor one side or the otherIn the context of an argument it describes a position that is true regardless of which side of the argument is rightIn other words if there is an argument as to whether A or notA is true if C is true regardless of whether A is true or not C is an apannaka positionAlthough this sutta is primarily concerned with the second context the Buddha implicitly makes the connection between this context and the first in stating that a person who rightly grasps the apannaka position has made a lucky throw whereas a person who has wrongly grasped it has made an unlucky throwThus to preserve this double context I have translated apannaka as safebet Coveryourbets might have been a more accurate translation but it would have been unwieldyThe sutta falls into two parts the first part covering his safebet arguments and the second part extolling the person who practices the Dhamma for tormenting neither himself nor othersThe two parts are connected in that they both present pragmatic arguments for accepting the Buddhas teachingThe safebet arguments in the first part of the sutta follow two patternsThe first pattern covers controversies over whether there is a life after death whether actions bear results and whether there is a causal connection between ones actions and ones experience of pleasure and painThe pattern here is as followsIt is noteworthy that the arguments in A and B are not safebet arguments for they assume that A is wrong and B is rightWhether these arguments date from the Buddha or were added at a later date no one knowsThe second pattern in the first part covers two controversies whether or not a person can attain a total state of formlessness and whether or not a person can attain total cessation of becomingIn the context of the first controversy the safebet position is that even if there is no total attainment of formlessness that still opens the possibility that one could become a deva on the level of formIn the context of the second the safebet position is that even if there is no total cessation of becoming that still leaves open the possibility that one could become a deva on the formless levelOne further reflects that total formlessness would open the way to greater peace than the level of form and that the cessation of becoming would open the way to greater freedom than formlessnessThese last observations in no way prove that there is total formlessness or total cessation of becoming but they do incline the mind to view those possibilities favorablyThe second part of the sutta divides people into four sorts those who torment themselves those who torment others those who torment themselves and others and those who torment neither themselves nor othersThe first and third alternatives describe styles of religious practice that were common in the Buddhas time practices of selftorture and selfaffliction and the offering of sacrificesThe second alternative covers any and all bloody occupationsIn opposition to these alternatives the Buddha presents the fourth alternative as ideal the practice of his teachings all the way to full liberationFor other pragmatic arguments for accepting and practicing the Dhamma see AN AN and SNANalso contains a variant on the wager argument given in this suttaI have heard that on one occasion when the Blessed One was on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks he arrived at the brahman village called SalaThe brahman householders heard Master Gotama the contemplative  the son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clan  on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks  has arrived at SalaAnd of that master Gotama this fine reputation has spread He is indeed a Blessed One an arahant rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessedHe has made known  having realized it through direct knowledge  this world with its devas maras  brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their rulers  common peopleHe has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pureIt is good to see such a worthy one So the brahman householders of Sala went to the Blessed OneOn arrival some of them bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one sideSome of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one sideSome of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palmtopalm over their heartsSome of them sat to one side having announced their name  clanSome of them sat to one side in silenceAs they were sitting there the Blessed One asked them Householders is there any teacher agreeable to you in whom you have found grounded convictionNo lord

enters and remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceThen with the fading of rapture he

recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain

undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after

others he dwells in the herenow free of hunger unbound cooled sensitive to happiness with a Brahmalike mindWhen this was said the brahman householders of Sala said Magnificent master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearWe go to master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monksMay master Gotama remember us as lay followers who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeSee also MN MN Monks there are these three types of individuals to be found existing in the worldWhich threeAn individual like an inscription in rock an individual like an inscription in soil and an individual like an inscription in waterAnd how is an individual like an inscription in rockThere is the case where a certain individual is often angered and his anger stays with him a long timeJust as an inscription in rock is not quickly effaced by wind or water and lasts a long time in the same way a certain individual is often angered and his anger stays with him a long timeThis is called an individual like an inscription in rockAnd how is an individual like an inscription in soilThere is the case where a certain individual is often angered but his anger doesnt stay with him a long timeJust as an inscription in soil is quickly effaced by wind or water and doesnt last a long time in the same way a certain individual is often angered but his anger doesnt stay with him a long timeThis is called an individual like an inscription in soilAnd how is an individual like an inscription in waterThere is the case where a certain individual  when spoken to roughly spoken to harshly spoken to in an unpleasing way  is nevertheless congenial companionable  courteousJust as an inscription in water immediately disappears and doesnt last a long time in the same way a certain individual  when spoken to roughly spoken to harshly spoken to in an unpleasing way  is nevertheless congenial companionable  courteousThis is called an individual like an inscription in waterThese are the three types of individuals to be found existing in the world In this discourse the Buddha shows the factors that go into deciding what is and is not worth sayingThe main factors are three whether or not a statement is true whether or not it is beneficial and whether or not it is pleasing to othersThe Buddha himself would state only those things that are true and beneficial and would have a sense of time for when pleasing and unpleasing things should be saidNotice that the possibility that a statement might be untrue yet beneficial is not even entertainedThis discourse also shows in action the Buddhas teaching on the four categories of questions and how they should be answeredThe prince asks him two questions and in both cases he responds first with a counterquestion before going on to give an analytical answer to the first question and a categorical answer to the secondEach counterquestion serves a double function to give the prince a familiar reference point for understanding the answer about to come and also to give him a chance to speak of his own intelligence and good motivesThis provides him with the opportunity to save face after being stymied in his desire to best the Buddha in argumentThe Commentary notes that the prince had placed his infant son on his lap as a cheap debaters trick if the Buddha had put him in an uncomfortable spot in the debate the prince would have pinched his son causing him to cry and thus effectively bringing the debate to a haltThe Buddha however uses the infants presence to remove any sense of a debate and also to make an effective pointTaking Nigantha Nataputtas image of a dangerous object stuck in the throat he applies it to the infant and then goes on to make the point that unlike the Niganthas  who were content to leave someone with a potentially lethal object in the throat  the Buddhas desire is to remove such objects out of sympathy and compassionIn this way he brings the prince over to his side converting a potential opponent into a discipleThus this discourse is not only about right speech but also shows right speech in actionI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryThen Prince Abhaya went to Nigantha Nataputta and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there Nigantha Nataputta said to him Come now princeRefute the words of Gotama the contemplative and this admirable report about you will spread afar The words of Gotama the contemplative  so mighty so powerful  were refuted by Prince Abhaya But how venerable sir will I refute the words of Gotama the contemplative  so mighty so powerfulCome now princeGo to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival say this Lord would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others If Gotama the contemplative thus asked answers The Tathagata would say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others then you should say Then how is there any difference between you lord and runofthemill peopleFor even runofthemill people say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others But if Gotama the contemplative thus asked answers The Tathagata would not say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others then you should say Then how lord did you say of Devadatta that Devadatta is headed for destitution Devadatta is headed for hell Devadatta will boil for an eon Devadatta is incurableFor Devadatta was upset  disgruntled at those words of yours When Gotama the contemplative is asked this twopronged question by you he wont be able to swallow it down or spit it upJust as if a twohorned chestnut were stuck in a mans throat he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it upIn the same way when Gotama the contemplative is asked this twopronged question by you he wont be able to swallow it down or spit it upResponding As you say venerable sir Prince Abhaya got up from his seat bowed down to Nigantha Nataputta circumambulated him and then went to the Blessed OneOn arrival he bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he glanced up at the sun and thought Today is not the time to refute the Blessed Ones wordsTomorrow in my own home I will overturn the Blessed Ones words So he said to the Blessed One May the Blessed One together with three others acquiesce to my offer of tomorrows mealThe Blessed One acquiesced with silenceThen Prince Abhaya understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him and leftThen after the night had passed the Blessed One early in the morning put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe went to Prince Abhayas homeOn arrival he sat down on a seat made readyPrince Abhaya with his own hand served  satisfied the Blessed One with fine staple  nonstaple foodsThen when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl Prince Abhaya took a lower seat and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to othersPrince there is no categorical yesorno answer to thatThen right here lord the Niganthas are destroyedBut prince why do you say Then right here lord the Niganthas are destroyedJust yesterday lord I went to Nigantha Nataputta and he said to meCome now princeGo to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival say this Lord would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others Just as if a twohorned chestnut were stuck in a mans throat he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it upIn the same way when Gotama the contemplative is asked this twopronged question by you he wont be able to swallow it down or spit it up Now at that time a baby boy was lying faceup on the princes lapSo the Blessed One said to the prince What do you think prince If this young boy through your own negligence or that of the nurse were to take a stick or a piece of gravel into its mouth what would you doI would take it out lordIf I couldnt get it out right away then holding its head in my left hand and crooking a finger of my right I would take it out even if it meant drawing bloodWhy is thatBecause I have sympathy for the young boyIn the same way princeIn the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he does not say themIn the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he does not say themIn the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial but unendearing  disagreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying themIn the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he does not say themIn the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he does not say themIn the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial and endearing  agreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying themWhy is thatBecause the Tathagata has sympathy for living beingsLord when wise nobles or brahmans householders or contemplatives having formulated questions come to the Tathagata and ask him does this line of reasoning appear to his awareness beforehand  If those who approach me ask this I  thus asked  will answer in this way  or does the Tathagata come up with the answer on the spotIn that case prince I will ask you a counterquestionAnswer as you see fitWhat do you think are you skilled in the parts of a chariotYes lordI am skilled in the parts of a chariotAnd what do you think When people come  ask you What is the name of this part of the chariot does this line of reasoning appear to your awareness beforehand  If those who approach me ask this I  thus asked  will answer in this way  or do you come up with the answer on the spotLord I am renowned for being skilled in the parts of a chariotAll the parts of a chariot are wellknown to meI come up with the answer on the spotIn the same way prince when wise nobles or brahmans householders or contemplatives having formulated questions come to the Tathagata and ask him he comes up with the answer on the spotWhy is thatBecause the property of the Dhamma is thoroughly penetrated by the TathagataFrom his thorough penetration of the property of the Dhamma he comes up with the answer on the spot When this was said Prince Abhaya said to the Blessed One Magnificent lordMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monksMay the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeSee also AN AN ANI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at IsipatanaThen early in the morning the Blessed One having put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe went into Varanasi for almsAs he was walking for alms near the figtree at the cattle yoke he saw a certain monk whose delight was in what is empty whose delight was in exterior things his mindfulness muddled his alertness lacking his concentration lacking his mind gone astray his faculties uncontrolledOn seeing him the Blessed One said to him Monk monk dont let yourself putrefyOn one who lets himself putrefy  stink with the stench of carrion theres no way that flies wont swarm  attackThen the monk  admonished with this the Blessed Ones admonishment  came to his sensesSo the Blessed One having gone for alms in Varanasi after the meal returning from his alms round addressed the monksWhen this was said a certain monk said to the Blessed One What lord is putrefactionWhat is the stench of carrionWhat are fliesGreed monk is putrefactionIll will is the stench of carrionEvil unskillful thoughts are fliesOn one who lets himself putrefy  stink with the stench of carrion theres no way that flies wont swarm  attackOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali at Gotamaka ShrineThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said Its through direct knowledge that I teach the Dhamma not without direct knowledgeIts with a cause that I teach the Dhamma not without a causeIts with marvels that I teach the Dhamma not without marvelsBecause I teach the Dhamma through direct knowledge and not without direct knowledge because I teach the Dhamma with a cause and not without a cause because I teach the Dhamma with marvels and not without marvels there is good reason for my instruction good reason for my admonitionAnd that is enough for you to be content enough for you to be gratified enough for you to take joy that the Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One and the community has practiced rightlyThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the tenthousand fold cosmos quakedEditors note According to the Commentary the audience for this sutta was the same group of monks who had been so displeased upon first hearing the Mulapariyaya SuttaMonks there are these three forms of sagacityWhich threeBodily sagacity verbal sagacity and mental sagacityAnd what is bodily sagacityThere is the case where a monk abstains from taking life abstains from theft abstains from unchastityThis is called bodily sagacityAnd what is verbal sagacityThere is the case where a monk abstains from lying abstains from divisive talebearing abstains from harsh language abstains from idle chatterThis is called verbal sagacityAnd what is mental sagacityThere is the case where a monk who  with the wasting away of the mental fermentations  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and nowThis is called mental sagacityThese monks are the three forms of sagacityThen Anathapindika the householder went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Householder when the mind is unprotected bodily actions are unprotected as well verbal actions are unprotected as well mental actions are unprotected as wellWhen ones bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions are unprotected ones bodily actions get soggy ones verbal actions get soggy ones mental actions get soggyWhen ones bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions are soggy ones bodily actions verbal actions mental actions rotWhen ones bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions rot ones death is not auspicious the mode of ones dying not goodJust as when a peakroofed house is poorly roofed The peak of the roof is unprotected the roof beams are unprotected the walls are unprotectedThe peak of the roof the roof beams the walls get soggyThe peak of the roof the roof beams the walls then rotIn the same way when the mind is unprotected bodily actions verbal actions mental actions are unprotected as well Ones bodily verbal mental actions get soggy Ones bodily verbal mental actions rotWhen ones bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions rot ones death is not auspicious the mode of ones dying not goodNow when the mind is protected bodily actions are protected as well verbal actions are protected as well mental actions are protected as wellWhen ones bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions are

mind is protected bodily actions verbal actions mental actions are protected as well Ones bodily verbal mental actions dont get soggy Ones bodily verbal mental actions dont rotWhen ones bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions dont rot ones death is auspicious the mode of ones dying is goodThe traditional title for this sutta has nothing to do with its contentThus I have given it a new title the translatorA monk intent on heightened mind should attend periodically to three themes He should attend periodically to the theme of concentration he should attend periodically to the theme of uplifted energy he should attend periodically to the theme of equanimityIf the monk intent on heightened mind were to attend solely to the theme of concentration it is possible that his mind would tend to lazinessIf he were to attend solely to the theme of uplifted energy it is possible that his mind would tend to restlessnessIf he were to attend solely to the theme of equanimity it is possible that his mind would not be rightly concentrated for the ending of the fermentationsBut when he attends periodically to the theme of concentration attends periodically to the theme of uplifted energy attends periodically to the theme of equanimity his mind is pliant malleable luminous  not brittleIt is rightly centered for the stopping of the fermentationsJust as if a goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice were to set up a smelterHaving set up the smelter he would fire the receptacleHaving fired the receptacle he would take hold of some gold with his tongs and place it in the receptaclePeriodically he would blow on it periodically sprinkle it with water periodically examine it closelyIf he were solely to blow on it it is possible that the gold would burn upIf he were solely to sprinkle it with water it is possible that the gold would grow coldIf he were solely to examine it closely it is possible that the gold would not come to full perfectionBut when he periodically blows on it periodically sprinkles it with water periodically examines it closely the gold becomes pliant malleable  luminousIt is not brittle and is ready to be workedThen whatever sort of ornament he has in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  the gold would serve his purposeIn the same way a monk intent on heightened mind should attend periodically to three themes he should attend periodically to the theme of concentration he should attend periodically to the theme of uplifted energy he should attend periodically to the theme of equanimityIf the monk intent on heightened mind were to attend solely to the theme of concentration it is possible that his mind would tend to lazinessIf he were to attend solely to the theme of uplifted energy it is possible that his mind would tend to restlessnessIf he were to attend solely to the theme of equanimity it is possible that his mind would not be rightly centered for the stopping of the fermentationsBut when he attends periodically to the theme of concentration attends periodically to the theme of uplifted energy attends periodically to the theme of equanimity his mind is pliant malleable luminous and not brittleIt is rightly centered for the stopping of the fermentationsAnd then whichever of the higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an openingIf he wants he wields manifold supranormal powersHaving been one he becomes many having been many he becomes oneHe appearsHe vanishesHe goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through spaceHe dives in and out of the earth as if it were waterHe walks on water without sinking as if it were dry landSitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged birdWith his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon so mighty and powerfulHe exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsHe can witness this for himself whenever there is an openingIf he wants he hears  by means of the divine earelement purified and surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine and human whether near or farHe can witness this for himself whenever there is an openingIf he wants he knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awarenessHe discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passionHe discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversionHe discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusionHe discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mindHe discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mindHe discerns an excelled mind as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mindHe discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mindHe discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mindHe can witness this for himself whenever there is an openingIf he wants he recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes and detailsHe can witness this for himself whenever there is an openingIf he wants he sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kammaHe can witness this for himself whenever there is an openingIf he wants then through the ending of the mental fermentations he remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and nowHe can witness this for himself whenever there is an openingThere were some strange people around in the Buddhas days believing some strange things  but that is no different from our own days when people still believe the most odd offbalance ideasIn this sutta we meet some people who believed that by imitating animals they would be savedMaybe theyre still with us tooBelief is often one thing action anotherWhile beliefs sometimes influence actions for other people their beliefs are quite separate from what they doBut the Buddha says all intentional actions whether thoughts speech or bodily actions however expressed are kamma and lead the doer of them to experience a result sooner or laterIn this sutta the Buddha classifies kamma into four groupsDark kamma does not give a bright result nor does bright kamma lead to dark resultKamma can be mixed where an action is done with a variety of motives some good some evilAnd that kind of kamma also exists which gives up attachment to and interest in the other three and so leads beyond the range of kammaThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Koliyan country there is a town of the Koliyans called HaliddavasanaThen Punna a son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic and also Seniya a naked dog duty ascetic went to the Blessed One and Punna the ox duty ascetic paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side while Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic exchanged greetings with the Blessed One and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished he too sat down at one side curled up like a dogWhen Punna the oxduty ascetic sat down he asked the Blessed One Venerable sir this naked dogduty ascetic Seniya does what is hard to do he eats his food when it is thrown on the groundThat dog duty has long been taken up and practiced by himWhat will be his destinationWhat will be his future courseEnough Punna let that beDo not ask me thatA second time A third time Punna the oxduty ascetic asked the Blessed One Venerable sir this naked dogduty ascetic Seniya does what is hard to do he eats his food when it is thrown on the groundThat dog duty has long been taken up and practiced by himWhat will be his destinationWhat will be his future courseWell Punna since I certainly cannot persuade you when I say Enough Punna let that beDo not ask me that I shall therefore answer youHere Punna someone develops the dog duty fully and unstintingly he develops the doghabit fully and unstintingly he develops the dog mind fully and unstintingly he develops dog behavior fully and unstintinglyHaving done that on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of dogsBut if his view is such as this By this virtue or duty or asceticism or religious life I shall become a god or some god that is wrong view in his caseNow there are two destinations for one with wrong view I say hell or the animal wombSo Punna if his dog duty is perfected it will lead him to the company of dogs if it is not it will lead him to hellWhen this was said Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic wept and shed tearsThen the Blessed One told Punna son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic Punna I could not persuade you when I said Enough Punna let that beDo not ask me that Venerable sir I am not weeping that the Blessed One has spoken thusStill this dog duty has long been taken up and practiced by meVenerable sir there is this Punna a son of the Koliyans and an ox duty ascetic that ox duty has long been taken up and practiced by himWhat will be his destinationWhat will be his future courseEnough Seniya let that beDo not ask me that A second time A third time Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic asked the Blessed One Venerable sir there is this Punna a son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic that ox duty has long been taken up and practiced by himWhat will be his destinationWhat will be his future courseWell Seniya since I certainly cannot persuade you when I say Enough Seniya let that beDo not ask me that I shall therefore answer youHere Seniya someone develops the ox duty fully and unstintingly he develops the ox habit fully and unstintingly he develops the ox mind fully and unstintingly he develops the ox behavior fully and unstintinglyHaving done that on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of oxenBut if his view is such as this By this virtue or duty or asceticism or religious like I shall become a god or some god that is wrong view in his caseNow there are two destinations for one with wrong view I say hell or the animal wombSo Seniya if his ox duty is perfected it will lead him to the company of oxen if it is not it will lead him to hellWhen this was said Punna a son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic wept and shed tearsThen the Blessed One told Seniya the naked dog duty ascetic Seniya I could not persuade you when I said Enough Seniya let that beDo not ask me that Venerable sir I am not weeping that the Blessed One has spoken thusStill this ox duty has long been taken up and practiced by meVenerable sir I have confidence in the Blessed One thus The Blessed One is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I may abandon this ox duty and that this naked dogduty ascetic Seniya may abandon that dog duty Then Punna listen and heed well what I shall sayYes venerable sir he repliedThe Blessed One said thisPunna there are four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after realization myself with direct knowledgeWhat are the fourThere is dark kamma with dark ripening there is bright kamma with bright ripening there is darkandbright kamma with darkandbright ripening and there is kamma that is not dark and not bright with neitherdarknorbright ripening that conduces to the exhaustion of kammaWhat is dark kamma with dark ripeningHere someone produces a bodily process with affliction he produces a verbal process with affliction he produces a mental process with afflictionBy so doing he reappears in a world with afflictionWhen that happens afflicting contacts touch himBeing touched by these he feels afflicting feelings entirely painful as in the case of beings in hellThus a beings reappearance is due to a being he reappears owing to the kammas he has performedWhen he has reappeared contacts touch himThus I say are beings heirs of their kammasThis is called dark kamma with dark ripeningAnd what is bright kamma with bright ripeningHere someone produces a bodily process not with affliction he produces a verbal process not with affliction he produces a mental process not with afflictionBy doing so he reappears in a world without afflictionWhen that happens unafflicting contacts touch himBeing touched by these he feels unafflicting feelings entirely pleasant as in the case of the Subhakinha the gods of Refulgent GloryThus a beings reappearance is due to a being he reappears owing to the kammas he has performedWhen he has reappeared contacts touch himThus I say are beings heirs of their kammasThis is called bright kamma with bright ripeningWhat is darkandbright kamma with darkandbright ripeningHere someone produces a bodily process both with affliction and not with affliction verbal process mental process both with affliction and not with afflictionBy doing so he reappears in a world both with and without afflictionWhen that happens both afflicting and unafflicting contacts touch himBeing touched by these he feels afflicting and unafflicting feelings with mingled pleasure and pain as in the case of human beings and some gods and some inhabitants of the states of deprivationThus a beings reappearance is due to a being he reappears owing to the kammas he has performedWhen he has reappeared contacts touch himThus I say are beings heirs of their

in abandoning the kind of kamma that is dark with dark ripening any volition in abandoning the kind of kamma that is bright with bright ripening and any volition in abandoning the kind of kamma that is darkand bright with darkandbright ripening this is called neitherdarknorbright kamma with neitherdarknorbright ripeningThese are the four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after realization myself with direct knowledgeWhen this was said Punna a son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master GotamaMagnificent Master GotamaThe Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing the hidden showing the way to one who is lost holding up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see formsI go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusFrom today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeBut Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic said Magnificent Master Gotama The Dhamma has been made clear for those with eyesight to see formsI go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusI would receive the going forth under Master Gotama and the full admissionSeniya one who belonged formerly to another sect and wants the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline lives on probation for four monthsAt the end of the four months bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give him the going forth into homelessness and also the full admission to the bhikkhus stateA difference in persons has become known to me in thisVenerable sir if those who belonged formerly to another sect and want the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live on probation for four months and at the end of four months bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give them the going forth into homelessness and the full admission to the bhikkhus state I will live on probation for four years and at the end of the four years let bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give me the going forth into homelessness and the full admission to the bhikkhus stateSeniya the naked dog duty ascetic received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admissionAnd not long after his full admission dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and selfcontrolled the venerable Seniya by realization himself with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abode in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessnessHe had direct knowledge thus Birth is exhausted the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more of this to comeAnd

qualitiesThis is how a monk is consummate in strengthAnd how is a monk consummate in speedThere is the case where a monk discerns as it actually is present that This is stress He discerns as it actually is present that This is the origination of stress He discerns as it actually is present that This is the cessation of stress He discerns as it actually is present that This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is how a monk is consummate in speedEndowed with these three qualities is a monk worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of

 wellharrowedHaving quickly gotten his field wellplowed  wellharrowed he quickly plants the seedHaving quickly planted the seed he quickly lets in the water  then lets it outThese are the three urgent duties of a farming householderNow that farming householder does not have the power or might May my crops spring up today may the grains appear tomorrow and may they ripen the next day But when the time has come the farming householders crops spring up the grains appear and they ripenIn the same way there are these three urgent duties of a monkWhich threeThe undertaking of heightened virtue the undertaking of heightened mind the undertaking of heightened discernmentThese are the three urgent duties of a monkNow that monk does not have the power or might May my mind be released from fermentations through lack of clingingsustenance today or tomorrow or the next day But when the time has come his mind is released from fermentations through lack of clingingsustenanceThus monks you

rules I tell you are not in vainThe Commentary defines this category and the following one with this example Suppose that a nonreturner appears spontaneously in the Aviha Pure Abode where the lifespan is eonsIf heshe attains unbinding after the first eons heshe is classed as one unbound on arrivalIf heshe attains unbinding anywhere from between the first day in that Pure Abode up through the first eons heshe is classed as one unbound in betweenFor a nonreturner appearing spontaneously in any of the higher Pure Abodes where the lifespans get progressively longer the same proportions would holdThis way of classifying these two categories however doesnt make much sense for two reasonsThe sutta lists the categories in ascending order and theres little reason to class one who takes eons to attain unbinding higher than one who takes only eons to do soThe second category actually includes the first so there would seem to be little reason to distinguish them as two separate categoriesIt would make better sense to define the categories this way One who attains unbinding relatively soon after arriving in a Pure Abode is one unbound on arrivalOne who attains unbinding after leaving the human realm but before reaching a Pure Abode would be one unbound in betweenMonks this recitation of more than training rules comes every fortnight in reference to which sons of good families desiring

reference to the three trainings the training in heightened virtue the training in heightened mind the training in heightened discernment Yes lord I can train in reference to the three trainings the training in heightened virtue the training in heightened mind the training in heightened discernmentThen train in reference to those three trainings the training in heightened virtue the training in heightened mind the training in heightened discernmentAs you train in heightened virtue heightened mind  heightened discernment your passion aversion  delusion  when trained in heightened virtue heightened mind  heightened discernment  will be abandonedYou  with the abandoning of passion the abandoning of aversion the abandoning of delusion  will not do anything unskillful or engage in any evilLater on that monk trained in reference to heightened virtue heightened mind  heightened discernmentHis passion aversion  delusion  when trained in heightened virtue heightened mind  heightened discernment were abandonedHe  with the abandoning of passion the abandoning of aversion the abandoning of delusion  did not do anything unskillful or engage in any evilMonks it is just as if a donkey were following right after a herd of cattle saying I too am a cowI too am a cow Its color is not that of a cow its voice is not that of a cow its hoof is not that of a cow and yet it still keeps following right after the herd of cattle saying I too am a cowI too am a cow In the same way there is the case where a certain monk follows right after the community of monks saying I too am a monkI too am a monk He doesnt have the other monks desire for undertaking the training in heightened virtue doesnt have their desire for undertaking the training in heightened mind doesnt have their desire for undertaking the training in heightened discernment and yet he still keeps following right after the community of monks saying I too am a monkI too am a monkSo you should train yourselves Strong

auspicious way to the abandoning of that passion aversion  delusion  enough for the sake of heedfulnessMonks there are these three roots of what is unskillfulWhich threeGreed is a root of what is unskillful aversion is a root of what is unskillful delusion is a root of what is unskillfulGreed itself is unskillfulWhatever a greedy person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is unskillfulWhatever suffering a greedy person  his mind overcome with greed his mind consumed  wrongly inflicts on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment I have powerI want power that too is unskillfulThus it is that many evil unskillful qualitiesevents  born of greed caused by greed originated through greed conditioned by greed  come into playAversion itself is unskillfulWhatever an aversive person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is unskillfulWhatever suffering an aversive person  his mind overcome with aversion his mind consumed  wrongly inflicts on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment I have powerI want power that too is unskillfulThus it is that many evil unskillful qualities  born of aversion caused by aversion originated through aversion conditioned by aversion  come into playDelusion itself is unskillfulWhatever a deluded person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is unskillfulWhatever suffering a deluded person  his mind overcome with delusion his mind consumed  wrongly inflicts on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment I have powerI want power that too is unskillfulThus it is that many evil unskillful qualities  born of delusion caused by delusion originated through delusion conditioned by delusion  come into playAnd a person like this is called one who speaks at the wrong time speaks what is unfactual speaks what is irrelevant speaks contrary to the Dhamma speaks contrary to the VinayaWhyBecause of having wrongly inflicted suffering on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment I have powerI want power When told what is factual he denies it and doesnt acknowledge itWhen told what is unfactual he doesnt make an ardent effort to untangle it This is unfactualThis is baseless Thats why a person like this is called one who speaks at the wrong time speaks what is unfactual speaks what is irrelevant speaks contrary to the Dhamma speaks contrary to the VinayaA person like this  his mind overcome with evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion his mind consumed  dwells in suffering right in the herenow  feeling threatened turbulent feverish  and at the breakup of the body after death can expect a bad destinationJust as a sal tree a birch or an aspen when smothered  surrounded by three parasitic vines falls into misfortune falls into disaster falls into misfortune  disaster in the same way a person like this  his mind overcome with evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion his mind consumed  dwells in suffering right in the herenow  feeling threatened turbulent feverish  and at the breakup of the body after death can expect a bad destinationThese are the three roots of what is unskillfulNow there are these three roots of what is skillfulWhich threeLack of greed is a root of what is skillful lack of aversion is a root of what is skillful lack of delusion is a root of what is skillfulLack of greed itself is skillfulWhatever an ungreedy person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is skillfulWhatever suffering an ungreedy person  his mind not overcome with greed his mind not consumed  does not wrongly inflict on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment I have powerI want power that too is skillfulThus it is that many skillful qualities  born of lack of greed caused by lack of greed originated through lack of greed conditioned by lack of greed  come into playLack of aversion itself is skillfulLack of delusion itself is skillfulWhatever an undeluded person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is skillfulWhatever suffering an undeluded person  his mind not overcome with delusion his mind not consumed  does not wrongly inflict on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment I have powerI want power that too is skillfulThus it is that many skillful qualities  born of lack of delusion caused by lack of delusion originated through lack of delusion conditioned by lack of delusion  come into playAnd a person like this is called one who speaks at the right time speaks what is factual speaks what is relevant speaks in line with the Dhamma speaks in line with the VinayaWhyBecause of not having wrongly inflicted suffering on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment I have powerI want power When told what is factual he acknowledges it and does not deny itWhen told what is unfactual he makes an ardent effort to untangle it This is unfactualThis is baseless Thats why a person like this is called one who speaks at the right time speaks what is factual speaks what is relevant speaks in line with the Dhamma speaks in line with the VinayaIn a person like this evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingHe dwells in ease right in the herenow  feeling unthreatened placid unfeverish  and is unbound right in the herenowJust as if there were a sal tree a birch or an aspen smothered  surrounded by three parasitic vinesA man would come along carrying a spade  a basketHe would cut the vines at the root and having cut them at the root would dig around themHaving dug around them he would pull them out even down to the rootletsHe would cut the stalks of the vinesHaving cut them he would slice them into splintersHaving sliced them into splinters he would pound them into bitsHaving pounded them into bits he would dry them in the wind  sunHaving dried them in the wind  sun he would burn them in a fireHaving burned them in a fire he would reduce them to powdered ashHaving reduced them to powdered ash he would winnow them before a high wind or let them be washed away in a swiftflowing streamIn that way the parasitic vines would have their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingIn the same way in a person like this evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingHe dwells in ease right in the herenow  feeling unthreatened placid unfeverish  and is unbound right in the herenowThese are the three roots of what is skillfulI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migaras motherNow at that time  it being the Uposatha day  Visakha Migaras mother went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her Well now Visakha why are you coming in the middle of the dayToday I am observing the Uposatha lordVisakha there are these three UposathasWhich threeThe Uposatha of a cowherd the Uposatha of the Jains and the Uposatha of the Noble OnesAnd what is the Uposatha of a cowherdJust as when a cowherd returns the cattle to their owners in the evening he reflects Today the cattle wandered to that spot and this drank at this spot and that tomorrow they will wander to that spot and this will drink at this spot and that in the same way there is the case where a certain person observing the Uposatha reflects Today I ate this sort of nonstaple food and that sort of staple foodTomorrow I will eat that sort of nonstaple food and this sort of staple food He spends the day with an awareness imbued with that covetousness with that greedSuch is the Uposatha of a cowherd VisakhaWhen this Uposatha of a cowherd is undertaken it is not of great fruit or great benefit not of great glory or great radianceAnd what is the Uposatha of the JainsThere are the contemplatives called the NiganthasThey get their disciple to undertake the following practice Here my good manLay down the rod with regard to beings who live more than leagues to the east more than leagues to the west more than leagues to the north more than leagues to the south Thus they get the disciple to undertake kindness  sympathy to some beings but not to othersOn the Uposatha day they get their disciple to undertake the following practice Here my good manHaving stripped off all your clothing say this I am nothing by anything or of anythingThus there is nothing by anything or of anything that is mine Yet in spite of that his parents know of him that This is our child And he knows of them that These are my parents His wives  children know of him that This is our husband  father And he knows of them that These are my wives  children His workers  slaves know of him that This is our master And he knows of them that These are my workers  slaves Thus at a time when he should be persuaded to undertake truthfulness he is persuaded to undertake falsehoodAt the end of the night he resumes the consumption of his belongings even though they arent given back to himThis counts as stealing I tell youSuch is the Uposatha of the Jains VisakhaWhen this Uposatha of the Jains is undertaken it is not of great fruit or great benefit not of great glory or great radianceAnd what is the Uposatha of the Noble OnesIt is the cleansing of the defiled mind through the proper techniqueAnd how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper techniqueThere is the case where the disciple of the noble ones recollects the Tathagata thus Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world

mind is cleansed through the proper technique is the cleansing of the defiled mind through the proper techniqueAnd how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper techniqueThere is the case where the disciple of the noble ones recollects the devas thus There are the Devas of the Four Great Kings the Devas of the Thirtythree the Yama Devas the Contented Devas the devas who delight in creation the devas who have power over the creations of others the devas of Brahmas retinue the devas beyond themWhatever conviction they were endowed with that  when falling away from this life  they rearose

when compared with heavenly blissI have heard that on one occasion VenAnanda was staying in Kosambi at Ghositas monasteryThen a certain householder a disciple of the Fatalists went to him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenAnanda Among us sir whose Dhamma is welltaughtWho has practiced well in this worldWho in the world is wellgoneIn that case householder I will question you in returnAnswer as you see fitNow what do you think those who teach a Dhamma for the abandoning of passion for the abandoning of aversion for the abandoning

stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingYou in this world are wellgoneMagnificent Master AnandaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Ananda  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Buddha for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksMay Master Ananda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for lifeUposatha days are times of renewed dedication to Dhamma practice observed by lay followers and monastics throughout the world of Theravada BuddhismFor monastics these are often days of more intensive reflection and meditationIn many monasteries physical labor is curtailedOn New Moon and Full Moon days the fortnightly confession and recitation of the Bhikkhu Patimokkha takes placeLay people observe the Eight Precepts on Uposatha days as a support for meditation practice and as a way to reenergize commitment to the DhammaWhenever possible lay people use these days as an opportunity to visit the local monastery in order to make special offerings to the Sangha to listen to Dhamma and to practice meditation with Dhamma companions late into the nightFor those not closely affiliated with a local monastery it can simply be an opportunity to step up ones efforts in meditation while drawing on the invisible support of millions of other practicing Buddhists around the worldThe calendar of Uposatha days is calculated using a complex traditional formula that is loosely based on the lunar calendar with the result that the dates do not always coincide with the actual astronomical datesTo further complicate matters each sect within Theravada Buddhism tends to follow a slightly different calendarSeveral fullmoon Uposatha days hold special significance in the Buddhist calendarI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan ParkNow at that time the Blessed One had just recovered from being ill was not long recovered from his illnessThen Mahanama the Sakyan went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One For a long time I have known the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One that There is knowledge for one who is concentrated not for one who is not concentrated Now does concentration come first and knowledge after or does knowledge come first and concentration afterThen the thought occurred to VenAnanda Here the Blessed One has just recovered from being ill is not long recovered from his illness and yet Mahanama the Sakyan asks him this very deep questionWhat if I were to take Mahanama the Sakyan to one side and teach him the Dhamma So VenAnanda taking Mahanama the Sakyan by the arm led him to one side and said to him Mahanama the Blessed One has talked both of the virtue of one who is in training and of the virtue of one whose training is completeHe has talked both of the concentration of one who is in training and of the concentration of one whose training is completeHe has talked both of the discernment of one who is in training and of the discernment of one whose training is completeAnd what is the virtue of one who is in trainingThere is the case where a monk is virtuousHe dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in his behavior  sphere of activityHe trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faultThis is called the virtue of one who is in trainingAnd what is the concentration of one who is in trainingThere is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painThis is called the concentration of one who is in trainingAnd what is the discernment of one who is in trainingThere is the case where a monk discerns as it actually is that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called the discernment of one who is in trainingThen there is the disciple of the noble ones  thus consummate in virtue thus consummate in concentration thus consummate in discernment  who through the ending of the mental fermentations enters  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having known  made them manifest for himself right in the here  nowIn this way Mahanama the Blessed One has talked both of the virtue of one who is in training and of the virtue of one whose training is completeHe has talked both of the concentration of one who is in training and of the concentration of one whose training is completeHe has talked both of the discernment of one who is in training and of the discernment of one whose training is completeMonks if you are asked by wanderers of other sects Friends there are these three qualitiesWhich threePassion aversion  delusionThese are the three qualitiesNow what is the difference what the distinction what the distinguishing factor among these three qualities  when thus asked how would you answer those wanderers of other sectsFor us lord the teachings have the Blessed One as their root their guide  their arbitratorIt would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statementHaving heard it from the Blessed One the monks will remember itIn that case monks listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said Monks if you are asked by wanderers of other sects Friends there are these three qualitiesWhich threePassion aversion  delusionThese are the three qualitiesNow what is the difference what the distinction what the distinguishing factor among these three qualities  when thus asked you should answer those wanderers of other sects in this way Friends passion carries little blame and is slow to fadeAversion carries great blame and is quick to fadeDelusion carries great blame and is slow to fade But what friends is the reason what the cause

heardOn one occasion the venerable Nandaka was living at Savatthi in the Eastern Monastery Migaras Mothers PalaceThen Migaras grandson Salha and Pekhuniyas grandson Rohana went to the venerable Nandaka and after salutation they sat down at one sideWhen they had done so the venerable Nandaka said to Migaras grandson SalhaCome Salha do not be satisfied with hearsay or with tradition or with legendary lore or with what has come down in scriptures or with conjecture or with logical inference or with weighing evidence or with a liking for a view after pondering it or with someone elses ability or with the thought The monk is our teacher When you know in yourself These things are unprofitable liable to censure condemned by the wise being adopted and put into effect they lead to harm and suffering then you should abandon themWhat do you thinkIs there greed  Yes venerable sir  Covetousness is the meaning of that I sayThrough greed a covetous man kills breathing things takes what is not given commits adultery and utters falsehood and he gets another to do likewiseWill that be long for his harm and suffering  Yes venerable sir  What do you think is there hate  Yes venerable sir  Illwill is the meaning of that I sayThrough hate a malevolent man kills breathing things Will that be long for his harm and suffering  Yes venerable sir  What do you thinkIs there delusion  Yes

things profitable or unprofitable  Unprofitable venerable sir  Reprehensible or blameless  Reprehensible venerable sir  Condemned or commended by the wise  Condemned by the wise venerable sir  Being adopted and put into effect do they lead to harm and suffering or do they not or how does it appear to you in this case  Being adopted and put into effect venerable sir they lead to harm and sufferingSo it appears in this case  Now that was the reason why I told you Come Salha do not be satisfied with hearsay When you know in yourself These things are unprofitable then you should abandon themCome Salha do not be satisfied with hearsay or with the thought The monk is our teacher When you know in yourself These things are profitable blameless commended by the wise being adopted and put into effect they lead to welfare and happiness then you should practice them and abide in themWhat do you thinkIs there nongreed  Yes venerable sir  Uncovetousness is the meaning of that I sayThrough nongreed an uncovetous man does not kill breathing things or take what is not given or commit adultery or utter falsehood and he gets another to do likewiseWill that be long for his welfare and happiness  Yes venerable sir  What do you thinkIs there nonhate  Yes venerable sir  Non illwill is the meaning of that I sayThrough non illwill an unmalevolent man does not kill breathing things Will

told you Come Salha do not be satisfied with hearsay when you know in yourself These things are profitable then you should practice them and abide in themNow a disciple who is ennobled who has rid himself in this way of covetousness and illwill and is undeluded abides with his heart imbued with lovingkindness extending over one quarter likewise the second quarter likewise the third quarter likewise the fourth quarter and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides with his heart abundant exalted measureless in lovingkindness without hostility or illwill extending over the allencompassing worldHe abides with his heart imbued with compassion gladness equanimity extending over the allencompassing worldNow he understands this state of contemplation in this way There is thisThere is what has been abandonedThere is a superior goalAnd there is an ultimate escape from this whole field of perceptionWhen he knows and sees in this way his heart is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignoranceWhen liberated there comes thereafter the knowledge that it is liberatedHe knows that birth is ended that the Divine Life has been lived out that what had to be done is done and that there is no more of this to comeHe understands thus Formerly there was greed which was bad and now there is none which is goodFormerly there was hate which was bad and now there is none which is goodFormerly there was delusion which was bad and now there is none which is good So here and now in this very life he is parched no more his fires of greed hate and delusion are extinguished and cooled out experiencing bliss he abides divinely pure in himselfMonks uneducated runofthemill people describe three things as

saidTranslators note Although this discourse is often cited as the Buddhas carte blanche for following ones own sense of right and wrong it actually says something much more rigorous than thatTraditions are not to be followed simply because they are traditionsReports are not to be followed simply because the source seems reliableOnes own preferences are not to be followed simply because they seem logical or resonate with ones feelingsInstead any view or belief must be tested by the results it yields when put into practice and  to guard against the possibility of any bias or limitations in ones understanding of those results  they must further be checked against the experience of people who are wiseThe ability to question and test ones beliefs in an appropriate way is called appropriate attentionThe ability to recognize and choose wise people as mentors is called having admirable friendsAccording to Iti  these are respectively the most important internal and external factors for attaining the goal of the practiceFor further thoughts on how to test a belief in practice see MN MN AN and ANFor thoughts on how to judge whether another person is wise see MN AN and ANI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks arrived at Kesaputta a town of the KalamasThe Kalamas of Kesaputta heard

Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings

has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pureIt is good to see such a worthy one So the Kalamas of Kesaputta went to the Blessed OneOn arrival some of them bowed down to him and sat to one sideSome of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one sideSome of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palmtopalm over their heartsSome of them sat to one side having announced their name  clanSome of them sat to one side in silenceAs they sat there the Kalamas of Kesaputta said to the Blessed One Lord there are some brahmans  contemplatives who come to KesaputtaThey expound  glorify their own doctrines but as for the doctrines of others they deprecate them revile them show contempt for them  disparage themAnd then other brahmans  contemplatives come to KesaputtaThey expound  glorify their own doctrines but as for the doctrines of others they deprecate them revile them show contempt for them  disparage themThey leave us absolutely uncertain  in doubt Which of these venerable brahmans  contemplatives are speaking the truth and which ones are lyingOf course you are uncertain KalamasOf course you are in doubtWhen there are reasons for doubt uncertainty is bornSo in this case Kalamas dont go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought This contemplative is our teacher When you know for yourselves that These qualities are unskillful these qualities are blameworthy these qualities are criticized by the wise these qualities when adopted  carried out lead to harm  to suffering  then you should abandon themWhat do you think KalamasWhen greed arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harmFor harm lordAnd this greedy person overcome by greed his mind possessed by greed kills living beings takes what is not given goes after another persons wife tells lies and induces others to do likewise all of which is for longterm harm  sufferingYes lordNow what do you think KalamasWhen aversion arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harmFor harm lordAnd this aversive person overcome by aversion his mind possessed by aversion kills living beings takes what is not given goes after another persons wife tells lies and induces others to do likewise all of which is for longterm harm  sufferingYes

place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearWe go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monksMay the Blessed One remember us as lay followers who have gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeSee alsoSuppose a dog overcome with weakness  hunger were to come across a slaughterhouse and there a dexterous butcher or butchers apprentice were to fling him a chain of bones  thoroughly scraped without any flesh smeared with bloodWhat do you think Would the dog gnawing on that chain of bones  thoroughly scraped without any flesh smeared with blood  appease its weakness  hungerNo lordAnd why is thatBecause the chain of bones is thoroughly scraped without any flesh  smeared with bloodThe dog would get nothing but its share of weariness  vexationIn the same way householder a disciple of the noble ones considers this point The Blessed One has compared sensuality to a chain of bones of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks Seeing

would occur to him This is a tree with delicious fruit abundant fruit and there is no fruit fallen to the ground but I know how to climb a treeWhy dont I climb the tree eat what I like and fill my

Venerable Ananda just as if a man seeking a single opening onto treasure were all at once to come upon eleven openings onto treasure in the same way I  seeking a single doorway to the Deathless  have all at once come to hear of eleven doorways to the DeathlessAnd just as if a man whose house had eleven doors could take himself to safety by means of any one of those doors in the same way I can take

the householder from Atthakanagara having assembled the community of monks from Vesali and Pataliputta with his own hands served  satisfied them with refined staple  nonstaple foodsHe presented a pair of cloths to each monk and a triple robe to VenAnandaAnd for VenAnanda he had a dwelling built worth five hundredTranslators note The Buddha praised Dhammadinna the nun as the foremost Dhamma teacher among his nun disciplesIn this discourse she answers questions put to her by a layman  Visakha  who according to the commentary was her former husband a merchant of Rajagaha and a nonreturnerI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryThen Visakha the lay follower went to Dhammadinna the nun and on arrival having bowed down to her sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to her Selfidentification selfidentification it is said ladyWhich selfidentification is described by the Blessed OneThere are these five clingingaggregates friend Visakha form as a clingingaggregate feeling as a clingingaggregate perception as a clingingaggregate fabrications as a clingingaggregate consciousness as a clingingaggregateThese five clingingaggregates are the selfidentification described by the Blessed OneSaying Yes lady Visakha the lay follower delighted  rejoiced in what Dhammadinna the nun had saidThen he asked her a further question The origination of selfidentification the origination of selfidentification it is said ladyWhich origination of selfidentification is described by the Blessed OneThe craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming This friend Visakha is the origination of selfidentification described by the Blessed OneThe cessation of selfidentification the cessation of selfidentification it is said ladyWhich cessation of selfidentification is described by the Blessed OneThe remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very craving This friend Visakha is the cessation of selfidentification described by the Blessed OneThe way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentification the way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentification it is said ladyWhich way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentification is described by the Blessed OnePrecisely this noble eightfold path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration This friend Visakha is the way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentification described by the Blessed OneIs it the case lady that clinging is the same thing as the five clingingaggregates or is it something separateFriend Visakha neither is clinging the same thing as the five clingingaggregates nor is it something separateWhatever desire  passion there is with regard to the five clingingaggregates that is the clinging thereBut lady how does selfidentification come aboutThere is the case friend Visakha where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe assumes feeling to be the selfHe assumes perception to be the selfHe assumes fabrications to be the selfHe assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessThis is how selfidentification comes aboutBut lady how does selfidentification not come aboutThere is the case where a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe does not assume feeling to be the selfHe does not assume perception to be the selfHe does not assume fabrications to be the selfHe does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessThis is how selfidentification does not come aboutNow again lady what is the noble eightfold pathThis is the noble eightfold path friend Visakha right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationIs the noble eightfold path fabricated or unfabricatedThe noble eightfold path is fabricatedAnd are the three aggregates included under the noble eightfold path lady or is the noble eightfold path included under the three aggregatesThe three aggregates are not included under the noble eightfold path friend Visakha but the noble eightfold path is included under the three aggregatesRight speech right action  right livelihood come under the aggregate of virtueRight effort right mindfulness  right concentration come under the aggregate of concentrationRight view  right resolve come under the aggregate of discernmentNow what is concentration lady what qualities are its themes what qualities are its requisites and what is its developmentSingleness of mind is concentration friend Visakha the four frames of reference are its themes the four right exertions are its requisites and any cultivation development  pursuit of these qualities is its developmentNow lady what are fabricationsThese three fabrications friend Visakha bodily fabrications verbal fabrications  mental fabricationsBut what are bodily fabricationsWhat are verbal fabricationsWhat are mental fabricationsInout breaths are bodily fabricationsDirected thought  evaluation are verbal fabricationsPerceptions  feelings are mental fabricationsBut why are inout breaths bodily fabricationsWhy are directed thought  evaluation verbal fabricationsWhy are perceptions  feelings mental fabricationsInout breaths are bodily these are things tied up with the bodyThats why inout breaths are bodily fabricationsHaving first directed ones thoughts and made an evaluation one then breaks out into speechThats why directed thought  evaluation are verbal fabricationsPerceptions  feelings are mental these are things tied up with the mindThats why perceptions  feelings are mental fabricationsNow lady how does the attainment of the cessation of perception  feeling come aboutThe thought does not occur to a monk as he is attaining the cessation of perception  feeling that I am about to attain the cessation of perception  feeling or that I am attaining the cessation of perception  feeling or that I have attained the cessation of perception  feeling Instead the way his mind has previously been developed leads him to that stateBut when a monk is attaining the cessation of perception  feeling which things cease first bodily fabrications verbal fabrications or mental fabricationsWhen a monk is attaining the cessation of perception  feeling friend Visakha verbal fabrications cease first then bodily fabrications then mental fabricationsNow lady how does emergence from the cessation of perception  feeling come aboutThe thought does not occur to a monk as he is emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling that I am about to emerge from the cessation of perception  feeling or that I am emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling or that I have emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling Instead the way his mind has previously been developed leads him to that stateBut when a monk is emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling which things arise first bodily fabrications verbal fabrications or mental fabricationsWhen a monk is emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling friend Visakha mental fabrications arise first then bodily fabrications then verbal fabricationsWhen a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling lady how many contacts make contactWhen a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling friend Visakha three contacts make contact contact with emptiness contact with the signless  contact with the undirectedWhen a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling lady to what does his mind lean to what does it tend to what does it inclineWhen a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling friend Visakha his mind leans to seclusion tends to seclusion inclines to seclusionNow lady how many kinds of feeling are thereThese three kinds of feeling pleasant feeling painful feeling  neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingWhat is pleasant feelingWhat is painful feelingWhat is neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingWhatever is experienced physically or mentally as pleasant  gratifying is pleasant feelingWhatever is experienced physically or mentally as painful  hurting is painful feelingWhatever is experienced physically or mentally as neither gratifying nor hurting is neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingIn what way is pleasant feeling pleasant lady and in what way painfulPleasant feeling is pleasant in remaining  painful in changing friend VisakhaPainful feeling is painful in remaining  pleasant in changingNeitherpleasantnorpainful feeling is pleasant in occurring together with knowledge and painful in occurring without knowledgeWhat obsession gets obsessed with pleasant feelingWhat obsession gets obsessed with painful feelingWhat obsession gets obsessed with neitherpleasantnorpainful feelingPassionobsession

friend VisakhaYou cant keep holding on up to the limit of questionsFor the holy life gains a footing in Unbinding culminates in Unbinding has Unbinding as its final endIf you wish go to the Blessed One and ask him the meaning of these thingsWhatever he says thats how you should remember itThen Visakha the lay follower delighting  rejoicing in what Dhammadinna the nun had said bowed down to her and keeping her to his right went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he told the Blessed One the full extent of the conversation he had had with Dhammadinna the nunWhen this was said the Blessed One said to him Dhammadinna the nun is wise Visakha a woman of great discernmentIf you had asked me those things I would have answered you in the same way she didThat is the meaning of those thingsThat is how you should remember itThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified Visakha the lay follower delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsFor some reason the editors of neither edition seem to have been aware of the reading in the other editionI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks repliedMonks there are these four ways of taking on practicesWhich fourThere is the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present but yields pain in the futureThere is the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present and yields pain in the futureThere is the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present but yields pleasure in the futureThere is the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present and yields pleasure in the futureNow what is the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present but yields pain in the futureThere are some brahmans  contemplatives who hold to a doctrine a view like this There is no harm in sensual pleasures Thus they meet with their downfall through sensual pleasuresThey consort with women wanderers who wear their hair coiled in a topknotThe thought occurs to them Now what future danger concerning sensual pleasures do those brahmans  contemplatives foresee that they have spoken of the relinquishment of sensual pleasures and describe the full comprehension of sensual pleasuresIts pleasant the touch of this woman wanderers soft tender downy armThus they meet with their downfall through sensual pleasuresThen having met with their downfall through sensual pleasures with the breakup of the body after death they go to a bad bourn destitution the realm of the hungry shades hellThere they experience sharp burning painsThey say This was the future danger concerning sensual pleasures those brahmans  contemplatives foresaw that they spoke of the relinquishment of sensual pleasures and described the full comprehension of sensual pleasuresIts because of sensual pleasures as a result of sensual pleasures that were now experiencing these sharp burning painsJust as if a maluva creeper pod were to burst open in the last month of the hot season and a maluva creeper seed were to fall at the foot of a sala treeThe deva living in the tree would become frightened apprehensive  anxiousHer friends  companions relatives  kin  garden devas forest devas tree devas devas living in herbs grass  forest monarchs  would gather together to console her Have no fear have no fearIn all likelihood a peacock is sure to swallow this maluva creeper seed or a deer will eat it or a brush fire will burn it up or woodsmen will pick it up or termites will carry it off and anyway it probably isnt really a seedAnd then no peacock swallowed it no deer ate it no brush fire burned it up no woodsmen picked it up no termites carried it off and it really was a seedWatered by a rainladen cloud it sprouted in due course and curled its soft tender downy tendril around the sala treeThe thought occurred to the deva living in the sala tree Now what future danger did my friends  companions relatives  kin  garden devas forest devas tree devas devas living in herbs grass  forest monarchs  foresee in that maluva creeper seed that they gathered together to console me Have no fear have no fearIn all likelihood a peacock is sure to swallow this maluva creeper seed or a deer will eat it or a brush fire will burn it up or woodsmen will pick it up or termites will carry it off and anyway it probably isnt really a seed Its pleasant the touch of this maluva creepers soft tender downy tendrilThen the creeper having enwrapped the sala tree having made a canopy over it  cascading down around it caused the massive limbs of the sala tree to come crashing downThe thought occurred to the deva living in the tree This was the future danger my friends foresaw in that maluva creeper seed that they gathered together to console me Its because of that maluva creeper seed that Im now experiencing sharp burning painsIn the same way monks there are some brahmans  contemplatives who hold to a doctrine a view like this There is no harm in sensual pleasures Thus they meet with their downfall through sensual pleasuresThey consort with women wanderers who wear their hair coiled in a topknotThe thought occurs to them Now what future danger do those brahmans  contemplatives foresee that they teach the relinquishment  analysis of sensual pleasuresIts pleasant the touch of this woman wanderers soft tender downy armThus they meet with their downfall through sensual pleasuresThen having met with their downfall through sensual pleasures with the breakup of the body after death they go to a bad bourn destitution the realm of the hungry shades hellThere they experience sharp burning painsThey say This was the future danger concerning sensual pleasures those brahmans  contemplatives foresaw that they spoke of the relinquishment of sensual pleasures and described the full comprehension of sensual pleasuresIts because of sensual pleasures as a result of sensual pleasures that were now experiencing these sharp burning painsThis is called the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present but yields pain in the futureAnd what is the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present and yields pain in the futureThere is the case where someone is a clothless ascetic rejecting conventions licking his hands not coming when asked not staying when askedHe doesnt consent to food brought to him or food dedicated to him or to an invitation to a mealHe accepts nothing from the mouth of a pot or from the mouth of a bowlHe accepts nothing from across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a nursing woman from a woman lying with a man from a food collection from where a dog is waiting or flies are buzzingHe takes no fish or meatHe drinks no liquor wine or fermented drinkHe limits himself to one house  one morsel a day or two houses  two morsels seven houses  seven morselsHe lives on one saucerful a day two seven saucerfuls a dayHe takes food once a day once every two days once every seven days and so on up to a fortnight devoted to regulating his intake of foodHe is an eater of greens millet wild rice hideparings moss rice bran ricescum sesame flour grass or cow dungHe lives on forest roots  berriesHe feeds on fallen fruitsHe wears hemp canvas shrouds refuse rags tree bark antelope hide strips of antelope hide kusagrass garments bark garments woodshaving garments headhair garments animal wool owls wingsHe is a hairbeard puller one devoted to the practice of pulling out his hair  beardHe is a stander one who rejects seatsHe is a handsaroundtheknees sitter one devoted to the exertion of sitting with his hands around his kneesHe is a spikemattresser one who makes his bed on a bed of spikesHe is a thirdtimeintheevening bather one who stays devoted to the practice of bathing in waterThus in a variety of ways he stays devoted to the practice of tormenting  afflicting the bodyWith the breakup of the body after death he goes to a bad bourn destitution the realm of the hungry shades hellThis is called the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present and yields pain in the futureAnd what is the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present but yields pleasure in the futureThere is the case of a person who is normally strongly passionate by nature and frequently experiences pain  grief born of passion a person who is normally strongly aversive by nature and frequently experiences pain  grief born of aversion a person who is normally strongly deluded by nature and frequently experiences pain  grief born of delusionEven though touched with pain  grief crying with a tearful face he lives the holy life that is utterly perfect surpassingly pureWith the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the good bourn the heavenly worldThis is called the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present but yields pleasure in the futureAnd what is the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present and yields pleasure in the futureThere is the case of a person who is not normally strongly passionate by nature and doesnt frequently experience pain  grief born of passion who is not normally strongly aversive by nature and doesnt frequently experience pain  grief born of aversion who is not normally strongly deluded by nature and doesnt frequently experience pain  grief born of delusionQuite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities he enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painWith the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the good bourn the heavenly worldThis is called the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present and yields pleasure in the futureAnd these are the four ways of taking on practicesThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan ParkNow at that time a new reception hall had just been built by the Kapilavatthu Sakyans and it had not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative brahman or anyone at all in human formSo the Kapilavatthu Sakyans went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to him Lord a new reception hall has just been built by the Kapilavatthu Sakyans and it has not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative brahman or anyone at all in human formMay the Blessed One be the first to use itWhen the Blessed One has used it first the Kapilavatthu Sakyans will use it afterwardsThat will be for their longterm welfare  happinessThe Blessed One acquiesced with silenceSensing his acquiescence the Kapilavatthu Sakyans got up from their seats bowed down to him circumambulated him and then went to the new reception hallOn arrival they spread it all over with felt rugs arranged seats set out a water vessel and raised an oil lampThen they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down stood to one sideAs they were standing there they said to him Lord the reception hall has been covered all over with felt rugs seats have been arranged a water vessel has been set out and an oil lamp raisedIt is now time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fitSo the Blessed One putting on his robe and taking up his bowl  outer robe went together with a community of monks to the reception hallOn arrival he washed his feet entered the hall and sat with his back to the central post facing eastThe community of monks washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the western wall facing east ranged around the Blessed OneThe Kapilavatthu Sakyans washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the eastern wall facing west ranged around the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One  having spent most of the night instructing urging rousing  encouraging the Kapilavatthu Sakyans with a Dhamma talk  said to VenAnanda Ananda speak to the Kapilavatthu Sakyans about the person who follows the practice for one in trainingMy back achesI will rest itVenAnanda responded As you say lordThen the Blessed One having arranged his outer robe folded in four lay down on his right side in the lions sleeping posture with one foot on top of the other mindful  alert having made a mental note to get upThen VenAnanda addressed Mahanama the Sakyan There is the case Mahanama where a disciple of the noble ones is consummate in virtue guards the doors to his sense faculties knows moderation in eating is devoted to wakefulness is endowed with seven qualities and obtains at will  without trouble or difficulty  the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the herenowAnd how is the disciple of the noble ones consummate in virtueThere is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is virtuousHe dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in his behavior  sphere of activityHe trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faultsThis is how the disciple of the noble ones is consummate in virtueAnd how does the disciple of the noble ones guard the doors to his sense facultiesThere is the case where the disciple of the noble ones on seeing a form with the eye doesnt grasp at any theme or variations by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himHe practices for its restraintHe guards the faculty of the eyeHe achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eyeOn hearing a sound with the earOn smelling an aroma with the noseOn tasting a flavor with the tongueOn feeling a tactile sensation with the bodyOn cognizing an idea with the intellect he doesnt grasp at any theme or variations by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himHe practices for its restraintHe guards the faculty of the intellectHe achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellectThis is how the disciple of the noble ones guards the doors to his sense facultiesAnd how does the disciple of the noble ones know moderation in eatingThere is the case where the disciple of the noble ones considering it appropriately takes his food not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival  continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking I will destroy old feelings  not create new feelingsThus I will maintain myself be blameless  live in comfort This is how the disciple of the noble ones knows moderation in eatingAnd how is the disciple of the noble ones devoted to wakefulnessThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones sitting  pacing back  forth cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in checkDuring the first watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in checkDuring the second watch of the night reclining on his right side he takes up the lions posture one foot placed on top of the other mindful alert with his mind set on getting upDuring the last watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in checkThis is how the monk is devoted to wakefulnessAnd how is the disciple of the noble ones endowed with seven qualities There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones has conviction is convinced of the Tathagatas Awakening Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in clearknowing  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed He feels shame at bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct He feels concern for bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct He has heard much has retained what he has heard has stored what he has heardWhatever teachings are admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end that  in their meaning  expression  proclaim the holy life that is entirely complete  pure those he has listened to often retained discussed accumulated examined with his mind and wellpenetrated in terms of his views He keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualitiesHe is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities He is mindful endowed with excellent proficiency in mindfulness remembering  recollecting even things that were done  said long ago He is discerning endowed with discernment of arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressThis is how the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with seven qualitiesAnd how does the disciple of the noble ones obtain at will  without trouble or difficulty  the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the herenowThere is the case where quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities the disciple of the noble ones enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painThis is how the disciple of the noble ones obtains at will  without trouble or difficulty  the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the herenowNow when a disciple of the noble ones is consummate in virtue in this way guards the doors to his sense faculties in this way knows moderation in eating in this way is devoted to wakefulness in this way is endowed with seven qualities in this way and obtains at will  without trouble or difficulty  the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the herenow in this way then he is called a disciple of the noble ones who follows the practice for one in training whose eggs are unspoiled who is capable of breaking out capable of awakening capable of attaining the supreme rest from the yokeJust as if a hen had eight ten or twelve eggs that she covered rightly warmed rightly  incubated rightly Even though this wish did not occur to her  O that my chicks might break through the egg shells with their spiked claws or beaks and hatch out safely  still it is possible that the chicks would break through the shells with their spiked claws or beaks and hatch out safelyIn the same way when a disciple of the noble ones is consummate in virtue in this way guards the doors to his sense faculties in this way knows moderation in eating in this way is devoted to wakefulness in this way is endowed with seven qualities in this way and obtains at will  without trouble or difficulty  the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the herenow in this way then he is called a disciple of the noble ones who follows the practice for one in training whose eggs are unspoiled who is capable of breaking out capable of awakening capable of attaining the supreme rest from the yokeNow when the disciple of the noble ones has arrived at this purity of equanimity  mindfulness he recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes  detailsThis is his first breaking out like that of the hens chicks from their shellsWhen the disciple of the noble ones has arrived at this purity of equanimity  mindfulness he sees  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away  reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kammaThis is his second breaking out like that of the hens chicks from their shellsWhen the disciple of the noble ones has arrived at this purity of equanimity  mindfulness he enters  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  nowThis is his third breaking out like that of the hens chicks from their shellsNow when the disciple of the noble ones is consummate in virtue that is a matter of his conductWhen he guards the doors to his sense faculties knows moderation in eating is devoted to wakefulness is endowed with seven qualities that is a matter of his conductWhen he obtains at will  without trouble or difficulty  the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the herenow that is a matter of his conductWhen he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes  details that is a matter of his clearknowingWhen he sees  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing When he enters  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  now that is a matter of his clearknowingThis Mahanama is called a disciple of the noble ones who is consummate in clearknowing consummate in conduct consummate in clearknowing  conductAnd by the Brahma Sanankumara this verse was saidThis verse was wellsung by the Brahma Sanankumara not illsung wellsaid not illsaid connected with the goal not unconnected with the goalIt was endorsed by the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One got up and said to VenAnanda Good good AnandaWhat you have said to the Kapilavatthu Sakyans about the person who follows the practice for one in training is goodThat is what VenAnanda said and the Teacher approvedGratified the Kapilavatthu Sakyans delighted in VenAnandas wordsOne in training is a person who has attained at least streamentry but not yet arahantshipIn this sutta the Buddha faces two antagonists Baka a brahma who believes that his brahmaattainment is the highest attainment there is and Mara who wants to keep Baka under his power by allowing Baka to maintain his deluded opinion and to prevent the Buddha from sharing his awakened knowledge with othersOf the two Mara is the more insidious a point illustrated by the fact that Mara always speaks through someone else and never directly shows his faceIn overcoming his antagonists the Buddha asserts the superiority of his knowledge in two major fashions through a description of his awakened knowledge and through a display of psychic powersThe Buddha describes his awakened knowledge in a variety of waysSome of these assertions  in particular the assertion of a consciousness not mediated by any of the six senses  are extremely important dhamma lessons which are further explained in the notesBut as the sutta shows even the Buddhas description of these teachings was not enough to win over Baka or the members of his followingThey were convinced only when the Buddha then performed a feat of psychic power that even Baka could not fathom and illustrated the Buddhas major pointUp to then in identifying Mara and the range of Bakas power the Buddha was in effect saying I see you but you dont see me With his display of psychic power in which brahma and his following could not see him but could hear his voice he demonstrated his point in such graphic terms that Baka and his following were immediately won overIn this way the protagonists of this sutta react in a way very different from that of a typical modern readerWe at present when reading this sutta may be more impressed with the Buddhas explanation of his awakened knowledge than we are with the account of his display of psychic power for after all both aspects of the sutta  the description of the Buddhas knowledge and the description of his psychic power  are for us just that descriptionsBut for those who witnessed it his display of power was an undeniable fact that went beyond wordsThey saw him go beyond their rangePrior to that display they regarded his claims of knowledge simply as that mere claimsWhen he showed however that he could perform a miracle that even Baka could not perform they were forced to concede his superiorityThus this sutta imparts a lesson often forgotten at present that the Buddha taught not only by word but also by example and that some of his examples required a dimension of power that even the gods could not matchStrictly speaking of course the Buddhas display of power did not prove that he had gone beyond becomingAfter all in becoming invisible to Baka he may simply have gone to another level of becoming of which Baka was unawareHowever the Buddha correctly surmised that a display of power would subdue the pride of his listeners awaken a sense of conviction in his attainment and thus enable them to enter the path of practiceAs he states in MN only when one sees the four noble truths  usually a synonym for streamentry  is ones conviction in the Buddhas Awakening confirmedOnly when one puts an end to ones mental fermentations does one have firm proof of the Buddhas AwakeningThe Buddha notes in DN that a display of psychic powers can sometimes backfire in that ones audience might assume that one is engaging in cheap magic tricksThus instead of inspiring conviction the display simply increases doubtNevertheless there are other instances in the Canon  most notably in the story of the Kassapa brothers and that of Angulimala  where the Buddha was able to display his powers to good effectStill because he could not trust even his arahant disciples to possess his same sense of when such powers would work and when they would backfire he forbade his disciples from displaying psychic powers to lay peopleThe conclusion of the sutta states that the suttas name comes from two facets of the story the fact that it contains an invitation from a brahma  when Baka welcomes the Buddha to his realm  and from the silencing of MaraThe first point is clear enough but the second requires explanationIt is a play on the word brahma which is not only a noun denoting the highest levels of devas but also an adjective meaning of great or high power The Buddhas last statement in which he declares his freedom from rebirth is something of an invitation to Mara Mara is welcome to refute it if he canUp to that point Mara has phrased his threats to the Buddha in terms of the fortunate rebirths the Buddha will experience if he obeys Maras advice and the unfortunate ones he will experience if he doesntNow that the Buddha declares in a way that Mara cannot refute that he has abandoned all possible conditions for rebirth Mara has nothing more on which to base his threatsThus he is left speechlessIn this way the Buddhas last statement is a brahmainvitation a statement that anyone is welcome to refute but of such great power that no one can refute it at allI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said On one occasion recently I was staying in Ukkattha in the Subhaga forest at the root of a royal sala treeNow on that occasion an evil viewpoint had arisen to BakaBrahma This is constantThis is permanentThis is eternalThis is totalThis is not subject to falling away  for this does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappearAnd there is no other higher escapeSo I  having known with my awareness the train of thought in Baka Brahmas awareness  as a strong man would extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm vanished into the root of the royal sala tree in the Subhaga forest in Ukkattha and appeared in that brahma worldBaka Brahma saw me coming in the distance and on seeing me said Come good sirYou are wellcome good sirIt has been long good sir since you arranged to come here  for this good sir is constantThis is permanentThis is eternalThis is totalThis is not subject to falling away  for here one does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappearAnd there is no other higher escapeWhen this was said I told Baka Brahma How immersed in ignorance is Baka BrahmaHow immersed in ignorance is Baka Brahma  in that what is actually inconstant he calls constant What is actually impermanent he calls permanent What is actually noneternal he calls eternal What is actually partial he calls total What is actually subject to falling away he calls not subject to falling away Where one takes birth ages dies falls away and reappears he says For here one does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear And there being another higher escape he says There is no other higher escapeThen Mara the Evil One taking possession of an attendant of the Brahma assembly said to me MonkMonkDont attack himDont attack himFor this Brahma monk is the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall BeThere were monk before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the worldThey with the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life were established in a coarse bodyThere were monk before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the worldThey with the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life were established in a refined bodySo I tell you monk Please good sir do only as Brahma saysDont defy the word of BrahmaIf you defy the word of Brahma then  as a man when the goddess of fortune approaches chases her away with a stick or as a man falling into hell loses hold of the earth with his hands and feet  that will be what you have accomplishedPlease good sir do only as Brahma saysDont defy the word of BrahmaDont you see that Brahmas assembly has gathered And so Mara the Evil One directed my attention to Brahmas assemblyWhen this was said I told Mara the Evil One I know you Evil OneDont assume He doesnt know me You are Mara Evil OneAnd Brahma and Brahmas assembly and the attendants of Brahmas assembly have all fallen into your handsThey have all fallen into your powerAnd you think This one too has come into my hands has come under my control But Evil One I have neither come into your hands nor have I come under your controlWhen this was said Baka Brahma told me But good sir what is actually constant I call constant What is actually permanent I call permanent What is actually eternal I call eternal What is actually total I call total What is actually not subject to falling away I call not subject to falling away Where one does not take birth age die fall away or reappear I say For this does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear And there being no other higher escape I say There is no other higher escapeThere were monk before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world whose ascetic practice lasted as long as your entire life spanThey knew when there was another higher escape that there was another higher escape or when there was no other higher escape that there was no other higher escapeSo I tell you monk both that you will not find another higher escape and that to that extent you will reap your share of trouble  wearinessMonk if you relish earth you will lie close to me lie within my domain for me to banish and to do with as I likeIf you relish liquid fire wind beings devas Pajapati brahma you will lie close to me lie within my domain for me to banish and to do with as I likeI too know that brahmaIf I relish earth I will lie close to you lie within your domain for you to banish and to do with as you likeIf I relish liquid fire wind beings devas Pajapati brahma I will lie close to you lie within your domain for you to banish and to do with as you likeMoreover I discern your sphere I discern your splendor Baka Brahma has this much great powerBaka Brahma has this much great mightBaka Brahma has this much great influenceWell monk how do you discern my sphere how do you discern my splendor Baka Brahma has this much great powerBaka Brahma has this much great mightBaka Brahma has this much great influenceThat brahma is how I discern your sphere that is how I discern your splendor Baka Brahma has this much great powerBaka Brahma has this much great mightBaka Brahma has this much great influence There are brahma bodies other than yours that you dont know dont see but that I know I seeThere is brahma the body named Abhassara from which you fell away  reappeared hereFrom your having lived here so long your memory of that has become muddledThat is why you dont know it dont see it but I know it I see itThus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be inferiorI am actually superior to youThere is brahma the body named Subhakinha the body named Vehapphala which you dont know dont see but that I know I seeThus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be your inferiorI am actually superior to youHaving directly known earth as earth and having directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the earthness of earth I wasnt earth I wasnt in earth I wasnt coming from earth I wasnt Earth is mine I didnt affirm earthThus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be inferiorI am actually superior to youHaving directly known liquid as liquid fire as fire wind as wind beings as beings devas as devas Pajapati as Pajapati brahma as brahma the radiant as radiant the beautiful black as the beautiful black the skyfruit as the skyfruit the conqueror as the conquerorHaving directly known the all as the all and having directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the allness of the all I wasnt the all I wasnt in the all I wasnt coming forth from the all I wasnt The all is mine I didnt affirm the allThus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be inferiorI am actually superior to youIf good sir you have directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the allness of the all may it not turn out to be actually vain and void for youhas not been experienced through the earthness of earth the liquidity of liquid the fieriness of fire the windiness of wind the allness of the allWell then good sir I will disappear from youWell then brahma disappear from me if you canThen Baka Brahma I will disappear from Gotama the contemplativeI will disappear from Gotama the contemplative was not able to disappear from meWhen this was said I said to Baka Brahma Well then brahma I will disappear from youWell then good sir disappear from me if you canSo then monks I fabricated a fabrication of psychic power to the extent that Brahma the Brahma assembly and the attendants of the Brahma assembly heard my voice but did not see meHaving disappeared I recited this verseThen in Brahma the Brahma assembly and the attendants of the Brahma assembly there arose a sense of amazement  awe How amazingHow awesome The great power the great might of Gotama the contemplativeNever before have we seen or heard of any other contemplative or brahman of such great power such great might as that of this Gotama the contemplative who went forth from a Sakyan clanLiving in a generation that so delights in becoming so rejoices in becoming is so fond of becoming he has pulled out becoming by the rootThen Mara the Evil One taking possession of an attendant of the Brahma assembly said to me If good sir this is what you discern if this is what you have awakened to do not lead disciples or those gone forthDo not teach the Dhamma to disciples or those gone forthDo not yearn for disciples or those gone forthThere were good sir before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world who claimed to be worthy  rightly selfawakenedThey led disciples  those gone forthThey taught the Dhamma to disciples  those gone forthThey yearned for disciples  those gone forthHaving led disciples  those gone forth having taught the Dhamma to disciples  those gone forth having yearned for disciples  those gone forth they  on the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life  were established in a coarse bodyThere were good sir before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world who claimed to be worthy  rightly selfawakenedThey did not lead disciples or those gone forthThey did not teach the Dhamma to disciples or those gone forthThey did not yearn for disciples or those gone forthHaving not led disciples or those gone forth having not taught the Dhamma to disciples or those gone forth having not yearned for disciples or those gone forth they  on the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life  were established in a refined bodySo monk I tell you this Please good sir be effortlessAbide committed to a pleasant abiding in the herenow  for it is skillful good sir that this not be taughtDont instruct othersWhen this was said I told Mara the Evil One I know you Evil OneDont assume He doesnt know me You are Mara Evil OneAnd its not sympathetic to welfare that you speak thus to meIts sympathetic to what is not welfare that you speak thus to meYou think this Evil One Those to whom Gotama the contemplative will teach the Dhamma will defy my sovereigntyWithout being rightly selfawakened Evil One your contemplatives  brahmans claimed to be rightly selfawakenedI however being rightly selfawakened claim to be rightly selfawakenedFor when the Tathagata is teaching the Dhamma to his disciples he is SuchWhen he is not teaching the Dhamma to his disciples he is SuchWhen leading his disciples he is SuchWhen not leading his disciples he is SuchWhy is thatThe fermentations that defile that lead to further becoming that disturb that ripen in stress that tend to future birth aging  death Those the Tathagata has abandoned their root destroyed like an uprooted palmyra tree deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingJust as a palmyra tree with its crown cut off is incapable of growing again so too the fermentations that defile that lead to further becoming that disturb that ripen in stress that tend to future birth aging  death Those the Tathagata has abandoned their root destroyed like an uprooted palmyra tree deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising Thus because of the silencing of Mara and because of the brahmas invitation this discourse is entitled The Brahma InvitationJust as if there were a roofed house or a roofed hall having windows on the north the south or the eastWhen the sun rises and a ray has entered by way of the window where does it landOn the western wall lordAnd if there is no western wall where does it landOn the ground lordAnd if there is no ground where does it landOn the water lordAnd if there is no water where does it landIt does not land lordIn the same way where there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food contact intellectual intention consciousness where there is no delight no craving then consciousness does not land there or growWhere consciousness does not land or grow nameform does not alightWhere nameform does not alight there is no growth of fabricationsWhere there is no growth of fabrications there is no production of renewed becoming in the futureWhere there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth aging  deathThat I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despairIn other words normal sensory consciousness is experienced because it has a surface against which it lands the sense organs and their objects which constitute the all For instance we experience visual consciousness because of the eye and forms of which we are consciousConsciousness without surface however is directly known without intermediary free from any dependence on conditions at allThis consciousness thus differs from the consciousness factor in dependent coarising which is defined in terms of the six sense mediaLying outside of time and space it would also not come under the consciousnessaggregate which covers all consciousness near and far past present and futureAnd as SNnotes the word all in the Buddhas teaching covers only the six sense media which is another reason for not including this consciousness under the aggregatesHowever the fact that it is outside of time and space  in a dimension where there is no here there or in between no coming no going or staying  means that it cannot be described as permanent or omnipresent terms that have meaning only within space and timeSome have objected to the equation of this consciousness with nibbana on the grounds that nibbana is nowhere else in the Canon described as a form of consciousnessThus they have proposed that consciousness without surface be regarded as an arahants consciousness of nibbana in meditative experience and not nibbana itselfThis argument however contains a flaw If nibbana is an object of mental consciousness it would come under the all as an object of the intellectThere are passages in the Canon that describe meditators experiencing nibbana as a dhamma but these passages seem to indicate that this description applies up through the level of nonreturningOther passages however describe nibbana as the ending of all dhammasFor instance Sn quotes the Buddha as calling the attainment of the goal the transcending of all dhammasSn and Sn state that the arahant has transcended dispassion said to be the highest dhammaThus for the arahant nibbana is not an object of consciousnessInstead it is directly known without mediationBecause consciousness without feature is directly known without mediation there seems good reason to equate the twoI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas MonasteryThen VenMaha Kotthita arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to VenSariputta and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenSariputta Friend One of poor discernment one of poor discernment Thus is it saidTo what extent is one said to be one of

just now we understood you to say Heat remains standing in dependence on vitality Now how is the meaning of these statements to be seenIn that case friend I will give you analogy for there are cases where it is through an analogy that an intelligent person understands the meaning of a statementSuppose an oil lamp is burningIts radiance is discerned in dependence on its flame and its flame is discerned in dependence on its radianceIn the same way vitality remains standing in dependence on heat and heat remains standing in dependence on vitalityFriend are vitalityfabrications the same thing

was on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks he arrived at SalavatikaThe brahman householders of Sala heard it said Gotama the contemplative  the son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clan  on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks  has arrived at SalaAnd of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread He is indeed a Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessedHe has made known  having realized it through direct knowledge  this world with its devas maras  brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their rulers  common people has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect  pureIt is good to see such a worthy one So the brahman householders of Sala went to the Blessed OneOn arrival some of them bowing down to him sat to one sideSome of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one sideSome of them placing their hands palmtopalm over the heart in his direction sat to one sideSome of them announcing their name and clan in his presence sat to one sideSome of them remaining silent sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the brahman householders of Sala said to the Blessed One What is the reason Master Gotama what is the condition whereby some beings here with the breakup of the body after death reappear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellAnd what is the reason what is the condition whereby some beings here with the breakup of the body after death reappear in the good destinations in the heavenly worldHouseholders its by reason of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct that some beings here with the breakup of the body after death reappear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellIts by reason of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct that some beings here with the breakup of the body after death reappear in the good destinations in the heavenly worldWe dont understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotamas brief statement the detailed meaning of what he hasnt analyzedIt would be good if Master Gotama would teach the Dhamma so that we would understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotamas brief statement the detailed meaning of what he hasnt analyzedVery well in that case householders listen  pay careful attentionI will speakAs you say master the brahman householders of Sala responded to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One said Householders there are three sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the body four sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with speech and three sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the mindAnd how are there three sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the bodyThere is the case where a certain person takes life is brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beingsHe takes what is not givenHe takes in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by themHe engages in sensual misconductHe gets sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another manThis is how there are three sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the bodyAnd how are there four sorts of unDhamma

says I havent seen Thus he consciously tells lies for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of a certain rewardHe engages in divisive speechWhat he has heard here he tells there to break those people apart from these people hereWhat he has heard there he tells here to break these people apart from those people thereThus breaking apart those who are united and stirring up strife between those who have broken apart he loves factionalism delights in factionalism enjoys factionalism speaks things that create factionalismHe engages in abusive speechHe speaks words that are harsh cutting bitter to others abusive of others provoking anger and destroying concentrationHe engages in idle chatterHe speaks out of season speaks what isnt factual what isnt in accordance with the goal

offered nothing sacrificedThere is no fruit or result of good or bad actionsThere is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no contemplatives or brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves This is how there are three sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with

GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearWe go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksMay Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge from this day forward for lifeThis and the following passages on the power of a wish made by a virtuous person are apparently related to a principle  expressed in SN that a wish made by a virtuous person can succeed through the purity of hisher virtueHowever other passages in the Canon suggest that virtue on its own  even when combined with the levels of conviction and discernment embodied in the three types of skillful mental action  may not be enough for any of the attainments listed hereIn other words the ten types of skillful action may be necessary causes for these attainments but they may not be sufficient causesFor example MN states that one must be generous in order to be born into a wealthy familyANstates that the rebirth into the six deva realms beginning with the devas of the Four Great Kings is based on five qualities conviction virtue learning generosity and discernmentANcorrelates different motivations for giving with the attainment of different levels of rebirth among these realms after deathANand state that rebirth in Brahmas retinue can follow on the attainment of the first jhana or the meditative development of immeasurable good willIt should also be noted in line with MN that skillful conduct in this lifetime is not always rewarded in the immediate next birth either because of previous bad actions or because of bad actions adopted toward the end of ones lifeIn such a case the desired destination will be delayed to a later lifetimeThis may be why the Buddha states that it is possible that a person of Dhamma conduct will attain hisher desired destination in the next lifeOnly with the attainment of streamentry is one guaranteed not to fall into the lower realmsConversely it is not always the case that a person who engages in unskillful conduct in this lifetime will go to a lower destination in the nextThere is always the possibility that such a person may have good kamma from the past or may change hisher ways later in this lifetimeIn SNthe Buddha criticizes those who teach that misdeeds inevitably lead to a bad destination in the next lifetime saying that anyone who believed such a teaching and knew that heshe had already committed misdeeds would feel that heshe had already been consigned to hellA more skillful way to regard past misdeeds would be to recognize that they were wrong to resolve not to repeat them and to develop attitudes of immeasurable goodwill compassion empathetic joy and equanimity to reinforce ones resolve not to treat anyone in an unskillful wayANadds that the results of past misdeeds can be mitigated both through the practice of the four immeasurables and through training the mind so that it is not overcome by feelings of pleasure or painThese are the devas on the level of formThe commentary notes that the term Radiant devas is actually a class name encompassing the following three levels the devas of Limited Radiance the devas of Immeasurable Radiance and the devas of Streaming RadianceSimilarly the Beautiful devas encompass the devas of Limited Beauty the devas of Immeasurable Beauty and the Beautiful Black devasAccording to ANand rebirth among the devas of Streaming Radiance can follow on the attainment of the second jhana or the meditative development of immeasurable compassion rebirth among the Beautiful Black devas can follow on the attainment of the third jhana or the meditative development of immeasurable empathetic joy rebirth among the Skyfruit devas can follow on the attainment of the fourth jhana or the meditative development of immeasurable equanimityAn Abhidhamma text the Vibhanga  drawing on a passage in DN  mentions another level of devas of form not listed here the Nonpercipient beings a level in which there is no perception at allThe commentary explains that they are not listed here because this attainment is open to hermits and seers outside the Buddhas teaching and does not require virtueThis however ignores the fact that the four jhanas and four formless states are also open to people outside the Buddhas teaching and although virtue helps with the attainment of jhana it is nowhere stated in the Canon that the jhanas cannot be attained by a person whose virtue is not pureA more likely reason for omitting the Nonpercipient beings here is that this state unlike the jhanas and four formless states is not conducive to the arising of insight and so would not be considered a desirable goalThe brahmans of this discourse intelligent people asked a question about the causality of rebirth  why is one reborn in the states of deprivation while others make it to the heaven worldsThe Buddha then analyzes what kind of kamma will take one to a low rebirthYou see any of your own actions hereThen you know what to do about it for if one makes any of these ten courses of unwholesome kamma strong in oneself a result can be expected at least on the dissolution of the body after death if not in this lifeThe ten courses of wholesome kamma followThey should be strengthened in oneself repeated frequently so that they become habitualIf one recognizes any of ones own actions among them then just guard against the conceit I am goodThe last part of the sutta deals with the aspirations which one may have for rebirth at the time of deathOf course ones previously made kamma must be such that it will support such aspirationsA miser might aspire to riches but his kamma will give him povertyIf a person has kept the Uposatha and generally all the precepts and been generous and truthful as well this is the passport to heavenly birthBeyond this it is necessary also to be proficient in jhana and one will gain rebirth among the Brahmas according to proficiency in thisFor the next five Brahmaplanes the state of nonreturning is required while for the last four one must have gained the formless attainmentsFinally one may aspire to no rebirth to arahantship but of course the aspiration alone is not sufficient  practice and sufficient insightwisdom are neededThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and eventually he arrived at a Kosalan brahman village called SalaThe brahman householders of Sala heard A monk called Gotama it seems a son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and has come to SalaNow a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is such since he is arahant and Fully Enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable teacher of men to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedHe describes this world with its gods its Maras and its Divinities this generation with its monks and brahmans with its kings and its people which he has himself realized through direct knowledgeHe teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with meaning and phrasing he affirms a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure Now it is good to see such arahantsThe brahman householders of Sala went to the Blessed One and some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side some exchanged greetings with him and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished sat down at one side some raised hands palms together in salutation to the Blessed One and sat down at one side some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed Ones presence and sat down at one side some kept silence and sat down at one sideWhen they were seated they said to the Blessed One Master Gotama what is the reason what is the condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell and what is the reason what is the condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldHouseholders it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of unrighteous conduct that beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellIt is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of righteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldWe do not understand the detailed meaning of this utterance of Master Gotamas spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaningIt would be good if Master Gotama taught us the Dhamma so that we might understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotamas utterance spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaningThen householders listen and heed well what I shall sayYes venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said thisHouseholders there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductThere are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductThere are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductAnd how are there three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductHere someone is a killer of living beings he is murderous bloodyhanded given to blows and violence and merciless to all living beingsHe is a taker of what is not given he takes as a thief anothers chattels and property in the village or in the forestHe is given over to misconduct in sexual desires he has intercourse with such as are protected by the mother father brother sister relatives as have a husband as entail a penalty and also with those that are garlanded in token of betrothalThat is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductAnd how are there four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductHere someone speaks falsehood when summoned to a court or to a meeting or to his relatives presence or to his guild or to the royal familys presence and questioned as a witness thus So good man tell what you know then not knowing he says I know or knowing he says I do not know not seeing he says I see or seeing he says I do not see in full awareness he speaks falsehood for his own ends or for anothers ends or for some trifling worldly endHe speaks maliciously he is a repeater elsewhere of what is heard here for the purpose of causing division from these or he is a repeater to these of what is heard elsewhere for the purpose of causing division from those and he is thus a divider of the united a creator of divisions who enjoys discord rejoices in discord delights in discord he is a speaker of words that create discordHe speaks harshly he utters such words as are rough hard hurtful to others censorious of others bordering on anger and unconducive to concentrationHe is a gossip as one who tells that which is unseasonable that which is not fact that which is not good that which is not the Dhamma that which is not the Discipline and he speaks out of season speech not worth recording which is unreasoned indefinite and unconnected with goodThat is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductAnd how are there three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductHere someone is covetous he is a coveter of anothers chattels and property thus Oh that what is anothers were mine Or he has a mind of illwill with the intention of a mind affected by hate thus May these beings be slain and slaughtered may they be cut off perish or be annihilated Or he has wrong view distorted vision thus There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed no fruit and ripening of good and bad kammas no this world no other world no mother no father no spontaneously beings no good and virtuous monks and brahmans that have themselves realized by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world That is how there are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conductSo householders it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of unrighteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellHouseholders there are three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductThere are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductThere are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductAnd how are there three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductHere someone abandoning the killing of living beings becomes one who abstains from killing living beings with rod and weapon laid aside gentle and kindly he abides compassionate to all living beingsAbandoning the taking of what is not given he becomes one who abstains from taking what is not given he does not take as a thief anothers chattels and property in the village or in the forestAbandoning misconduct in sexual desires he becomes one who abstains from misconduct in sexual desires he does not have intercourse with such women as are protected by mother father brother sister relatives as have a husband as entail a penalty and also those that are garlanded in token of betrothalThat is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductAnd how are there four of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductHere someone abandoning false speech becomes one who abstains from false speech when summoned to a court or to a meeting or to his relatives presence or to his guild or to the royal familys presence and questioned as a witness thus So good man tell what you know not knowing he says I do not know or knowing he says I know not seeing he says I do not see or seeing he says I see he does not in full awareness speak falsehood for his own ends or for anothers ends or for some trifling worldly endAbandoning malicious speech he becomes one who abstains from malicious speech as one who is neither a repeater elsewhere of what is heard here for the purpose of causing division from these nor a repeater to these of what is heard elsewhere for the purpose of causing division from those who is thus a reuniter of the divided a promoter of friendships enjoying concord rejoicing in concord delighting in concord he becomes a speaker of words that promote concordAbandoning harsh speech he becomes one who abstains from harsh speech he becomes a speaker of such words as are innocent pleasing to the ear and lovable as go to the heart are civil desired of many and dear to manyAbandoning gossip he becomes one who abstains from gossip as one who tells that which is seasonable that which is factual that which is good that which is the Dhamma that which is the Discipline he speaks in season speech worth recording which is reasoned definite and connected with goodThat is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductAnd how are there three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductHere someone is not covetous he is not a coveter of anothers chattels and property thus Oh that what is anothers were mine He has no mind of illwill with the intention of a mind unaffected by hate thus May these beings be free from enmity affliction and anxiety may they live happily He has right view undistorted vision thus There is what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed and there is fruit and ripening of good and bad kammas and there is this world and the other world and mother and father and spontaneously beings and good and virtuous monks and brahmans that have themselves realized by direct knowledge and declared this world and the other world That is how there are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductSo householders it is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of righteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldIf a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the warriornobles of great property it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he may do soWhy is thatBecause he observes conduct that is in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductIf a householder who observes conduct is accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the brahmans of great property it is possibleIf a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma I might reappear in the company of householders of great property it is possibleIf a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the gods of the Four Kings it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he may do soWhy is thatBecause he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductIf a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the gods of the base consisting of neitherperceptionnornonperception it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he may do soWhy is thatBecause he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductIf a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish Oh that by realization myself with direct knowledge I may here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of the heart and the deliverance by wisdom that are taintfree with exhaustion of taints it is possible that by realization himself with direct knowledge he may here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of the heart and the deliverance by wisdom that are taintfree with exhaustion of taintsWhy is thatBecause he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conductWhen this was said the brahman householders of Sala said to the Blessed OneMagnificent Master GotamaMagnificent Master GotamaThe Dhamma has been made clear

of strawAfter his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the foreAbandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousnessHe cleanses his mind of covetousnessAbandoning ill will and anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beingsHe cleanses his mind of ill will and angerAbandoning sloth and drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness mindful alert percipient of lightHe cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsinessAbandoning restlessness and anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilledHe cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxietyAbandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualitiesHe cleanses his mind of uncertaintySuppose that a man taking a loan invests it in his business affairsHis business affairs succeedHe repays his old debts and has extra left over for maintaining his wifeThe thought would occur to him Before taking a loan I invested it in my business affairsNow my business affairs have succeededI have repaid my old debts and have extra left over for maintaining my wife Because of that he would gain joy  experience happinessNow suppose that a man falls sick  in pain  seriously illHe does not enjoy his meals and has no measure of strength in his bodyAt a later time he is released from that sicknessHe enjoys his meals and has a measure of strength in his bodyThe thought would occur to him Before I was sick Now I am released from that sicknessI enjoy my meals and have a measure of strength in my body Because of that he would gain joy  experience happinessNow suppose that a man is bound in prisonAt a later time he is released from that bondage safe  sound with no loss of propertyThe thought would occur to him Before I was bound in prisonNow I am released from that bondage safe  sound with no loss of my property Because of that he would gain joy  experience happinessNow suppose that a man subject to others not subject to himself unable to go where he likesAt a later time he is released from that slavery subject to himself not subject to others freed able to go where he likesThe thought would occur to him Before I was a slave Now I am released from that slavery subject to myself not subject to others freed able to go where I like Because of that he would gain joy  experience happinessNow suppose that a man carrying money  goods is traveling by a road through desolate countryAt a later time he emerges from that desolate country safe  sound with no loss of propertyThe thought would occur to him Before carrying money  goods I was traveling by a road through desolate countryNow I have emerged from that desolate country safe  sound with no loss of my property Because of that he would gain joy  experience happinessIn the same way when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself the monk regards it as a debt a sickness a prison slavery a road through desolate countryBut when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself he regards it as unindebtedness good health release from prison freedom a place of securitySeeing that they have been abandoned within him he becomes gladGlad he becomes enrapturedEnraptured his body grows tranquilHis body tranquil he is sensitive to pleasureFeeling pleasure his mind becomes concentratedQuite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluationHe permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawalJust as if a skilled bathman or bathmans apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again and again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within and without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of withdrawalTheres nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawalFurthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assuranceHe permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composureJust like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time and again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate and pervade suffuse and fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composureTheres nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composureAnd furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born and growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated and pervaded suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureTheres nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of raptureAnd furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure and stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasure nor stressHe sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessJust as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessTheres nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awarenessWith his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past livesHe recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and detailsJust as if a man were to go from his home village to another village and then from that village to yet another village and then from that village back to his home villageThe thought would occur to him I went from my home village to that village over thereThere I stood in such a way sat in such a way talked in such a way and remained silent in such a wayFrom that village I went to that village over there and there I stood in such a way sat in such a way talked in such a way and remained silent in such a wayFrom that village I came back home In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past livesHe recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and detailsWith his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beingsHe sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kammaJust as if there were a tall building in the central square and a man with good eyesight standing on top of it were to see people entering a house leaving it walking along the street and sitting in the central squareThe thought would occur to him These people are entering a house leaving it walking along the streets and sitting in the central square In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beingsHe sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kammaWith his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentationsHe discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneTheres nothing further for this world Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid and unsullied  where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting and it would occur to him This pool of water is clear limpid and unsulliedHere are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentationsHe discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneTheres nothing further for this worldThis monks is called a monk who is a contemplative a brahman washed a master learned noble an arahantAnd how is a monk a contemplativeHis evil unskillful qualities that are

verse comes at the end of the Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd where the Buddha develops the simile of a herd of cows getting safely across the ford of a raging riverThe strong old bulls plunge straight in and show the way to the others  these are likened to the arahants who make their way across the flood of death to the safety of the further shoreThe other members of the herd also make their way across according to their capabilities from the heifers and young oxen to the youngsters and the newborn calves just as the various groups of Buddhist followers attain the goal in due course by different methodsThe Buddha of course is the one who has first cut the current of the river with his wisdom to show the way to the safety of nibbanaIt is hard to know how best to translate this word in this contextIts meaning is clear enough being simply a form of the verb to cut But how does one cut a streamWe immediately think of cutting off the flow of water but this is not what happens when a river is fordedBhikkhus anamoli and Bodhi throughout their translation of this discourse speak of the stream as being breasted This term expresses well the sense in which one boldly stands up to the current as it swirls around ones body during the crossingI have settled upon the word penetrated although it may sound odd at first because it communicates the basic sense of cutting or partingIn other contexts such as in the Simile of the Raft the emphasis is upon crossing the flood but the image is different in this verseMara is the embodiment of the lower reaches of our human nature  those parts of ourselves rooted in greed hatred and delusion that prompt us to act selfishly and without careHis stream can be taken as representing samsara the onflowing of unwholesome states unskillful intentions and unfortunate karma constructionsWe can follow the current of this stream willfully selfgratification being the path of least resistance or despite our best efforts we can get swept away in the mighty flood of suffering that causes us to be reborn in other afflicted states after each painful and tragic deathWe can imagine the force of this imagery in the deadflat plains of Northern India which are chiseled with innumerable rushing streams and mighty riversThe monks went on retreat for three months during the rainy season because the rivers were uncrossable as much as for any other reasonThe safety of the other shore is within reach of the monks because the Buddha has shown that the crossing is possibleHe has disrupted the current by his passage holding firm against the current with every step and has removed many of the obstacles and hindrances in doing soBut his followers still need to put forth their own effort to get acrossThe newborn calf in the Discourse of the Cowherd is not carried across the flood on someones back but is urged across by its mothers lowing So in addition to the intrepidity of his leading example the Buddha also plays the role of the lowing mother helping even the weakest member of the herd across the danger with the compassionate encouragement of his teachingI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Vesali at the Gabled Hall in the Great ForestAnd on that occasion he had finished dressing in the morning and was carrying his bowl and outer robe planning to enter Vesali for almsThen Saccaka a Nigantha while walking and wandering around to exercise his legs went to the Gabled Hall in the Great ForestVenAnanda saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said to the Blessed One Venerable sir here comes Saccaka the Nigantha a debater a sophist wellregarded by people at largeHe is intent on the disparagement of the Buddha the disparagement of the Dhamma the disparagement of the SanghaIt would be good if the Blessed One would sit down for a moment out of sympathy So the Blessed One sat down on a prepared seatThen Saccaka the Nigantha went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One There are Master Gotama some brahmans  contemplatives who live committed to the development of the body but not to the development of the mindThey are touched by bodily painful feelingIt has happened in the past that when one was touched by bodily painful feeling his thighs would grow rigid his heart would burst hot blood would gush from his mouth he would go mad out of his mindHis mind was thus subservient to his body and fell under the power of the bodyWhy was thatA lack of development of the mindThen there are some brahmans  contemplatives who live committed to the development of the mind but not to the development of the bodyThey are touched by mental painful feelingIt has happened in the past that when one was touched by mental painful feeling his thighs would grow rigid his heart would burst hot blood would gush from his mouth he would go mad out of his mindHis body was thus subservient to his mind and fell under the power of the mindWhy was thatA lack of development of the bodyThe thought has occurred to me that the disciples of Gotama the contemplative live committed to the development of the mind but not to the development of the bodyBut what have you learned Aggivessana about the development of the bodyThere are for example Nanda Vaccha Kisa Sankicca and Makkhali GosalaThey are clothless ascetics rejecting conventions licking their hands not coming when called not staying when askedThey dont consent to food brought to them or food dedicated to them or to an invitation to a mealThey accept nothing from the mouth of a pot or from the mouth of a bowlThey accept nothing from across a threshold across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a nursing woman from a woman living with a man from where it is announced that food is to be distributed from where a dog is waiting or flies are buzzingThey take no fish or meatThey drink no liquor wine or fermented drinkThey limit themselves to one house  one morsel a day or two houses  two morsels seven houses  seven morselsThey live on one saucerful a day two seven saucerfuls a dayThey take food once a day once every two days once every seven days and so on up to a fortnight devoted to regulating their intake of foodBut Aggivessana do they survive just on thatNo Master GotamaSometimes they eat outstanding staple foods chew on outstanding nonstaple foods taste outstanding delicacies and drink outstanding drinksThey rescue the body  its strength fortify it and fatten itWhat they earlier abandoned Aggivessana they later gather upThis is how there is decrease  increase of the bodyBut what have you learned Aggivessana about the development of the mindYet Saccaka the Nigantha when asked by the Blessed One about the development of the mind was unable to respondThen the Blessed One said to Saccaka The ones you described just now as developed in the development of the body That is not legitimate development of the body in the discipline of the noble onesAs you dont understand the development of the body from where would you understand the development of the mindNevertheless as to how one is undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind and developed in body and developed in mind listen and pay close attentionI will speakAs you say Master Gotama Saccaka respondedThe Blessed One said And how is one undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mindThere is the case where a pleasant feeling arises in an uneducated runofthemill personOn being touched by the pleasant feeling he becomes impassioned with pleasure and is reduced to being impassioned with pleasureHis pleasant feeling ceasesWith the cessation of the pleasant feeling there arises a painful feelingOn being touched with the painful feeling he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraughtWhen that pleasant feeling had arisen in him it invaded his mind and remained because of his lack of development of the bodyWhen that painful feeling had arisen in him it invaded his mind and remained because of his lack of development of the mindThis is how one is undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mindAnd how is one developed in body and developed in mindThere is the case where a pleasant feeling arises in a welleducated disciple of the noble onesOn being touched by the pleasant feeling he doesnt become impassioned with pleasure and is not reduced to being impassioned with pleasureHis pleasant feeling ceasesWith the cessation of the pleasant feeling there arises a painful feelingOn being touched with the painful feeling he doesnt sorrow grieve or lament beat his breast or becomes distraughtWhen that pleasant feeling had arisen in him it didnt invade his mind and remain because of his development of the bodyWhen that painful feeling had arisen in him it didnt invade his mind and remain because of his development of the mindThis is how one is developed in body and developed in mindI have confidence in Master Gotama that Master Gotama is developed in body and developed in mindWell Aggivessana you are certainly being rude and presumptuously speaking your words but nevertheless I will respond to youEver since I shaved my hair  beard put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness it has not been possible for a pleasant feeling that has arisen to invade my mind and remain or for a painful feeling that has arisen to invade my mind and remainBut perhaps there has never arisen in Master Gotama the sort of pleasant feeling that having arisen would invade the mind and remainPerhaps there has never arisen in Master Gotama the sort of painful feeling that having arisen would invade the mind and remainWhy wouldnt it have AggivessanaBefore my Awakening when I was still an unawakened Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me Household life is confining a dusty pathLife gone forth is the open airIt isnt easy living in a home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shellWhat if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessnessSo at a later time when I was still young blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life having shaved off my hair  beard  though my parents wished otherwise and were grieving with tears on their faces  I put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessnessHaving gone forth in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Alara Kalama and on arrival said to him Friend Kalama I want to practice in this doctrine  disciplineWhen this was said he replied to me You may stay here my friendThis doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teachers knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledgeIt was not long before I quickly learned the doctrineAs far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with othersI thought It isnt through mere conviction alone that Alara Kalama declares I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwells knowing  seeing this Dhamma So I went to him and said To what extent do you declare that you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma When this was said he declared the dimension of nothingnessI thought Not only does Alara Kalama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernmentI too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernmentWhat if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Alara Kalama declares he has entered  dwells in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeI went to him and said Friend Kalama is this the extent to which you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for yourself through direct knowledgeYes my friendThis friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeIt is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy lifeSo the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledgeAnd the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeThe Dhamma I know is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma I knowAs I am so are you as you are so am Come friend let us now lead this community togetherIn this way did Alara Kalama my teacher place me his pupil on the same level with himself and pay me great honorBut the thought occurred to me This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I leftIn search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Uddaka Ramaputta and on arrival said to him Friend Uddaka I want to practice in this doctrine  disciplineWhen this was said he replied to me You may stay here my friendThis doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teachers knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledgeIt was not long before I quickly learned the doctrineAs far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with othersI thought It wasnt through mere conviction alone that Rama declared I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwelled knowing  seeing this Dhamma So I went to Uddaka and said To what extent did Rama declare that he had entered  dwelled in this Dhamma When this was said Uddaka declared the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionI thought Not only did Rama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernmentI too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernmentWhat if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeI went to Uddaka and said Friend Uddaka is this the extent to which Rama entered  dwelled in this Dhamma having realized it for himself through direct knowledgeYes my friendThis friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeIt is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy lifeSo the Dhamma Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledgeAnd the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledgeThe Dhamma he knew is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma he knewAs he was so are you as you are so was heCome friend lead this communityIn this way did Uddaka Ramaputta my companion in the holy life place me in the position of teacher and pay me great honorBut the thought occurred to me This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I leftIn search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I wandered by stages in the Magadhan country and came to the military town of UruvelaThere I saw some delightful countryside with an inspiring forest grove a clearflowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for almsgoing on all sidesThe thought occurred to me How delightful is this countryside with its inspiring forest grove clearflowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for almsgoing on all sidesThis is just right for the striving of a clansman intent on striving So I sat down right there thinking This is just right for strivingThen these three similes  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to meSuppose there were a wet sappy piece of timber lying in the water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking Ill light a fireIll produce heat Now what do you thinkWould he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the wet sappy timber lying in the waterNo Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause the timber is wet  sappy and besides it is lying in the waterEventually the man would reap only his share of weariness  disappointmentSo it is with any brahman or contemplative who does not live withdrawn from sensuality in body  mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst  fever for sensuality is not relinquished  stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is incapable of knowledge vision  unexcelled selfawakeningThis was the first simile  spontaneous never before heard  that appeared to meThen a second simile  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to meSuppose there were a wet sappy piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking Ill light a fireIll produce heat Now what do you thinkWould he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the wet sappy timber lying on land far from waterNo Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause the timber is wet  sappy even though it is lying on land far from waterEventually the man would reap only his share of weariness  disappointmentSo it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body only but whose desire infatuation urge thirst  fever for sensuality is not relinquished  stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is incapable of knowledge vision  unexcelled selfawakeningThis was the second simile  spontaneous never before heard  that appeared to meThen a third simile  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to meSuppose there were a dry sapless piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking Ill light a fireIll produce heat Now what do you thinkWould he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the dry sapless timber lying on landYes Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause the timber is dry  sapless and besides it is lying on land far from waterSo it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body  mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst  fever for sensuality is relinquished  stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is capable of knowledge vision  unexcelled selfawakeningThis was the third simile  spontaneous never before heard  that appeared to meI thought Suppose that I clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth were to beat down constrain  crush my mind with my awareness So clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth I beat down constrained  crushed my mind with my awarenessJust as a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain  crush him in the same way I beat down constrained  crushed my mind with my awarenessAs I did so sweat poured from my armpitsAnd although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused  uncalm because of the painful exertionBut the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainI thought Suppose I were to become absorbed in the trance of nonbreathing So I stopped the inbreaths  outbreaths in my nose  mouthAs I did so there was a loud roaring of winds coming out my earholes just like the loud roar of winds coming out of a smiths bellows So I stopped the inbreaths  outbreaths in my nose  mouth  earsAs I did so extreme forces sliced through my head just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword Extreme pains arose in my head just as if a strong man were tightening a turban made of tough leather straps around my head Extreme forces carved up my stomach cavity just as if a butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox There was an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms were to roast  broil him over a pit of hot embersAnd although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused  uncalm because of the painful exertionBut the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainDevas on seeing me said Gotama the contemplative is dead Other devas said He isnt dead hes dying Others said Hes neither dead nor dying hes an arahant for this is the way arahants liveI thought Suppose I were to practice going altogether without food Then devas came to me and said Dear sir please dont practice going altogether without foodIf you go altogether without food well infuse divine nourishment in through your pores and you will survive on that I thought If I were to claim to be completely fasting while these devas are infusing divine nourishment in through my pores I would be lying So I dismissed them saying EnoughI thought Suppose I were to take only a little food at a time only a handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soup So I took only a little food at a time only a handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soupMy body became extremely emaciatedSimply from my eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems My backside became like a camels hoof My spine stood out like a string of beads My ribs jutted out like the jutting rafters of an old rundown barn The gleam of my eyes appeared to be sunk deep in my eye sockets like the gleam of water deep in a well My scalp shriveled  withered like a green bitter gourd shriveled  withered in the heat  the wind The skin of my belly became so stuck to my spine that when I thought of touching my belly I grabbed hold of my spine as well and when I thought of touching my spine I grabbed hold of the skin of my belly as well If I urinated or defecated I fell over on my face right there Simply from my eating so little if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair  rotted at its roots  fell from my body as I rubbed simply from eating so littlePeople on seeing me would say Gotama the contemplative is black Other people would say Gotama the contemplative isnt black hes brown Others would say Gotama the contemplative is neither black nor brown hes goldenskinned So much had the clear bright color of my skin deteriorated simply from eating so littleI thought Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the past have felt painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmostNone have been greater than thisWhatever brahmans or contemplatives in the future will feel painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmostNone will be greater than thisWhatever brahmans or contemplatives in the present are feeling painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmostNone is greater than thisBut with this racking practice of austerities I havent attained any superior human state any distinction in knowledge or vision worthy of the noble onesCould there be another path to AwakeningI thought I recall once when my father the Sakyan was working and I was sitting in the cool shade of a roseapple tree then  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities  I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationCould that be the path to Awakening Then following on that memory came the realization That is the path to Awakening I thought So why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities I thought I am no longer afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities but that pleasure is not easy to achieve with a body so extremely emaciatedSuppose I were to take some solid food some rice  porridge So I took some solid food some rice  porridgeNow five monks had been attending on me thinking If Gotama our contemplative achieves some higher state he will tell us But when they saw me taking some solid food  some rice  porridge  they were disgusted and left me thinking Gotama the contemplative is living luxuriouslyHe has abandoned his exertion and is backsliding into abundanceSo when I had taken solid food and regained strength then  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWith the fading of rapture I remained equanimous mindful  alert and sensed pleasure with the bodyI entered  remained in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWith the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  I entered  remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past livesI recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth twofive tenfifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  detailsThis was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beingsI saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kammaThis was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentationsI discerned as it was actually present that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there was the knowledge Released I discerned that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainI recall having taught the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds and yet each one of them assumes of me Gotama the contemplative is teaching the Dhamma attacking just me but it shouldnt be seen in that wayThe Tathagata rightly teaches them the Dhamma simply for the purpose of giving knowledgeAt the end of that very talk I steady the mind inwardly settle it concentrate it and unify it in the same theme of concentration as before in which I almost constantly dwellThat is credible for the Master Gotama as would be the case for one who is worthy  rightly selfawakenedBut does the Master Gotama recall sleeping during the dayI recall Aggivessana in the last month of the hot season after the meal returning from my almsround setting out my outer robe folded in four lying down on my right side and falling asleep while mindful  alertThere are some brahmans  contemplatives Master Gotama who would call that dwelling in delusionIts not to that extent that one is deluded or undeluded AggivessanaAs to how one is deluded or undeluded listen and pay close attentionI will speakAs you say Master Gotama Saccaka respondedThe Blessed One said In whomever the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death are not abandoned Him I call deludedFor it is from not abandoning the fermentations that one is deludedIn whomever the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death are abandoned Him I call undeludedFor it is from abandoning the fermentations that one is undeludedIn the Tathagata Aggivessana the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arisingJust as a palmyra cut off at the crown is incapable of further growth in the same way in the Tathagata the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arisingWhen this was said Saccaka the Nigantha said to the Blessed One Its amazing Master GotamaIts astounding  that when Master Gotama is addressed rudely again  again is assailed by presumptuous courses of speech the color of his skin brightens the color of his face clears as would be the case with one who is worthy and rightly selfawakenedI recall engaging Purana Kassapa in debateHe when engaged in debate by me spoke evasively and led the discussion astray displayed irritation aversion  peevishnessBut when Master Gotama is addressed rudely again  again is assailed by presumptuous courses of speech the color of his skin brightens the color of his face clears as would be the case with one who is worthy and rightly selfawakenedI recall engaging Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakambala Pakudha KaccayanaSañjaya Velatthaputta Nigantha Nataputa in debateHe when engaged in debate by me spoke evasively and led the discussion astray displayed irritation aversion  peevishnessBut when Master Gotama is addressed rudely again  again is assailed by presumptuous courses of speech the color of his skin brightens the color of his face clears as would be the case with one who is worthy and rightly selfawakenedAnd now Master Gotama I am goingMany are my duties many my responsibilitiesThen do Aggivessana what you think it is now time to doSo Saccaka the Nigantha delighting in  approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat and leftI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesālī at the Gabled Hall in the Great ForestAnd on that occasion Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason was dwelling in Vesālī  a debater a sophist wellregarded by people at largeHe made this statement before the assembly in Vesālī I see no contemplative or brahman the head of an order the head of a group or even one who claims to be an arahant rightly selfawakened who  engaged in debate with me  would not shiver quiver shake  break out in sweat under the armpitsEven if I were to engage a senseless stump in debate it  engaged with me in debate  would shiver quiver  shake to say nothing of a human beingThen early in the morning VenAssaji adjusted his under robe and  carrying his bowl  robes  went into Vesālī for almsSaccaka the Nigaṇṭhason walking  wandering around Vesālī to exercise his legs saw VenAssaji coming from afarOn seeing him he went up to him and exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one sideAs he was standing there he said to him Master Assaji how does Gotama the contemplative discipline his disciplesOr what part of his instruction is generally presented to his disciplesAggivessana the Blessed One disciplines his disciples in this way this part of the Blessed Ones instruction is generally presented to his disciples Form is inconstantFeeling is inconstantPerception is inconstantFabrications are inconstantConsciousness is inconstantForm is notselfFeeling is notselfPerception is notselfFabrications are notselfConsciousness is notselfAll fabrications are inconstantAll phenomena are notself This Aggivessana is the way in which the Blessed One disciplines his disciples this part of the Blessed Ones instruction is generally presented to his disciplesWhat a bad thing to hear we have heard Master Assaji when we have heard that Gotama the contemplative teaches this sort of thingPerhaps sooner or later we might go to meet with Gotama the contemplativePerhaps there might be some discussionPerhaps we might pry him away from that evil viewpointNow on that occasion five hundred Licchavis had gathered at a meeting hall on some business or otherSo Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason went to those Licchavis and on arrival said to them Come out good LicchavisCome out good LicchavisToday will be my discussion with Gotama the contemplativeIf he takes the position with me that was taken with me by his famous disciples the monk named Assaji then just as a strong man seizing a longhaired ram by the hair would drag him to and drag him fro and drag him all around in the same way I statement by statement will drag Gotama the contemplative to and drag him fro and drag him all aroundJust as a strong distillery worker throwing a large distillers strainer into a deep water tank and grabbing it by the corners would drag it to and drag it fro and drag it all around in the same way I statement by statement will drag Gotama the contemplative to and drag him fro and drag him all aroundJust as a strong distillery ruffian grabbing a horsehair strainer by the corners would shake it down and shake it out and thump it in the same way I statement by statement will shake Gotama the contemplative down and shake him out and thump himJust as a sixtyyear old elephant plunging into a deep pond would amuse itself playing the game of hempwashing in the same way I will amuse myself playing the game of hempwashing Gotama the contemplative as it wereCome on out good LicchavisCome on out good LicchavisToday will be my discussion with Gotama the contemplativeThen some of the Licchavis said Who is Gotama the contemplative that he will refute the statement of Saccaka the NigaṇṭhasonIts Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason who will refute the statement of Gotama the contemplative Some of the Licchavis said Who is Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason that he will refute the statement of Gotama the contemplativeIts Gotama the contemplative who will refute the statement of Saccaka the NigaṇṭhasonSo Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason surrounded by five hundred Licchavis went to the Gabled Hall in the Great ForestNow on that occasion a large number of monks were doing walking meditation in the open airSo Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason went up to the monks and said Where masters is Master Gotama nowWe want to see Master GotamaThe Blessed One Aggivessana having plunged into the Great Forest is sitting under a certain tree for the days abidingThen Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason together with a large group of Licchavis plunged into the Great Forest and went to the Blessed OneOn arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed OneAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideSome of the Licchavis having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one sideSome of the Licchavis exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one sideSome of the Licchavis having raised their hands palmtopalm in front of the chest sat to one sideSome of the Licchavis after announcing their name and clan sat to one sideSome of the Licchavis staying silent sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I would like to question Master Gotama on a certain point if Master Gotama would grant me the favor of an answer to the questionAsk Aggivessana as you see fitHow does Master Gotama discipline his disciplesOr what part of his instruction is generally presented to his disciplesAggivessana I discipline my disciples in this way this part of my instruction is generally presented to my disciples Form is inconstantFeeling is inconstantPerception is inconstantFabrications are inconstantConsciousness is inconstantForm is notselfFeeling is notselfPerception is notselfFabrications are notselfConsciousness is notselfAll fabrications are inconstantAll phenomena are notself This Aggivessana is the way in which I discipline my disciples this part of my instruction is generally presented to my disciplesA simile occurs to me Master GotamaLet it occur to you AggivessanaJust as any seeds that exhibit growth increase  proliferation all do so in dependence on the earth or just as any activities requiring strength that are done all are done in dependence on the earth in the same way Master Gotama an individual with form as self taking a stance on form produces merit or demeritAn individual with feeling as self with perception as self with fabrications as self with consciousness as self taking a stance on consciousness produces merit or demeritThen Aggivessana are you saying Form is my self feeling is my self perception is my self fabrications are my self consciousness is my selfYes Master Gotama Im saying that Form is my self feeling is my self perception is my self fabrications are my self consciousness is my self As does this great multitude What does this great multitude have to do with youPlease focus just on your own assertionYes Master Gotama Im saying that Form is my self feeling is my self perception is my self fabrications are my self consciousness is my self Very well then Aggivessana I will crossquestion you on this matterAnswer as you see fitWhat do you thinkWould a consecrated noblewarrior king  such as King Pasenadi of Kosala or King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha  wield the power in his own domain to execute those who deserve execution to fine those who deserve to be fined and to banish those who deserve to be banishedYes Master Gotama he would wield the power in his own domain to execute those who deserve execution to fine those who deserve to be fined and to banish those who deserve to be banishedEven these oligarchic groups such as the Vajjians  Mallans wield the power in their own domains to execute those who deserve execution to fine those who deserve to be fined and to banish those who deserve to be banished to say nothing of a consecrated noblewarrior king such as King Pasenadi of Kosala or King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of MagadhaHe would wield it and he would deserve to wield itWhat do you think AggivessanaWhen you say Form is my self do you wield power over that form May my form be thus may my form not be thusWhen this was said Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason was silentA second time the Blessed One said to Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason What do you think AggivessanaWhen you say Form is my self do you wield power over that form May my form be thus may my form not be thusWhen this was said Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason was silent a second timeThen the Blessed One said to him Answer now AggivessanaThis is not the time to be silentWhen anyone doesnt answer when asked a legitimate question by the Tathāgata up to three times his head splits into seven pieces right hereNow on that occasion the spirit Vajirapāṇin carrying an iron thunderbolt was poised in the air above Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason If Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason doesnt answer when asked a legitimate question by the Blessed One up to three times I will split his head into seven pieces right hereThe Blessed One saw the spirit Vajirapāṇin as did Saccaka the NigaṇṭhasonSo Saccaka  afraid terrified his hair standing on end  seeking shelter in the Blessed One seeking a caveasylum in the Blessed One seeking refuge in the Blessed One  said to the Blessed One Let Master Gotama ask meI will answerWhat do you think AggivessanaWhen you say Form is my self do you wield power over that form May my form be thus may my form not be thusNo Master GotamaPay attention Aggivessana and answer after having paid attentionWhat you said after isnt consistent with what you said before nor is what you said before consistent with what you said afterWhat do you think AggivessanaWhen you say Feeling is my self Perception is my self Fabrications are my self Consciousness is my self do you wield power over that consciousness May my consciousness be thus may my consciousness not be thusNo Master GotamaPay attention Aggivessana and answer after having paid attentionWhat you said after isnt consistent with what you said before nor is what you said before consistent with what you said afterWhat do you think AggivessanaIs form constant or inconstantInconstant Master GotamaAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful Master GotamaAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo Master GotamaIs feeling constant or inconstantInconstant Master GotamaIs perception constant or inconstantInconstant Master GotamaAre fabrications constant or inconstantInconstant Master GotamaWhat do you think AggivessanaIs consciousness constant or inconstantInconstant Master GotamaAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful Master GotamaAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo Master GotamaWhat do you think AggivessanaWhen one adheres to stress holds to stress is attached to stress and envisions of stress that This is mine this is my self this is what I am would he comprehend stress or dwell having totally destroyed stressHow could that be Master GotamaNo Master GotamaThat being the case Aggivessana dont you adhere to stress hold to stress arent you attached to stress and dont you envision of stress that This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amHow could that not be the case Master GotamaYes Master GotamaSuppose a man  in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood  were to enter a forest taking a sharp axThere he would see a large plantain trunk straight young immatureHe would cut it at the root and having cut it at the root cut off the crownHaving cut off the crown he would unfurl the leaf sheathsUnfurling the leaf sheaths he wouldnt even find sapwood there to say nothing of heartwoodIn the same way Aggivessana when you are interrogated rebuked  pressed by me with regard to your own statement you are empty void mistakenBut it was you who made this statement before the assembly in Vesālī I see no contemplative or brahman the head of an order the head of a group or even one who claims to be an arahant rightly selfawakened who  engaged in debate with me  would not shiver quiver shake  break out in sweat under the armpitsEven if I were to engage a senseless stump in debate it  engaged with me in debate  would shiver quiver  shake to say nothing of a human being But now some drops of sweat coming out of your forehead drenching your upper robe are landing on the ground whereas now I have no sweat on my body And the Blessed One uncovered his goldencolored body to the assemblyWhen this was said Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason fell silent abashed sitting with his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for wordsThen Dummukha the Licchavison  sensing that Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason was silent abashed sitting with his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words  said to the Blessed One Lord a simile has occurred to meLet it occur to you Dummukha the Blessed One saidSuppose lord that not far from a village or town was a pondThere in it was a crabThen a number of boys  girls leaving the village or town would go to the pond and on arrival would go down to bathe in itTaking the crab out of the water they would place it on the groundAnd whenever the crab extended a leg the boys or girls would cut it off break it and smash it with sticks or stones right there so that the crab  with all its legs cut off broken  smashed  would be unable to get back in the water as beforeIn the same way whatever Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhasons writhings capers  contortions the Blessed One has cut them off broken them and smashed them all so that Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason is now unable to approach the Blessed One again for the purpose of debateWhen this was said Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason said to Dummukha the Licchavison Just you wait DummukhaJust you wait DummukhaYoure a bigmouth DummukhaWere not taking counsel with youWere here taking counsel with Master Gotama Let that be Master Gotama our words  those of other ordinary contemplatives  brahmans  prattled prattling as it wereNow Master Gotama to what extent is a disciple of Master Gotama one who carries out his message carries out his instruction one who has crossed over  beyond doubt one with no more questioning one who has gained fearlessness and dwells independent of others with regard to the Teachers messageThere is the case Aggivessana where a disciple of mine sees with right discernment any form whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form as it has come to be  as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amHe sees with right discernment any feeling any perception any fabrications any consciousness whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness as it has come to be  as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amIts to this extent Aggivessana that a disciple of mine is one who carries out my message carries out my instruction one who has crossed over  beyond doubt one with no more questioning one who has gained fearlessness and dwells independent of others with regard to the Teachers messageAnd to what extent Master Gotama is a monk an arahant one whose mental effluents are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal laid to waste the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosisThere is the case Aggivessana where a monk  having seen with right discernment any form whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form as it has come to be  as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I am is through lack of clingingsustenance releasedHaving seen with right discernment any feeling any perception any fabrications any consciousness whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness as it has come to be  as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I am he is through lack of clingingsustenance releasedIts to this extent Aggivessana that a monk is an arahant one whose mental effluents are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal laid to waste the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosisOne thus released is endowed with three unsurpassables unsurpassable vision unsurpassable practice unsurpassable releaseAnd a monk whose mind is thus released still honors respects reveres  worships the Tathāgata Awakened the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma for awakeningTamed the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma for tamingTranquil the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma for tranquilityHaving crossed over the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma for crossing overTotally unbound the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma for total UnbindingWhen this was said Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason said to the Blessed One It is we Master Gotama who were insolent we who were reckless in that we construed that Master Gotama could be attacked statement by statementFor there might be safety for a person who has attacked a rutting elephant but there is no safety for a person who has attacked Master GotamaThere might be safety for a person who has attacked a mass of fire but there is no safety for a person who has attacked Master GotamaThere might be safety for a person who has attacked a fanged snake a poisonous snake but there is no safety for a person who has attacked Master GotamaIt is we Master Gotama who were insolent we who were reckless in that we construed that Master Gotama could be attacked statement by statementMay Master Gotama together with the community of monks acquiesce to my offer of tomorrows mealThe Blessed One acquiesced with silenceThen Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason sensing the Blessed Ones acquiescence addressed the Licchavis Listen Master LicchavisGotama the contemplative is invited for tomorrow together with the community of monksOffer to me what you construe to be proper for himThen after the night had passed the Licchavis offered to Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason a food offering of approximately five hundred oblationdishesSaccaka the Nigaṇṭhason after having exquisite staple  nonstaple food prepared in his own monastery announced the time to the Blessed One Its time Master GotamaThe meal is readySo the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his under robe and  carrying his bowl  robes  went together with the community of monks to Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhasons monasteryOn arrival he sat down on a seat laid outSaccaka the Nigaṇṭhason with his own hand served  satisfied the community of monks headed by the Blessed One with exquisite staple  nonstaple foodThen when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason taking a lower seat sat down to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama may the merit and accoutrements of the merit of this gift be exclusively for the happiness of the donorsAggivessana whatever has come from a recipient such as you  not without passion not without aversion not without delusion  that will be for the donorsWhatever has come from a recipient such as me  without passion without aversion without delusion  that will be for youFor more on the Buddhas approach to argument and debate see Skill in Questions chapters one and fiveThis sutta teaches how to understand the relationship of consciousness to rebirth in a way that helps put an end to rebirthAlthough the Buddha never used any word corresponding to rebirth in his teachings he did describe birth as a process following on death again and again as long as the appropriate conditions are presentIn other words even though he didnt use the word rebirth his teachings on birth are teachings on repeated birth how it happens how it inherently involves suffering and stress and how it can be brought to an endThe idea that death can be followed by birth was not universally accepted in India in the Buddhas timeAs DN and MN show some prominent contemplative schools actively rejected the idea of rebirth while others affirmed itThus when the Buddha taught rebirth he wasnt simply following an unexamined cultural assumptionHe was consciously taking a stand on one of the controversial issues of his timeHowever his explanation of rebirth differed from other schools on both sides of the issue in that he avoided the question of whether or not theres a what that gets reborn or if there is a what what it isHe also discouraged such speculations as If I take rebirth what was I in the past and what will I be in the future He put all these questions aside because they interfered with the path of practice leading to the end of sufferingInstead he focused on the process of how birth happens because the process involves factors that are immediately apparent to ones awareness throughout life and lie enough under ones control to turn them toward the ending of birthAn understanding of the process as process  and in particular as an example of the process of dependent coarising  can actually contribute to the end to suffering because it gives guidance in how to apply the tasks appropriate for the four noble truths to all the factors in the process leading up to birthOne of the salient features of dependent coarising is its lack of outside contextIn other words it avoids any reference to the presence or absence of a self around or a world behind the processes it describesThis allows one to focus directly on the factors of the process as factors parts of a causal chainAnd this in turn makes it easier to notice which factors  such as ignorance  cause suffering and should thus be abandoned which ones  such as attention and intention  can be converted to the path to the end of suffering and so should be developed before they too are abandoned and which ones  such as clinging and becoming  constitute suffering and so should be comprehended to the point of disenchantment and dispassion leading to releaseThis sutta concerns a monk  Sāti the Fishermans Son  who refuses to heed the Buddhas care in treating all the elements of the process of wandering on from birth to birth as processesSāti states that in his understanding of the Buddhas teachings consciousness is the what that does the wandering onHis fellow monks and then the Buddha treat him and his erroneous view in a way that parallels the way they treat Ariṭṭha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers in MNFirst the narrator notes that the view is not merely wrong but actually evil and pernicious To adopt it would be to place an obstacle in ones pathThe monks try unsuccessfully to dissuade Sāti from his view after which they report the case to the BuddhaThe Buddha calls Sāti into his presence and after ascertaining that Sāti will not abandon his view even when reprimanded by the Buddha himself he abandons Sāti as too recalcitrant to teach and turns to crossquestion the monks as to the relevant right view of how consciousness functions in the process leading to repeated birthThe Buddhas treatment of Sāti might seem harsh but he is actually acting out of compassion for the monks in the assembly in case any of them might be swayed by Sātis positionSeeing Sāti as a lost cause the Buddha doesnt want this lost cause to cause further losses among the other monksWe have to remember that during the Buddhas lifetime there were no written accounts of his teachings the monks and nuns all had to rely on their memory of what they had heard directly from him or through wordofmouth from fellow members of the SaṅghaThus the Buddha saw the need to establish orthodoxy whenever a member of the Saṅgha was espousing false interpretations of his teachingBecause Sātis pernicious view deals with issues that are much more complex than those touched on in Ariṭṭhas the Buddhas crossquestioning of the monks here is correspondingly longer and more complex than in MNHowever the complexity can be comprehended by keeping in mind that essentially the crossquestioning aims at accomplishing two things at once In providing a correct understanding of consciousness as a conditioned phenomenon it also shows why the sort of question Sāti was trying to answer is illconceivedThe first part of the crossquestioning treats the conditioned nature of consciousness as a process in the context of two frameworks the standard description of the factors of dependent coarising and the four nutriments of consciousnessFollowing the pattern of dependent coarising the Buddha first classifies consciousness in terms of the way it arises in dependence on the six sensemediaThis analysis points to the way consciousness functions as a subfactor under the factor of contact in dependent coarisingIts in dependence on a pair that consciousness comes into playAnd how does consciousness come into play in dependence on a pairIn dependence on the eye  forms there arises eyeconsciousnessThe eye is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseForms are inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseThus this pair is both wavering  fluctuating  inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseEyeconsciousness is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseWhatever is the cause the requisite condition for the arising of eyeconsciousness that is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseHaving arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor how could eyeconsciousness be constantThe coming together the meeting the convergence of these three phenomena is eyecontactThe discussion then switches to consciousness as dependent on four types of nutriment physical food contact intellectual intention and consciousness itselfHere the sutta focuses on the need  in practice  to see this dependence as it actually occurs and on the need to use this view for the proper purposeAs other passages in the Canon point out the purpose of all Dhamma teachings is to induce the disenchantmentdistaste for the nutriment that will allow for releaseFor a monk practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma this is what accords with the Dhamma that he keep cultivating disenchantmentdistaste with regard to form feeling perception fabrications consciousnessAs he keeps cultivating disenchantmentdistaste with regard to form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousnessAs he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he is totally released from form feeling perception fabrications consciousnessHe is totally released from sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairsHe is totally released I tell you from suffering  stress Just as the ocean has a single taste  that of salt  in the same way this DhammaVinaya has a single taste that of releaseIn other words the ability of the monks to give in unison the right answers to the Buddhas questions does not fulfill the teachings purposeThe right answers are meant to be used as tools to induce a sense of disenchantmentdistaste for continued feeding on the processes leading to sufferingThis sense of disenchantmentdistaste is what leads to releaseThe reference to the raft analogy here is another point on which this sutta parallels MN in which the monks also give correct answers in unison to the Buddhas questionsPerhaps the reason for why the raft analogy is cited in both suttas is that it was seen as a corrective for the sort of complacency that can come when one can recite with others an orthodox viewAt any rate the discussion of consciousness in the framework of nutriment is then tied into the discussion of dependent coarising through the fact that nutriment is dependent on cravingThis places nutriment in the position of clingingsustenance in dependent coarising  as dependent on craving and acting as a condition for becomingThis placement is affirmed by passages elsewhere in the Canon that speak of consciousness plus its nutriment as among the subfactors providing the conditions for further becomingKamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moistureThe consciousness of living beings hindered by ignorance  fettered by craving is established intuned to a lower property a middling property a refined propertyThus there is the production of renewed becoming in the futureThis is how there is becoming Like the earth property monks is how the four standingspots for consciousness should be seenLike the liquid property is how delight  passion should be seenLike the five types of propagation is how consciousness together with its nutriment should be seen Given that consciousness also functions at a point in dependent coarising prior to sensory contact  as following on fabrication and preceding nameandform  it thus plays a role at three stages in the process as a factor following on fabrication as a subfactor of contact and as a subfactor of clingingThe remainder of the Buddhas crossquestioning of the monks further explores the framework of dependent coarising arriving at the conclusion that a person thus trained in understanding dependent coarising would no longer be interested in pursuing questions of identity and existence  such as Am I Am I not What am I What was I What will I be This is because as MN points out such questions are instances of inappropriate attention and as SNpoints out the framework of dependent coarising classes inappropriate attention under the factor of name as a cause of sufferingThus the discussion arrives at the reasons why the Buddha was so careful to put the sort of question asked and answered by Sāti asideThe sutta then turns to the path of practice by which an understanding of dependent coarising can gain the power and focus needed to put an end to sufferingIt begins with an account of birth noting that the birth of a human being requires not only that the parents have intercourse when the mother is in her season but also that a gandhabba is presentUsually in the Canon the term gandhabba means a being on the lowest level of the celestial devas  devas who are often represented as obsessed with lustHowever the Commentary notes that gandhabba in this context means a being whose kamma enables it to take birth on that occasion an interpretation supported by a discussion in MNBy introducing a being into the discussion the Buddha might be suspected of introducing a what into his discussion of birthHowever on the level of dependent coarising the Buddha did not treat the concept of a being as a what His definition of a being shows that he recommended that it too be regarded as a processAs he was sitting there VenRādha said to the Blessed One A being lordA being its saidTo what extent is one said to be a beingAny desire passion delight or craving for form Rādha When one is caught up there tied up there one is said to be a beingAny desire passion delight or craving for feeling perception fabricationsAny desire passion delight or craving for consciousness Rādha When one is caught up there tied up there one is said to be a being Thus the Buddha advocated viewing a being simply as a process of attachment to desire passion delight and cravingAnd it is precisely this attachment to craving that allows for rebirth after deathJust as a fire burns with sustenance and not without sustenance even so I designate the rebirth of one who has sustenance and not of one without sustenanceBut Master Gotama at the moment a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance what do you designate as its sustenance thenVaccha when a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance I designate it as windsustained for the wind is its sustenance at that timeAnd at the moment when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body what do you designate as its sustenance thenVaccha when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body I designate it as cravingsustained for craving is its sustenance at that time However a being  in the Buddhas sense of the term  not only takes birth after the death of the body it can also take birth die and be reborn many times in the course of a day  as attachment develops for one desire ends and then develops for another desireThis is why the processes leading to rebirth after death can be observed and redirected in the present moment during lifeThis is why the ability to understand and observe the processes of dependent coarising is so important in putting an end to rebirth on all its many levelsTo emphasize the desirability of putting an end to rebirth the sutta moves from the topic of conception to note the pains and anxieties suffered by the mother in carrying the fetus and giving birthBut then what does her child doHe spends his time in trivial pursuits childish games and then as he grows older the quest for sensual pleasuresIf the child  now an adult  realizes the limited nature of such an existence he gains conviction in the need to practice the DhammaHe becomes a monk develops virtue and concentration and then on the basis of his attainment in concentration he approaches the senses in a way that overcomes the limitations experienced by one who approaches them simply for the pursuit of sensual pleasureThis the Buddha says is a short description of the destruction of craving  and by implication of the ending of the consciousness and the birth that depend on craving as a conditionOne of the ironies in the organization of the sutta is that after a long detailed discussion of discernment virtue and concentration the description of how these factors actually are brought together to arrive at the end of craving and birth leaves out many important detailsFor instance there is no discussion of how once the monk has attained concentration he uses it wisely in such a way that actually puts an end to cravingAs the Buddha states in other suttas  such as MN MN and AN it is possible to attain strong states of concentration and use them not as a basis of release but as a basis for increased defilement and attachmentThis means that the Buddha is not being coy when he states at the end of this long sutta that his discussion of the destruction of craving is briefIts up to the reader to put the elements of triple training together in practice to see how they lead from a limited awareness through a limitless awareness to total releaseI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas parkNow on that occasion this pernicious viewpoint had arisen in the monk Sāti the Fishermans Son As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not another A large number of monks heard They say that this pernicious viewpoint has arisen in the monk Sāti the Fishermans Son As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not another So they went to the monk Sāti the Fishermans Son and on arrival said to him Is it true friend Sāti that this pernicious viewpoint has arisen in you  As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not anotherExactly so friendsI understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One such that it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not anotherThen those monks desiring to pry the monk Sāti the Fishermans Son away from that pernicious viewpoint quizzed him back  forth and rebuked him saying Dont say that friend SātiDont slander the Blessed One for it is not good to slander the Blessed OneThe Blessed One would not say anything like thatIn many ways friend the Blessed One has said of dependently coarisen consciousness Apart from a requisite condition there is no comingintoplay of consciousness And yet even though he was quizzed back  forth and rebuked by those monks the monk Sāti the Fishermans Son through stubbornness and attachment to that very same pernicious viewpoint continued to insist Exactly so friendsI understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One such that it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not anotherSo when the monks were unable to pry the monk Sāti the Fishermans Son away from that pernicious viewpoint they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there theySo the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monkIn my name call the monk Sāti the Fishermans Son saying The Teacher calls you friend Sāti As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to the monk Sāti the Fishermans Son on arrival he said The Teacher calls you friend SātiAs you say friend the monk Sāti the Fishermans Son repliedThen he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Sāti that this pernicious view has arisen in you  As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not anotherExactly so lordAs I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not anotherWhich consciousness Sāti is that This speaker this knower lord that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  evil actionsThen the Blessed One said to the monks What do you think monksIs this monk Sāti the Fishermans Son even warm in this Dhamma  VinayaHow could he be lordNo lordWhen this was said the monk Sāti the Fishermans Son sat silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for wordsThen the Blessed One seeing that the monk Sāti the Fishermans Son was sitting silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words said to him Worthless man you will be recognized for your own pernicious viewpointI will crossquestion the monks on this matterThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks do you too understand the Dhamma as taught by me in the same way that the monk Sāti the Fishermans Son does when through his own poor grasp he not only slanders us but also digs himself up and produces much demerit for himselfNo lord for in many ways the Blessed One has said of dependently coarisen consciousness Apart from a requisite condition there is no comingintoplay of consciousness Its good monks that you understand the Dhamma taught by me in this way for in many ways I have said of dependently coarisen consciousness Apart from a requisite condition there is no comingintoplay of consciousness But this monk Sāti the Fishermans Son through his own poor grasp has not only slandered us but has also dug himself up producing much demerit for himselfThat will lead to this worthless mans longterm harm  sufferingConsciousness monks is classified simply by the requisite

it was saidThen for nine or ten months the mother shelters the embryo in her womb with great anxiety as a heavy burdenThen at the end of nine or ten months she gives birth with great anxiety as a heavy burdenThen when the child is born she feeds it with her own blood  for mothers milk is called blood in the discipline of the noble onesThen as the child grows and his faculties mature he plays

a polished shellWhat if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessnessSo after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessnessWhen he has thus gone forth

Fishermans Son as tied up in the great net of craving the great tangle of cravingThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThe Buddha knowing that there are two types of consciousness  the consciousness aggregate which is experienced in conjunction with the six sense media and consciousness without surface which is experienced independently of the six sense media  is here giving Sāti the chance to identify which of the two types he has interpreted as running and wandering onSātis answer shows that he is talking about the first typeThe remaining discussion of consciousness throughout this sutta is thus directed at this first typeIt would have been interesting to see how the Buddha would have attacked Sātis misunderstanding had Sāti stated that he was talking about the secondOn the topic of consciousness without surface see DN note and MN noteThe Pali here is Nanu mayā moghapurisa anekapariyāyena paṭiccasamuppannaṃ viññāṇaṃ vuttaṃ Aññatra paccayā natthi viññāṇassa sambhavotiIf the first part of this sentence were a complete sentence its syntax  putting the topic of what is described in the accusative followed by the word vuttaṃ plus the speaker in the instrumental  could be translated in line with either of two patternsAn example of the first pattern is in SN Paṭiccasamuppannaṃ kho ānanda dukkhaṃ vuttaṃ mayā  nanda stress has been described by me as dependently coarisen In other words the pattern is X has been described as Y by the speakerAn example of the second pattern is in AN Sekhampi kho mahānāma sīlaṃ vuttaṃ bhagavatā asekhampi sīlaṃ vuttaṃ bhagavatā  Mahānāma the virtue of one in training has been described by the Blessed One and the virtue of one beyond training has been described by the Blessed One This pattern is X has been described by the speaker Another example of this pattern is in SN Idaṃ kho gahapati dhātunānattaṃ vuttaṃ bhagavatā cakkhudhātu rūpadhātu cakkhuviññāṇadhātu manodhātu dhammadhātu manoviññāṇadhātu  Householder this diversity of properties has been described by the Blessed One eyeproperty form property eyeconsciousness property intellectproperty idea property intellectconsciousness property Again X has been described by the speakerTo make a literal translation of the entire passage here in line with the first pattern would yield Worthless man hasnt consciousness been described as dependently coarisen by me in many ways Apart from a requisite condition there is no comingintoplay of consciousnessTo make a literal translation in line with the second pattern would yield Worthless man hasnt dependently coarisen consciousness been described by me in many ways Apart from a requisite condition there is no comingintoplay of consciousnessThe translator of MLS renders the sentence both waysWhen it earlier appears in the mouths of the monks reprimanding Sāti she renders it in line with the first pattern For reverend Sāti in many a figure is conditioned genesis spoken of in connection with consciousness by the Lord saying Apart from condition there is no origination of consciousness When the sentence appears in the Buddhas mouth she renders it in line with the second pattern Foolish man has not consciousness generated by conditions been spoken of in many a figure by me saying Apart from condition there is no origination of consciousnessThe translators of MLDB consistently follow the first pattern in rendering this sentence Misguided man have I not stated in many ways consciousness to be dependently arisen since without a condition there is no origination of consciousness around the sentence beginning Apart from or without More on this belowThe substantive difference in these two patterns is that the first could be taken as implying that all consciousness is dependently coarisen whereas the second states explicitly that the Buddhas words Apart from condition there is no origination of consciousness apply specifically to one type of consciousness  consciousness arising in dependence on the coarising of conditions  leaving open the possibility that there is another type of consciousness to which these words do not applyArguing from translations rendered in line with the first pattern people have asserted that the two passages in the Canon referring to consciousness without surface are not in keeping with the principle expressed here that all consciousness is dependently coarisenThus the argument continues those two passages cannot be accepted as coming genuinely from the Buddha whereas this passage in MN definitely canThere are three main problems with this argumentThe first is that throughout the suttas when consciousness as an active agent is discussed without modifiers it is always with reference to the consciousness aggregate as that is the sort of consciousness occurring within the territory delimited by the way the Buddha explicitly defines the term allThat is clearly the topic of discussion hereConsciousness without surface is discussed explicitly only in passages where the Buddha is citing the superiority of his attainment over that of brahmas In knowing this sort of consciousness which performs no active role and lies outside of the term all he knows something that brahmas do notAt the same time to lie outside of the consciousness aggregate it would also have to lie outside of the dimensions of time and space as that aggregate is defined as covering all consciousness past future and present far and nearBecause the consciousness discussed in this sutta is an active agent functions within the dimensions of time and space and definitely lies within the term all all references can be understood to apply solely to the consciousness aggregateWhat this means is that even if we were to follow the first pattern in translating this sentence  if it were a sentence  we would not have to adopt the argument drawn from it the people advancing this argument force the passage to say more than it actually says when taken in the context of the suttas as a wholeSecond it is a poor interpretative strategy to give unnecessary privilege to one passage of the Canon at the expense of two others when we have no way of proving which passages in the suttas are most authenticThis is especially true in light of the fact that the passage here  even if we took it as a complete sentence  would not demand a single unequivocal interpretationTo force such an interpretation on it knowing that that would discredit other passages as inauthentic is unfair to the textsThe third problem with the argument for using this passage to reject DN and MN however is the most telling The first part of the above sentence is not a complete sentenceIt is followed by a passage in quotation marks Aññatra paccayā natthi viññāṇassa sambhavoti The only way to make sense of this punctuation is to take this passage in quotation marks as constituting what is said about X as named in the first part of the sentenceIn other words this constitutes the description that the Buddha has made about dependentlycoarisen consciousnessThe second pattern is the only one that make sense in this context Worthless man hasnt dependently coarisen consciousness been described by me in many ways Apart from a requisite condition there is no comingintoplay of consciousnessThus it is clear that the Buddha here is discussing dependently coarisen consciousness in a way that does not preclude the possibility that there is also a consciousness that lies beyond the six sensemedia is not dependently coarisen and is neither momentary nor eternal as it stands outside the dimension of timeGandhabba usually means a low level of celestial devaDevas on this level are frequently represented in the Canon as obsessed with sexual desireHowever the Commentary here notes that gandhabba here does not mean a being standing near watching the couple have sexual intercourseRather it means the being driven by kamma who will take birth on that occasionThis interpretation is seconded by a passage in MN which builds on the brahman assumption that a person maintains the same caste from one life to the next Do you know how there is the descent of an embryo Yes master we know how there is the descent of an embryoThere is the case where the mother  father have come together the mother is fertile and a gandhabba is standing presentThe coming together of these three is the descent of the embryoBut do you know for sure whether the gandhabba is a noble warrior a brahman a merchant or a workerNo masterThat being the case do you know who you areThat being the case master we dont know who we areI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said Monks a cowherd endowed with eleven factors is incapable of looking after a herd so that it prospers  growsWhich elevenThere is the case where a cowherd is not wellversed in forms unskilled in characteristics doesnt pick out flies eggs doesnt dress wounds doesnt fumigate doesnt know fords doesnt know what it is to have drunk doesnt know the road is not skilled in pastures milks dry and shows no extra respect for the bulls who are fathers  leaders of the herdA cowherd endowed with these eleven factors is incapable of looking after a herd so that it prospers  growsA monk endowed with these eleven factors is incapable of attaining growth increase  abundance in this DhammaVinayaWhich elevenThere is the case where a monk is not wellversed in forms unskilled in characteristics doesnt pick out flies eggs doesnt dress wounds doesnt fumigate doesnt know fords doesnt know what it is to have drunk doesnt know the road is not skilled in pastures milks dry and shows no extra respect for the elder monks with seniority who have been ordained long who are fathers  leaders of the CommunityAnd how is a monk not wellversed in formsThere is the case where a monk does not discern as it actually is that every form whatsoever is composed of the four great existents and the forms dependent on themThis is how a monk is not wellversed in formsAnd how is a monk unskilled in characteristicsThere is the case where a monk does not discern as it actually is that a fool is characterized by his actions a wise person is characterized by his actionsThis is how a monk is unskilled in characteristicsAnd how does a monk not pick out flies eggsThere is the case where a monk acquiesces with an arisen thought of sensualityHe does not abandon it dispel it or wipe it out of existenceHe acquiesces with an arisen thought of ill will an arisen thought of harmfulnessHe does not abandon it dispel it or wipe it out of existenceHe acquiesces with arisen evil unskillful qualitiesHe doesnt abandon them dispel them demolish them or wipe the out of existenceThis is how a monk doesnt pick out flies eggsAnd how does a monk not dress woundsThere is the case where a monk on seeing a form with the eye grasps at themes or details by which  as he dwells without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himHe doesnt practice for its restraintHe doesnt protect the faculty of the eyeOn hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odor with the nose On tasting a flavor with the tongue On touching a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect he grasps at themes or details by which  as he

with these eleven factors is capable of attaining growth increase  abundance in this DhammaVinayaThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryThen a number of monks from the native land having completed the Rains Retreat in the native land went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them Monks whom in our native land do the nativeland monks  his companions in the holy life  esteem in this way Having few wants himself he gives talks to the monks on fewness of wantsContented himself he gives talks to the monks on contentmentSecluded himself he gives talks to the monks on seclusionUnentangled himself he gives talks to the monks on nonentanglementHaving aroused persistence in himself he gives talks to the monks on arousing persistenceConsummate in his own virtue he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in virtueConsummate in his own concentration he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in concentrationConsummate in his own discernment he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in discernmentConsummate in his own release he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in releaseConsummate in his own knowledge  vision of release he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in the knowledge  vision of releaseHe is one who exhorts informs instructs urges rouses  encourages his companions in the holy life Lord the monk named Punna Mantaniputta is esteemed by the nativeland monks  his companions in the holy life  in this way Having few wants himself he gives talks to the monks on fewness of wantsContented himself he gives talks to the monks on contentmentSecluded himself he gives talks to the monks on seclusionUnentangled himself he gives talks to the monks on nonentanglementHaving aroused persistence in himself he gives talks to the monks on arousing persistenceConsummate in his own virtue he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in virtueConsummate in his own concentration he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in concentrationConsummate in his own discernment he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in discernmentConsummate in his own release he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in releaseConsummate in his own knowledge  vision of release he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in the knowledge  vision of releaseHe is one who exhorts informs instructs urges rouses  encourages his companions in the holy life Now at that time VenSariputta was sitting not far from the Blessed OneThe thought occurred to him Its a gain a great gain for VenPunna Mantaniputta that his knowledgeable companions in the holy life speak his praise point by point in the presence of the Teacher and that the Teacher seconds that praiseMaybe sometime or other I too will go to meet with VenPunna Mantaniputta maybe Ill have some conversation with himThen the Blessed One having stayed at Rajagaha as long as he liked set out wandering to SavatthiWandering by stages he arrived there and stayed in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryVenPunna Mantaniputta heard The Blessed One has arrived at Savatthi and is staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monastery Setting his lodgings in order and taking his robes  bowl he set out wandering to SavatthiWandering by stages he went to where the Blessed One was staying in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryOn arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged him with a Dhamma talkThen VenPunna  instructed urged roused  encouraged with the Blessed Ones Dhamma talk delighting  approving of the Blessed Ones words  got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him and went to the Grove of the Blind for the days abidingThen a certain monk went to VenSariputta and on arrival said to him Friend Sariputta the monk named Punna Mantaniputta whom you have so often praised  instructed urged roused  encouraged with the Blessed Ones Dhamma talk delighting  approving of the Blessed Ones words  has gotten up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him and has gone to the Grove of the Blind for the days abiding So VenSariputta quickly picked up a sitting cloth and followed right behind VenPunna keeping his head in sightVenPunna plunged into the Grove of the Blind and sat down in the shade of a tree for the days abidingVenSariputta also plunged into the Grove of the Blind and sat down in the shade of a tree for the days abidingThen in the evening VenSariputta arose from his seclusion and went to VenPunnaOn arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenPunna My friend is the holy life lived under the Blessed OneYes my friendAnd is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of virtueNo my friendThen is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of mindNo my friendThen is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of viewNo my friendThen is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of the overcoming of perplexityNo my friendThen is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge  vision of what is  is not the pathNo my friendThen is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge  vision of the wayNo my friendThen is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge  visionNo my friendWhen asked if the holy life is lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of virtue you say No my friend When asked if the holy life is lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of mind view the overcoming of perplexity knowledge  vision of what is  is not the path knowledge  vision of the way knowledge  vision you say No my friend For the sake of what then my friend is the holy life lived under the Blessed OneThe holy life is lived under the Blessed One my friend for the sake of total Unbinding through lack of clingingBut is purity in terms of virtue total Unbinding through lack of clingingNo my friendThen is purity in terms of mind view the overcoming of perplexity knowledge  vision of what is  is not the path knowledge  vision of the way knowledge  vision total Unbinding through lack of clingingNo my friendThen is total Unbinding through lack of clinging something apart from these qualitiesNo my friendWhen asked if purity in terms of virtue mind view the overcoming of perplexity knowledge  vision of what is  is not the path knowledge  vision of the way knowledge  vision is total Unbinding through lack of clinging you say No my friend But when asked if total Unbinding through lack of clinging is something apart from these qualities you say No my friend Now how my friend is the meaning of these statements to be understoodIf the Blessed One had described purity in terms of virtue as total Unbinding through lack of clinging my friend then he would have defined something still accompanied by clinging as total Unbinding through lack of clingingIf he had described purity in terms of mind view the overcoming of perplexity knowledge  vision of what is  is not the path knowledge  vision of the way knowledge  vision as total Unbinding through lack of clinging then he would have defined something still accompanied by clinging as total Unbinding through lack of clingingBut if total Unbinding through lack of clinging were apart from these qualities then a runofthemill person would be totally unbound inasmuch as a runofthemill person is apart from these qualitiesSo my friend I will give you an analogy for there are cases where its through analogies that knowledgeable people can understand the meaning of what is being saidSuppose that while King Pasenadi Kosala was staying at Savatthi some urgent business were to arise at Saketa and that between Savatthi and Saketa seven relay chariots were made ready for himComing out the door of the inner palace in Savatthi he would get in the first relay chariotBy means of the first relay chariot he would reach the second relay chariotGetting out of the first relay chariot he would get in the second relay chariotBy means of the second relay chariot he would reach the third by means of the third he would reach the fourth by means of the fourth the fifth by means of the fifth the sixth by means of the sixth he would reach the seventh relay chariotGetting out of the sixth relay chariot he would get in the seventh relay chariotBy means of the seventh relay chariot he would finally arrive at the door of the inner palace at SaketaAs he arrived there his friends  companions relatives  kin would ask him Great king did you come from Savatthi to the door of the inner palace in Saketa by means of this chariot Answering in what way my friend would King Pasenadi Kosala answer them correctlyAnswering in this way my friend he would answer them correctly Just now as I was staying at Savatthi some urgent business arose at Saketa and between Savatthi and Saketa seven relay chariots were made ready for meComing out the door of the inner palace in Savatthi I got in the first relay chariotBy means of the first relay chariot I reached the second relay chariotGetting out of the first relay chariot I got in the second relay chariotBy means of the second relay chariot I reached the third by means of the third I reached the fourth by means of the fourth the fifth by means of the fifth the sixth by means of the sixth I reached the seventh relay chariotGetting out of the sixth relay chariot I got in the seventh relay chariotBy means of the seventh relay chariot I finally arrived at the door of the inner palace at Saketa Answering in this way he would answer them correctlyIn the same way my friend purity in terms of virtue is simply for the sake of purity in terms of mindPurity in terms of mind is simply for the sake of purity in terms of viewPurity in terms of view is simply for the sake of purity in terms of the overcoming of perplexityPurity in terms of the overcoming of perplexity is simply for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge  vision of what is  is not the pathPurity in terms of knowledge  vision of what is  is not the path is simply for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge  vision of the wayPurity in terms of knowledge  vision of the way is simply for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge  visionPurity in terms of knowledge  vision is simply for the sake of total Unbinding through lack of clingingAnd its for the sake of total Unbinding through lack of clinging that the holy life is lived under the Blessed OneWhen this was said VenSariputta said to VenPunna Mantaniputta What is your name friend and how do your companions in the holy life know youMy name is Punna friend and my companions in the holy life know me as MantaniputtaHow amazing my friend how astounding that VenPunna Mantaniputta has answered point by point with profound profound discernment in the manner of a learned disciple who has rightly understood the Teachers messageIts a gain a great gain for any of his companions in the holy life who get to see him and visit with himEven if they had to carry him around on a cushion placed on top of their heads in order to see him and visit with him it would be a gain for them a great gainAnd the fact that I have gotten to see him and visit with him has been a gain a great gain for meWhen this was said VenPunna said to VenSariputta And what is your name friend and how do your companions in the holy life know youMy name is Upatissa friend and my companions in the holy life know me as SariputtaWhatIve been talking with the disciple who is like the Teacher himself without knowing that it is VenSariputtaHad I known it was VenSariputta I wouldnt have answered at such lengthHow amazing my friend how astounding that VenSariputta has questioned point by point with profound profound discernment in the manner of a learned disciple who has rightly understood the Teachers messageIts a gain a great gain for any of his companions in the holy life who get to see him and visit with himEven if they had to carry him around on a cushion placed on top of their heads in order to see him and visit with him it would be a gain for them a great gainAnd the fact that I have gotten to see him and visit with him has been a gain a great gain for meIn this way did both great beings rejoice in each others good wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryNow at that time Janussonin the brahman was driving out of Savatthi in the middle of the day in a totally white roofedchariotHe saw Pilotika the wanderer coming from afar and on seeing him said to him Now where is Master Vacchayana coming from in the middle of the daySir I have come here from the presence of Gotama the contemplativeAnd what does a wise person think about Gotama the contemplatives acuity of discernmentSir who am I to know Gotama the contemplatives acuity of discernmentWouldnt one have to be his equal to know his acuity of discernmentMaster Vacchayana praises Gotama the contemplative with lavish praise indeedSir who am I to praise Gotama the contemplativeHe is praised by the praised as the best of beings human  divineSeeing what reasons does Master Vacchayana have such high confidence in Gotama the contemplativeSir suppose an elephant hunter were to enter an elephant forest and were to see there a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in widthHe would come to the conclusion What a big bull elephant In the same way when I saw four footprints in Gotama the contemplative I came to the conclusion The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples has practiced rightly Which fourThere is the case where I see certain noble warriors who are pundits subtle skilled in debate like hairsplitting marksmenThey prowl about as it were shooting philosophical positions to pieces with their dialecticThey hear Gotama the contemplative they say will visit that village or town They formulate a question thus Having gone to Gotama the contemplative we will ask him this question of oursIf having been asked like this he answers like this we will refute his teaching like thisAnd if having been asked like this he answers like that we will refute his teaching like thatThey hear Gotama the contemplative is visiting that village or town They go to him and he instructs urges rouses  encourages them with a talk on DhammaHaving been instructed urged roused  encouraged by him with a talk on Dhamma they dont even ask him their question so since when could they refute himAs it turns out they become his disciplesWhen I saw this first footprint in Gotama the contemplative I came to the conclusion The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples has practiced rightlyThen there is the case where I see certain brahmansThen there is the case where I see certain householdersThen there is the case where I see certain contemplatives who are pundits subtle skilled in debate like hairsplitting marksmenThey prowl about as it were shooting philosophical positions to pieces with their dialecticThey hear Gotama the contemplative they say will visit that village or town They formulate a question thus Having gone to Gotama the contemplative we will ask him this question of oursIf having been asked like this he answers like this we will refute his teaching like thisAnd if having been asked like this he answers like that we will refute his teaching like thatThey hear Gotama the contemplative is visiting that village or town They go to him and he instructs urges rouses  encourages them with a talk on DhammaHaving been instructed urged roused  encouraged by him with a talk on Dhamma they dont even ask him their question so since when could they refute himAs it turns out they ask him for the opportunity to go forth from the home life into homelessnessHe gives them the GoingforthHaving gone forth there  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  they in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for themselves in the here  nowThey say How near we were to being lostHow near we were to being lostBefore though we werent contemplatives we claimed to be contemplativesThough we werent brahmans we claimed to be brahmansThough we werent arahants we claimed to be arahantsBut now we are contemplatives now we are brahmans now we are arahantsWhen I saw this fourth footprint in Gotama the contemplative I came to the conclusion The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples has practiced rightlyWhen this was said Janussonin the brahman got down from his totally white roofedchariot and  arranging his upper robe over one shoulder and extending his hands in reverent salutation in the direction of the Blessed One  exclaimed this exclamation three timesHomage to the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakenedHomage to the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakenedHomage to the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakenedMay I at some time or another meet with Master GotamaMay there be some conversationThen Janussonin the brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he told the Blessed One the entirety of his conversation with Pilotika the wandererWhen he was finished the Blessed One said to him Its not to that extent brahman that the elephant footprint simile is complete in its detailsAs to how it is complete in its details listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say sir Janussonin the brahman respondedThe Blessed One said Suppose an elephant hunter were to enter an elephant forest and were to see there a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in widthA skilled elephant hunter would not yet come to the conclusion What a big bull elephant Why is thatBecause in an elephant forest there are dwarf female elephants with big feetThe footprint might be one of theirsSo he follows along and sees in the elephant forest a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in width and some scratch marks high upA skilled elephant hunter would not yet come to the conclusion What a big bull elephant Why is thatBecause in an elephant forest there are tall female elephants with prominent teeth  big feetThe footprint might be one of theirsSo he follows along and sees in the elephant forest a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in width with some scratch marks and tusk slashes high upA skilled elephant hunter would not yet come to the conclusion What a big bull elephant Why is thatBecause in an elephant forest there are tall female elephants with tusks  big feetThe footprint might be one of theirsSo he follows along and sees in the elephant forest a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in width with some scratch marks and tusk slashes high up and some brokenoff branchesAnd he sees that bull elephant at the foot of the tree or in an open clearing walking standing sitting or lying downHe comes to the conclusion Thats the big bull elephantIn the same way brahman there is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakenedHe teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its endHe proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pureA householder or householders son hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects Household life is confining a dusty pathLife gone forth is the open airIt isnt easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shellWhat if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessnessSo after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessnessWhen he has thus gone forth endowed with the monks training  livelihood then  abandoning the taking of life  he abstains from the taking of lifeHe dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beingsAbandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not givenHe takes only what is given accepts only what is given lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pureThis too is part of his virtueAbandoning uncelibacy he lives a celibate life aloof refraining from the sexual act that is the villagers wayAbandoning false speech he abstains from false speechHe speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the worldAbandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speechWhat he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people hereWhat he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people thereThus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concordAbandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speechHe speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing and pleasing to people at largeAbandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatterHe speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma and the VinayaHe speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goalHe abstains from damaging seed and plant lifeHe eats only once a day refraining from the evening meal and from food at the wrong time of dayHe abstains from dancing singing instrumental music and from watching showsHe abstains from wearing garlands and from beautifying himself with scents and cosmeticsHe abstains from high and luxurious beds and seatsHe abstains from accepting gold and moneyHe abstains from accepting uncooked grain raw meat women and girls male and female slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle steeds and mares fields and propertyHe abstains from running messages from buying and selling from dealing with false scales false metals and false measures from bribery deception and fraudHe abstains from mutilating executing imprisoning highway robbery plunder and violenceHe is content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hungerJust as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hungerWherever he goes he takes only his barest necessities alongEndowed with this noble aggregate of virtue he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blamelessOn seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himOn hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odor with the nose On tasting a flavor with the tongue On touching a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himEndowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blamelessWhen going forward and returning he acts with alertnessWhen looking toward and looking away when bending and extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe and his bowl when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and remaining silent he acts with alertnessEndowed with this noble aggregate of virtue this noble restraint over the sense faculties this noble mindfulness  alertness he seeks out a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of strawAfter his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the foreAbandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousnessHe cleanses his mind of covetousnessAbandoning ill will and anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beingsHe cleanses his mind of ill will and angerAbandoning sloth and drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness mindful alert percipient of lightHe cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsinessAbandoning restlessness and anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilledHe cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxietyAbandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualitiesHe cleanses his mind of uncertaintyHaving abandoned these five hindrances  imperfections of awareness that weaken discernment  then quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluationThis brahman is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata but a disciple of the noble ones would not yet come to the conclusion The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples has practiced rightlyThen with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure onepointedness of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assuranceThis too is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata but a disciple of the noble ones would not yet come to the conclusion The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples has practiced rightlyThen with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abidingThis too is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata but a disciple of the noble ones would not yet come to the conclusion The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples has practiced rightlyThen with the abandoning of pleasure and pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainThis too is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata but a disciple of the noble ones would not yet come to the conclusion The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples has practiced rightlyWith his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past livesHe recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and detailsThis too is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata but a disciple of the noble ones would not yet come to the conclusion The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples has practiced rightlyWith his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beingsHe sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and

knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentationsHe discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentationsThis too is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the TathagataA disciple of the noble ones has not yet come to conclusion but he comes to the conclusion The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples has practiced rightlyHis heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis too is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata and it is here that a disciple of the noble ones has come to conclusion The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples has practiced rightly When this was said Janussonin the brahman said to the Blessed One Magnificent lordMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monksMay the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeThe sentence stating that the streamenterer has come to a conclusion without coming to conclusion is a play on wordsThe idiomatic expression for coming to a conclusion  nittham gacchati  can also mean coming to a finish reaching completion or coming to an endTo distinguish these two meanings the text here uses the form nitthangato to mean having come to a finish and nittham gacchati to mean coming to a conclusionThis particular way of distinguishing the meanings however is not adhered to consistently across the CanonOn the one hand Dhp  like this sutta  uses the word nitthangato to describe an arahantOn the other a series of suttas beginning at AN some lay disciples are each described as tathaagate nitthangato which could either mean that they have come to a definite conclusion about the Tathagata or that they have finished their training under the TathagataSome of the disciples named in these suttas  such as Citta Mahanama Ugga Anathapindika and Jivaka Komarabhacca  are in other parts of the Canon described as streamwinners or nonreturnersHowever the description of their attainment here contains a mixture of terms some normally associated with streamentry some with arahantshipThe pattern of the suttas is this Endowed with six qualities Tapussa the householder has come to conclusion in the Tathagata seen the deathless and goes about having realized the deathlessWhich sixVerified confidence in the Buddha verified confidence in the Dhamma verified confidence in the Sangha noble virtue noble knowledge noble release Of these six qualities the first four are normally associated with streamentry the last two with arahantshipIt may be that the last two are meant here in a nontechnical sense which would mean that nitthangato here means simply coming to a definite conclusion about the TathagataANplays with the two meanings of nittha in another wayThe Buddha describes ten types of individuals all of whom he says are nitthangataa in me In this case nitthangato would simply mean having come to a definite conclusionOf the ten types he adds the nitthaa  or completion of the training  of five occurs here in the human realm the nitthaa of five occurs away from hereIn the first five he includes three types of streamwinners oncereturners and those who attain arahantship in the present lifeIn the latter five he includes five types of nonreturnersThus as with the suttas in AN VI nitthangato here means simply coming to a definite conclusion about the TathagataAnd the lack of consistency surrounding this term in the suttas suggests that it is not a technical termThis would confirm the impression the two meanings of nittha are used more as an opportunity for word play a game in which inconsistency is not a viceFor more on word play in the Canon see The Atthakavagga An IntroductionI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen Piṅgalakoccha the brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama these contemplatives  brahmans each with his group each with his community each the teacher of his group an honored leader wellregarded by people at large  ie Pūraṇa Kassapa Makkhali Gosāla Ajita Kesakambalin Pakudha Kaccāyana Sañjaya Velaṭṭhaputta  the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim or do they all not have direct knowledge or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them notEnough brahmanPut this question asideI will teach you the DhammaListen and pay close attentionI will speakYes sir Piṅgalakoccha the brahman responded to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One said Brahman its as if a man in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of

remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationThis is a quality higher  more sublime than knowledge  visionFurthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceThis too is a quality higher  more sublime than knowledge  visionFurthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding This too is a quality higher  more sublime than knowledge  visionFurthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  he enters  remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainThis too is a quality higher  more sublime than

have as its reward consummation of virtue doesnt have as its reward consummation of concentration doesnt have as its reward knowledge  vision but the unprovoked awarenessrelease That is the purpose of this holy life that is its heartwood that its final endWhen this was said Piṅgalakoccha the brahman said to the Blessed One Magnificent lordMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monksMay the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeAkuppaThis term is sometimes translated as unshakable but it literally means unprovoked The reference is apparently to the theory of dhātu or properties underlying physical or psychological events in natureThe physical properties according to this theory are four earth liquid heat and windThree of them  liquid heat  wind  are potentially activeWhen they are aggravated agitated or provoked  the Pali term here pakuppati is used also on the psychological level where it means angered or upset  they act as the underlying cause for natural activityWhen the provocation ends the corresponding activity subsidesNow there comes a time friends when the external liquid property is provoked and at that time the external earth property vanishesThere comes a time friends when the external liquid property is provoked and washes away village town city district  countryThere comes a time when the water in the great ocean drops down one hundred leagues two hundred three hundred four hundred five hundred six hundred seven hundred leaguesThere comes a time when the water in the great ocean stands seven palmtrees deep six five four three two palmtrees deep one palmtree deepThere comes a time when the water in the great ocean stands seven fathoms deep six five four three two fathoms deep one fathom deepThere comes a time when the water in the great ocean stands half a fathom deep hipdeep kneedeep ankle deepThere comes a time when the water in the great ocean is not even the depth of the first joint of a fingerThere comes a time friends when the external fire property is provoked and consumes village town city district  country and then coming to the edge of a green district the edge of a road the edge of a rocky district to the waters edge or to a lush wellwatered area goes out from lack of sustenanceThere comes a time when people try to make fire using a wingbone  tendon paringsThere comes a time friends when the external wind property is provoked and blows away village town city district  countryThere comes a time when in the last month of the hot season people try to start a breeze with a fan or bellows and even the grass at the fringe of a thatch roof doesnt stirA similar theory attributes the irruption of mental states to the provocation of the properties of sensuality form or formlessnessIn dependence on the property of sensuality there occurs the perception of sensualityIn dependence on the perception of sensuality there occurs the resolve for sensuality the desire for sensuality the fever for sensuality the quest for sensualityQuesting for sensuality monks an uninstructed runofthemill person conducts himself wrongly through three means through body through speech  through mindEven unbinding is described as a propertyHowever there is a crucial difference in how unbinding is attained in that the unbinding property is not provokedAny events that depend on the provocation of a property are inherently unstable and inconstant subject to change when the provocation endsBut because true release is not caused by the provocation of anything it is not subject to changeIn have heard that on one occasion the

there is no opportunity for that monk to fall from that nonoccasional release Because this inconsistency seems anomalous the Sri LankanBurmese reading seems preferableOccasional liberationrelease is the temporary release from such things as the hindrances attained when entering right concentration or the temporary release from some of the factors of lower states of jhāna attained when entering higher states of jhānaThis release lasts only as long as the necessary causal factors are still in placeNonoccasional liberationrelease according to the Commentary covers all of the transcendent attainments the paths and fruitions of streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship along with unbindingThus if the Commentary is right here nonoccasional liberationrelease has a broader meaning than the unprovoked release mentioned below as that covers only the fruition of arahantship and unbindingAlthough the path factors are needed to reach these attainments they do not cause them just as a path to a mountain does not cause the mountain to beThis release is beyond time  and thus nonoccasional  in that the falling away of the path factors would not end itAkuppaThis term is sometimes translated as unshakable but it literally means unprovoked The reference is apparently to the theory of dhātu or properties underlying physical or psychological events in natureThe physical properties according to this theory are four earth liquid heat and windThree of them  liquid heat  wind  are potentially activeWhen they are aggravated agitated or provoked  the Pali term here pakuppati is used also on the psychological level where it means angered or upset  they act as the underlying cause for natural activityWhen the provocation ends the corresponding activity subsidesNow there comes a time friends when the external liquid property is provoked and at that time the external earth property vanishesThere comes a time friends when the external liquid property is provoked

theory attributes the irruption of mental states to the provocation of the properties of sensuality form or formlessnessIn dependence on the property of sensuality there occurs the perception of sensualityIn dependence on the perception of sensuality there occurs the resolve for sensuality the desire for sensuality the fever for sensuality the quest for sensualitySearching for sensuality monks an uninstructed runofthemill person conducts himself wrongly through three means through body through speech  through mindEven unbinding is described as a propertyHowever there is a crucial difference in how unbinding is attained in that the unbinding property is not provokedAny events that depend on the provocation of a property are inherently unstable and inconstant subject to change when the provocation endsBut because true release is not caused by the provocation of anything it is not subject to changeI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere VenSariputta addressed the monks saying Friend monksYes friend the monks respondedVenSariputta said Friends just as the footprints of all legged animals are encompassed by the footprint of the elephant and the elephants footprint is reckoned the foremost among them in terms of size in the same way all skillful qualities are gathered under the four noble truthsUnder which fourUnder the noble truth of stress under the noble truth of the origination of stress under the noble truth of the cessation of stress and under the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressAnd what is the noble truth of stressBirth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful not getting what is wanted is stressfulIn short the five clingingaggregates are stressfulAnd which are the five clingingaggregatesThe form clingingaggregate the feeling clingingaggregate the perception clingingaggregate the fabrication clingingaggregate  the consciousness clingingaggregateAnd what is the form clingingaggregateThe four great existents and the form derived from themAnd what are the four great existentsThe earth property the liquid property the fire property  the wind propertyAnd what is the earth propertyThe earth property can be either internal or externalWhich is the internal earth propertyWhatever internal within oneself is hard solid  sustained head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces or whatever else internal within oneself is hard solid  sustained This is called the internal earth propertyNow both the internal earth property and the external earth property are simply earth propertyAnd that should be seen as it actually is with right discernment This is not mine this is not me this is not my self When one sees it thus as it actually is with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the earth property and makes the mind dispassionate toward the earth propertyNow there comes a time friends when the external liquid property is provoked and at that time the external earth property vanishesSo when even in the external earth property  so vast  inconstancy will be discerned destructibility will be discerned a tendency to decay will be discerned changeability will be discerned then what in this shortlasting body sustained by clinging is I or mine or what I amIt has here only a noNow if other people insult

people attack the monk in ways that are undesirable displeasing  disagreeable  through contact with fists contact with stones contact with sticks or contact with knives  the monk discerns that This body is of such a nature that contacts with fists come contacts with stones come contacts with sticks come  contacts with knives comeNow the Blessed One has said in his exhortation of the simile of

wordsSome scholars have suggested that of the many autobiographical accounts of the Buddhas Awakening presented in the Pali canon this is the earliestFrom that assumption they have further suggested that because this account does not mention the four noble truths either in connection with the Awakening or with the Buddhas instructions to his first disciples the four noble truths must have been a later doctrineThere is little reason however to accept these suggestionsTo begin with the sutta does not recount the Buddhas period of austerities prior to his Awakening nor does it tell of how the group of five monks attended to him during that period and later left him when he abandoned his austerities and yet toward the end of the sutta the Buddha alludes to those two incidents in a way indicating that he assumes them to be familiar to his listenersThus if anything the accounts that do explicitly relate those events  such as the one in MN  would seem to be earlierSecondly the lack of reference to the four noble truths does not indicate that they were not actually involved in the Awakening or the first sermonAs is always the case in the Buddhas autobiographical accounts in the Canon this account is designed to convey a lesson and the lesson is clearly articulated toward the beginning of the sutta the difference between noble search and ignoble searchThe account then illustrates the Buddhas own noble search and his later teaching career in the terms introduced by the lesson the search for the unborn agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless undefiled unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding In particular all the events mentioned in the account revolve around the issue of the Deathless the discovery of the Deathless the teaching of the Deathless and the Buddhas success in helping others to attain the DeathlessHad the lesson of the sutta concerned the four noble truths they would probably have been mentioned in the accountThus there seems little reason to regard this sutta as proof that the four noble truths were a later teachingNevertheless this sutta offers many excellent lessons in the Dhamma in addition to mentioning a few incidents in the Buddhas life that are found nowhere else in the Sutta PitakaI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe he went into Savatthi for almsThen a large number of monks went to VenAnanda and said It has been a long time friend Ananda since we have heard a Dhamma talk in the Blessed Ones presenceIt would be good if we could get to hear a Dhamma talk in the Blessed Ones presenceIn that case venerable ones go to the hermitage of Rammaka the brahmanPerhaps you will get to hear a Dhamma talk in the Blessed Ones presenceAs you say friend the monks replied to VenAnanda and leftThen the Blessed One having gone for alms after his meal on returning from his alms round said to VenAnanda Ananda lets go to the Eastern Park the palace of Migaras mother for the days abidingAs you say lord VenAnanda replied to the Blessed OneSo the Blessed One together with VenAnanda went to the Eastern Park the palace of Migaras mother for the days abidingThen in the evening emerging from seclusion he said to VenAnanda Ananda lets go to the Eastern Gatehouse to bathe our limbsAs you say lord VenAnanda replied to the Blessed OneSo the Blessed One together with VenAnanda went to the Eastern Gatehouse to bathe his limbsHaving bathed his limbs at the Eastern Gatehouse coming out of the water he stood in his lower robe drying his limbsThen VenAnanda said to him Lord the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman is not far awayPleasing is the hermitage of Rammaka the brahmanDelightful is the hermitage of Rammaka the brahmanIt would be good if the Blessed One went to the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman out of sympathy The Blessed One acquiesced through silenceSo the Blessed One went to the hermitage of Rammaka the brahmanNow at that time a large number of monks had gathered in the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman for a Dhamma discussionThe Blessed One stood outside the door waiting for the discussion to endOn knowing that the discussion had ended clearing his throat he tapped at the doorThe monks opened the door for himEntering the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman the Blessed One sat down on a seat made readyAs he was sitting there he addressed the monks For what discussion are you gathered together hereIn the midst of what discussion have you been interruptedLord our interrupted Dhamma discussion was about the Blessed One himself and then the Blessed One arrivedGood monksIts fitting that you as sons of good families who have gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should gather for Dhamma discussionWhen you have gathered you have two duties either Dhamma discussion or noble silenceMonks there are these two searches ignoble search  noble searchAnd what is ignoble searchThere is the case where a person being subject himself to birth seeks what is likewise subject to birthBeing subject himself to aging illness death sorrow defilement he seeks what is likewise subject to illness death sorrow defilementAnd what may be said to be subject to birthSpouses  children are subject to birthMen  women slaves goats  sheep fowl  pigs elephants cattle horses  mares gold  silver are subject to birthSubject to birth are these acquisitions and one who is tied to them infatuated with them who has totally fallen for them being subject to birth seeks what is likewise subject to birthAnd what may be said to be subject to aging illness death sorrow defilementSpouses  children men  women slaves goats  sheep fowl  pigs elephants cattle horses  mares gold  silver are subject to aging illness death sorrow defilementSubject to aging illness death sorrow defilement are these acquisitions and one who is tied to them infatuated with them who has totally fallen for them being subject to birth seeks what is likewise subject to aging illness death sorrow defilementThis is ignoble searchAnd what is the noble searchThere is the case where a person himself being subject to birth seeing the drawbacks of birth seeks the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke UnbindingHimself being subject to aging illness death sorrow defilement seeing the drawbacks of aging illness death sorrow defilement seeks the agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless undefiled unexcelled rest from the yoke UnbindingThis is the noble searchI too monks before my Awakening when I was an unawakened bodhisatta being subject myself to birth sought what was likewise subject to birthBeing subject myself to aging illness death sorrow defilement I sought what was likewise subject to illness death sorrow defilementThe thought occurred to me Why do I being subject myself to birth seek what is likewise subject to birthBeing subject myself to aging illness death sorrow defilement why do I seek what is likewise subject to illness death sorrow defilementWhat if I being subject myself to birth seeing the drawbacks of birth were to seek the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke UnbindingWhat if I being subject myself to aging illness death sorrow defilement seeing the drawbacks of aging illness death sorrow defilement were to seek the agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless unexcelled rest from the yoke UnbindingSo at a later time while still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life  and while my parents unwilling were crying with tears streaming down their faces  I shaved off my hair  beard put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessnessHaving thus gone forth in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Alara Kalama and on arrival said to him Friend Kalama I want to practice in this doctrine  disciplineWhen this was said he replied to me You may stay here my friendThis doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teachers knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledgeIt was not long before I quickly learned the doctrineAs far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with othersI thought It isnt through mere conviction alone that Alara Kalama declares I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwells knowing  seeing this Dhamma So I went to him and said To what extent do you declare that you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma When this was said he declared the dimension of nothingnessI thought Not only does Alara Kalama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernmentI too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernmentWhat if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Alara Kalama declares he has entered  dwells in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeI went to him and said Friend Kalama is this the extent to which you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for yourself through direct knowledgeYes my friendThis friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeIt is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy lifeSo the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledgeAnd the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeThe Dhamma I know is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma I knowAs I am so are you as you are so am Come friend let us now lead this community togetherIn this way did Alara Kalama my teacher place me his pupil on the same level with himself and pay me great honorBut the thought occurred to me This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I leftIn search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Uddaka Ramaputta and on arrival said to him Friend Uddaka I want to practice in this doctrine  disciplineWhen this was said he replied to me You may stay here my friendThis doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teachers knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledgeIt was not long before I quickly learned the doctrineAs far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with othersI thought It wasnt through mere conviction alone that Rama declared I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwelled knowing  seeing this Dhamma So I went to Uddaka and said To what extent did Rama declare that he had entered  dwelled in this Dhamma When this was said Uddaka declared the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionI thought Not only did Rama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernmentI too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernmentWhat if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeI went to Uddaka and said Friend Uddaka is this the extent to which Rama entered  dwelled in this Dhamma having realized it for himself through direct knowledgeYes my friendThis friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeIt is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy lifeSo the Dhamma Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledgeAnd the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledgeThe Dhamma he knew is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma he knewAs he was so are you as you are so was heCome friend lead this communityIn this way did Uddaka Ramaputta my companion in the holy life place me in the position of teacher and pay me great honorBut the thought occurred to me This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I leftIn search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I wandered by stages in the Magadhan country and came to the military town of UruvelaThere I saw some delightful countryside with an inspiring forest grove a clearflowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for almsgoing on all sidesThe thought occurred to me How delightful is this countryside with its inspiring forest grove clearflowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for almsgoing on all sidesThis is just right for the exertion of a clansman intent on exertion So I sat down right there thinking This is just right for exertionThen monks being subject myself to birth seeing the drawbacks of birth seeking the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding I reached the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke UnbindingBeing subject myself to aging illness death sorrow defilement seeing the drawbacks of aging illness death sorrow defilement seeking the agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding I reached the agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless unexcelled rest from the yoke UnbindingKnowledge  vision arose in me Unprovoked is my releaseThis is the last birthThere is now no further becomingThen the thought occurred to me This Dhamma that I have attained is deep hard to see hard to realize peaceful refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wiseBut this generation delights in attachment is excited by attachment enjoys attachmentFor a generation delighting in attachment excited by attachment enjoying attachment thisthat conditionality  dependent coarising are hard to seeThis state too is hard to see the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation UnbindingAnd if I were to teach the Dhamma and others would not understand me that would be tiresome for me troublesome for meJust then these verses unspoken in the past unheard before occurred to meAs I reflected thus my mind inclined to dwelling at ease not to teaching the DhammaThen Brahma Sahampati having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in my awareness thought The world is lostThe world is destroyedThe mind of the Tathagata the Arahant the Rightly Selfawakened One inclines to dwelling at ease not to teaching the Dhamma Then just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm Brahma Sahampati disappeared from the Brahmaworld and reappeared in front of meArranging his upper robe over one shoulder he knelt down with his right knee on the ground saluted me with his hands before his heart and said to me Lord let the Blessed One teach the DhammaLet the OneWellGone teach the DhammaThere are beings with little dust in their eyes who are falling away because they do not hear the DhammaThere will be those who will understand the DhammaThat is what Brahma Sahampati saidHaving said that he further said thisThen having understood Brahmas invitation out of compassion for beings I surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened OneAs I did so I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much those with keen faculties and those with dull those with good attributes and those with bad those easy to teach and those hard some of them seeing disgrace  danger in the other worldJust as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some lotuses  born  growing in the water  might flourish while immersed in the water without rising up from the water some might stand at an even level with the water while some might rise up from the water and stand without being smeared by the water  so too surveying the world with the eye of an Awakened One I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much those with keen faculties and those with dull those with good attributes and those with bad those easy to teach and those hard some of them seeing disgrace  danger in the other worldHaving seen this I answered Brahma Sahampati in verseThen Brahma Sahampati thinking The Blessed One has given his consent to teach the Dhamma bowed down to me and circling me on the right disappeared right thereThen the thought occurred to me To whom should I teach the Dhamma firstWho will quickly understand this Dhamma Then the thought occurred to me This Alara Kalama is wise competent intelligentHe has long had little dust in his eyesWhat if I were to teach him the Dhamma firstHe will quickly understand this Dhamma Then devas came to me and said Lord Alara Kalama died seven days ago And knowledge  vision arose within me Alara Kalama died seven days ago The thought occurred to me A great loss has Alara Kalama sufferedIf he had heard this Dhamma he would have quickly understood itThen the thought occurred to me To whom should I teach the Dhamma firstWho will quickly understand this Dhamma Then the thought occurred to me This Uddaka Ramaputta is wise competent intelligentHe has long had little dust in his eyesWhat if I were to teach him the Dhamma firstHe will quickly understand this Dhamma Then devas came to me and said Lord Uddaka Ramaputta died last night And knowledge  vision arose within me Uddaka Ramaputta died last night The thought occurred to me A great loss has Uddaka Ramaputta sufferedIf he had heard this Dhamma he would have quickly understood itThen the thought occurred to me To whom should I teach the Dhamma firstWho will quickly understand this Dhamma Then the thought occurred to me They were very helpful to me the group of five monks who attended to me when I was resolute in exertionWhat if I were to teach them the Dhamma first Then the thought occurred to me Where are the group of five monks staying now And with the divine eye purified  surpassing the human I saw that they were staying near Varanasi in the Deer Park at IsipatanaThen having stayed at Uruvela as long as I liked I set out to wander by stages to VaranasiUpaka the Ajivaka saw me on the road between Gaya and the Awakening and on seeing me said to me Clear my friend are your facultiesPure your complexion and brightOn whose account have you gone forthWho is your teacherIn whose Dhamma do you delightWhen this was said I replied to Upaka the Ajivaka in versesFrom your claims my friend you must be an infinite conquerorWhen this was said Upaka said May it be so my friend and  shaking his head taking a sideroad  he leftThen wandering by stages I arrived at Varanasi at the Deer Park in Isipatana to where the group of five monks were stayingFrom afar they saw me coming and on seeing me made a pact with one another Friends here comes Gotama the contemplative living luxuriously straying from his exertion backsliding into abundanceHe doesnt deserve to be bowed down to to be greeted by standing up or to have his robe  bowl receivedStill a seat should be set out if he wants to he can sit down But as I approached they were unable to keep to their pactOne standing up to greet me received my robe  bowlAnother spread out a seatAnother set out water for washing my feetHowever they addressed me by name and as friendSo I said to them Dont address the Tathagata by name and as friend The Tathagata friends is a worthy one rightly selfawakenedLend ear friends the Deathless has been attainedI will instruct youI will teach you the DhammaPracticing as instructed you will in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for yourselves in the here  nowWhen this was said the group of five monks replied to me By that practice that conduct that performance of austerities you did not attain any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble oneSo how can you now  living luxuriously straying from your exertion backsliding into abundance  have attained any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble oneWhen this was said I replied to them The Tathagata monks is not living luxuriously has not strayed from his exertion has not backslid into abundanceThe Tathagata friends is a worthy one rightly selfawakenedLend ear friends the Deathless has been attainedI will instruct youI will teach you the DhammaPracticing as instructed you will in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for yourselves in the here  nowA second time A third time the group of five monks said to me By that practice that conduct that performance of austerities you did not attain any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble oneSo how can you now  living luxuriously straying from your exertion backsliding into abundance  have attained any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble oneWhen this was said I replied to the group of five monks Do you recall my ever having spoken in this way beforeNo lordThe Tathagata monks is not living luxuriously has not strayed from his exertion has not backslid into abundanceThe Tathagata friends is a worthy one rightly selfawakenedLend ear friends the Deathless has been attainedI will instruct youI will teach you the DhammaPracticing as instructed you will in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for yourselves in the here  nowAnd so I was able to convince themI would teach two monks while three went for alms and we six lived off what the three brought back from their alms roundThen I would teach three monks while two went for alms and we six lived off what the two brought back from their alms roundThen the group of five monks  thus exhorted thus instructed by me  being subject themselves to birth seeing the drawbacks of birth seeking the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding reached the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke UnbindingBeing subject themselves to aging illness death sorrow defilement seeing the drawbacks of aging illness death sorrow defilement seeking the agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding they reached the agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless unexcelled rest from the yoke UnbindingKnowledge  vision arose in them Unprovoked is our releaseThis is the last birthThere is now no further becomingMonks there are these five strings of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingSounds cognizable via the ear  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingAromas cognizable via the nose  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingTastes cognizable via the tongue  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingTactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingThese are the five strings of sensualityAnd any brahmans or contemplatives tied to these five strings of sensuality  infatuated with them having totally fallen for them consuming them without seeing their drawbacks or discerning the escape from them  should be known as having met with misfortune having met with ruin Mara can do with them as he willJust as if a wild deer were to lie bound on a heap of snares it should be known as having met with misfortune having met with ruin the hunter can do with it as he willWhen the hunter comes it wont get away as it would likeIn the same way any brahmans or contemplatives tied to these five strings of sensuality  infatuated with them having totally fallen for them consuming them without seeing their drawbacks or discerning the escape from them  should be known as having met with misfortune having met with ruin Mara can do with them as he willBut any brahmans or contemplatives not tied to these five strings of sensuality  uninfatuated with them having not totally fallen for them consuming them seeing their drawbacks and discerning the escape from them  should be known as not having met with misfortune not having met with ruin Mara cannot do with them as he willJust as if a wild deer were to lie unbound on a heap of snares it should be

contemplatives not tied to these five strings of sensuality  uninfatuated with them having not totally fallen for them consuming them seeing their drawbacks and discerning the escape from them  should be known as not having met with misfortune not having met with ruin Mara cannot do with them as he willSuppose that a wild deer is living in a wilderness glenCarefree it walks carefree it stands carefree it sits carefree it lies downWhy is thatBecause it has gone beyond the hunters rangeIn the same way a monk  quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationThis monk is said to have blinded MaraTrackless he has destroyed Maras vision and has become invisible to the Evil OneThen again the monk with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceThis monk is said to have blinded MaraTrackless he has destroyed Maras vision and has become invisible to the Evil OneThen again the monk with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding This monk is said to have blinded MaraTrackless he has destroyed Maras vision and has become invisible to the Evil OneThen again the monk with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainThis monk is said to have blinded MaraTrackless he has destroyed Maras vision and has become invisible to the Evil OneThen again the monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity Infinite space enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of spaceThis monk is said to have blinded MaraTrackless he has destroyed Maras vision and has become invisible to the Evil OneThen again the monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of

invisible to the Evil OneThen again the monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThis monk is said to have blinded MaraTrackless he has destroyed Maras vision and has become invisible to the Evil OneThen again the monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters  remains in the cessation of perception  feelingAnd having seen with discernment his mental fermentations are completely endedThis monk is said to have blinded MaraTrackless he has destroyed Maras vision and has become invisible to the Evil OneHaving crossed over he is unattached in the worldCarefree he walks carefree he stands carefree he sits carefree he lies downWhy is thatBecause he has gone beyond the Evil Ones rangeThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsPhagguna if anyone were to reproach you right to your face even then you should abandon those urges and thoughts which are worldlyThere Phagguna you should train yourself thus Neither shall my mind be affected by this nor shall I give vent to evil words but I shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and I shall not give in to hatred This is how Phagguna you should train yourselfPhagguna if anyone were to give you a blow with the hand or hit you with a clod of earth or with a stick or with a sword even then you should abandon those urges and thoughts which are worldlyThere Phagguna you should train yourself thus Neither shall my mind be affected by this nor shall I give vent to evil words but I shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and I shall not give in to hatred This is how Phagguna you should train yourselfIn the past monks in this very Savatthi there was a mistress Vedehika by nameAnd monks this good reputation had spread about the mistress Vedehika The mistress Vedehika is gentle the mistress Vedehika is meek the mistress Vedehika is calm Now monks the mistress Vedehika had a maidservant Kali by name who was able energetic and very methodical in her workThen monks it occurred to Kali the maidservant This good reputation has spread about my lady The mistress Vedehika is gentle the mistress Vedehika is meek the mistress Vedehika is calm Could it be that my lady does have anger within her which she does not show or could it be that she does not have angerOr is it because I am methodical in my job that my lady though she does have anger within does not show it and not because she does not have angerWhy dont I test my ladyThus monks the maidservant Kali got up late the next morningAnd monks the mistress Vedehika told this to the maidservant Kali Hey you Kali  What is it lady  Why did you get up so late  Oh that is nothing lady  WhatThat is nothing indeedYou bad maidservant you got up late Angry and displeased she frownedThen monks it occurred to Kali the maidservant Though she does have anger within my lady does not show it it is not that she does not have angerIt is because I am methodical in my job that though she does have anger within my lady does not show it and not because she does not have angerWhy dont I test my lady furtherNow monks Kali the maidservant got up even later than beforeThen monks the mistress Vedehika told the maidservant Kali Hey you Kali  What is it lady  Why did you get up even later than before  Oh that is nothing lady  WhatThat is nothing indeedYou bad maidservant you got up even later than before Angry and displeased she gave vent to her displeasureThen monks it occurred to the maidservant Kali Though she does have anger within my lady does not show it it is not that she does not have angerIt is because I am methodical in my job that though she does have anger within my lady does not show it and not because she does not have angerWhy dont I test my lady furtherAnd monks the maidservant Kali got up even later than beforeThen monks the mistress Vedehika told the maidservant Kali Hey you Kali  What is it lady  Why did you get up so late  Oh that is nothing lady  WhatThat is nothing indeedYou bad maidservant you got up so late And angry and displeased she hit her on the head with the doorbarAnd this injured her headNow monks the maidservant Kali with her head injured and blood oozing went about among the neighbors shouting Look sirs at the deed of the gentle oneLook sirs at the deed of the meek oneLook sirs at the deed of the calm oneHow can she saying to her own maidservant You got up late today angry and displeased having taken a doorbar give me a blow on the head and injure my headAnd then monks this illrepute spread thereafter about the mistress Vedehika The mistress Vedehika is violent the mistress Vedehika is arrogant the mistress Vedehika is not calmIn the same way monks some monk here is very gentle very meek and very calm so long as disagreeable ways of speech do not assail him but when disagreeable ways of speech do assail the monk it is then that the monk is to be judged whether he is gentle meek or calm Monks I do not call that monk dutiful who is dutiful on account of the requisites he gets ie the robe almsfood lodging and medicaments whereby he falls into pseudodutifulnessAnd whyFor monks when that monk fails to get the requisites of the robe almsfood lodging and medicaments he ceases to be dutiful and is not in keeping with the norms of dutifulnessBut monks whichever monk out of reverence for the Teaching out of respect for the Teaching out of dedication to the Teaching showing honor to the Teaching and giving regard to the Teaching comes to be dutiful and is in keeping with the norms of dutifulness him do I consider as dutifulTherefore monks you should consider Only out of reverence for the Teaching out of respect for the Teaching out of dedication to the Teaching showing honor to the Teaching and giving regard to the Teaching shall we become dutiful shall we be in keeping with the norms of dutifulness Thus indeed monks you should train yourselvesMonks there are these five modes of speech which people might use when speaking to you  speech that is timely or untimely true or false gentle or harsh with a good or a harmful motive and with a loving heart or hostilityMonks some might speak to you using speech that is timely or untimely monks some might speak to you according to truth or falsely monks some might speak to you gently or harshly monks some might speak to you with a good motive or with a harmful motive monks some might speak to you with a loving heart or with hostilityOn all occasions monks you should train yourselves thus Neither shall our minds be affected by this nor for this matter shall we give vent to evil words but we shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and we shall not give in to hatredOn the contrary we shall live projecting thoughts of universal love to that very person making him as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love  thoughts that have grown great exalted and measurelessWe shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will It is in this way monks that you should train yourselvesSuppose monks a person were to come to you holding a hoe and a basket and he were to say I shall make this great earth earthless Then he would strew the earth here and there spit here and there and urinate here and there and would say Be earthless be earthless What do you think monks would this person render this great earth earthlessNo indeed not most venerable sirAnd whyBecause this great earth most venerable sir is deep and without measureIt cannot possibly be turned earthlessOn the contrary that person would only reap weariness and frustrationIn the same way monks others may use these five modes of speech when speaking to you  speech that is timely or untimely true or false gentle or harsh with a good or a harmful

monks there was a supple and silky leather bag made of catskin that had been beaten tanned cured and fully processed and made completely free of all creases and wrinklesThen a man were to come with a stick or mallet and say With this stick or mallet I shall make creases and wrinkles in this supple and silky catskin bag which has been beaten tanned cured and fully processed and made free of creases

monks you should keep this instruction on the Parable of the Saw constantly in mindThat will conduce to your wellbeing and happiness for long indeedThat is what the Blessed One saidDelighted those monks acclaimed the Teaching of the Blessed OneI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks repliedThe Blessed One said When a monk is intent on the heightened mind there are five themes he should attend to at the appropriate timesWhich fiveThere is the case where evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  arise in a monk while he is referring to and attending to a particular themeHe should attend to another theme apart from that one connected with what is skillfulWhen he is attending to this other theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful then those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itJust as a skilled carpenter or his apprentice would use a small peg to knock out drive out and pull out a large one in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  arise in a monk while he is referring to and attending to a particular theme he should attend to another theme apart from that one connected with what is skillfulWhen he is attending to this other theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful then those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itIf evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to this other theme connected with what is skillful he should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful these thoughts of mine are blameworthy these thoughts of mine result in stress As he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itJust as a young woman  or man  fond of adornment would be horrified humiliated and disgusted if the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human being were hung from her neck in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to this other theme connected with what is skillful he should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful these thoughts of mine are blameworthy these thoughts of mine result in stress As he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itIf evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts he should pay no mind and pay no attention to those thoughtsAs he is paying no mind and paying no attention to them those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itJust as a man with good eyes not wanting to see forms that had come into range would close his eyes or look away in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts he should pay no mind and pay no attention to those thoughtsAs he is paying no mind and paying no attention to them those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itIf evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts he should attend to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughtsAs he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itJust as the thought would occur to a man walking quickly Why am I walking quicklyWhy dont I walk slowly So he walks slowlyThe thought occurs to him Why am I walking slowlyWhy dont I stand So he standsThe thought occurs to him Why am I standingWhy dont I sit down So he sits downThe thought occurs to him Why am I sittingWhy dont I lie down So he lies downIn this way giving up the grosser posture he takes up the more refined oneIn the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts he should attend to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughtsAs he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itIf evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts then  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he should beat down constrain and crush his mind with his awarenessAs  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he is beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itJust as a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain and crush him in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts then  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he should beat down constrain and crush his mind with his awarenessAs  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he is beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subsideWith their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates itNow when a monk attending to another theme scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it He is then called a monk with mastery over the ways of thought sequencesHe thinks whatever thought he wants to and doesnt think whatever thought he doesntHe has severed craving thrown off the fetters and  through the right penetration of conceit  has made an end of suffering and stressThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas PleasanceThe Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus and they replied to him saying Reverend Sir The Blessed One spoke as followsFive things should be reflected on from time to time by the bhikkhu who is intent on the higher consciousnessWhat fiveWhen evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion arise in a bhikkhu through reflection on an adventitious object he should reflect on a different object which is connected with skillThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinLike an experienced carpenter or carpenters apprentice striking hard at pushing out and getting rid of a coarse peg with a fine one should the bhikkhu in order to get rid of the adventitious object reflect on a different object which is connected with skillThen the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinIf the evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu who in order to get rid of an adventitious object reflects on a different object which is connected with skill he should ponder on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts thus Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful blameworthy and productive of miseryThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinLike a welldressed young man or woman who feels horrified humiliated and disgusted because of the carcass of a snake dog or human that is hung round his or her neck should the bhikkhu in whom unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his reflection on the object which is connected with skill ponder on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts thus Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful blameworthy and productive of miseryThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinIf evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu who ponders on their disadvantageousness he should in regard to them endeavor to be without attention and reflectionThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinLike a keeneyed man shutting his eyes and looking away from some direction in order to avoid seeing visible objects come within sight should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his pondering on their disadvantageousness endeavor to be without attention and reflection as regards themThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinIf evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu in spite of his endeavor to be without attention and reflection as regards evil unskillful thoughts he should reflect on the removal of the source of those unskillful thoughtsThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinJust as a man finding no reason for walking fast walks slowly finding no reason for walking slowly stands finding no reason for standing sits down finding no reason for sitting down lies down and thus getting rid of a posture rather uncalm resorts to a restful posture just so should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts arise in spite of his endeavor to be without attention and reflection regarding them reflect on the removal of the source of those unskillful thoughtsThen the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinIf evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu in spite of his reflection on the removal of a source of unskillful thoughts he should with clenched teeth and the tongue pressing on the palate restrain subdue and beat down the mind by the mindThen the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinLike a strong man holding a weaker man by the head or shoulders and restraining subduing and beating him down should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his reflection on the source of unskillful thoughts restrain subdue and beat down the mind by the mind with clenched teeth and the tongue pressing on the palateThen the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappearBy their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just withinWhen indeed bhikkhus evil unskillful thoughts due to reflection on an adventitious object are eliminated when they disappear and the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within through his reflection on an object connected with skill through his pondering on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts his endeavoring to be without attentiveness and reflection as regards those thoughts or through his restraining subduing and beating down of the evil mind by the good mind with clenched teeth and tongue pressing on the palate that bhikkhu is called a master of the paths along which thoughts travelThe thought he wants to think that he thinks the thought he does not want to think that he does not thinkHe has cut down craving removed the fetter rightly mastered pride and made an end of sufferingThe Blessed One said this and the bhikkhus glad at heart approved of his wordsThis is a discourse about clinging to viewsIts central message is conveyed in two similes among the most famous in the Canon the simile of the watersnake and the simile of the raftTaken together these similes focus on the skill needed to grasp right view properly as a means of leading to the cessation of suffering rather than an object of clinging and then letting it go when it has done its jobThe first section of the discourse leading up to the simile of the watersnake focuses on the danger of misapprehending the Dhamma in general and particularly the teachings on sensualityThe discourse doesnt explain how the offending monk Arittha formulated his misapprehension of the Dhamma but the Commentary suggests a plausible scenarioHere the monk having gone into seclusion reasons as follows There are people living the household life enjoying the five pleasures of the senses who are streamwinners oncereturners and nonreturnersAs for monks they see pleasurable forms cognizable via the eye hear smell taste feel tactile sensations cognizable via the bodyThey use soft carpets and clothingAll this is properThen why shouldnt the sight sound smell taste and feel of a woman be properThey too are proper Thus comparing a mustard seed with Mount Sineru he gives rise to the pernicious viewpoint Why did the Blessed One  binding the ocean as it were with great effort  formulate the first parajika training ruleThere is nothing wrong with that act Regardless of how Arittha actually arrived at his position the Commentarys suggestion makes an important point that just because an idea can be logically inferred from the Dhamma does not mean that the idea is valid or usefulThe Buddha himself makes the same point in ANMonks these two slander the TathagataWhich twoHe who explains a discourse whose meaning needs to be inferred as one whose meaning has already been fully drawn outAnd he who explains a discourse whose meaning has already been fully drawn out as one whose meaning needs to be inferred Having established this point the discourse illustrates it with the simile of the watersnake which in turn is an introduction to the simile of the raftIt is important to underline the connection between these two similes for it is often missedMany a casual reader has concluded from the simile of the raft simply that the Dhamma is to be let goIn fact one major Mahayana text  the Diamond Sutra  interprets the raft simile as meaning that one has to let go of the raft in order to cross the riverHowever the simile of the watersnake makes the point that the Dhamma has to be grasped the trick lies in grasping it properlyWhen this point is then applied to the raft simile the implication is clear One has to hold onto the raft properly in order to cross the riverOnly when one has reached the safety of the further shore can one let goTaken together these two similes set the stage for the remainder of the discourse which focuses on the teaching of notselfThis is one of the most easily misapprehended teachings in the Canon largely because it is possible to draw the wrong inferences from itTwo mistaken inferences are particularly relevant hereThe first concerns the range of the notself teachingSome have argued that because the Buddha usually limits his teachings on notself to the five aggregates  form feeling perceptions fabrications and consciousness  he leaves open the possibility that something else may be regarded as selfOr as the argument is often phrased he denies the limited temporal self as a means of pointing to ones identity with the larger unlimited cosmic selfHowever in this discourse the Buddha explicitly phrases the notself teaching in such a way as to refute any notion of cosmic selfInstead of centering his discussion of notself on the five aggregates he focuses on the first four aggregates plus two other possible objects of selfidentification both more explicitly cosmic in their range all that can be seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect and the cosmos as a whole eternal and unchangingIn fact the Buddha holds this last view up to particular ridicule as the teaching of a fool for two reasons that are developed at different points in this discourse If the cosmos were me then it must also be mine which is obviously not the caseThere is nothing in the experience of the cosmos that fits the bill of being eternal unchanging or that deserves to be clung to as me or mineThe second mistaken inference is that given the thoroughness with which the Buddha teaches notself one should draw the inference that there is no selfThis inference is treated less explicitly in this discourse although it is touched upon briefly in terms of what the Buddha teaches here and how he teachesIn terms of what He explicitly states he cannot envision a doctrine of self that if clung to would not lead to sorrow lamentation pain grief  despairHe does not list all the possible doctrines of self included under this statement but MN provides at least a partial listI have a self I have no self It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self or This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternityThis is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of viewsBound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairHe is not freed I tell you from suffering  stressThus the view I have no self is just as much a doctrine of self as the view I have a self Because the act of clinging involves what the Buddha calls Imaking  the creation of a sense of self  if one were to cling to the view that there is no self one would be creating a very subtle sense of self around that viewBut as he says the Dhamma is taught for the elimination of all viewpositions determinations biases inclinations  obsessions for the stilling of all fabrications for the relinquishing of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation UnbindingThus it is important to focus on how the Dhamma is taught Even in his most thoroughgoing teachings about notself the Buddha never recommends replacing the assumption that there is a self with the assumption that there is no selfInstead he only goes so far as to point out the drawbacks of various ways of conceiving the self and then to recommend dropping themFor example in his standard series of questions building on the logic of the inconstancy and stress of the aggregates he does not say that because the aggregates are inconstant and stressful there is no selfHe simply asks When they are inconstant and stressful is it proper to assume that they are me my self what I amNow because the sense of self is a product of Imaking this question seeks to do nothing more than to induce disenchantment and dispassion for that process of Imaking so as to put a stop to itOnce that is accomplished the teaching has fulfilled its purpose in putting an end to suffering and stressThats the safety of the further shoreAs the Buddha says in this discourse Both formerly and now monks I declare only stress and the cessation of stress As he also says here when views of self are finally dropped one is free from agitation and as MN points out when one is truly unagitated one is unboundThe raft has reached the shore and one can leave it there  free to go where one likes in a way that cannot be tracedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas parkNow on that occasion this pernicious viewpoint had arisen in the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructions A large number of monks heard They say that this pernicious viewpoint has arisen in the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructions So they went to the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers and on arrival said to him Is it true friend Arittha that this pernicious viewpoint has arisen in you  As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructionsYes indeed friendsI understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One and those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructionsThen those monks desiring to pry the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers away from that pernicious viewpoint quizzed him back and forth and rebuked him saying Dont say that friend AritthaDont misrepresent the Blessed One for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed OneThe Blessed One would not say anything like thatIn many ways friend the Blessed One has described obstructive acts and when indulged in they are genuine obstructionsThe Blessed One has said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction much stress much despair  greater drawbacksThe Blessed One has compared sensual pleasures to a chain of bones of much stress much despair  greater drawbacksThe Blessed One has compared sensual pleasures to a lump of flesh a grass torch a pit of glowing embers a dream borrowed goods the fruits of a tree a butchers ax and chopping block swords and spears a snakes head of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks And yet even though he was quizzed back  forth and rebuked by those monks the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers through stubbornness and attachment to that very same pernicious viewpoint continued to insist Yes indeed friendsI understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One and those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructionsSo when the monks were unable to pry the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers away from that pernicious viewpoint they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they So the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monkIn my name call the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers saying The Teacher calls you friend Arittha As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers on arrival he said The Teacher calls you friend AritthaAs you say my friend the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers repliedThen he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Arittha that this pernicious viewpoint has arisen in you  As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructionsYes indeed lordI understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One and those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructionsWorthless man from whom have you understood that Dhamma taught by me in such a wayWorthless man havent I in many ways described obstructive actsAnd when indulged in they are genuine obstructions
