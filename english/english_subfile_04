'Inconstant' with regard to the inconstant is a nonperversion of perception a nonperversion of mind a nonperversion of view
'Stressful' with regard to the stressful 'Notself' with regard to notself 'Unattractive' with regard to the unattractive is a nonperversion of perception a nonperversion of mind a nonperversion of view
These are the four nonperversions of perception nonperversions of mind nonperversions of view
These four O Monks are distortions of perception distortions of thought distortions of view
These verses from the Numerical Discourses give the traditional list of the vipallasas
This Pali word is sometimes translated as perversions of the mind but I find this language too strong and prefer the expression distortions of the mind
The term is composed of a prefix which carries the sense of division separation or removal another prefix meaning around or complete and a verb which can be taken as meaning to throw Putting all this together we have the image of the mind taking something up turning it around and throwing it back down  a perversion or distortion of reality by the perceptual and cognitive apparatus of the brain
The distortions are fundamental to the Buddhist notion of ignorance or delusion
It is not that we are inherently flawed in our nature it is just that we make some serious errors on many levels as we attempt to make sense of the world around us
As we come to recognize  through meditation practice  some of the ways we misconstrue things about our experience we become more able to correct for these errors and gain greater clarity
The distortions of the mind work on three levels of scale
First distortions of perception cause us to misperceive the information coming to us through the sense doors
We might mistake a rope by the path as a snake for example
Normally such errors of vision are corrected by a more careful scrutiny but sometimes these sensory mistakes are overlooked and remain
Distortions of thought have to do with the next higher level of mental processing when we find ourselves thinking about or pondering over things in our minds
The mind tends to elaborate upon perception with these thought patterns and if our thoughts are based upon distortions of perception then they too will be distorted
Eventually such thought patterns can become habitual and evolve into distortions of view
We might become so convinced that there is a snake by the path that no amount of evidence to the contrary from our own eyes or reason nor the advice of others will shake our beliefs and assumptions
We are stuck in a mistaken view
Furthermore these three levels of distortion are cyclical  our perceptions are formed in the context of our views which are strengthened by our thoughts and all three work together to build the cognitive systems which make up our unique personality
You will no doubt recognize that the particular distortions mentioned in this text correspond to the three characteristics
Taking what is impermanent as permanent what is inherently unsatisfactory as a source of satisfaction and what is without a self to constitute a self  these are the primary ways we distort reality to the profound disadvantage of ourselves and others
Seeing the unlovely as lovely rounds out the traditional list of four vipallasas
I like the way these verses say that when under the influence of these distortions we have lost our senses and our mind is broken or thrown
When the distortions are corrected by right view clear thinking and careful perception then the text says that we have gotten back our true mind
This is the Buddhist view of mental disease and mental health
Delusion is a mental illness that causes all sorts of suffering mental health can be restored by correcting the flaws in how the mind operates
Fortunately Buddhas arise to make things bright and illustrate in detail how this recovery of our natural health can be accomplished
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then Rohitassa the son of a deva in the far extreme of the night his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove went to the Blessed One
On arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One Is it possible lord by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear
I tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear
It is amazing lord and awesome how well that has been said by the Blessed One 'I tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear' Once I was a seer named Rohitassa a student of Bhoja a powerful skywalker
My speed was as fast as that of a strong archer  welltrained a practiced hand a practiced sharpshooter  shooting a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree
My stride stretched as far as the east sea is from the west
To me endowed with such speed such a stride there came the desire 'I will go traveling to the end of the cosmos' I  with a onehundred year life a onehundred year span  spent one hundred years traveling  apart from the time spent on eating drinking chewing  tasting urinating  defecating and sleeping to fight off weariness  but without reaching the end of the cosmos I died along the way
So it is amazing lord and awesome how well that has been said by the Blessed One 'I tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear' I tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear
But at the same time I tell you that there is no making an end of suffering  stress without reaching the end of the cosmos
Yet it is just within this fathomlong body with its perception  intellect that I declare that there is the cosmos the origination of the cosmos the cessation of the cosmos and the path of practice leading to the cessation of the cosmos

There is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the attainment of knowledge  vision
There is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to mindfulness  alertness
There is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the effluents
And what is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  now
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  now
And what is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the attainment of knowledge  vision
There is the case where a monk attends to the perception of light and is resolved on the perception of daytime
Day is the same as night night is the same as day
By means of an awareness open  unhampered he develops a brightened mind
This is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the attainment of knowledge  vision
And what is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to mindfulness  alertness
There is the case where feelings are known to the monk as they arise known as they persist known as they subside
Perceptions are known to him as they arise known as they persist known as they subside
Thoughts are known to him as they arise known as they persist known as they subside
This is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to mindfulness  alertness
And what is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the effluents
There is the case where a monk remains focused on arising  falling away with reference to the five clingingaggregates 'Such is form such its origination such its passing away
Such is feeling such its origination such its passing away
Such is perception such its origination such its passing away
Such are fabrications such their origination such their passing away
Such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance' This is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the effluents
These are the four developments of concentration
And it was in connection with this that I stated in Punnaka's Question in the Way to the Far Shore

It's amazing Master Gotama and astounding how well that has been said by Master Gotama
And I hold Master Gotama to be endowed with these same four qualities
Master Gotama practices for the welfare  happiness of many people and has established many people in the noble method ie the rightness of what is admirable the rightness of what is skillful

On one occasion the Blessed One was traveling along the road between Ukkattha and Setabya and Dona the brahman was also traveling along the road between Ukkattha and Setabya
Dona the brahman saw in the Blessed One's footprints wheels with spokes together with rims and hubs complete in all their features
On seeing them the thought occurred to him How amazing
How astounding
These are not the footprints of a human being
Then the Blessed One leaving the road went to sit at the root of a certain tree  his legs crossed his body erect with mindfulness established to the fore
Then Dona following the Blessed One's footprints saw him sitting at the root of the tree confident inspiring confidence his senses calmed his mind calmed having attained the utmost control  tranquility tamed guarded his senses restrained a naga
On seeing him he went to him and said Master are you a deva
No brahman I am not a deva
Are you a gandhabba
No  a yakkha
No  a human being
No brahman I am not a human being
When asked 'Are you a deva' you answer 'No brahman I am not a deva' When asked 'Are you a gandhabba' you answer 'No brahman I am not a gandhabba' When asked 'Are you a yakkha' you answer 'No brahman I am not a yakkha' When asked 'Are you a human being' you answer 'No brahman I am not a human being' Then what sort of being are you
Brahman the fermentations by which  if they were not abandoned  I would be a deva Those are abandoned by me their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
The fermentations by which  if they were not abandoned  I would be a gandhabba a yakkha a human being Those are abandoned by me their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Just like a red blue or white lotus  born in the water grown in the water rising up above the water  stands unsmeared by the water in the same way I  born in the world grown in the world having overcome the world  live unsmeared by the world
Remember me brahman as 'awakened'
It's also possible that the Buddha's answers to Dona's questions  which like the questions are put in the future tense  are a form of wordplay in which the Buddha is using the future tense in both its meanings to refer both to his present and to his future state
The Buddha's refusal to identify himself as a human being relates to a point made throughout the Canon that an awakened person cannot be defined in any way at all
On this point see MN SN SN and the article A Verb for Nirvana Because a mind with clinging is located by its clinging an awakened person takes no place in any world this is why heshe is unsmeared by the world like the lotus unsmeared by water

If he lives in the west the north the south he conquers displeasure and is not conquered by displeasure
Why is that
Because the wise one endures both pleasure and displeasure
This is what the Blessed One said
Having said this he said further

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Saketa at Kalaka's park
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said Monks whatever in the cosmos  with its devas Maras  Brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans royalty  common people  is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect That do I know
Whatever in the cosmos  with its devas Maras  Brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their royalty  common people  is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect That I directly know
That has been realized by the Tathagata but in the Tathagata it has not been established
If I were to say 'I don't know whatever in the cosmos is seen heard sensed cognized pondered by the intellect' that would be a falsehood in me
If I were to say 'I both know and don't know whatever in the cosmos is seen heard sensed cognized pondered by the intellect' that would be just the same
If I were to say 'I neither know nor don't know whatever in the cosmos is seen heard sensed cognized pondered by the intellect' that would be a fault in me
Thus monks the Tathagata when seeing what is to be seen doesn't construe an seen
He doesn't construe an unseen
He doesn't construe an tobeseen
He doesn't construe a seer
When hearing
When sensing
When cognizing what is to be cognized he doesn't construe an cognized
He doesn't construe an uncognized
He doesn't construe an tobecognized
He doesn't construe a cognizer
Thus monks the Tathagata  being the same with regard to all phenomena that can be seen heard sensed  cognized  is 'Such' And I tell you There's no other 'Such' higher or more sublime

For one understanding as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of the six spheres of sensecontact with respect to ignorance about the six fields of sensecontact one is not obsessed with not understanding this monks is called the release from the bondage of the bond of ignorance
Thus the release from the bondage of the bond of sensual pleasure the release from the bondage of the bond of being the release from the bondage of the bond of opinions and the release from the bondage of the bond of ignorance released from the bondage of evil unwholesome mental phenomena  defiling leading to renewed being painful having suffering as fruit and stretching forth to future birth old age and death  because of that it is called peace or rest from bondage
These monks are the four releases from bondage
Bound by the bond of sensual pleasure and also by the bond of being Bound by the bond of opinions and enveloped by ignorance Beings go to wanderingon destined to birth and death
But those fully understanding sensual pleasure and in every way the bond of being Dispelling the bond of opinions and detached from ignorance Are released from all bonds they indeed are the wise ones going beyond bonds
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Vajjians at Bhanda Village
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said It's because of not understanding and not penetrating four things that we have wandered  transmigrated on such a long long time you  Which four
It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble virtue that we have wandered  transmigrated on such a long long time you  I
It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble concentration that we have wandered  transmigrated on such a long long time you  I
It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble discernment that we have wandered  transmigrated on such a long long time you  I
It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble release that we have wandered  transmigrated on such a long long time you  I
But when noble virtue is understood  penetrated when noble concentration noble discernment noble release is understood  penetrated then craving for becoming is destroyed the guide to becoming is ended there is now no further becoming
That is what the Blessed One said
When the One Wellgone had said that he  the Teacher  said further
Monks whether or not there is the arising of Tathagatas this property stands  this steadfastness of the Dhamma this orderliness of the Dhamma All processes are inconstant
The Tathagata directly awakens to that breaks through to that
Directly awakening  breaking through to that he declares it teaches it describes it sets it forth
He reveals it explains it  makes it plain All processes are inconstant
Whether or not there is the arising of Tathagatas this property stands  this steadfastness of the Dhamma this orderliness of the Dhamma All processes are stressful
The Tathagata directly awakens to that breaks through to that
Directly awakening  breaking through to that he declares it teaches it describes it sets it forth
He reveals it explains it  makes it plain All processes are stressful
Whether or not there is the arising of Tathagatas this property stands  this steadfastness of the Dhamma this orderliness of the Dhamma All phenomena are notself
The Tathagata directly awakens to that breaks through to that
Directly awakening  breaking through to that he declares it teaches it describes it sets it forth
He reveals it explains it  makes it plain All phenomena are notself

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks replied
The Blessed One said Monks I will teach you the quality of a person of integrity and the quality of a person of no integrity
Listen and pay close attention
I will speak
Yes lord the monks replied
The Blessed One said And which is the quality of a person of no integrity
There is the case where a person of no integrity goes forth from a highranking family
He notices 'I have gone forth from a highranking family but these other monks have not gone forth from a highranking family' He exalts himself for having a highranking family and disparages others
This is the quality of a person of no integrity
But a person of integrity notices 'It's not through having a highranking family that the quality of greed goes to its end it's not through having a highranking family that the quality of aversion the quality of delusion goes to its end
Even though one has not gone forth from a highranking family if  practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully  he is one who follows the Dhamma he is to be honored for that praised for that' So giving priority just to the practice he neither exalts himself for having a highranking family nor disparages others
This is the quality of a person of integrity
Furthermore a person of no integrity goes forth from a great family a family of great wealth a family of extensive wealth
He notices 'I have gone forth from a family of extensive wealth but these other monks have not gone forth from a family of extensive wealth' He exalts himself for having a family of extensive wealth and disparages others
This is the quality of a person of no integrity
But a person of integrity notices 'It's not through having a family of extensive wealth that the quality of greed goes to its end it's not through having a family of extensive wealth that the quality of aversion the quality of delusion goes to its end
Even though one has not gone forth from a family of extensive wealth if  practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully  he is one who follows the Dhamma he is to be honored for that praised for that' So giving priority just to the practice he neither exalts himself for having a family of extensive wealth nor disparages others
This is the quality of a person of integrity
Furthermore a person of no integrity is wellknown  highly regarded
He notices 'I am wellknown  highly regarded but these other monks are hardly known  have hardly any influence' He exalts himself for being wellknown  highly regarded and disparages others
This is the quality of a person of no integrity
But a person of integrity notices 'It's not through being wellknown  highly regarded that the quality of greed goes to its end it's not through being wellknown  highly regarded that the quality of aversion the quality of delusion goes to its end
Even though one is not wellknown  highly regarded if  practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully  he is one who follows the Dhamma he is to be honored for that praised for that' So giving priority just to the practice he neither exalts himself for being wellknown nor disparages others
This is the quality of a person of integrity
Furthermore a person of no integrity is one who gains robecloth almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
He notices 'I am one who gains robecloth almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick but these other monks are not ones who gain robecloth almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
He exalts himself for being one who gains robecloth almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick and disparages others
This is the quality of a person of no integrity
But a person of integrity notices 'It's not through gains that the quality of greed goes to its end it's not through gains that the quality of aversion the quality of delusion goes to its end
Even though one is not one who gains robecloth almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick if  practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully  he is one who follows the Dhamma he is to be honored for that praised for that' So giving priority just to the practice he neither exalts himself for his gains nor disparages others
This is the quality of a person of integrity
Furthermore a person of no integrity is learned a master of the Vinaya a Dhammaspeaker
He notices 'I am a Dhammaspeaker but these other monks are not Dhammaspeakers
He exalts himself for being a Dhammaspeaker and disparages others
This is the quality of a person of no integrity
But a person of integrity notices 'It's not through being a Dhammaspeaker that the quality of greed goes to its end it's not through being a Dhammaspeaker that the quality of aversion the quality of delusion goes to its end
Even though one is not a Dhammaspeaker if  practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully  he is one who follows the Dhamma he is to be honored for that praised for that' So giving priority just to the practice he neither exalts himself for being a Dhammaspeaker nor disparages others
This is the quality of a person of integrity
Furthermore a person of no integrity is a wilderness dweller
He notices 'I am a wilderness dweller but these other monks are not wilderness dwellers' He exalts himself for being a wilderness dweller and disparages others
This is the quality of a person of no integrity
But a person of integrity notices 'It's not through being a wilderness dweller that the quality of greed goes to its end it's not through being a wilderness dweller that the quality of aversion the quality of delusion goes to its end
Even though one is not a wilderness dweller if  practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully  he is one who follows the Dhamma he is to be honored for that praised for that' So giving priority just to the practice he neither exalts himself for being a wilderness dweller nor disparages others
This is the quality of a person of integrity
Furthermore a person of no integrity is one who wears robes of thrownaway rags an almsgoer one who dwells at the root of a tree a cemetery dweller one who lives in the open air one who doesn't lie down one who is content with whatever dwelling is assigned to him one who eats only one meal a day
He notices 'I am one who eats only one meal a day but these other monks do not eat only one meal a day' He exalts himself for being one who eats only one meal a day and disparages others
This is the quality of a person of no integrity
But a person of integrity notices 'It's not through being one who eats only one meal a day that the quality of greed goes to its end it's not through being one who eats only one meal a day that the quality of aversion the quality of delusion goes to its end
Even though one is not one who eats only one meal a day if  practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully  he is one who follows the Dhamma he is to be honored for that praised for that' So giving priority just to the practice he neither exalts himself for being one who eats only one meal a day nor disparages others
This is the quality of a person of integrity
Furthermore a person of no integrity  secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He notices 'I have gained the attainment of the first jhāna but these other monks have not gained the attainment of the first jhāna' He exalts himself for the attainment of the first jhāna and disparages others
This is the quality of a person of no integrity
But a person of integrity notices 'The Blessed One has spoken of nonfashioning even with regard to the attainment of the first jhāna for by whatever means they construe it it becomes otherwise from that' So giving priority to nonfashioning he neither exalts himself for the attainment of the first jhāna nor disparages others
This is the quality of a person of integrity
Furthermore a person of no integrity enters  remains in the second jhāna the third jhāna the fourth jhāna the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
He notices 'I have gained the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception but these other monks have not gained the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception' He exalts himself for the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception and disparages others
This is the quality of a person of no integrity
A person of integrity notices 'The Blessed One has spoken of nonfashioning even with regard to the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception for by whatever means they construe it it becomes otherwise from that' So giving priority to nonfashioning he neither exalts himself for the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception nor disparages others
This is the quality of a person of integrity
A person of integrity completely transcending the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters  remains in the cessation of feeling  perception
When he sees with discernment his effluents are ended
This is a monk who does not construe anything does not construe anywhere does not construe in any way

Translator's note This discourse presents a picture of life in the early Buddhist community shortly after the Buddha's passing away
On the one hand it shows the relationship between the monastic community and the political powers that be the monks are polite and courteous to political functionaries but the existence of this discourse shows that they had no qualms about depicting those functionaries as a little dense
On the other hand it shows that early Buddhist practice had no room for many practices that developed in later Buddhist traditions such as appointed lineage holders elected ecclesiastical heads or the use of mental defilements as a basis for concentration practice
I have heard that on one occasion Ven
Ananda was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Sanctuary not long after the Blessed One's total Unbinding
Now at that time King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha suspicious of King Pajjota was having Rajagaha fortified
Then in the early morning Ven
Ananda having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe went into Rajagaha for alms
The thought occurred to him It's too early to go for alms in Rajagaha
What if I were to go to the brahman Moggallana the Guardsman at his construction site So he went to Moggallana the Guardsman at his construction site
Moggallana the Guardsman saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said to him Come Master Ananda
Welcome Master Ananda
It has been a long time since Master Ananda has found the time to come here
Sit down Master Ananda
Here is a seat made ready for you
So Ven
Ananda sat down on the seat made ready
Moggallana the Guardsman taking a lower seat sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Ananda Master Ananda is there any one monk endowed in each  every way with the qualities with which Master Gotama  worthy  rightly selfawakened  was endowed
No brahman there isn't any one monk endowed in each  every way with the qualities with which the Blessed One  worthy  rightly selfawakened  was endowed
For the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path the begetter of the unbegotten path the expounder of the unexpounded path the knower of the path the expert with regard to the path adept at the path
And now his disciples follow the path and become endowed with it after him
And then Ven
Ananda's discussion with Moggallana the Guardsman was interrupted in midcourse for the brahman Vassakara the Magadhan administrator on an inspection tour of the construction sites in Rajagaha went to Ven
Ananda at Moggallana the Guardsman's construction site
On arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with Ven
Ananda
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Ananda Just now for what discussion were you sitting together when you were interrupted in midcourse
Just now brahman Moggallana the Guardsman said to me 'Master Ananda is there any one monk endowed in each  every way with the qualities with which Master Gotama  worthy  rightly selfawakened  was endowed' And when this was said I said to him 'No brahman there isn't any one monk endowed in each  every way with the qualities with which the Blessed One  worthy  rightly selfawakened  was endowed
For the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path the begetter of the unbegotten path the expounder of the unexpounded path the knower of the path the expert with regard to the path adept at the path
And now his disciples follow the path and become endowed with it after him' This was my discussion with the brahman Moggallana the Guardsman that was interrupted in midcourse when you arrived
Master Ananda is there any one monk appointed by Master Gotama 'He will be your arbitrator after I am gone' to whom you now turn
No brahman
There isn't any one monk appointed by the Blessed One  the one who knows the one who sees worthy  rightly selfawakened  'He will be your arbitrator after I am gone' to whom we now turn
Then is there any one monk authorized by the Sangha and appointed by a large body of elder monks 'He will be our arbitrator after the Blessed One is gone' to whom you now turn
No brahman
There isn't any one monk authorized by the Sangha and appointed by a large body of elder monks 'He will be our arbitrator after the Blessed One is gone' to whom we now turn
Being thus without an arbitrator Master Ananda what is the reason for your concord
It's not the case brahman that we're without an arbitrator
We have an arbitrator
The Dhamma is our arbitrator
When asked 'Master Ananda is there any one monk appointed by Master Gotama He will be your arbitrator after I am gone to whom you now turn' you said 'No brahman
There isn't any one monk appointed by the Blessed One to whom we now turn'
When asked 'Then is there any one monk authorized by the Sangha to whom you now turn' you said 'No brahman
There isn't any one monk authorized by the Sangha to whom we now turn'
When asked 'Being thus without an arbitrator Master Ananda what is the reason for your concord' you said 'It's not the case brahman that we're without an arbitrator
We have an arbitrator
The Dhamma is our arbitrator' Now how is the meaning of what you have said to be understood
Brahman there is a training rule laid down by the Blessed One  the one who knows the one who sees worthy  rightly selfawakened  a Patimokkha that has been codified
On the uposatha day all of us who live dependent on a single township gather together in one place
Having gathered together we invite the one to whom it falls
If while he is reciting a monk remembers an offense or transgression we deal with him in accordance with the Dhamma in accordance with what has been instructed
We're not the ones who deal with that venerable one
Rather the Dhamma is what deals with us
Is there Master Ananda any one monk you now honor respect revere  venerate on whom  honoring  respecting  you live in dependence
Yes brahman there is a monk we now honor respect revere  venerate on whom  honoring  respecting  we live in dependence
When asked 'Master Ananda is there any one monk appointed by Master Gotama He will be your arbitrator after I am gone to whom you now turn' you said 'No brahman
There isn't any one monk appointed by the Blessed One to whom we now turn'
When asked 'Then is there any one monk authorized by the Sangha to whom you now turn' you said 'No brahman
There isn't any one monk authorized by the Sangha to whom we now turn'
When asked 'Is there Master Ananda any one monk you now honor respect revere  venerate on whom  honoring  respecting  you live in dependence' you said 'Yes brahman there is a monk we now honor respect revere  venerate on whom  honoring  respecting  we live in dependence' Now how is the meaning of what you have said to be understood
Brahman there are ten inspiring qualities expounded by the Blessed One  the one who knows the one who sees worthy  rightly selfawakened
In whoever among us those ten qualities are found we now honor respect revere  venerate him honoring  respecting him we live in dependence on him
Which ten
There is the case where a monk is virtuous
He dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in his behavior  sphere of activity
He trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults
He has heard much has retained what he has heard has stored what he has heard
Whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end that  in their meaning  expression  proclaim the holy life entirely perfect  pure those he has listened to often retained discussed accumulated examined with his mind and wellpenetrated in terms of his views
He is content with robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for curing the sick
He attains  whenever he wants without strain without difficulty  the four jhanas that are heightened mental states pleasant abidings in the herenow
He experiences manifold supranormal powers
Having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one
He appears
He vanishes
He goes unimpeded through walls ramparts  mountains as if through space
He dives in  out of the earth as if it were water
He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land
Sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird
With his hand he touches  strokes even the sun  moon so mighty  powerful
He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
He hears  by means of the divine earelement purified  surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine  human whether near or far
He knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awareness
He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion
He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion
He discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion
He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind
He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind
He discerns an excelled mind as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind
He discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind
He discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind
He recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction  expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes  details
He sees  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
Through the ending of the mental fermentations he remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having known  made them manifest for himself right in the here  now
These brahman are the ten inspiring qualities expounded by the Blessed One  the one who knows the one who sees worthy  rightly selfawakened
In whoever among us these ten qualities are found we now honor respect revere  venerate him honoring  respecting him we live in dependence on him
When this was said the brahman Vassakara the Magadhan administrator turned to General Upananda and said What do you think general
Do these venerable ones honor what should be honored respect what should be respected revere what should be revered venerate what should be venerated
Of course they honor what should be honored respect what should be respected revere what should be revered venerate what should be venerated
For if they did not honor respect revere or venerate a person like this then what sort of person would they honor respect revere  venerate on what sort of person honor  respecting would they live in dependence
Then the brahman Vassakara the Magadhan administrator said to Ven
Ananda But where are you staying now Master Ananda
I am now staying at the Bamboo Grove brahman
I trust Master Ananda that the Bamboo Grove is delightful quiet free of noise with an air of isolation remote from human beings  appropriate for retreat
Certainly brahman the Bamboo Grove is delightful quiet free of noise with an air of isolation remote from human beings  appropriate for retreat because of guardians  protectors like yourself
Certainly Master Ananda the Bamboo Grove is delightful quiet free of noise with an air of isolation remote from human beings  appropriate for retreat because of venerable ones who are endowed with mental absorption who make mental absorption their habit
You venerable ones are both endowed with mental absorption  make mental absorption your habit
Once Ven
Ananda Master Gotama was staying near Vesali in the Peaked Roofed Pavilion in the Great Wood
I went to him at the Peaked Roofed Pavilion in the Great Wood and there he spoke in a variety of ways on mental absorption
Master Gotama was both endowed with mental absorption  made mental absorption his habit
In fact he praised mental absorption of every sort
It wasn't the case brahman that the Blessed One praised mental absorption of every sort nor did he criticize mental absorption of every sort
And what sort of mental absorption did he not praise
There is the case where a certain person dwells with his awareness overcome by sensual passion seized with sensual passion
He does not discern the escape as it actually is present from sensual passion once it has arisen
Making that sensual passion the focal point he absorbs himself with it besorbs resorbs  supersorbs himself with it
He dwells with his awareness overcome by ill will
He dwells with his awareness overcome by sloth  drowsiness
He dwells with his awareness overcome by restlessness  anxiety
He dwells with his awareness overcome by uncertainty seized with uncertainty
He does not discern the escape as it actually is present from uncertainty once it has arisen
Making that uncertainty the focal point he absorbs himself with it besorbs resorbs  supersorbs himself with it
This is the sort of mental absorption that the Blessed One did not praise
And what sort of mental absorption did he praise
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is the sort of mental absorption that the Blessed One praised
It would seem Ven
Ananda that Master Gotama criticized the mental absorption that deserves criticism and praised that which deserves praise
Well now Master Ananda I must be going
Many are my duties many the things I must do
Then do brahman what you think it is now time to do
So the brahman Vassakara the Magadhan administrator delighting  rejoicing in what Ven
Ananda had said got up from his seat  left
Then not long after he had left Moggallana the Guardsman said to Ven
Ananda Master Ananda you still haven't answered what I asked you
Didn't I just tell you brahman
There isn't any one monk endowed in each  every way with the qualities with which the Blessed One  worthy  rightly selfawakened  was endowed
For the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path the begetter of the unbegotten path the expounder of the unexpounded path the knower of the path the expert with regard to the path adept at the path
And now his disciples follow the path and become endowed with it after him
I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks saying Monks
Yes lord the monks responded to him
The Blessed One said Monks Sariputta is wise of great discernment deep discernment wide joyous rapid quick penetrating discernment
For half a month Sariputta clearly saw insight into mental qualities one after another
This is what occurred to Sariputta through insight into mental qualities one after another
There was the case where Sariputta  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
Whatever qualities there are in the first jhana  directed thought evaluation rapture pleasure singleness of mind contact feeling perception intention consciousness desire decision persistence mindfulness equanimity  attention  he ferreted them out one after another
Known to him they arose known to him they remained known to him they subsided
He discerned 'So this is how these qualities not having been come into play
Having been they vanish' He remained unattracted  unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers
He discerned that 'There is a further escape' and pursuing it there really was for him
Furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations Sariputta entered  remained in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
Whatever qualities there are in the second jhana  internal assurance rapture pleasure singleness of mind contact feeling perception intention consciousness desire decision persistence mindfulness equanimity  attention  he ferreted them out one after another
Known to him they arose known to him they remained known to him they subsided
He discerned 'So this is how these qualities not having been come into play
Having been they vanish' He remained unattracted  unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers
He discerned that 'There is a further escape' and pursuing it there really was for him
Furthermore with the fading of rapture Sariputta  remaining in equanimity mindful  alert and physically sensitive to pleasure  entered  remained in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' Whatever qualities there are in the third jhana  equanimitypleasure singleness of mind contact feeling perception intention consciousness desire decision persistence mindfulness equanimity  attention  he ferreted them out one after another
Known to him they arose known to him they remained known to him they subsided
He discerned 'So this is how these qualities not having been come into play
Having been they vanish' He remained unattracted  unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers
He understood He discerned that 'There is a further escape' and pursuing it there really was for him
Furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  Sariputta entered  remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
Whatever qualities there are in the fourth jhana  a feeling of equanimity neither pleasure nor pain an unconcern due to serenity of awareness singleness of mind contact feeling perception intention consciousness desire decision persistence mindfulness equanimity  attention  he ferreted them out one after another
Known to him they arose known to him they remained known to him they subsided
He discerned 'So this is how these qualities not having been come into play
Having been they vanish' He remained unattracted  unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers
He discerned that 'There is a further escape' and pursuing it there really was for him
Furthermore with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' Sariputta entered  remained in the dimension of the infinitude of space
Whatever qualities there are in the dimension of the infinitude of space  the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of space singleness of mind contact feeling perception intention consciousness desire decision persistence mindfulness equanimity  attention  he ferreted them out one after another
Known to him they arose known to him they remained known to him they subsided
He discerned 'So this is how these qualities not having been come into play
Having been they vanish' He remained unattracted  unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers
He discerned that 'There is a further escape' and pursuing it there really was for him
Furthermore with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' Sariputta entered  remained in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
Whatever qualities there are in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness  the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness singleness of mind contact feeling perception intention consciousness desire decision persistence mindfulness equanimity  attention  he ferreted them out one after another
Known to him they arose known to him they remained known to him they subsided
He discerned 'So this is how these qualities not having been come into play
Having been they vanish' He remained unattracted  unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers
He discerned that 'There is a further escape' and pursuing it there really was for him
Furthermore with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' Sariputta entered  remained in the dimension of nothingness
Whatever qualities there are in the dimension of nothingness  the perception of the dimension of nothingness singleness of mind contact feeling perception intention consciousness desire decision persistence mindfulness equanimity  attention  he ferreted them out one after another
Known to him they arose known to him they remained known to him they subsided
He discerned 'So this is how these qualities not having been come into play
Having been they vanish' He remained unattracted  unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers
He discerned that 'There is a further escape' and pursuing it there really was for him
Furthermore with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness Sariputta entered  remained in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
He emerged mindfully from that attainment
On emerging mindfully from that attainment he regarded the past qualities that had ceased  changed 'So this is how these qualities not having been come into play
Having been they vanish' He remained unattracted  unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers
He discerned that 'There is a further escape' and pursuing it there really was for him
Furthermore with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception Sariputta entered  remained in the cessation of feeling  perception
Seeing with discernment his fermentations were totally ended
He emerged mindfully from that attainment
On emerging mindfully from that attainment he regarded the past qualities that had ceased  changed 'So this is how these qualities not having been come into play
Having been they vanish' He remained unattracted  unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers
He discerned that 'There is no further escape' and pursuing it there really wasn't for him
If a person rightly saying it of anyone were to say 'He has attained mastery  perfection in noble virtue noble concentration noble discernment noble release' he would be rightly saying it of Sariputta if he were to say 'He has attained mastery  perfection in noble virtue noble concentration noble discernment noble release'
If a person rightly saying it of anyone were to say 'He is the Blessed One's son his offspring  born of his mouth born of the Dhamma created by the Dhamma his heir in the Dhamma not his heir in material things' he would be rightly saying it of Sariputta if he were to say 'He is the Blessed One's son his offspring  born of his mouth born of the Dhamma created by the Dhamma his heir in the Dhamma not his heir in material things' Sariputta monks takes the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma set rolling by the Tathagata and keeps it rolling rightly
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
For a discussion of how insight can be developed in the context of jhana see The Wings to Awakening IIIF
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migara's mother together with many wellknown elder disciples  with Ven
Sariputta Ven
Maha Moggallana Ven
Maha Kassapa Ven
Maha Kaccana Ven
Maha Kotthita Ven
Maha Kappina Ven
Maha Cunda Ven
Revata Ven
Ananda and other wellknown elder disciples
On that occasion the elder monks were teaching  instructing
Some elder monks were teaching  instructing ten monks some were teaching  instructing twenty monks some were teaching  instructing thirty monks some were teaching  instructing forty monks
The new monks being taught  instructed by the elder monks were discerning grand successive distinctions
Now on that occasion  the Uposatha day of the fifteenth the fullmoon night of the Pavarana ceremony  the Blessed One was seated in the open air surrounded by the community of monks
Surveying the silent community of monks he addressed them
Monks I am content with this practice
I am content at heart with this practice
So arouse even more intense persistence for the attaining of the asyetunattained the reaching of the asyetunreached the realization of the asyetunrealized
I will remain right here at Savatthi through the 'White Waterlily' Month the fourth month of the rains
The monks in the countryside heard The Blessed One they say will remain right there at Savatthi through the White Waterlily Month the fourth month of the rains So they left for Savatthi to see the Blessed One
Then the elder monks taught  instructed the new monks even more intensely
Some elder monks were teaching  instructing ten monks some were teaching  instructing twenty monks some were teaching  instructing thirty monks some were teaching  instructing forty monks
The new monks being taught  instructed by the elder monks were discerning grand successive distinctions
Now on that occasion  the Uposatha day of the fifteenth the fullmoon night of the White Waterlily Month the fourth month of the rains  the Blessed One was seated in the open air surrounded by the community of monks
Surveying the silent community of monks he addressed them
Monks this assembly is free from idle chatter devoid of idle chatter and is established on pure heartwood such is this community of monks such is this assembly
The sort of assembly that is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect an incomparable field of merit for the world such is this community of monks such is this assembly
The sort of assembly to which a small gift when given becomes great and a great gift greater such is this community of monks such is this assembly
The sort of assembly that it is rare to see in the world such is this community of monks such is this assembly  the sort of assembly that it would be worth traveling for leagues taking along provisions in order to see
In this community of monks there are monks who are arahants whose mental effluents are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal laid to waste the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosis such are the monks in this community of monks
In this community of monks there are monks who with the wasting away of the five lower fetters are due to be reborn there to be totally unbound destined never again to return from that world such are the monks in this community of monks
In this community of monks there are monks who with the wasting away of three fetters and with the attenuation of passion aversion  delusion are oncereturners who  on returning only once more to this world  will make an ending to stress such are the monks in this community of monks
In this community of monks there are monks who with the wasting away of three fetters are streamwinners steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakening such are the monks in this community of monks
In this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the development of the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for awakening the noble eightfold path such are the monks in this community of monks
In this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the development of good will compassion appreciation equanimity foulness the perception of inconstancy such are the monks in this community of monks
In this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to mindfulness of inout breathing
Mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is of great fruit of great benefit
Mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued brings the four frames of reference to their culmination
The four frames of reference when developed  pursued bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination
The seven factors for awakening when developed  pursued bring clear knowing  release to their culmination
Now how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit
There is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' Or breathing in short he discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short he discerns 'I am breathing out short' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming mental fabrication'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in satisfying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out satisfying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in steadying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out steadying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in releasing the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out releasing the mind'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment'
This is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit
And how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
 On whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long discerns 'I am breathing out long' or breathing in short discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short discerns 'I am breathing out short' trains himself 'I will breathe in out sensitive to the entire body' trains himself 'I will breathe inout calming bodily fabrication' On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  the inout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself 'I will breathe inout sensitive to rapture' trains himself 'I will breathe inout sensitive to pleasure' trains himself 'I will breathe inout sensitive to mental fabrication' trains himself 'I will breathe inout calming mental fabrication' On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  careful attention to inout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself 'I will breathe inout sensitive to the mind' trains himself 'I will breathe inout satisfying the mind' trains himself 'I will breathe inout steadying the mind' trains himself 'I will breathe inout releasing the mind' On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I don't say that there is mindfulness of inout breathing in one of lapsed mindfulness and no alertness which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself 'I will breathe inout focusing on inconstancy' trains himself 'I will breathe inout focusing on dispassion' trains himself 'I will breathe inout focusing on cessation' trains himself 'I will breathe inout focusing on relinquishment' On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He who sees with discernment the abandoning of greed  distress is one who watches carefully with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
And how are the four frames of reference developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination
 On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world on that occasion his mindfulness is steady  without lapse
When his mindfulness is steady  without lapse then mindfulness as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 Remaining mindful in this way he examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment
When he remains mindful in this way examining analyzing  coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 In one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment persistence is aroused unflaggingly
When persistence is aroused unflaggingly in one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then persistence as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 In one whose persistence is aroused a rapture notoftheflesh arises
When a rapture notoftheflesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused then rapture as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 For one enraptured at heart the body grows calm and the mind grows calm
When the body  mind of a monk enraptured at heart grow calm then serenity as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 For one who is at ease  his body calmed  the mind becomes concentrated
When the mind of one who is at ease  his body calmed  becomes concentrated then concentration as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 He carefully watches the mind thus concentrated with equanimity
When he carefully watches the mind thus concentrated with equanimity equanimity as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
This is how the four frames of reference are developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination
And how are the seven factors for awakening developed  pursued so as to bring clear knowing  release to their culmination
There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishment
He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening serenity as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishment
This is how the seven factors for awakening are developed  pursued so as to bring clear knowing  release to their culmination
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded to him
The Blessed One said Monks I will teach you noble right concentration with its supports  requisite conditions
Listen and pay close attention
I will speak
Yes lord the monks responded to him
The Blessed One said Now what monks is noble right concentration with its supports  requisite conditions
Any singleness of mind equipped with these seven factors  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort  right mindfulness  is called noble right concentration with its supports  requisite conditions
Of those right view is the forerunner
And how is right view the forerunner
One discerns wrong view as wrong view and right view as right view
This is one's right view
And what is wrong view
'There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed
There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions
There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no contemplatives or brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' This is wrong view
And what is right view
Right view I tell you is of two sorts There is right view with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions there is right view that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path
And what is the right view with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions
'There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed

The discernment the faculty of discernment the strength of discernment analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening the path factor of right view in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is without effluents who is fully possessed of the noble path
This is the right view that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path
One makes an effort for the abandoning of wrong view  for entering into right view This is one's right effort
One is mindful to abandon wrong view  to enter  remain in right view This is one's right mindfulness
Thus these three qualities  right view right effort  right mindfulness  run  circle around right view
 Of those right view is the forerunner
And how is right view the forerunner
One discerns wrong resolve as wrong resolve and right resolve as right resolve
This is one's right view
And what is wrong resolve

Right resolve I tell you is of two sorts There is right resolve with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions there is right resolve that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path
And what is the right resolve with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions

This is the right resolve that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path
One makes an effort for the abandoning of wrong resolve  for entering right resolve This is one's right effort

 Of those right view is the forerunner
And how is right view the forerunner
One discerns wrong speech as wrong speech and right speech as right speech
This is one's right view
And what is wrong speech
Lying divisive talebearing abusive speech  idle chatter
This is wrong speech
And what is right speech

And what is the right speech with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions
Abstaining from lying from divisive talebearing from abusive speech  from idle chatter
This is the right speech with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions
And what is the right speech that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path
The abstaining desisting abstinence avoidance of the four forms of verbal misconduct in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is without effluents who is fully possessed of the noble path
This is the right speech that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path
One makes an effort for the abandoning of wrong speech  for entering right speech This is one's right effort
One is mindful to abandon wrong speech  to enter  remain in right speech This is one's right mindfulness
Thus these three qualities  right view right effort  right mindfulness  run  circle around right speech
 Of those right view is the forerunner
And how is right view the forerunner
One discerns wrong action as wrong action and right action as right action
This is one's right view
And what is wrong action
Killing taking what is not given illicit sex
This is wrong action
And what is right action
Right action I tell you is of two sorts There is right action with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions there is right action that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path
And what is the right action with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions

And what is the right livelihood with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abandons wrong livelihood and maintains his life with right livelihood
This is the right livelihood with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions
And what is the right livelihood that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path
The abstaining desisting abstinence avoidance of wrong livelihood in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is without effluents who is fully possessed of the noble path

One tries to abandon wrong livelihood  to enter into right livelihood This is one's right effort
One is mindful to abandon wrong livelihood  to enter  remain in right livelihood This is one's right mindfulness
Thus these three qualities  right view right effort  right mindfulness  run  circle around right livelihood
Of those right view is the forerunner
And how is right view the forerunner
In one of right view right resolve comes into being
In one of right resolve right speech comes into being
In one of right speech right action In one of right action right livelihood In one of right livelihood right effort In one of right effort right mindfulness In one of right mindfulness right concentration In one of right concentration right knowledge In one of right knowledge right release comes into being
Thus the learner is endowed with eight factors and the arahant with ten
Of those right view is the forerunner
And how is right view the forerunner
In one of right view wrong view is abolished
The many evil unskillful qualities that come into play with wrong view as their condition are also abolished while the many skillful qualities that have right view as their condition go to the culmination of their development
In one of right resolve wrong resolve is abolished In one of right speech wrong speech is abolished In one of right action wrong action is abolished In one of right livelihood wrong livelihood is abolished In one of right effort wrong effort is abolished In one of right mindfulness wrong mindfulness is abolished In one of right concentration wrong concentration is abolished In one of right knowledge wrong knowledge is abolished In one of right release wrong release is abolished

Thus monks there are twenty factors siding with skillfulness and twenty with unskillfulness
This Dhamma discourse on the Great Forty has been set rolling and cannot be stopped by any contemplative or brahman or deva or Mara and Brahma or anyone at all in the world
If any contemplative or brahman might think that this Great Forty Dhamma discourse should be censured  rejected there are ten legitimate implications of his statement that would form grounds for censuring him here  now
If he censures right view then he would honor any contemplatives  brahmans who are of wrong view he would praise them
If he censures right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration right knowledge If he censures right release then he would honor any contemplatives  brahmans who are of wrong release he would praise them
If any contemplative or brahman might think that this Great Forty Dhamma discourse should be censured  rejected there are these ten legitimate implications of his statement that would form grounds for censuring him here  now
Even Vassa  Bhañña  those teachers from Okkala who were proponents of nocausality noaction  noexistence  would not think that this Dhamma discourse on the Great Forty should be censured  rejected
Why is that
For fear of criticism opposition  reproach
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
Thus I have heard At one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the palace of Migara's mother in the Eastern Monastery
Then the brahman GanakaMoggallana approached the Lord having approached he exchanged greetings with the Lord having conversed in a friendly and courteous way he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance GanakaMoggallana the brahman spoke thus to the Lord Just as good Gotama in this palace of Migara's mother there can be seen a gradual training a gradual doing a gradual practice that is to say as far as the last flight of stairs so too good Gotama for these brahmans there can be seen a gradual training a gradual doing a gradual practice that is to say in the study so too good Gotama for these archers there can be seen a gradual practice that is to say in archery so too good Gotama for us whose livelihood is calculation there can be seen a gradual training a gradual practice that is to say in accountancy
For when we get a pupil good Gotama we first of all make him calculate 'One one two twos three threes four fours five fives six sixes seven sevens eight eights nine nines ten tens' and we good Gotama also make him calculate a hundred
Is it not possible good Gotama to lay down a similar gradual training gradual doing gradual practice in respect of this dhamma and discipline
It is possible brahman to lay down a gradual training a gradual doing a gradual practice in respect of this dhamma and discipline Brahman even a skilled trainer of horses having taken on a beautiful thoroughbred first of all gets it used to the training in respect of wearing the bit
Then he gets it used to further training  even so brahman the Tathagata having taken on a man to be tamed first of all disciplines him thus
'Come you monk be of moral habit live controlled by the control of the Obligations endowed with behavior and posture seeing peril in the slightest fault and undertaking them train yourself in the rules of training' As soon brahman as the monk is of moral habit controlled by the control of the Obligations endowed with behavior and posture seeing peril in the slightest fault and undertaking them trains himself in the rules of training the Tathagata disciplines him further saying
'Come you monk be guarded as to the doors of the senseorgans having seen a material shape with the eye do not be entranced with the general appearance do not be entranced with the detail for if one dwells with the organ of sight uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind may flow in
So fare along controlling it guard the organ of sight achieve control over the organ of sight
Having heard a sound with the ear Having smelt a smell with the nose Having savored a taste with the tongue Having felt a touch with the body Having cognized a mental state with the mind do not be entranced with the detail
For if one dwells with the organ of mind uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind may flow in
So fare along controlling it guard the organ of mind achieve control over the organ of mind'
As soon brahman as a monk is guarded as to the doors of the senseorgans the Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk be moderate in eating you should take food reflecting carefully not for fun or indulgence or personal charm or beautification but taking just enough for maintaining this body and keeping it going for keeping it unharmed for furthering the Brahmafaring with the thought Thus will I crush out an old feeling and I will not allow a new feeling to arise and then there will be for me subsistence and blamelessness and abiding in comfort'
As soon brahman as a monk is moderate in eating the Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk dwell intent on vigilance during the day while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental states during the middle watch of the night lie down on the right side in the lion posture foot resting on foot mindful clearly conscious reflecting on the thought of getting up again during the last watch of the night when you have arisen while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental states'
As soon brahman as a monk is intent on vigilance the Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk be possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness acting with clear consciousness whether you are approaching or departing acting with clear consciousness whether you are looking ahead or looking round acting with clear consciousness whether you are bending in or stretching out acting with clear consciousness whether you are carrying the outer cloak the bowl or robe acting with clear consciousness whether you are eating drinking munching savoring acting with clear consciousness whether you are obeying the calls of nature acting with clear consciousness whether you are walking standing sitting asleep awake talking or being silent'
As soon brahman as he is possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness the Tathagata disciplines him further saying 'Come you monk choose a remote lodging in a forest at the root of a tree on a mountain slope in a glen a hill cave a cemetery a woodland grove in the open or on a heap of straw' On returning from almsgathering after the meal the monk sits down crosslegged holding the back erect having made mindfulness rise up in front of him
He getting rid of covetousness for the world dwells with a mind devoid of covetousness he cleanses the mind of covetousness
Getting rid of the taint of illwill he dwells benevolent in mind compassionate and merciful towards all creatures and beings he cleanses the mind of illwill
Getting rid of sloth and torpor he dwells without sloth or torpor perceiving the light mindful and clearly conscious he cleanses the mind of sloth and torpor
Getting rid of restlessness and worry he dwells calmly the mind inward tranquil he cleanses the mind of restlessness and worry
Getting rid of doubt he dwells doubtcrossed unperplexed as to the states that are skilled he cleanses his mind of doubt
He by getting rid of these five hindrances which are defilements of the mind and deleterious to intuitive wisdom aloof from pleasures of the senses aloof from unskilled states of mind enters and abides in the first meditation which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought is born of aloofness and is rapturous and joyful
By allaying initial thought and discursive thought his mind subjectively tranquilized and fixed on one point he enters and abides in the second meditation which is devoid of initial thought and discursive thought is born of concentration and is rapturous and joyful
By the fading out of rapture he dwells with equanimity attentive and clearly conscious and experiences in his person that joy of which the ariyans say 'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful' and he enters and abides in the third meditation
By getting rid of anguish by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows he enters and abides in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish nor joy and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulness
Brahman such is my instruction for those monks who are learners who perfection being not yet attained dwell longing for the incomparable security from the bonds
But as for those monks who are perfected ones the cankers destroyed who have lived the life done what was to be done shed the burden attained to their own goal the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed and who are freed by perfect profound knowledge  these things conduce both to their abiding in ease here and now as well as to their mindfulness and clear consciousness
When this had been said the brahman GanakaMoggallana spoke thus to the Lord
Now on being exhorted thus and instructed thus by the good Gotama do all the good Gotama's disciples attain the unchanging goal  nibbana or do some not attain it
Some of my disciples brahman on being exhorted and instructed thus by me attain the unchanging goal  nibbana some do not attain it
What is the cause good Gotama what the reason that since nibbana does exist since the way leading to nibbana exists since the good Gotama exists as adviser some of the good Gotama's disciples on being exhorted thus and instructed thus by the good Gotama attain the unchanging goal  nibbana but some do not attain it
Well then brahman I will question you on this point in reply
As it is pleasing to you so you may answer me
What do you think about this brahman
Are you skilled in the way leading to Rajagaha
Yes sir skilled am I in the way leading to Rajagaha
What do you think about this
A man might come along here wanting to go to Rajagaha
Having approached you he might speak thus 'I want to go to Rajagaha sir show me the way to this Rajagaha' You might speak thus to him Yes my good man this road goes to Rajagaha go along it for a while
When you have gone along it for a while you will see a village go along for a while when you have gone along for a while you will see a market town go for a while
When you have gone along for a while you will see Rajagaha with its delightful parks delightful forests delightful fields delightful ponds
But although he has been exhorted and instructed thus by you he might take the wrong road and go westwards
Then a second man might come along wanting to go to Rajagaha you will see Rajagaha with its delightful ponds' Exhorted and instructed thus by you he might get to Rajagaha safely
What is the cause brahman what the reason that since Rajagaha does exist since the way leading to Rajagaha exists since you exist as adviser the one man although being exhorted and instructed thus by you may take the wrong road and go westwards while the other may get to Rajagaha safely
What can I good Gotama do in this matter
A shower of the way good Gotama am I
Even so brahman nibbana does exist the way leading to nibbana exists and I exist as adviser
But some of my disciples on being exhorted and instructed thus by me attain the unchanging goal  nibbana some do not attain it
What can I brahman do in this matter
A shower of the way brahman is a Tathagata
When this had been said the brahman GanakaMoggallana spoke thus to the Lord
Good Gotama as for those persons who in want of a way of living having gone forth from home into homelessness without faith who are crafty fraudulent deceitful who are unbalanced and puffed up who are shifty scurrilous and of loose talk the doors of whose senseorgans are not guarded who do not know moderation in eating who are not intent on vigilance indifferent to recluseship not of keen respect for the training who are ones for abundance lax taking the lead in backsliding shirking the burden of seclusion who are indolent of feeble energy of confused mindfulness not clearly conscious not concentrated but of wandering minds who are weak in wisdom drivelers  the good Gotama is not in communion with them
But as for those young men of respectable families who have gone forth from home into homelessness from faith who are not crafty fraudulent or deceitful who are not unbalanced or puffed up who are not shifty scurrilous or of loose talk the doors of whose senseorgans are guarded who know moderation in eating who are intent on vigilance longing for recluseship of keen respect for the training who are not ones for abundance not lax shirking backsliding taking the lead in seclusion who are of stirred up energy selfresolute with mindfulness aroused clearly conscious concentrated their minds onepointed who have wisdom are not drivelers  the good Gotama is in communion with them
As good Gotama black gum is pointed to as chief of rootscents as red sandalwood is pointed to as chief of the pithscents as jasmine is pointed to as chief of the flower scents  even so is the exhortation of the good Gotama highest among the teachings of today
Excellent good Gotama excellent good Gotama
As good Gotama one might set upright what had been upset or disclose what had been covered or show the way to one who had gone astray or bring an oillamp into the darkness so that those with vision might see material shapes  even so in many a figure is dhamma made clear by the good Gotama
I am going to the revered Gotama for refuge and to dhamma and to the Order of monks May the good Gotama accept me as a layfollower going for refuge from today forth for as long as life lasts
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in the Kuru country
Now there is a town of the Kurus called Kammasadhamma
There the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said Monks sensuality is inconstant hollow vain deceptive
It is illusory the babble of fools
Sensuality here  now sensuality in lives to come sensual perceptions here  now sensual perceptions in lives to come both are Mara's realm Mara's domain Mara's bait Mara's range
They lead to these evil unskillful mental states greed ill will  contentiousness
They arise for the obstruction of a disciple of the noble ones here in training
In that case the disciple of the noble ones considers this 'Sensuality here  now sensuality in lives to come sensual perceptions here  now sensual perceptions in lives to come both are Mara's realm Mara's domain Mara's bait Mara's range
They lead to these evil unskillful mental states greed ill will  contentiousness
They arise for the obstruction of a disciple of the noble ones here in training
What if I  overpowering the world and having determined my mind  were to dwell with an awareness that was abundant  enlarged
Having done so these evil unskillful mental states  greed ill will  contentiousness  would not come into being
With their abandoning my mind would become unlimited immeasurable  well developed' Practicing  frequently abiding in this way his mind acquires confidence in that dimension

With the breakup of the body after death it's possible that this leadingon consciousness of his will go to the imperturbable
This is declared to be the first practice conducive to the imperturbable

When this was said Ven
Ananda said to the Blessed One There is the case lord where a monk having practiced in this way  'It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me
What is what has come to be that I abandon'  obtains equanimity
Now would this monk be totally unbound or not
A certain such monk might Ananda and another might not'
What is the cause what is the reason whereby one might and another might not
There is the case Ananda where a monk having practiced in this way  'It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me
What is what has come to be that I abandon'  obtains equanimity
He relishes that equanimity welcomes it remains fastened to it
As he relishes that equanimity welcomes it remains fastened to it his consciousness is dependent on it is sustained by it
With clingingsustenance Ananda a monk is not totally unbound
Being sustained where is that monk sustained
The dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Then indeed being sustained he is sustained by the supreme sustenance
Being sustained Ananda he is sustained by the supreme sustenance for this  the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  is the supreme sustenance
There is the case where a monk having practiced in this way  'It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me
What is what has come to be that I abandon'  obtains equanimity
He does not relish that equanimity does not welcome it does not remain fastened to it
As he does not relish that equanimity does not welcome it does not remain fastened to it his consciousness is not dependent on it is not sustained by it
Without clingingsustenance Ananda a monk is totally unbound
It's amazing lord
It's astounding
For truly the Blessed One has declared to us the way to cross over the flood by going from one support to the next
But what is the noble liberation
There is the case Ananda where a disciple of the noble ones considers this 'Sensuality here  now sensuality in lives to come sensual perceptions here  now sensual perceptions in lives to come forms here  now forms in lives to come formperceptions here  now formperceptions in lives to come perceptions of the imperturbable perceptions of the dimension of nothingness perceptions of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception that is an identity to the extent that there is an identity
This is deathless the liberation of the mind through lack of clingingsustenance'
Now Ananda I have taught the practice conducive to the imperturbable
I have taught the practice conducive to the dimension of nothingness
I have taught the practice conducive to the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
I have taught the way to cross over the flood by going from one support to the next the noble liberation
Whatever a teacher should do  seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them  that have I done for you
Over there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellings
Practice jhana Ananda
Don't be heedless
Don't later fall into regret
This is our message to you all
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Ananda delighted in the Blessed One's words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migara's mother
And on that occasion  the uposatha of the fifteenth the night of a very full moon  he was sitting out in the open with the community of monks
Then a certain monk rising from his seat arranging his robe over one shoulder and placing his hands palmtopalm over the heart said to the Blessed One Lord there is an area where if the Blessed One would give me leave I would like the answer to a question
Very well then monk
Sit back down in your seat and ask whatever you want
Responding to the Blessed One Yes lord the monk sat back down in his seat and said to the Blessed One Aren't these the five clingingaggregates ie form as a clingingaggregate feeling perception fabrications consciousness as a clingingaggregate
Monk these are the five clingingaggregates ie form as a clingingaggregate feeling perception fabrications consciousness as a clingingaggregate
Saying Very good lord the monk delighted  approved of the Blessed One's words and then asked him a further question But in what lord are these five clingingaggregates rooted
Monk these five clingingaggregates are rooted in desire
Saying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question Is clinging the same thing as the five clingingaggregates or is clinging separate from the five clingingaggregates
Monk clinging is neither the same thing as the five clingingaggregates nor is it separate from the five clingingaggregates
Just that whatever passion  delight is there that's the clinging there
Saying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question Might there be diversity in the desire  passion for the five clingingaggregates
There might monk
There is the case where the thought occurs to someone 'May I be one with such a form in the future
May I be one with such a feeling perception fabrications such a consciousness in the future
This is how there would be diversity in the desire  passion for the five clingingaggregates
Saying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question To what extent does the designation 'aggregate' apply to the aggregates
Monk whatever form is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of form
Whatever feeling is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of feeling
Whatever perception is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of perception
Whatever fabrications are past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near those are called the aggregate of fabrication
Whatever consciousness is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of consciousness
This is the extent to which the term 'aggregate' applies to the aggregates
Saying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question Lord what is the cause what the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of form
What is the cause what the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of feeling perception fabrications consciousness
Monk the four great existents are the cause the four great existents the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of form
Contact is the cause contact the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of feeling
Contact is the cause contact the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of perception
Contact is the cause contact the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of fabrications
Nameform is the cause nameform the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of consciousness
Saying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question Lord how does selfidentity view come about
There is the case monk where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feeling
He assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perception
He assumes fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabrications
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
This monk is how selfidentity view comes about
Saying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question Lord how does selfidentity view no longer come about
There is the case monk where a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He does not assume feeling to be the self does not assume perception to be the self does not assume fabrications to be the self He does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
This monk is how selfidentity view no longer comes about
Saying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question What lord is the allure of form
What is its drawback
What is the escape from it
What is the allure of feeling perception fabrications consciousness
What is its drawback
What is the escape from it
Monk whatever pleasure  joy arises dependent on form that is the allure of form
The fact that form is inconstant stressful subject to change that is the drawback of form
The subduing of desire  passion the abandoning of desire  passion for form that is the escape from form
Whatever pleasure  joy arises dependent on feeling that is the allure of feeling
Whatever pleasure  joy arises dependent on perception that is the allure of perception
Whatever pleasure  joy arises dependent on fabrications that is the allure of fabrications
Whatever pleasure  joy arises dependent on consciousness that is the allure of consciousness
The fact that consciousness is inconstant stressful subject to change that is the drawback of consciousness
The subduing of desire  passion the abandoning of desire  passion for consciousness that is the escape from consciousness
Saying Very good lord the monk asked him a further question Knowing in what way seeing in what way is there  with regard to this body endowed with consciousness and with regard to all external signs  no longer any Imaking or mymaking or obsession with conceit
Monk one sees any form whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  every form as it actually is with right discernment 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
One sees any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever
One sees any consciousness whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  every consciousness  as it actually is with right discernment 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am' Monk knowing in this way seeing in this way there is  with regard to this body endowed with consciousness and with regard to all external signs  no longer any Imaking or mymaking or obsession with conceit
Now at that moment this line of thinking appeared in the awareness of a certain monk So  form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself fabrications are notself consciousness is notself
Then what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notself
Then the Blessed One realizing with his awareness the line of thinking in that monk's awareness addressed the monks It's possible that a senseless person  immersed in ignorance overcome with craving  might think that he could outsmart the Teacher's message in this way 'So  form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself fabrications are notself consciousness is notself
Then what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notself' Now monks haven't I trained you in counterquestioning with regard to this  that topic here  there
What do you think  Is form constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
 Is feeling constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
 Is perception constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
 Are fabrications constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
What do you think monks  Is consciousness constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Any feeling whatsoever
Any perception whatsoever
Any fabrications whatsoever
Any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
And while this explanation was being given the minds of sixty monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentations
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali in the Great Forest at the Peaked Pavilion
Now at that time a large number of monks had declared final gnosis in the Blessed One's presence We discern that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world' Sunakkhatta the Licchavin heard that A large number of monks it seems have declared final gnosis in the Blessed One's presence 'We discern that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world' Then Sunakkhatta the Licchavin went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I have heard lord that a large number of monks have declared final gnosis in the Blessed One's presence 'We discern that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world' Now have they rightly declared final gnosis or is it the case that some of them have declared final gnosis out of overestimation
Sunakkhatta of the monks who have declared final gnosis in my presence it is the case that some have rightly declared final gnosis whereas others have declared final gnosis out of overestimation
As for those who have rightly declared final gnosis that is their truth
As for those who have declared final gnosis out of overestimation the thought occurs to the Tathagata 'I will teach them the Dhamma' Yet there are cases when the thought has occurred to the Tathagata 'I will teach them the Dhamma' but there are worthless men who come to him having formulated question after question so that his thought 'I will teach them the Dhamma' changes into something else
Now is the time O Blessed One
Now is the time O One WellGone for the Blessed One to teach the Dhamma
Having heard the Blessed One the monks will remember it
Then in that case Sunakkhatta listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord Sunakkhatta the Licchavin responded to the Blessed One
The Blessed One said Sunakkhatta there are these five strings of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Sounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
These are the five strings of sensuality
Now there's the possible case where a certain person is intent on the baits of the world
When a person is intent on the baits of the world that sort of talk interests him his thinking  evaluating follow along those lines he feels at home with that sort of person and his mind gets along with that sort of person
But when talk concerning the imperturbable is going on he does not listen does not lend ear and does not exert his mind to know
He does not get along with that sort of person his mind does not feel at home with him
Suppose that there were a man who had left his home village or town a long time ago
And he were to meet with a man who had left the village or town only a short time ago
He would ask if the people in the village or town were secure wellfed  free of disease and the second man would tell him if they were secure wellfed  free of disease
Now what do you think Sunakkhatta
Would the first man listen to the second man lend ear and exert his mind to know
Would he get along with the second man would his mind feel at home with him
Yes lord
In the same way it is possible that there is the case where a certain person is intent on the baits of the world
When a person is intent on the baits of the world that sort of talk interests him his thinking  evaluating follow along those lines he feels at home with that sort of person and his mind gets along with that sort of person
But when talk concerning the imperturbable is going on he does not listen does not lend ear and does not exert his mind to know
He does not get along with that sort of person his mind does not feel at home with him
This is how it can be known that 'This person is intent on the baits of the world'
Now there's the possible case where a certain person is intent on the imperturbable
When a person is intent on the imperturbable that sort of talk interests him his thinking  evaluating follow along those lines he feels at home with that sort of person and his mind gets along with that sort of person
But when talk concerning the baits of the world is going on he does not listen does not lend ear and does not exert his mind to know
He does not get along with that sort of person his mind does not feel at home with him
Just as a yellow leaf released from its stem is incapable of ever again becoming green in the same way when a person is intent on the imperturbable he is released from the fetter of the baits of the world
This is how it can be known that 'This person disjoined from the fetter of the baits of the world is intent on the imperturbable'
Now there's the possible case where a certain person is intent on the dimension of nothingness
When a person is intent on the dimension of nothingness that sort of talk interests him his thinking  evaluating follow along those lines he feels at home with that sort of person and his mind gets along with that sort of person
But when talk concerning the imperturbable is going on he does not listen does not lend ear and does not exert his mind to know
He does not get along with that sort of person his mind does not feel at home with him
Just as a thick rock broken in two cannot be put back together again in the same way when a person is intent on the dimension of nothingness he has broken the fetter of the imperturbable
This is how it can be known that 'This person disjoined from the fetter of the imperturbable is intent on the dimension of nothingness'
Now there's the possible case where a certain person is intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
When a person is intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception that sort of talk interests him his thinking  evaluating follow along those lines he feels at home with that sort of person and his mind gets along with that sort of person
But when talk concerning the dimension of nothingness is going on he does not listen does not lend ear and does not exert his mind to know
He does not get along with that sort of person his mind does not feel at home with him
Sunakkhatta suppose that a person having eaten some delicious food were to vomit it up
What do you think  would he have any desire for that food
No lord
Why is that
Because he would consider that food to be disgusting
In the same way when a person is intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception he has vomited up the fetter of the dimension of nothingness
This is how it can be known that 'This person disjoined from the fetter of the dimension of nothingness is intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception'
Now there's the possible case where a certain person is rightly intent on Unbinding
When a person is rightly intent on Unbinding that sort of talk interests him his thinking  evaluating follow along those lines he feels at home with that sort of person and his mind gets along with that sort of person
But when talk concerning the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception is going on he does not listen does not lend ear and does not exert his mind to know
He does not get along with that sort of person his mind does not feel at home with him
Just as a palm tree with its top cut off is incapable of further growth in the same way when a person is rightly intent on Unbinding he has destroyed the fetter of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception has destroyed it by the root made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
This is how it can be known that 'This person disjoined from the fetter of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception is intent on Unbinding'
Now there's the possible case where a certain monk thinks 'Craving is said by the Contemplative to be an arrow
The poison of ignorance spreads its toxin through desire passion  ill will
I have abandoned the arrow
I have expelled the poison of ignorance
I am rightly intent on Unbinding' Because this is not true of him he might pursue those things that are unsuitable for a person rightly intent on Unbinding
He might pursue unsuitable forms  sights with the eye
He might pursue unsuitable sounds with the ear unsuitable aromas with the nose unsuitable flavors with the tongue unsuitable tactile sensations with the body
He might pursue unsuitable ideas with the intellect
When he pursues unsuitable forms  sights with the eye pursues unsuitable ideas with the intellect lust invades the mind
With his mind invaded by lust he incurs death or deathlike suffering
Suppose that a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poison
His friends  companions kinsmen  relatives would provide him with a surgeon
The surgeon would cut around the opening of the wound with a knife and then would probe for the arrow with a probe
He then would pull out the arrow and extract the poison leaving a residue behind
Knowing that a residue was left behind he would say 'My good man your arrow has been pulled out
The poison has been extracted with a residue left behind but it is not enough to do you harm
Eat suitable food
Don't eat unsuitable food or else the wound will fester
Wash the wound frequently smear it with an ointment frequently so that blood  pus don't fill the opening of the wound
Don't walk around in the wind  sun or else dust  dirt may contaminate the opening of the wound
Keep looking after the wound my good man and work for its healing'
The thought would occur to the man 'My arrow has been pulled out
The poison has been extracted with a residue left behind but it is not enough to do me harm' He would eat unsuitable food so the wound would fester
He wouldn't wash the wound or smear it with an ointment frequently so blood  pus would fill the opening of the wound
He would walk around in the wind  sun so dust  dirt would contaminate the opening of the wound
He wouldn't keep looking after the wound or work for its healing
Now both because of these unsuitable actions of his and because of the residue of the dirty poison left behind the wound would swell
With the swelling of the wound he would incur death or deathlike suffering
In the same way there's the possible case where a certain monk thinks 'Craving is said by the Contemplative to be an arrow
The poison of ignorance spreads its toxin through desire passion  ill will
I have abandoned the arrow
I have expelled the poison of ignorance
I am rightly intent on Unbinding' Because this is not true of him he might pursue those things that are unsuitable for a person rightly intent on Unbinding
He might pursue unsuitable forms  sights with the eye
He might pursue unsuitable sounds with the ear unsuitable aromas with the nose unsuitable flavors with the tongue unsuitable tactile sensations with the body
He might pursue unsuitable ideas with the intellect
When he pursues unsuitable forms  sights with the eye pursues unsuitable ideas with the intellect lust invades the mind
With his mind invaded by lust he incurs death or deathlike suffering
For this is death in the discipline of the noble ones when one renounces the training and returns to the lower life
And this is deathlike suffering when one commits a defiled offense
Now there's the possible case where a certain monk thinks 'Craving is said by the Contemplative to be an arrow
The poison of ignorance spreads its toxin through desire passion  ill will
I have abandoned the arrow
I have expelled the poison of ignorance
I am rightly intent on Unbinding' Because he is rightly intent on Unbinding he wouldn't pursue those things that are unsuitable for a person rightly intent on Unbinding
He wouldn't pursue unsuitable forms  sights with the eye
He wouldn't pursue unsuitable sounds with the ear unsuitable aromas with the nose unsuitable flavors with the tongue unsuitable tactile sensations with the body
He wouldn't pursue unsuitable ideas with the intellect
When he doesn't pursue unsuitable forms  sights with the eye doesn't pursue unsuitable ideas with the intellect lust doesn't invade the mind
With his mind not invaded by lust he doesn't incur death or deathlike suffering
Suppose that a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poison
His friends  companions kinsmen  relatives would provide him with a surgeon
The surgeon would cut around the opening of the wound with a knife and then would probe for the arrow with a probe
He then would pull out the arrow and extract the poison leaving no residue behind
Knowing that no residue was left behind he would say 'My good man your arrow has been pulled out
The poison has been extracted with no residue left behind so it is not enough to do you harm
Eat suitable food
Don't eat unsuitable food or else the wound will fester
Wash the wound frequently smear it with an ointment frequently so that blood  pus don't fill the opening of the wound
Don't walk around in the wind  sun or else dust  dirt may contaminate the opening of the wound
Keep looking after the wound my good man and work for its healing'
The thought would occur to the man 'My arrow has been pulled out
The poison has been extracted with no residue left behind so it is not enough to do me harm' He would eat suitable food so the wound wouldn't fester
He would wash the wound and smear it with an ointment frequently so blood  pus wouldn't fill the opening of the wound
He would not walk around in the wind  sun so dust  dirt wouldn't contaminate the opening of the wound
He would keep looking after the wound and would work for its healing
Now both because of these suitable actions of his and because of there being no residue of the poison left behind the wound would heal
With the healing of the wound and its being covered with skin he wouldn't incur death or deathlike suffering
In the same way there's the possible case where a certain monk thinks 'Craving is said by the Contemplative to be an arrow
The poison of ignorance spreads its toxin through desire passion  ill will
I have abandoned the arrow
I have expelled the poison of ignorance
I am rightly intent on Unbinding' Because he is rightly intent on Unbinding he wouldn't pursue those things that are unsuitable for a person rightly intent on Unbinding
He wouldn't pursue unsuitable forms  sights with the eye
He wouldn't pursue unsuitable sounds with the ear unsuitable aromas with the nose unsuitable flavors with the tongue unsuitable tactile sensations with the body
He wouldn't pursue unsuitable ideas with the intellect
When he doesn't pursue unsuitable forms  sights with the eye doesn't pursue unsuitable ideas with the intellect lust doesn't invade the mind
With his mind not invaded by lust he doesn't incur death or deathlike suffering
I have given this simile to convey a meaning
The meaning is this the wound stands for the six internal sense media the poison for ignorance the arrow for craving the probe for mindfulness the knife for noble discernment the surgeon for the Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened
Now when a monk  maintaining restraint over the six spheres of contact knowing that 'Acquisition is the root of stress'  is free from acquisition released in the total ending of acquisition it's not possible that with regard to acquisition he would stir his body or arouse his mind
Suppose there were a beverage in a bronze cup  consummate in its color smell  flavor  but mixed with poison
And suppose a man were to come along wanting to live not wanting to die desiring pleasure  abhorring pain
What do you think Sunakkhatta  would he drink the beverage in the bronze cup knowing that 'Having drunk this I will incur death or deathlike suffering'
No lord
In the same way when a monk  maintaining restraint over the six spheres of contact knowing that 'Acquisition is the root of stress'  is free from acquisition released in the total ending of acquisition it's not possible that with regard to acquisition he would stir his body or arouse his mind
Suppose there were a deadly poisonous viper and a man were to come along wanting to live not wanting to die desiring pleasure  abhorring pain
What do you think Sunakkhatta  would he give his hand or finger to the snake knowing that 'Having been bitten by this I will incur death or deathlike suffering'
No lord
In the same way when a monk  maintaining restraint over the six spheres of contact knowing that 'Acquisition is the root of stress'  is free from acquisition released in the total ending of acquisition it's not possible that with regard to acquisition he would stir his body or arouse his mind
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Sunakkhatta the Licchavin delighted in the Blessed One's words
 There are five ideas that ripen here and now in two ways
What five
Faith preference hearsaylearning arguing upon evidence and liking through pondering a view
Now something may have faith well placed in it and yet be hollow empty and false and again something may have no faith placed in it and yet be factual true and no other than it seems and so with preference and the rest
If a man has faith then he guards truth when he says My faith is thus but on that account draws no unreserved conclusion Only this is true the other is wrong In this way he guards the truth but there is as yet no discovery of truth
And so with preference and the rest
How is truth discovered
Here a bhikkhu lives near some village or town
Then a householder or his son goes to him in order to test him in three kinds of ideas in ideas provocative of greed of hate and of delusion wondering Are there in this venerable one any such ideas whereby his mind being obsessed he might not knowing say 'I know' unseeing say 'I see' or to get others to do likewise which would be long for their harm and suffering While thus testing him he comes to find that there are no such ideas in him and he finds that The bodily and verbal behavior of that venerable one are not those of one affected by lust or hate or delusion
But the True Idea that this venerable one teaches is profound hard to see and discover yet it is the most peaceful and superior of all out of reach of logical ratiocination subtle for the wise to experience such a True Idea cannot be taught by one affected by lust or hate or delusion
It is as soon as by testing him he comes to see that he is purified from ideas provocative of lust hate and delusion that he then plants his faith in him
When he visits him he respects him when he respects him he gives ear one who gives ear hears the True Idea he remembers it he investigates the meaning of the ideas remembered
When he does that he acquires a preference by pondering the ideas
That produces interest
One interested is actively committed
So committed he makes a judgment
According to his judgment he exerts himself
When he exerts himself he comes to realize with the body the ultimate truth and he sees it by the penetrating of it with understanding
That is how there is discovery of truth
But there is as yet no final arrival at truth
How is truth finally arrived at
Final arrival at truth is the repetition the keeping in being the development of those same ideas
That is how there is final arrival at truth

 Now at that time the Blessed One was sitting  exchanging courtesies  conversation with some very senior brahmans
It so happened that a brahman student named Kapadika was seated in the assembly young shavenheaded sixteen years old a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology  etymologies and the histories as a fifth skilled in philology  grammar wellversed in cosmology  the marks of a great man
While the very senior brahmans were conversing with the Blessed One he kept breaking in  interrupting their talk
So the Blessed One scolded him Venerable Bharadvaja don't break in  interrupt while the very senior brahmans are conversing
Wait until they are finished talking
When this was said the brahman Canki said to the Blessed One Master Gotama don't scold the brahman student Kapadika
He is a clansman learned wise with good delivery
He is capable of taking part in this discussion with Master Gotama
Then the thought occurred to the Blessed One Yes this brahman student Kapadika must be accomplished in the texts of the Three Vedas inasmuch as the brahmans honor him so
Then the thought occurred to Kapadika When Gotama the contemplative meets my gaze with his I will ask him a question
And so the Blessed One encompassing Kapadika's awareness with his awareness met his gaze
Kapadika thought Gotama the contemplative has turned to me
Suppose I ask him a question So he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama with regard to the ancient hymns of the brahmans  passed down through oral transmission  included in their canon  the brahmans have come to the definite conclusion that Only this is true anything else is worthless What does Master Gotama have to say to this
Tell me Bharadvaja is there among the brahmans even one brahman who says 'This I know this I see only this is true anything else is worthless' No Master Gotama
And has there been among the brahmans even one teacher or teacher's teacher back through seven generations who said 'This I know this I see only this is true anything else is worthless' No Master Gotama
And among the brahman seers of the past the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymns  those ancient hymns sung repeated  collected which brahmans at present still sing still chant repeating what was said repeating what was spoken  ie Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa  Bhagu was there even one of these who said 'This we know this we see only this is true anything else is worthless' No Master Gotama
So then Bharadvaja it seems that there isn't among the brahmans even one brahman who says 'This I know this I see only this is true anything else is worthless' And there hasn't been among the brahmans even one teacher or teacher's teacher back through seven generations who said 'This I know this I see only this is true anything else is worthless' And there hasn't been among the brahman seers of the past the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymns even one who said 'This we know this we see only this is true anything else is worthless' Suppose there were a row of blind men each holding on to the one in front of him the first one doesn't see the middle one doesn't see the last one doesn't see
In the same way the statement of the brahmans turns out to be a row of blind men as it were the first one doesn't see the middle one doesn't see the last one doesn't see
So what do you think Bharadvaja this being the case doesn't the conviction of the brahmans turn out to be groundless
It's not only out of conviction Master Gotama that the brahmans honor this
They also honor it as unbroken tradition
Bharadvaja first you went by conviction
Now you speak of unbroken tradition
There are five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenow
Which five
Conviction liking unbroken tradition reasoning by analogy  an agreement through pondering views
These are the five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenow
Now some things are firmly held in conviction and yet vain empty  false
Some things are not firmly held in conviction and yet they are genuine factual  unmistaken
Some things are wellliked truly an unbroken tradition wellreasoned Some things are wellpondered and yet vain empty  false
Some things are not wellpondered and yet they are genuine factual  unmistaken
In these cases it isn't proper for a knowledgeable person who safeguards the truth to come to a definite conclusion 'Only this is true anything else is worthless
But to what extent Master Gotama is there the safeguarding of the truth
To what extent does one safeguard the truth
We ask Master Gotama about the safeguarding of the truth
If a person has conviction his statement 'This is my conviction' safeguards the truth
But he doesn't yet come to the definite conclusion that 'Only this is true anything else is worthless' To this extent Bharadvaja there is the safeguarding of the truth
To this extent one safeguards the truth
I describe this as the safeguarding of the truth
But it is not yet an awakening to the truth
If a person likes something holds an unbroken tradition has something reasoned through analogy has something he agrees to having pondered views his statement 'This is what I agree to having pondered views' safeguards the truth
But he doesn't yet come to the definite conclusion that 'Only this is true anything else is worthless' To this extent Bharadvaja there is the safeguarding of the truth
To this extent one safeguards the truth
I describe this as the safeguarding of the truth
But it is not yet an awakening to the truth
Yes Master Gotama to this extent there is the safeguarding of the truth
To this extent one safeguards the truth
We regard this as the safeguarding of the truth
But to what extent is there an awakening to the truth
To what extent does one awaken to the truth
We ask Master Gotama about awakening to the truth
There is the case Bharadvaja where a monk lives in dependence on a certain village or town
Then a householder or householder's son goes to him and observes him with regard to three mental qualities  qualities based on greed qualities based on aversion qualities based on delusion 'Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on greed that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say I know while not knowing or say I see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for hisher longterm harm  pain' As he observes him he comes to know 'There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on greed His bodily behavior  verbal behavior are those of one not greedy
And the Dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
This Dhamma can't easily be taught by a person who's greedy
When on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on greed he next observes him with regard to qualities based on aversion 'Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on aversion that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say I know while not knowing or say I see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for hisher longterm harm  pain' As he observes him he comes to know 'There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on aversion His bodily behavior  verbal behavior are those of one not aversive
And the Dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
This Dhamma can't easily be taught by a person who's aversive
When on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on aversion he next observes him with regard to qualities based on delusion 'Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on delusion that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say I know while not knowing or say I see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for hisher longterm harm  pain' As he observes him he comes to know 'There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on delusion His bodily behavior  verbal behavior are those of one not deluded
And the Dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
This Dhamma can't easily be taught by a person who's deluded
When on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on delusion he places conviction in him
With the arising of conviction he visits him  grows close to him
Growing close to him he lends ear
Lending ear he hears the Dhamma
Hearing the Dhamma he remembers it
Remembering it he penetrates the meaning of those dhammas
Penetrating the meaning he comes to an agreement through pondering those dhammas
There being an agreement through pondering those dhammas desire arises
With the arising of desire he becomes willing
Willing he contemplates
Contemplating he makes an exertion
Exerting himself he both realizes the ultimate meaning of the truth with his body and sees by penetrating it with discernment
To this extent Bharadvaja there is an awakening to the truth
To this extent one awakens to the truth
I describe this as an awakening to the truth
But it is not yet the final attainment of the truth
Yes Master Gotama to this extent there is an awakening to the truth
To this extent one awakens to the truth
We regard this as an awakening to the truth
But to what extent is there the final attainment of the truth
To what extent does one finally attain the truth
We ask Master Gotama about the final attainment of the truth
The cultivation development  pursuit of those very same qualities to this extent Bharadvaja there is the final attainment of the truth
To this extent one finally attains the truth
I describe this as the final attainment of the truth
Yes Master Gotama to this extent there is the final attainment of the truth
To this extent one finally attains the truth
We regard this as the final attainment of the truth
But what quality is most helpful for the final attainment of the truth
We ask Master Gotama about the quality most helpful for the final attainment of the truth
Exertion is most helpful for the final attainment of the truth Bharadvaja
If one didn't make an exertion one wouldn't finally attain the truth
Because one makes an exertion one finally attains the truth
Therefore exertion is most helpful for the final attainment of the truth
But what quality is most helpful for exertion
We ask Master Gotama about the quality most helpful for exertion
Contemplating is most helpful for exertion Bharadvaja
If one didn't contemplate one wouldn't make an exertion
Because one contemplates one makes an exertion
Therefore contemplating is most helpful for exertion
But what quality is most helpful for contemplating Being willing If one weren't willing one wouldn't contemplate But what quality is most helpful for being willing Desire If desire didn't arise one wouldn't be willing But what quality is most helpful for desire Coming to an agreement through pondering dhammas If one didn't come to an agreement through pondering dhammas desire wouldn't arise But what quality is most helpful for coming to an agreement through pondering dhammas Penetrating the meaning If one didn't penetrate the meaning one wouldn't come to an agreement through pondering dhammas But what quality is most helpful for penetrating the meaning Remembering the Dhamma If one didn't remember the Dhamma one wouldn't penetrate the meaning But what quality is most helpful for remembering the Dhamma 
Hearing the Dhamma If one didn't hear the Dhamma one wouldn't remember the Dhamma But what quality is most helpful for hearing the Dhamma 
Lending ear If one didn't lend ear one wouldn't hear the Dhamma But what quality is most helpful for lending ear 
Growing close If one didn't grow close one wouldn't lend ear But what quality is most helpful for growing close 
Visiting If one didn't visit one wouldn't grow close But what quality is most helpful for visiting
We ask Master Gotama about the quality most helpful for visiting
Conviction is most helpful for visiting Bharadvaja
If conviction didn't arise one wouldn't visit
Because conviction arises one visits
Therefore conviction is most helpful for visiting
We have asked Master Gotama about safeguarding the truth and Master Gotama has answered about safeguarding the truth
We like that  agree with that and so we are gratified
We have asked Master Gotama about awakening to the truth and Master Gotama has answered about awakening to the truth
We like that  agree with that and so we are gratified
We have asked Master Gotama about finally attaining the truth and Master Gotama has answered about finally attaining the truth
We like that  agree with that and so we are gratified
We have asked Master Gotama about the quality most helpful for finally attaining the truth and Master Gotama has answered about the quality most helpful for finally attaining the truth
We like that  agree with that and so we are gratified
Whatever we have asked Master Gotama Master Gotama has answered it
We like that  agree with that and so we are gratified
We used to think 'Who are these baldheaded contemplatives these menial dark offspring of the Kinsman's feet
Who are they to know the Dhamma' But now Master Gotama has inspired within us a contemplativelove for contemplatives a contemplativeconfidence in contemplatives a contemplativerespect for contemplatives
Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life

In this sutta the Buddha refutes the theories of the Jains  here called the Niganthas  an order of contemplatives flourishing in India during his time
Although on the surface this sutta may seem to be of strictly historical interest it makes two important points that are very relevant to some common misunderstandings about Buddhism alive today
The first point concerns the Buddhist teaching on action or kamma
The general understanding of this teaching is that actions from the past determine present pleasure and pain while present actions determine future pleasure and pain
Or to quote a recent book devoted to the topic Karma is the moral principle that governs human conduct
It declares that our present experience is conditioned by our past conduct and that our present conduct will condition our future experience This however does not accurately describe the Buddha's teaching on karma and is instead a fairly accurate account of the Nigantha teaching which the Buddha explicitly refutes here
As he interrogates the Niganthas he makes the point that if all pleasure and pain experienced in the present were determined by past action why is it that they now feel the pain of harsh treatment when they practice asceticism and no pain of harsh treatment when they don't
If past action were the sole determining factor then present action should have no effect on their present experience of pleasure or pain
In this way the Buddha points to one of the most distinctive features of his own teaching on kamma that the present experience of pleasure and pain is a combined result of both past and present actions
This seemingly small addition to the notion of kamma plays an enormous role in allowing for the exercise of free will and the possibility of putting an end to suffering before the effects of all past actions have ripened
In other words this addition is what makes Buddhist practice possible and makes it possible for a person who has completed the practice to survive and teach it with full authority to others
For more on these points see the articles Karma A Refuge in Skillful Action and Five Piles of Bricks see also the Introduction to The Wings to Awakening along with the introductions to the sections on Skillfulness and Kamma  the Ending of Kamma in that book
The second important point touched on in this sutta  how to put an end to pain and suffering  relates to the first
If the cause of present suffering were located exclusively in the past no one could do anything in the present moment to stop that suffering the most that could be done would be to endure the suffering while not creating any new kamma leading to future suffering
Although this was the Jain approach to practice many people at present believe that it is the Buddhist approach as well
Meditation according to this understanding is the process of purifying the mind of old kamma by training it to look on with nonreactive equanimity as pain arises
The pain is the result of old kamma the equanimity adds no new kamma and thus over time all old kamma can be burned away
In this sutta however the Buddha heaps ridicule on this idea
First he notes that none of the Niganthas have ever come to the end of pain by trying to burn it away in this way then he notes that they have based their belief in this practice entirely on their faith in their teacher and their approval of his ideas but neither faith nor approval can act as guarantees of the truth
As he illustrates with his simile of the man shot with an arrow only a person who has succeeded in going beyond pain would be in a position to speak with authority of the method that actually puts an end to pain

The Buddha then provides his own account of how meditation actually works in putting an end to pain and suffering
His discussion shows that the problem underlying pain is not past action but passion  in the present  for the causes of pain
In other words pain is not inevitable
Present suffering can be prevented by changing one's understanding of and attitude toward the cause of suffering in the present
The Buddha illustrates this principle with the simile of a man in love with a woman As long as he feels passion for her he will suffer when he sees her enjoying the company of another man when seeing the connection between his suffering and his passion he abandons that passion he will no longer suffer from that cause
Thus the practice must focus on ways to understand and bring about dispassion for the causes of stress and pain here and now
As the Buddha points out in MN equanimity plays an important role in this practice but it can also become an object for passion and delight which would then stand in the way of true release
Thus he notes here that in some cases dispassion can arise simply from onlooking equanimity directed at the causes of stress
In other cases it can come only through exertion the mental effort  through the fabrications of directed thought evaluation and perception  to develop the discernment needed to see through and abandon any and all passion
The remainder of the sutta is devoted to a standard map of how the practice develops over time showing how the proper mixture of onlooking equanimity combined with fabrication and exertion can lead to dispassion and through dispassion to release from all stress and suffering
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans
Now the Sakyans have a city named Devadaha and there the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said Monks there are some brahmans  contemplatives who teach in this way who have this view 'Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the past
Thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the future
With no flow into the future there is the ending of action
With the ending of action the ending of stress
With the ending of stress the ending of feeling
With the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted' Such is the teaching of the Niganthas
Going to Niganthas who teach in this way I have asked them 'Is it true friend Niganthas that you teach in this way that you have this view Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the past
Thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the future
With no flow into the future there is the ending of action
With the ending of action the ending of stress
With the ending of stress the ending of feeling
With the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted'
Having been asked this by me the Niganthas admitted it 'Yes'
So I said to them 'But friends do you know that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist'
'No friend'
'And do you know that you did evil actions in the past and that you did not not do them'
'No friend'
'And do you know that you did suchandsuch evil actions in the past'
'No friend'
'And do you know that soandso much stress has been exhausted or that soandso much stress remains to be exhausted or that with the exhaustion of soandso much stress all stress will be exhausted'
'No friend'
'But do you know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenow'
'No friend'
'So friends it seems that you don't know that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist you don't know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenow
That being the case it is not proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the past
Thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the future
With no flow into the future there is the ending of action
With the ending of action the ending of stress
With the ending of stress the ending of feeling
With the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted
'If however you knew that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist if you knew that you did evil actions in the past and that you did not not do them if you knew that you did suchandsuch evil actions in the past you don't know that soandso much stress has been exhausted or that soandso much stress remains to be exhausted or that with the exhaustion of soandso much stress all stress will be exhausted if you knew what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenow then  that being the case  it would be proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the past
Thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the future
With no flow into the future there is the ending of action
With the ending of action the ending of stress
With the ending of stress the ending of feeling
With the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted
'Friend Niganthas it's as if a man were shot with an arrow thickly smeared with poison
As a result of being shot with the arrow he would feel fierce sharp racking pains
His friends  companions kinsmen  relatives would provide him with a surgeon
The surgeon would cut around the opening of the wound with a knife
As a result of the surgeon's cutting around the opening of the wound with a knife the man would feel fierce sharp racking pains
The surgeon would probe for the arrow with a probe
As a result of the surgeon's probing for the arrow with a probe the man would feel fierce sharp racking pains
The surgeon would then pull out the arrow
As a result of the surgeon's pulling out the arrow the man would feel fierce sharp racking pains
The surgeon would then apply a burning medicine to the mouth of the wound
As a result of the surgeon's applying a burning medicine to the mouth of the wound the man would feel fierce sharp racking pains
But then at a later time when the wound had healed and was covered with skin he would be well  happy free master of himself able to go wherever he liked
The thought would occur to him Before I was shot with an arrow thickly smeared with poison
As a result of being shot with the arrow I felt fierce sharp racking pains
My friends  companions kinsmen  relatives provided me with a surgeon The surgeon cut around the opening of the wound with a knife probed for the arrow with a probe pulled out the arrow applied a burning medicine to the mouth of the wound
As a result of his applying a burning medicine to the mouth of the wound I felt fierce sharp racking pains
But now that the wound is healed and covered with skin I am well  happy free master of myself able to go wherever I like
'In the same way friend Niganthas if you knew that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist if you knew what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenow then  that being the case  it would be proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the past
Thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the future
With no flow into the future there is the ending of action
With the ending of action the ending of stress
With the ending of stress the ending of feeling
With the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted But because you do not know that you existed in the past you do not know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenow then  that being the case  it is not proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the past
Thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the future
With no flow into the future there is the ending of action
With the ending of action the ending of stress
With the ending of stress the ending of feeling
With the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted
When this was said the Niganthas said to me 'Friend the Nigantha Nataputta is allknowing allseeing and claims total knowledge  vision thus Whether I am walking or standing sleeping or awake knowledge  vision are continuously  continually established in me He has told us Niganthas there are evil actions that you have done in the past
Exhaust them with these painful austerities
When in the present you are restrained in body restrained in speech and restrained in mind that is the nondoing of evil action for the future
Thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the future
With no flow into the future there is the ending of action
With the ending of action the ending of stress
With the ending of stress the ending of feeling
With the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted We approve of that prefer it and are gratified by it'
When this was said I said to the Niganthas 'Friend Niganthas there are five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenow
Which five
Conviction liking unbroken tradition reasoning by analogy  an agreement through pondering views
These are the five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenow
That being the case what kind of conviction do you have for your teacher with regard to the past
What kind of liking
What kind of unbroken tradition
What kind of reasoning by analogy
What kind of agreement through pondering views' But when I said this I did not see that the Niganthas had any legitimate defense of their teaching
So I asked them further 'Friend Niganthas what do you think When there is fierce striving fierce exertion do you feel fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment
And when there is no fierce striving no fierce exertion do you feel no fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment'
'Yes friend'
' Then it's not proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the past
Thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the future
With no flow into the future there is the ending of action
With the ending of action the ending of stress
With the ending of stress the ending of feeling
With the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted
'If it were the case that when there was fierce striving fierce exertion you felt fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment and when there was no fierce striving no fierce exertion you still felt fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment then  that being the case  it would be proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the past
Thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the future
With no flow into the future there is the ending of action
With the ending of action the ending of stress
With the ending of stress the ending of feeling
With the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted But because when there is fierce striving fierce exertion you feel fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment and when there was no fierce striving no fierce exertion you feel no fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment then  that being the case  it is not proper for you to assert that Whatever a person experiences  pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain  all is caused by what was done in the past
Thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the future
With no flow into the future there is the ending of action
With the ending of action the ending of stress
With the ending of stress the ending of feeling
With the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted' But when I said this I did not see that the Niganthas had any legitimate defense of their teaching
So I asked them further 'Friend Niganthas what do you think Can an action to be experienced in the herenow be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced in the future life'
'No friend'
'Can an action to be experienced in the future life be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced in the herenow'
'No friend'
What do you think Can an action to be experienced as pleasure be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced as pain'
'No friend'
'Can an action to be experienced as pain be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced as pleasure'
'No friend'
What do you think Can an action ripe to be experienced be turned through striving  exertion into an action not ripe to be experienced'
'No friend'
'Can an action not ripe to be experienced be turned through striving  exertion into an action ripe to be experienced'
'No friend'
What do you think Can an action greatly to be experienced be turned through striving  exertion into an action barely to be experienced'
'No friend'
'Can an action barely to be experienced be turned through striving  exertion into an action greatly to be experienced'
'No friend'
What do you think Can an action to be experienced be turned through striving  exertion into an action not to be experienced'
'No friend'
'Can an action not to be experienced be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced'
'No friend'
'So friends it seems that an action to be experienced in the herenow cannot be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced in the future life
An action to be experienced in the future life cannot be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced in the herenow An action to be experienced cannot be turned through striving  exertion into an action not to be experienced
An action not to be experienced cannot be turned through striving  exertion into an action to be experienced
That being the case the striving of the Niganthas is fruitless their exertion is fruitless'
Such is the teaching of the Niganthas
And such being the teaching of the Niganthas ten legitimate deductions can be drawn that give grounds for censuring them
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on what was done in the past then obviously the Niganthas have done bad things in the past which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking pains
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on the creative act of a supreme god then obviously the Niganthas have been created by an evil supreme god which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking pains
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on sheer luck then obviously the Niganthas have evil luck which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking pains
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on birth then obviously the Niganthas have had an evil birth which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking pains
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on efforts in the herenow then obviously the Niganthas have evil efforts in the herenow which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking pains
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on what was done in the past the Niganthas deserve censure
Even if not they still deserve censure
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on the creative act of a supreme god the Niganthas deserve censure
Even if not they still deserve censure
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on sheer luck the Niganthas deserve censure
Even if not they still deserve censure
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on birth the Niganthas deserve censure
Even if not they still deserve censure
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on efforts in the herenow the Niganthas deserve censure
Even if not they still deserve censure
Such is the teaching of the Niganthas monks
And such being the teaching of the Niganthas these ten legitimate deductions can be drawn that give grounds for censuring them
This is how striving is fruitless how exertion is fruitless
And how is striving fruitful how is exertion fruitful
There is the case where a monk when not loaded down does not load himself down with pain nor does he reject pleasure that accords with the Dhamma although he is not fixated on that pleasure
He discerns that 'When I exert a fabrication against this cause of stress then from the fabrication of exertion there is dispassion
When I look on with equanimity at that cause of stress then from the development of equanimity there is dispassion' So he exerts a fabrication against the cause of stress where there comes dispassion from the fabrication of exertion and develops equanimity with regard to the cause of stress where there comes dispassion from the development of equanimity
Thus the stress coming from the cause of stress for which there is dispassion through the fabrication of exertion is exhausted  the stress resulting from the cause of stress for which there is dispassion through the development of equanimity is exhausted
Suppose that a man is in love with a woman his mind ensnared with fierce desire fierce passion
He sees her standing with another man chatting joking  laughing
What do you think monks As he sees her standing with another man chatting joking  laughing would sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise in him
Yes lord
Why is that
Because he is in love with her his mind ensnared with fierce desire fierce passion Now suppose the thought were to occur to him 'I am in love with this woman my mind ensnared with fierce desire fierce passion
When I see her standing with another man chatting joking  laughing then sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise within me
Why don't I abandon my desire  passion for that woman' So he abandons his desire  passion for that woman and afterwards sees her standing with another man chatting joking  laughing
What do you think monks As he sees her standing with another man chatting joking  laughing would sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise in him
No lord
Why is that
He is dispassionate toward that woman In the same way the monk when not loaded down does not load himself down with pain nor does he reject pleasure that accords with the Dhamma although he is not infatuated with that pleasure
He discerns that 'When I exert a fabrication against this cause of stress then from the fabrication of exertion there is dispassion
When I look on with equanimity at that cause of stress then from the development of equanimity there is dispassion' So he exerts a fabrication against the cause of stress where there comes dispassion from the fabrication of exertion and develops equanimity with regard to the cause of stress where there comes dispassion from the development of equanimity
Thus the stress coming from the cause of stress for which there is dispassion through the fabrication of exertion is exhausted  the stress resulting from the cause of stress for which there is dispassion through the development of equanimity is exhausted
Furthermore the monk notices this 'When I live according to my pleasure unskillful mental qualities increase in me  skillful qualities decline
When I exert myself with stress  pain though unskillful qualities decline in me  skillful qualities increase
Why don't I exert myself with stress  pain' So he exerts himself with stress  pain and while he is exerting himself with stress  pain unskillful qualities decline in him  skillful qualities increase
Then at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress  pain
Why is that
Because he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress  pain
That is why at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress  pain
Suppose a fletcher were to heat  warm an arrow shaft between two flames making it straight  pliable
Then at a later time he would no longer heat  warm the shaft between two flames making it straight  pliable
Why is that
Because he has attained the goal for which he was heating  warming the shaft
That is why at a later time he would no longer heat  warm the shaft between two flames making it straight  pliable
In the same way the monk notices this 'When I live according to my pleasure unskillful mental qualities increase in me  skillful qualities decline
When I exert myself with stress  pain though unskillful qualities decline in me  skillful qualities increase
Why don't I exert myself with stress  pain' So he exerts himself with stress  pain and while he is exerting himself with stress  pain unskillful qualities decline in him  skillful qualities increase
Then at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress  pain
Why is that
Because he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress  pain
That is why at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress  pain
This is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful
Furthermore there is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakened
He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its end
He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
A householder or householder's son hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects 'Household life is confining a dusty path
Life gone forth is the open air
It isn't easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
What if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessness'
So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness
When he has thus gone forth endowed with the monks' training  livelihood then  abandoning the taking of life  he abstains from the taking of life
He dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given
He takes only what is given accepts only what is given lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure
This too is part of his virtue
Abandoning uncelibacy he lives a celibate life aloof refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way
Abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech
He speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the world
Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech
What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here
What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concord
Abandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speech
He speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing and pleasing to people at large
Abandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter
He speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma and the Vinaya
He speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal
He abstains from damaging seed and plant life
He eats only once a day refraining from the evening meal and from food at the wrong time of day
He abstains from dancing singing instrumental music and from watching shows
He abstains from wearing garlands and from beautifying himself with scents and cosmetics
He abstains from high and luxurious beds and seats
He abstains from accepting gold and money
He abstains from accepting uncooked grain raw meat women and girls male and female slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle steeds and mares fields and property
He abstains from running messages from buying and selling from dealing with false scales false metals and false measures from bribery deception and fraud
He abstains from mutilating executing imprisoning highway robbery plunder and violence
He is content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hunger
Just as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hunger
Wherever he goes he takes only his barest necessities along
Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
On seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
On hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odor with the nose On tasting a flavor with the tongue On touching a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
When going forward and returning he acts with alertness
When looking toward and looking away when bending and extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe and his bowl when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and remaining silent he acts with alertness
Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue this noble restraint over the sense faculties this noble mindfulness  alertness he seeks out a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of straw
After his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the fore
Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness
He cleanses his mind of covetousness
Abandoning ill will and anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings
He cleanses his mind of ill will and anger
Abandoning sloth and drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness mindful alert percipient of light
He cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsiness
Abandoning restlessness and anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilled
He cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxiety
Abandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities
He cleanses his mind of uncertainty
Having abandoned these five hindrances  imperfections of awareness that weaken discernment  then quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluation
This too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful
Then with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure onepointedness of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assurance
This too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful
Then with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' This too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful
Then with the abandoning of pleasure and pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
This too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives
He recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details
This too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
He sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
This too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations
He discerns as it has come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignorance
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' This too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful
Such is the teaching of the Tathagata
And such being the teaching of the Tathagata ten legitimate deductions can be drawn that give grounds for praising him
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on what was done in the past then obviously the Tathagata has done good things in the past which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentation
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on the creative act of a supreme god then obviously the Tathagata has been created by an excellent supreme god which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentation
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on sheer luck then obviously the Tathagata has admirable luck which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentation
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on birth then obviously the Tathagata has had an admirable birth which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentation
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on efforts in the herenow then obviously the Tathagata has admirable efforts in the herenow which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentation
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on what was done in the past the Tathagata deserves praise
Even if not he still deserves praise
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on the creative act of a supreme god Tathagata deserves praise
Even if not he still deserves praise
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on sheer luck the Tathagata deserves praise
Even if not he still deserves praise
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on birth Tathagata deserves praise
Even if not he still deserves praise
If beings experience pleasure  pain based on efforts in the herenow the Tathagata deserves praise
Even if not he still deserves praise
Such is the teaching of the Tathagata
And such being the teaching of the Tathagata these ten legitimate deductions can be drawn that give grounds for praising him
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Sanctuary
Now on that occasion Ven
Sariputta was wandering in the Southern Mountains with a large community of monks
Then a certain monk who had spent the Rains in Rajagaha went to the Southern Mountains to Ven
Sariputta
On arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with Ven
Sariputta and  after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies  sat to one side
As he was sitting there Ven
Sariputta said to him I trust friend that the Blessed One is strong  free from illness
The Blessed One friend is strong  free from illness
I trust that the community of monks is strong  free from illness
The community of monks is also strong  free from illness
At the Tandulapala Gate is a brahman named Dhanañjanin
I trust that he is strong  free from illness
Dhanañjanin the brahman is also strong  free from illness
And I trust that Dhanañjanin the brahman is heedful
From where would our Dhanañjanin the brahman get any heedfulness friend
Relying on the king he plunders brahmans  householders
Relying on the brahmans  householders he plunders the king
His wife  a woman of faith fetched from a family with faith  has died
He has fetched another wife  a woman of no faith  from a family with no faith
What a bad thing to hear my friend  when we hear that Dhanañjanin the brahman is heedless
Perhaps sooner or later we might meet with Dhanañjanin the brahman
Perhaps there might be some conversation
Then Ven
Sariputta having stayed in the Southern Mountains as long as he liked wandered in the direction of Rajagaha
After wandering by stages he arrived at Rajagaha
There he stayed near Rajagaha in the Squirrels' Sanctuary
Then early in the morning Ven
Sariputta put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe went into Rajagaha for alms
And on that occasion Dhanañjanin the brahman was milking cows in a cow pen outside the city
Then Ven
Sariputta having gone for alms in Rajagaha after his meal on his way back from his almsround went to Dhanañjanin the brahman
Dhanañjanin the brahman saw Ven
Sariputta coming from afar
On seeing him he went to him and said Drink some of this fresh milk master Sariputta
It must be time for your meal
That's all right brahman
I have finished my meal for today
My day's abiding will be under that tree over there
You may come there
As you say master Dhanañjanin responded to Ven
Sariputta
Then after he had finished his morning meal he went to Ven
Sariputta
On arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with Ven
Sariputta and  after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies  sat to one side
As he was sitting there Ven
Sariputta said to him I trust Dhanañjanin that you are heedful
From where would we get any heedfulness master
 when parents are to be supported wife  children are to be supported slaves  workers are to be supported friendcompanion duties are to be done for friends  companions kinsmenrelative duties for kinsmen  relatives guest duties for guests departedancestor duties for departed ancestors devata duties for devatas king duties for the king and this body also has to be refreshed  nourished
What do you think Dhanañjanin
There is the case where a certain person for the sake of his mother  father does what is unrighteous does what is discordant
Then because of his unrighteous discordant behavior hellwardens drag him off to hell
Would he gain anything by saying 'I did what is unrighteous what is discordant for the sake of my mother  father
Don't me into hell hellwardens' Or would his mother  father gain anything for him by saying 'He did what is unrighteous what is discordant for our sake
Don't him into hell hellwardens'
No master Sariputta
Even right while he was wailing they'd cast him into hell
What do you think Dhanañjanin
There is the case where a certain person for the sake of his wife  children his slaves  workers his friends  companions his kinsmen  relatives his guests his departed ancestors the devatas the king does what is unrighteous does what is discordant
Then because of his unrighteous discordant behavior hellwardens drag him off to hell
Would he gain anything by saying 'I did what is unrighteous what is discordant for the sake of the king
Don't me into hell hellwardens' Or would the king gain anything for him by saying 'He did what is unrighteous what is discordant for our sake
Don't him into hell hellwardens'
No master Sariputta
Even right while he was wailing they'd cast him into hell
What do you think Dhanañjanin
There is the case where a certain person for the sake of refreshing  nourishing his body does what is unrighteous does what is discordant
Then because of his unrighteous discordant behavior hellwardens drag him off to hell
Would he gain anything by saying 'I did what is unrighteous what is discordant for the sake of refreshing  nourishing my body
Don't me into hell hellwardens' Or would others gain anything for him by saying 'He did what is unrighteous what is discordant for the sake of refreshing  nourishing his body
Don't him into hell hellwardens'
No master Sariputta
Even right while he was wailing they'd cast him into hell
Now what do you think Dhanañjanin
Which is the better one who for the sake of his mother  father would do what is unrighteous what is discordant or one who for the sake of his mother  father would do what is righteous what is concordant
Master Sariputta the one who for the sake of his mother  father would do what is unrighteous what is discordant is not the better one
The one who for the sake of his mother  father would do what is righteous what is concordant would be the better one there
Righteous behavior concordant behavior is better than unrighteous behavior discordant behavior
Dhanañjanin there are other activities  reasonable righteous  by which one can support one's mother  father and at the same time both not do evil and practice the practice of merit
What do you think Dhanañjanin Which is the better one who for the sake of his wife  children his slaves  workers his friends  companions his kinsmen  relatives his guests his departed ancestors the devatas the king refreshing  nourishing his body would do what is unrighteous what is discordant or one who for the sake of refreshing  nourishing his body would do what is righteous what is concordant
Master Sariputta the one who for the sake of refreshing  nourishing his body would do what is unrighteous what is discordant is not the better one
The one who for the sake of refreshing  nourishing his body would do what is righteous what is concordant would be the better one there
Righteous behavior concordant behavior is better than unrighteous behavior discordant behavior
Dhanañjanin there are other activities  reasonable righteous  by which one can refresh  nourish one's body and at the same time both not do evil and practice the practice of merit
Then Dhanañjanin the brahman delighting  rejoicing in Ven
Sariputta's words got up from his seat and left
Then on a later occasion Dhanañjanin the brahman became diseased in pain severely ill
So he said to one of his men Come my good man
Go to the Blessed One and on arrival pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say 'Lord Dhanañjanin the brahman is diseased in pain severely ill
He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One's feet' Then go to Ven
Sariputta and on arrival pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say 'Venerable sir Dhanañjanin the brahman is diseased in pain severely ill
He pays homage with his head to Ven
Sariputta's feet' Then say 'It would be good if Ven
Sariputta would visit Dhanañjanin's home out of sympathy for him' Responding As you say lord to Dhanañjanin the brahman the man went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said Lord Dhanañjanin the brahman is diseased in pain severely ill
He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One's feet Then he went to Ven
Sariputta and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said 'Venerable sir Dhanañjanin the brahman is diseased in pain severely ill
He pays homage with his head to Ven
Sariputta's feet Then he said It would be good if Ven
Sariputta would visit Dhanañjanin's home out of sympathy for him Ven
Sariputta acquiesced through silence
Then Ven
Sariputta having put on his robes and taking his bowl  outer robe went to Dhanañjanin's home
On arrival he sat down on a prepared seat and said to him I trust you are getting better Dhanañjanin
I trust you are comfortable
I trust that your pains are lessening and not increasing
I trust that there are signs of their lessening and not of their increasing
I am not getting better Master Sariputta
I am not comfortable
My severe pains are increasing not lessening
There are signs of their increasing and not of their lessening
Extreme forces slice through my head just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword Extreme pains have arisen in my head just as if a strong man were tightening a turban on my head with a tough leather strap Extreme forces carve up my stomach cavity just as if an expert butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox with a sharp butcher's knife There is an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men seizing a weaker man with their arms were to roast and broil him over a pit of hot embers
I am not getting better venerable sir
I am not comfortable
My severe pains are increasing not lessening
There are signs of their increasing and not of their lessening
What do you think Dhanañjanin
Which is better hell or the animal womb
The animal womb is better than hell Master Sariputta
 Which is better the animal womb or the realm of the hungry shades
 the realm of the hungry shades  the realm of the hungry shades or human beings
 human beings human beings or the Four Great King devas
the Four Great King devas the Four Great King devas or the devas of the Thirtythree
the devas of the Thirtythree the devas of the Thirtythree or the Yama devas
the Yama devas the Yama devas or the Tusita devas
the Tusita devas the Tusita devas or the Nimmanarati devas
the Nimmanarati devas the Nimmanarati devas or the Paranimmitavasavatti devas
the Paranimmitavasavatti devas the Paranimmitavasavatti devas or the Brahma world
Did Master Sariputta say 'Brahma world'
Did Master Sariputta say 'Brahma world'
Then the thought occurred to Ven
Sariputta These brahmans are set on the Brahma world
What if I were to teach Dhanañjanin the brahman the path to union with the Brahmas
Dhanañjanin I will teach you the path to union with the Brahmas
Listen and pay careful attention to that
I will speak
As you say master Dhanañjanin the brahman responded to Ven
Sariputta
Ven
Sariputta said And what is the path to union with the Brahmas
There is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will
He keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion appreciation equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will
This Dhanañjanin is the path to union with the Brahmas
In that case Master Sariputta pay homage to the Blessed One's feet with your head in my name and say 'Lord Dhanañjanin the brahman is diseased in pain severely ill
He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One's feet' So Ven
Sariputta  when there was still more to be done having established Dhanañjanin the brahman in the inferior Brahma world  got up from his seat and left
Then not long after Ven
Sariputta's departure Dhanañjanin the brahman died and reappeared in the Brahma world
And the Blessed One said to the monks Monks Sariputta  when there was still more to be done having established Dhanañjanin the brahman in the inferior Brahma world  has gotten up from his seat and left
Then Ven
Sariputta went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord Dhanañjanin the brahman is diseased in pain severely ill
He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One's feet
But why Sariputta  when there was still more to be done having established Dhanañjanin the brahman in the inferior Brahma world  did you get up from your seat and leave
The thought occurred to me lord 'These brahmans are set on the Brahma worlds
What if I were to teach Dhanañjanin the brahman the path to union with the Brahmas' Sariputta Dhanañjanin the brahman has died and reappeared in the Brahma world

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monstery
And on that occasion five hundred brahmans from various provinces were staying at Savatthi on some business or other
The thought occurred to them This Gotama the contemplative prescribes purity for the four castes
Now who is capable of disputing with him on this statement And on that occasion the brahman student Assalayana was staying at Savatthi
Young shavenheaded sixteen years old he was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology etymology  histories as a fifth skilled in philology  grammar he was fully versed in cosmology and in the marks of a Great Man
The thought occurred to the brahmans This brahman student Assalayana is staying in Savatthi He is capable of disputing with Gotama the contemplative on this statement
So the brahmans went to the brahman student Assalayana and said to him Master Assalayana this Gotama the contemplative prescribes purity for the four castes
Come and dispute with him on this statement
When this was said the brahman student Assalayana said to the brahmans Sirs Gotama the contemplative is one who speaks Dhamma
And those who speak Dhamma are hard to dispute with
I can't dispute with him on this statement
A second time A third time the brahmans said to the brahman student Assalayana Master Assalayana this Gotama the contemplative prescribes purity for the four castes
Come and dispute with him on this statement for you have lived the life of a wanderer
Don't be defeated without being defeated in battle
When this was said the brahman student Assalayana said to the brahmans Apparently sirs I don't get leave from you 'Gotama the contemplative is one who speaks Dhamma
And those who speak Dhamma are hard to dispute with
I can't dispute with him on this statement' But at your bidding I will go
Then the brahman student Assalayana went with a large group of brahmans to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama the brahmans say 'Brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferior
Only brahmans are the fair caste any other caste is dark
Only brahmans are pure not nonbrahmans
Only brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma' What does Master Gotama have to say with regard to that
But Assalayana the brahmans' brahmanwomen are plainly seen having their periods becoming pregnant giving birth and nursing
And yet the brahmans being born through the birth canal say 'Brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferior
Only brahmans are the fair caste any other caste is dark
Only brahmans are pure not nonbrahmans
Only brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma' Even though Master Gotama says that still the brahmans think 'Brahmans are the superior caste the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma' What do you think Assalayana
Have you heard that in Yana  Kamboja and other outlying countries there are only two castes  masters  slaves  and that having been a master one become a slave and that having been a slave one become a master

Even though Master Gotama says that still the brahmans think 'Brahmans are the superior caste the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma' What do you think Assalayana

There is the case where a consecrated noble warrior king might call together one hundred men of different births 'Come masters
Those of you there born from a noble warrior clan from a brahman clan or from a royal clan taking an upper firestick of saala wood salala wood sandalwood or padumaka wood produce fire  make heat appear
And come masters
Those of you there born from an outcast clan a trapper clan a wicker workers' clan a cartwrights' clan or a scavengers' clan taking an upper firestick from a dog's drinking trough from a pig's trough from a dustbin or of castoroil wood produce fire  make heat appear' What do you think Assalayana
Would the fire made by those born from a noble warrior clan a brahman clan or a royal clan  who had produced fire  made heat appear by taking an upper firestick of saala wood salala wood sandalwood or padumaka wood  be the only one with flame color  radiance able to do whatever a fire might be needed to do
And would the fire made by those born those born from an outcast clan a trapper clan a wicker workers' clan a cartwrights' clan or a scavengers' clan  who had produced fire  made heat appear by taking an upper firestick from a dog's drinking trough from a pig's trough from a dustbin or of castoroil wood  be without flame color  radiance unable to do what a fire might be needed to do
No Master Gotama
The fire made by those born from a noble warrior clan a brahman clan or a royal clan would have flame color  radiance able to do whatever a fire might be needed to do
And the fire made by those born from an outcast clan a trapper clan a wicker workers' clan a cartwrights' clan or a scavengers' clan would have flame color  radiance able to do whatever a fire might be needed to do

There is the case where a noble warrior youth might cohabit with a brahman maiden and from their cohabitation a son would be born
Would the son born from the noble warrior youth and brahman maiden be like the father and like the mother
Should it be called a noble warrior  a brahman
Yes Master Gotama What do you think Assalayana
There is the case where a brahman youth might cohabit with a noble warrior maiden and from their cohabitation a son would be born
Would the son born from the brahman youth and noble warrior maiden be like the father and like the mother

Yes Master Gotama What do you think Assalayana
There is the case where a mare might mate with a donkey and from their mating a foal would be born
Would the foal born from the mare  the donkey be like the father and like the mother
Should it be called a horse  a donkey
Master Gotama from the mixed breeding it would be a mule
Here I see that it makes a difference but there I don't see that it makes a difference
What do you think Assalayana
There is the case where there might be two brahmanstudent brothers born of the same mother one learned  initiated the other not learned  uninitiated
Which of the two would the brahmans serve first at a funeral feast a milkrice offering a sacrifice or a feast for guests
The brahman student who was learned  initiated Master Gotama For what great fruit would there be for what is given to one who is not learned  uninitiated
What do you think Assalayana
There is the case where there might be two brahmanstudent brothers born of the same mother one learned  initiated unvirtuous  of evil character the other not learned  uninitiated virtuous  of fine character
Which of the two would the brahmans serve first at a funeral feast a milkrice offering a sacrifice or a feast for guests
The brahman student who was not learned  uninitiated virtuous  of fine character Master Gotama For what great fruit would there be for what is given to one who is unvirtuous  of evil character
First Assalayana you went by birth
Then having gone by birth you went by mantras
Then having gone by mantras putting them both aside you have come around to the purity of the four castes that I prescribe
When this was said the brahman student Assalayana sat silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words
Then the Blessed One  seeing that the brahman student Assalayana was sitting silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words  said to him Once Assalayana this evil viewpoint arose in the seven brahman seers as they were consulting together in leaf huts in the wilderness 'Brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferior
Only brahmans are the fair caste any other caste is dark
Only brahmans are pure not nonbrahmans
Only brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma' Then the seer Devala the Dark heard 'This evil viewpoint has arisen in the seven brahman seers as they are consulting together in leaf huts in the wilderness 'Brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferior Only brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma' So arranging his hair  beard putting on crimson garments wearing multilayered sandals and carrying a staff made of gold he appeared in the courtyard of the seven brahman seers
Then he walked back  forth in the courtyard of the seven brahman seers saying Well now where have these masters the brahman seers gone
Well now where have these masters the brahman seers gone
Then the seven brahman seers said to the seer Devala the Dark 'Now who is this walking back  forth in the courtyard of the seven brahman seers like a village lout saying Well now where have these masters the brahman seers gone
Well now where have these masters the brahman seers gone Let's curse him' So the seven brahman seers cursed the seer Devala the Dark Be ashes dribblespit
Be ashes dribblespit
Be ashes dribblespit' But the more they cursed him the more beautiful goodlooking  inspiring he became
Then the thought occurred to the seven brahman seers 'Our asceticism is in vain
Our holylife is fruitless
For before whenever we cursed anyone Be ashes dribblespit he would always become ashes
But the more we curse this one the more beautiful goodlooking  inspiring he becomes'
'Masters your asceticism is not in vain and your holylife not fruitless
Please masters abandon your hatred toward me'
'We abandon our hatred toward you master
Who are you'
'Have you heard of the seer Devala the Dark'
'Yes master'
'I am he'
Then the seven brahman seers approached him to bow down to him and he said to them 'I have heard that this evil viewpoint has arisen in the seven brahman seers as they are consulting together in leaf huts in the wilderness Brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferior Only brahmans are the sons  offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma'
That is so master'
'But do you know masters if the mother who bore you went only with a brahman and not with a nonbrahman'
'No master'
'And do you know if the mothers of the mother who bore you  back seven generations of mothers  went only with brahmans and not with nonbrahmans'
'No master'
'And do you know if the father who sired you went only with a brahman woman and not with a nonbrahman woman'
'No master'
'And do you know if the fathers of the father who bore you  back seven generations of fathers  went only with brahman women and not with nonbrahman women'
'No master'
'Do you know how there is the descent of an embryo'
'Yes master we know how there is the descent of an embryo
There is the case where the mother  father have come together the mother is fertile and a gandhabba is standing present
The coming together of these three is the descent of the embryo'
'But do you know for sure whether the gandhabba is a noble warrior a brahman a merchant or a worker'
'No master'
'That being the case do you know who you are'
'That being the case master we don't know who we are'
Now Assalayana when those seven brahman seers couldn't defend their own birthstatement when interrogated pressed  rebuked by the seer Devala the Dark how can you now defend your own birthstatement when interrogated pressed  rebuked by me  you their lineage holder but not Punna their ladle holder
When this was said the brahman student Assalayana said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks
May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Now on that occasion Uggahamana a follower of Mundika the contemplative together with a large following of about wanderers had taken up residence in the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen Mallika
Then Pañcakanga the carpenter left Savatthi in the middle of the day to see the Blessed One but the thought occurred to him Now is not the right time to see the Blessed One for he is in seclusion
And it is not the right time to see the minddeveloping monks for they too are in seclusion
Why don't I go to the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen Mallika to see Uggahamana a follower of Mundika the contemplative So he headed to the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen Mallika
Now on that occasion Uggahamana was sitting with his large following of wanderers all making a great noise  racket discussing many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state armies alarms  battles food  drink clothing furniture garlands  scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women  heroes the gossip of the street  the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world  of the sea talk of whether things exist or not
Then Uggahamana saw Pañcakanga the carpenter coming from afar and on seeing him hushed his following Be quiet good sirs
Don't make any noise
Here comes Pañcakanga the carpenter a disciple of Gotama the contemplative
He is one of those disciples of Gotama the contemplative clad in white who lives in Savatthi
These people are fond of quietude trained in quietude and speak in praise of quietude
Maybe if he perceives our group as quiet he will consider it worth his while to come our way So the wanderers fell silent
Then Pañcakanga went to Uggahamana and on arrival greeted him courteously
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat down to one side
As he was sitting there Uggahamana said to him I describe an individual endowed with four qualities as being consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainments
Which four
There is the case where he does no evil action with his body speaks no evil speech resolves on no evil resolve and maintains himself with no evil means of livelihood
An individual endowed with these four qualities I describe as being consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainments
Then Pañcakanga neither delighted in Uggahamana's words nor did he scorn them
Expressing neither delight nor scorn he got up from his seat  left thinking I will learn the meaning of this statement in the Blessed One's presence
Then he went to the Blessed One and on arrival after bowing down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he told the Blessed One the entire conversation he had had with Uggahamana
When this was said the Blessed One said to Pañcakanga In that case carpenter then according to Uggahamana's words a stupid baby boy lying on its back is consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainments
For even the thought 'body' does not occur to a stupid baby boy lying on its back so from where would it do any evil action with its body aside from a little kicking
Even the thought 'speech' does not occur to it so from where would it speak any evil speech aside from a little crying
Even the thought 'resolve' does not occur to it so from where would it resolve on any evil resolve aside from a little bad temper
Even the thought 'livelihood' does not occur to it so from where would it maintain itself with any evil means of livelihood aside from its mother's milk
So according to Uggahamana's words a stupid baby boy lying on its back is consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainments
If an individual is endowed with these four qualities I do not describe him as consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainments
Rather he stands on the same level as a stupid baby boy lying on its back
Which four
There is the case where he does no evil action with his body speaks no evil speech resolves on no evil resolve and maintains himself with no evil means of livelihood
If an individual is endowed with these four qualities I do not describe him as consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainments
Rather he stands on the same level as a stupid baby boy lying on its back
An individual endowed with ten qualities is one whom I describe as being consummate in what is skillful foremost in what is skillful an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainments

That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Pañcakanga the carpenter delighted in the Blessed One's words
The frame story of this sutta presents a gentle satire of royal life
Despite his position King Pasenadi Kosala must still act the role of messenger for his wives
Because of his position he finds himself surrounded by people he cannot trust  he never gets to the bottom of the question of who brought misinformation into the palace  and whose minds fasten on issues of overthrowing and banishing possibly him
He is so preoccupied with his responsibilities that he doesn't pick up on the Buddha's gentle joke about his servitude to the sisters Soma and Sakula can't stick with an issue for any length of time sometimes can't even phrase his questions properly and can arrive at no greater certainty about the Buddha's teachings than that they seem reasonable
At the end of the sutta he has to leave not because he has exhausted the issues he would like to discuss but because one of his courtiers tells him it is time to go
All in all not an enviable position
The substance of the discussion however does touch on some serious issues
The topic treated in greatest detail concerns the differences among the castes of the Buddha's time and the Buddha's remarks can profitably be applied to issues of racism in ours
The discussion and the frame story of course play off one another
Because of his social position King Pasenadi is unable to pursue the path to release that is open to all regardless of race or caste
His social advantages are a spiritual liability
Like many people in the modern world he has plenty of things but no time
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Udaññans in the Deer Park at Kannakatthala
And at that time King Pasenadi Kosala had arrived at Udañña on some business or other
So King Pasenadi Kosala said to one of his men Come my good man
Go to the Blessed One and on arrival showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort saying 'King Pasenadi Kosala lord shows reverence with his head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort' And then say 'Lord today King Pasenadi Kosala will come to see the Blessed One after his morning meal' Having responded As you say sire the man went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to him King Pasenadi Kosala lord shows reverence with his head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort And then he said Lord today King Pasenadi Kosala will come to see the Blessed One after his morning meal
Now the sisters Soma and Sakula heard Today they say King Pasenadi Kosala will go to see the Blessed One after his morning meal So they approached King Pasenadi while his meal was being served and on arrival said to him Well in that case great king show reverence with your head to his feet in our name too and ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort saying 'The sisters Soma and Sakula lord show reverence with their heads to your feet and ask whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort' Then after his morning meal King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One The sisters Soma and Sakula lord show reverence with their heads to your feet and ask whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort
But great king couldn't the sisters Soma and Sakula get another messenger
Lord the sisters Soma and Sakula heard 'Today they say King Pasenadi Kosala will go to see the Blessed One after his morning meal' So they approached me while my meal was being served and on arrival said to me 'In that case great king show reverence with your head to his feet in our name too and ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort saying The sisters Soma and Sakula lord show reverence with their heads to your feet and ask whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort' Lord the sisters Soma and Sakula show reverence with their heads to your feet and ask whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort
May the sisters Soma and Sakula be happy great king
Then King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Lord I have heard that 'Gotama the contemplative says this It is not possible that a brahman or contemplative would claim a knowledge and vision that is allknowing and allseeing without exception' Those who say this are they speaking in line with what the Blessed One has said
Are they not misrepresenting the Blessed One with what is unfactual
Are they answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma would have grounds for criticizing them
Great king those who say that are not speaking in line with what I have said and are misrepresenting me with what is untrue and unfactual
Then King Pasenadi Kosala turned to General Vidudabha General who brought this topic into the palace
Sañjaya the brahman of the Akasa clan great king
So King Pasenadi turned to one of his men Come my good man
Summon Sañjaya the brahman of the Akasa clan saying 'King Pasenadi Kosala summons you' Responding As you say sire the man went to Sañjaya the brahman of the Akasa clan and on arrival said to him King Pasenadi Kosala summons you
Then King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Could it be that something was said by the Blessed One in reference to something else which a person could have misunderstood
In what way does the Blessed One recall having said a statement
Great king I recall having said 'It is not possible that a brahman or contemplative could know everything and see everything all at once' What the Blessed One says lord seems reasonable
What the Blessed One says seems logical 'It is not possible that a brahman or contemplative could know everything and see everything all at once'
Lord there are these four castes noble warriors brahmans merchants  workers
Is there any distinction or difference among them
Great king of these four castes two  noble warriors  brahmans  are held to be foremost in terms of receiving homage hospitality salutation  polite services
I'm not asking about the present life lord
I'm asking about the future life
Is there any distinction or difference among these four castes
Great king there are these five factors for exertion
Which five
There is the case where a monk has conviction is convinced of the Tathagata's Awakening 'Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed'
He is free from illness  discomfort endowed with good digestion  not too cold not too hot of moderate strength  fit for exertion
He is neither fraudulent nor deceitful
He declares himself to the Teacher or to his wise friends in the holy life in line with what he actually is
He keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities
He is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities
He is discerning endowed with discernment leading to the arising of the goal  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress
These are the five factors for exertion
As for the four castes great king If they were endowed with these five factors for exertion that would be for their longterm welfare  happiness
Lord if these four castes were endowed with these five factors for exertion would there be any distinction or difference among them in that respect
I tell you great king the difference among them would lie in the diversity of their exertion
Suppose that there were two tamable elephants tamable horses or tamable oxen that were welltamed  welltrained and two tamable elephants tamable horses or tamable oxen that were untamed  untrained
What do you think would the two tamable elephants tamable horses or tamable oxen that were welltamed  welltrained acquire the habits of the tamed and reach the status of the tamed
Yes lord
And would the two tamable elephants tamable horses or tamable oxen that were untamed  untrained acquire the habits of the tamed and reach the status of the tamed
No lord
In the same way great king it is impossible that what could be attained by one who has confidence who is free from illness who is neither fraudulent nor deceitful whose persistence is aroused and who is discerning could also be attained by one who is without conviction who is sickly fraudulent  deceitful lazy and dull
What the Blessed One says lord seems reasonable
What the Blessed One says seems logical
But with regard to these four castes if they were endowed with these five factors for exertion and they had right exertion would there be any distinction or difference among them in that respect
I tell you great king that there would be no difference among them with regard to the release of one and the release of another
Suppose that a man taking dry sala wood were to generate a fire and make heat appear
And suppose that another man taking dry saka wood were to generate a fire and make heat appear
And suppose that another man taking dry mango wood were to generate a fire and make heat appear
And suppose that another man taking dry fig wood were to generate a fire and make heat appear
Now what do you think great king among those fires generated from different kinds of wood would there be any difference between the glow of one and the glow of another the color of one and the color of another the radiance of one and the radiance of another
No lord
In the same way great king in the power that is kindled by persistence and generated by exertion I say that there is no difference with regard to the release of one and the release of another
What the Blessed One says lord seems reasonable
What the Blessed One says seems logical
But lord are there devas
But why do you ask 'But lord are there devas'
Whether the devas come back to this life lord or whether they don't
Those devas who are afflicted come back to this life whereas those devas who are unafflicted don't come back to this life
When this was said General Vidudabha said to the Blessed One Lord can the afflicted devas oust or expel the unafflicted devas from that place
Then the thought occurred to Ven
Ananda This General Vidudabha is the son of King Pasenadi Kosala and I am the son of the Blessed One
Now is the time for the son to counsel the son So Ven
Ananda turned to General Vidudabha and said In that case general I will ask you a counter question
Answer as you see fit
Through the extent of land conquered by King Pasenadi Kosala  where he exercises sovereign  independent kingship  is he able to oust or expel a brahman or contemplative from that place regardless of whether that person has merit or not or follows the holy life or not
Sir through the extent of land conquered by King Pasenadi Kosala  where he exercises sovereign  independent kingship  he is able to oust or expel a brahman or contemplative from that place regardless of whether that person has merit or not or follows the holy life or not
And what do you think general Through the extent of land not conquered by King Pasenadi Kosala  where he does not exercise sovereign  independent kingship  is he able to oust or expel a brahman or contemplative from that place regardless of whether that person has merit or not or follows the holy life or not
Sir through the extent of land not conquered by King Pasenadi Kosala  where he does not exercise sovereign  independent kingship  he is not able to oust or expel a brahman or contemplative from that place regardless of whether that person has merit or not or follows the holy life or not
And what do you think general Have you heard of the Devas of the Thirtythree
Yes sir I have heard of the Devas of the Thirtythree as has King Pasenadi Kosala
And what do you think general Could King Pasenadi Kosala oust or expel the Devas of the Thirtythree from that place
Sir King Pasenadi Kosala can't even see the Devas of the Thirtythree
How could he oust or expel them from that place
In the same way general afflicted devas who will come back to this life can't even see the unafflicted devas who don't come back to this life
How could they oust or expel them from that place
Then King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Lord what is the name of this monk
His name is Ananda great king
What a joy he is
What a true joy
But lord are there brahmas
But why do you ask 'But lord are there brahmas'
Whether the brahmas come back to this life lord or whether they don't
Those brahmas who are afflicted come back to this life whereas those brahmas who are unafflicted don't come back to this life
Then a man said to King Pasenadi Kosala Great king Sañjaya the brahman of the Akasa clan has come
Then King Pasenadi Kosala said to Sañjaya the brahman of the Akasa clan Who brought that topic into the royal palace
General Vidudabha great king
General Vidudabha said Sañjaya the brahman of the Akasa clan great king
Then a man said to King Pasenadi Kosala Time to go great king
So King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Lord we have asked the Blessed One about omniscience the Blessed One has answered about omniscience and that is pleasing  agreeable to us and we are gratified because of it
We have asked the Blessed One about the purity of the four castes the Blessed One has answered about the purity of the four castes and that is pleasing  agreeable to us and we are gratified because of it
We have asked the Blessed One about the higher devas the Blessed One has answered about the higher devas and that is pleasing  agreeable to us and we are gratified because of it
We have asked the Blessed One about the higher brahmas the Blessed One has answered about the higher brahmas and that is pleasing  agreeable to us and we are gratified because of it
Whatever we have asked the Blessed One about that he has answered and that is pleasing  agreeable to us and we are gratified because of it
Now lord we must go
Many are our duties many our responsibilities
Then do great king what you think it is now time to do
Then King Pasenadi Kosala delighting in and approving of the Blessed One's words got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and  keeping him to his right  departed
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Now at that time a certain householder's dear  beloved little son his only child had died
Because of his death the father had no desire to work or to eat
He kept going to the cemetery and crying out Where have you gone my only little child
Where have you gone my only little child
Then he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Householder your faculties are not those of one who is steady in his own mind
There is an aberration in your faculties
Lord how could there not be an aberration in my faculties
My dear  beloved little son my only child has died
Because of his death I have no desire to work or to eat
I keep going to the cemetery and crying out 'Where have you gone my only little child
Where have you gone my only little child' That's the way it is householder
That's the way it is  for sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear
But lord who would ever think that sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear
Happiness  joy are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear So the householder not delighting in the Blessed One's words rejecting the Blessed One's words got up from his seat and left
Now at that time a large number of gamblers were playing dice not far from the Blessed One
So the householder went to them and on arrival said to them Just now venerable sirs I went to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As I was sitting there Gotama the contemplative said to me 'Householder your faculties are not those of one who is steady in his own mind
There is an aberration in your faculties'
When this was said I said to him 'Lord how could there not be an aberration in my faculties
My dear  beloved little son my only child has died
Because of his death I have no desire to work or to eat
I keep going to the cemetery and crying out Where have you gone my only little child
Where have you gone my only little child'
'That's the way it is householder
That's the way it is  for sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear'
'But lord who would ever think that sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear
Happiness  joy are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear' So not delighting in the words of Gotama the contemplative rejecting them I got up from my seat and left
That's the way it is householder
That's the way it is
Happiness  joy are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear
So the householder left thinking I agree with the gamblers
Eventually word of this conversation made its way into the king's inner chambers
Then King Pasenadi Kosala addressed Queen Mallika Mallika your contemplative Gotama has said this 'Sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear' If that was said by the Blessed One great king then that's the way it is
No matter what Gotama the contemplative says Mallika endorses it 'If that was said by the Blessed One great king then that's the way it is' Just as no matter what his teacher says a pupil endorses it 'That's the way it is teacher
That's the way it is' In the same way no matter what Gotama the contemplative says Mallika endorses it 'If that was said by the Blessed One great king then that's the way it is' Go away Mallika
Out of my sight
Then Queen Mallika called for the brahman Nalijangha Come brahman
Go to the Blessed One and on arrival showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort saying 'Queen Mallika lord shows reverence with her head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort' And then say 'Lord did the Blessed One say that sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear' Whatever the Blessed One says remember it well and tell it to me
For Tathagatas do not speak what is untrue
Yes madam the brahman Nalijangha responded to Queen Mallika
Going to the Blessed One on arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama Queen Mallika shows reverence with her head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort
And she says further 'Lord did the Blessed One say that sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear' That's the way it is brahman
That's the way it is
Sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear
And it's through this sequence of events that it may be understood how sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear
Once in this same Savatthi there was a woman whose mother died
Owing to her mother's death she went mad out of her mind and wandering from street to street crossroads to crossroads would say 'Have you seen my mother
Have you seen my mother' It's through this sequence of events that it may be understood how sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear
Once in this same Savatthi there was a woman whose father died whose brother died whose sister died whose son died whose daughter died whose husband died
Owing to his death she went mad out of her mind and wandering from street to street crossroads to crossroads would say 'Have you seen my husband
Have you seen my husband' It's through this sequence of events that it may be understood how sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear
Once in this same Savatthi there was a man whose mother died
Owing to her death he went mad out of his mind and wandering from street to street crossroads to crossroads would say 'Have you seen my mother
Have you seen my mother' It's through this sequence of events that it may be understood how sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear
Once in this same Savatthi there was a man whose father died whose brother died whose sister died whose son died whose daughter died whose wife died
Owing to her death he went mad out of his mind and wandering from street to street crossroads to crossroads would say 'Have you seen my wife
Have you seen my wife' It's through this sequence of events that it may be understood how sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear
Once in this same Savatthi there was a wife who went to her relatives' home
Her relatives having separated her from her husband wanted to give her to another against her will
So she said to her husband 'These relatives of mine having separated us want to give me to another against my will' whereupon he cut her in two and slashed himself open thinking 'Dead we will be together' It's through this sequence of events that it may be understood how sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear
Then the brahman Nalijangha delighting in  approving of the Blessed One's words got up from his seat and went to Queen Mallika
On arrival he told her all that had been said in his conversation with the Blessed One
Then Queen Mallika went to King Pasenadi Kosala and on arrival said to him What do you think great king Is Princess Vajiri dear to you
Yes Mallika Princess Vajiri is dear to me
And what do you think would sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise in you from any change  aberration in Princess Vajiri
Mallika any change  aberration in Princess Vajiri would mean an aberration of my very life
How could sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair not arise in me
Great king it was in connection with this that the Blessed One  the One who knows the One who sees worthy  rightly selfawakened  said 'Sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear'
Now what do you think great king Is the noble Queen Vasabha dear to you Is General Vidudabha dear to you Am I dear to you
Yes Mallika you are dear to me
And what do you think would sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise in you from any change  aberration in me
Mallika any change  aberration in you would mean an aberration of my very life
How could sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair not arise in me
Great king it was in connection with this that the Blessed One  the One who knows the One who sees worthy  rightly selfawakened  said 'Sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear'
Now what do you think great king Are the Kasis  Kosalans dear to you
Yes Mallika the Kasis  Kosalans are dear to me
It is through the might of the Kasis  Kosalans that we use Kasi sandalwood and wear garlands scents  ointments
And what do you think would sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair arise in you from any change  aberration in the Kasis  Kosalans
Mallika any change  aberration in the Kasis  Kosalans would mean an aberration of my very life
How could sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair not arise in me
Great king it was in connection with this that the Blessed One  the One who knows the One who sees worthy  rightly selfawakened  said 'Sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear' It's amazing Mallika
It's astounding how deeply the Blessed One sees having pierced through as it were with discernment
Come Mallika Give me the ablution water Then King Pasenadi Kosala rising from his seat and arranging his upper robe over one shoulder paid homage in the direction of the Blessed One with his hands palmtopalm in front of his heart and exclaimed three times
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
And at that time in King Pasenadi's realm there was a bandit named Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beings
He turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countryside
Having repeatedly killed human beings he wore a garland made of fingers
Then the Blessed One early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Savatthi for alms
Having wandered for alms in Savatthi and returning from his alms round after his meal he set his lodging in order
Carrying his robes  bowl he went along the road to where Angulimala was staying
Cowherds shepherds  farmers saw him going along the road to where Angulimala was staying and on seeing him said to him Don't go along that road contemplative for on that road is Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beings
He has turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countryside
Having repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingers
Groups of ten twenty thirty  forty men have gone along that road and even they have fallen into Angulimala's hands When this was said the Blessed One kept going in silence
A second time A third time cowherds shepherds  farmers said to the Blessed One Don't go along that road contemplative Groups of ten twenty thirty  forty men have gone along that road and even they have fallen into Angulimala's hands When this was said the Blessed One kept going in silence
Then Angulimala saw the Blessed One coming from afar and on seeing him this thought occurred to him Isn't it amazing
Isn't it astounding
Groups of ten twenty thirty  forty men have gone along this road and even they have fallen into my hands and yet now this contemplative comes attacking as it were alone and without a companion
Why don't I kill him So Angulimala taking up his sword  shield buckling on his bow  quiver followed right behind the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One willed a feat of psychic power such that Angulimala though running with all his might could not catch up with the Blessed One walking at normal pace
Then the thought occurred to Angulimala Isn't it amazing
Isn't it astounding
In the past I've chased  seized even a swiftrunning elephant a swiftrunning horse a swiftrunning chariot a swiftrunning deer
But now even though I'm running with all my might I can't catch up with this contemplative walking at normal pace So he stopped and called out to the Blessed One Stop contemplative
Stop
I have stopped Angulimala
You stop
Then the thought occurred to Angulimala These Sakyan contemplatives are speakers of the truth asserters of the truths and yet this contemplative even while walking says 'I have stopped Angulimala
You stop' Why don't I question him
So Angulimala the bandit addressed this verse to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One set out wandering toward Savatthi with Ven
Angulimala as his attendant monk
After wandering by stages he reached Savatthi and there he lived near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Now at that time a large crowd of people loud  noisy had gathered at the gates to King Pasenadi Kosala's inner palace There is a bandit in your realm sire named Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beings
He has turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countryside
Having repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingers
The king must stamp him out
Then King Pasenadi Kosala with a cavalry of roughly horsemen drove out of Savatthi and entered the monastery
Driving as far as the ground was passable for chariots he got down from his chariot and went on foot to the Blessed One
On arrival having bowed down he sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him What is it great king
Has King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha provoked you or have the Licchavis of Vesali or some other hostile king
No lord
King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha hasn't provoked me nor have the Licchavis of Vesali nor has some other hostile king
There is a bandit in my realm lord named Angulimala brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beings
He has turned villages into nonvillages towns into nontowns settled countryside into unsettled countryside
Having repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingers
I am going to stamp him out 
Great king suppose you were to see Angulimala with his hair  beard shaved off wearing the ochre robe having gone forth from the home life into homelessness refraining from killing living beings refraining from taking what is not given refraining from telling lies living the holy life on one meal a day virtuous  of fine character what would you do to him
We would bow down to him lord or rise up to greet him or offer him a seat or offer him robes almsfood lodgings or medicinal requisites for curing illness or we would arrange a lawful guard protection  defense
But how could there be such virtue  restraint in an unvirtuous evil character
Now at that time Ven
Angulimala was sitting not far from the Blessed One
So the Blessed One pointing with his right arm said to King Pasenadi Kosala That great king is Angulimala Then King Pasenadi Kosala was frightened terrified his hair standing on end
So the Blessed One sensing the king's fear  hairraising awe said to him Don't be afraid great king
Don't be afraid
He poses no danger to you
Then the king's fear his terror his hairstandingonend subsided
He went over to Ven
Angulimala and said Are you really Angulimala lord
Yes great king
What is your father's clan
What is your mother's clan
My father is a Gagga great king and my mother a Mantani
Then may Master Gagga Mantaniputta delight
I will be responsible for your robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for curing illness
Now it so happened that at that time Ven
Angulimala was a wildernessdweller an almsgoer wearing one set of the triple robe made of castoff cloth
So he said to King Pasenadi Kosala Enough great king
My triple robe is complete
So King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One It's amazing lord
It's astounding how the Blessed One has tamed the untamed pacified the unpeaceful and brought to Unbinding those who were not unbound
For what we could not tame even with blunt or bladed weapons the Blessed One has tamed without blunt or bladed weapons
Now lord we must go
Many are our duties many our responsibilities
Then do great king what you think it is now time to do
Then King Pasenadi Kosala got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and  keeping him to his right  departed
Then Ven
Angulimala early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Savatthi for alms
As he was going from house to house for alms he saw a woman suffering a breech birth
On seeing her the thought occurred to him How tormented are living beings
How tormented are living beings Then having wandered for alms in Savatthi and returning from his alms round after his meal he went to the Blessed One
On arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord early in the morning having put on my robes and carrying my outer robe  bowl I went into Savatthi for alms
As I was going from house to house for alms I saw a woman suffering a breech birth
On seeing her the thought occurred to me 'How tormented are living beings
How tormented are living beings' In that case Angulimala go to that woman and on arrival say to her 'Sister since I was born I do not recall intentionally killing a living being
Through this truth may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetus' But lord wouldn't that be a lie for me
For I have intentionally killed many living beings
Then in that case Angulimala go to that woman and on arrival say to her 'Sister since I was born in the noble birth I do not recall intentionally killing a living being
Through this truth may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetus' Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Angulimala went to that woman and on arrival said to her Sister since I was born in the noble birth I do not recall intentionally killing a living being
Through this may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetus And there was wellbeing for the woman wellbeing for her fetus
Then Ven
Angulimala dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus Ven
Angulimala became another one of the arahants
Then Ven
Angulimala early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Savatthi for alms
Now at that time a clod thrown by one person hit Ven
Angulimala on the body a stone thrown by another person hit him on the body and a potsherd thrown by still another person hit him on the body
So Ven
Angulimala  his head broken open and dripping with blood his bowl broken and his outer robe ripped to shreds  went to the Blessed One
The Blessed One saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said to him Bear with it brahman
Bear with it
The fruit of the kamma that would have burned you in hell for many years many hundreds of years many thousands of years you are now experiencing in the herenow 
Then Ven
Angulimala having gone alone into seclusion experienced the bliss of release
At that time he exclaimed
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One on a wandering tour among the Kurus with a large community of monks arrived at Thullakotthita a town of the Kurus
The brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita heard it said Gotama the contemplative  the son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clan  has arrived at Thullakotthita
And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread 'He is indeed a Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessed
He has made known  having realized it through direct knowledge  this world with its devas maras  brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their rulers  common people
He has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
It's good to see such a worthy one' So the brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita went to the Blessed One
On arrival some of them bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side
Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one side
Some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palmtopalm over their hearts
Some of them sat to one side having announced their name  clan
Some of them sat to one side in silence
As they were sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused and encouraged them with a talk on Dhamma
Now at that time a clansman named Ratthapala the son of the leading clan in that same Thullakotthita was sitting in that assembly
The thought occurred to him As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it's not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
What if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Then the brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed One's talk on Dhamma delighted  rejoiced in his words
Rising from their seats bowing down to him they left keeping him on their right
Then Ratthapala not long after the brahmans  householders of Thullakotthita had left approached the Blessed One and on arrival said to him As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it's not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
Lord I want  having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe  to go forth from the household life into homelessness
May I receive the goingforth in the Blessed One's presence
May I receive admission
Do you have your parents' permission Ratthapala to go forth from the household life into homelessness
No lord I haven't
Ratthapala Tathagatas do not give the goingforth to anyone who doesn't have his parents' permission
Lord I will do what needs to be done so that my parents will give their permission for me to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Then Ratthapala rising from his seat bowing down to the Blessed One and keeping him on his right went to his parents and said Mom Dad as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it's not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
I want  having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe  to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Please give me your permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness
When this was said Ratthapala's parents said to him Ratthapala dear you are our only son dear  appealing raised in comfort brought up in comfort
You know nothing of suffering
Eat drink  enjoy yourself
While eating drinking  looking after yourself you may enjoy yourself by indulging in sensual pleasures  making merit
We don't give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Even with your death we would not want to be separated from you so how could we  while you're alive  give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
A second time A third time Ratthapala said to his parents Mom Dad as I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it's not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
I want  having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe  to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Please give me your permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness
A third time Ratthapala's parents said to him Ratthapala dear you are our only son dear  appealing raised in comfort brought up in comfort
You know nothing of suffering
Eat drink  enjoy yourself
While eating drinking  looking after yourself you may enjoy yourself by indulging in sensual pleasures  making merit
We don't give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Even with your death we would not want to be separated from you so how could we  while you're alive  give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Then Ratthapala not getting his parents' permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness lay down right there on the bare floor Here will be my death or my goingforth And he went without food for one day two days three days four five six days
He went without food for seven days
His parents said to him Ratthapala dear you are our only son dear  appealing raised in comfort brought up in comfort
You know nothing of suffering
Get up dear
Eat drink  enjoy yourself
While eating drinking  looking after yourself you may enjoy yourself by indulging in sensual pleasures  making merit
We don't give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Even with your death we would not want to be separated from you so how could we  while you're alive  give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
When this was said Ratthapala remained silent
A second time A third time Ratthapala's parents said to him Ratthapala dear you are our only son dear  appealing raised in comfort brought up in comfort
You know nothing of suffering
Get up dear
Eat drink  enjoy yourself
While eating drinking  looking after yourself you may enjoy yourself by indulging in sensual pleasures  making merit
We don't give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Even with your death we would not want to be separated from you so how could we  while you're alive  give our permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
A third time Ratthapala remained silent
Then Ratthapala's parents went to his friends and said to them My dears Ratthapala has lain down on the bare floor 'Here will be my death or my goingforth' Please dears go to Ratthapala and say to him 'Friend Ratthapala you are your parents' only son Get up friend Ratthapala
Eat drink  enjoy yourself How could your parents  while you're alive  give their permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness' So Ratthapala's friends went to Ratthapala and on arrival said to him Friend Ratthapala you are your parents' only son Get up friend Ratthapala
Eat drink  enjoy yourself How could your parents  while you're alive  give their permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
When this was said Ratthapala remained silent
A second time A third time his friends said to him Friend Ratthapala you are your parents' only son Get up friend Ratthapala
Eat drink  enjoy yourself How could your parents  while you're alive  give their permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
A third time Ratthapala remained silent
So Ratthapala's friends went to his parents and on arrival said to them Mom Dad Ratthapala is lying there on the bare floor 'Here will be my death or my goingforth
If you don't give him your permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness right there will be his death
But if you do give him your permission then even when he has gone forth you will see him
And if he does not enjoy going forth from the household life into homelessness where else will he go
He'll return right here
So please give him permission to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Then dears we give our permission for Ratthapala to go forth from the household life into homelessness
But when he has gone forth he must visit his parents
Then Ratthapala's friends went to him and said Get up Ratthapala
Your parents give their permission for you to go forth from the household life into homelessness
But when you have gone forth you must visit your parents
Then Ratthapala got up and on regaining strength went to the Blessed One
On arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I have received my parents' permission lord to go forth from the household life into homelessness
May the Blessed One give me the goingforth
Then Ratthapala the clansman obtained the goingforth in the Blessed One's presence he obtained admission
And not long after his admission one half month after his admission the Blessed Onehaving stayed at Thullakotthita as long as he liked  set out wandering to Savatthi
Wandering by stages he eventually arrived at Savatthi
There he lived at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
As for Ven
Ratthapala  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus Ven
Ratthapala became another one of the arahants
Then Ven
Ratthapala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I want to visit my parents if you give me permission Then the Blessed One encompassing Ven
Ratthapala's awareness with his awareness considered  understood Ven
Ratthapala is incapable of leaving the training and reverting to the lower life So he said to him Now is the time Ratthapala for you to do as you see fit
Then Ven
Ratthapala rising from his seat bowing down to the Blessed One and keeping him on his right
Putting his lodgings in order and carrying his bowl  robes set out wandering toward Thullakotthita
Wandering by stages he eventually arrived at Thullakotthita
There he stayed in Thullakotthita in King Koravya's Migacira
Then early in the morning  putting on his under robe and carrying his bowl  robes  he went into Thullakotthita for alms
As he went for alms from house to house in Thullakotthita he came to his own father's house
Now at that time Ven
Ratthapala's father was in the middle doorporch having his hair combed
He saw Ven
Ratthapala coming from afar and on seeing him said It was by these shavenheaded contemplatives that our only son dear  appealing was made to go forth So Ven
Ratthapala  instead of receiving a gift or a polite refusal at his own father's house  got nothing but abuse
Just then a slavewoman belonging to one of his relatives was about to throw away some dayold porridge
So Ven
Ratthapala said to her Sister if that is to be thrown away pour it here into my bowl While she was pouring the dayold porridge into this bowl she recognized his hands feet  voice
So she went to his mother and said May it please you to know my lady that masterson Ratthapala has arrived
Hey if what you say is true I give you your freedom
Then Ven
Ratthapala's mother went to his father and said May it please you to know householder that they say the clansman Ratthapala has arrived
Now at that time Ven
Ratthapala was sitting by a wall eating the dayold porridge
His father went to him and said Ratthapala my dear isn't there  What
You're eating dayold porridge
Don't you have your own home to go to
How could we have a home householder
We have gone forth from the household life into homelessness
We are homeless householder
We went to your house but  instead of receiving a gift or a polite refusal  we got nothing but abuse
Come dear Ratthapala
Let's go home
Enough householder
My meal for today is finished
In that case dear Ratthapala acquiesce to the meal for tomorrow
So Ven
Ratthapala acquiesced in silence
Understanding Ven
Ratthapala's acquiesence his father went to his house and having the floor coated with fresh cow dung had a great heap of gold  silver made two great heaps made  one of gold one of silver  so large that a man standing on the near side could not see a man standing on the far side just as a man standing on the far side could not see a man standing on the near
Hiding them behind screens he set out a seat between them surrounded by a curtain
Addressing Ven
Ratthapala's former wives he said to them Come daughtersinlaw
Adorn yourself in the ornaments that our son Ratthapala used to find dear  appealing
Then as the night was ending Ven
Ratthapala's father had exquisite staple  nonstaple foods prepared in his own house and had the time announced to Ven
Ratthapala It's time dear Ratthapala
The meal is ready
Then early in the morning  putting on his under robe and carrying his bowl  robes  Ven
Ratthapala went to his father's house and on arrival sat down on the seat made ready
Then his father revealing the heap of gold  silver said to him This my dear Ratthapala is your mother's inheritance
The other is your fathers the other your grandfather's  you can enjoy wealth and make merit
Come my dear Ratthapala
Leave the training and revert to the lower life
Enjoy wealth and make merit
Householder if you'd do as I say you would have this heap of gold  silver loaded on carts and hauled away to be dumped midstream in the river Ganges
Why is that
This will be the cause of your sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
Then clasping each of his feet Ven
Ratthapala's former wives said to him What are they like dear masterson those nymphs for whose sake you lead the holy life
Sisters we don't lead the holy life for the sake of nymphs
'Sisters' he calls us And they fell down right there in a faint
Then Ven
Ratthapala said to his father Householder if there's food to be given then give it
Don't harass us
Eat then my dear Ratthapala
The meal is ready
So with his own hands Ven
Ratthapala's father served and satisfied him with exquisite staple and nonstaple foods
When he had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl Ven
Ratthapala stood up and recited these verses
After reciting these verses while standing Ven
Ratthapala went to King Koravya's Migacira
On arrival he sat down in the shade of a tree for the day's abiding
Then King Koravya said to his gamekeeper Clean up the Migacira pleasure garden
I am going there to see the beautiful grounds
As you say your majesty the gamekeeper responded to the king
As he was cleaning up Migacira he saw Ven
Ratthapala sitting in the shade of a tree for the day's abiding
On seeing him he went to the king and said Migacira has been cleaned up for you your majesty
And the clansman Ratthapala  the son of the leading clan in this Thullakotthita of whom you have often spoken highly  is there sitting in the shade of a tree for the day's abiding
In that case my dear gamekeeper never mind about the pleasure garden for today
I am now going to pay my respects to that Master Ratthapala
Then saying Give away all the staple and nonstaple foods that have been prepared King Koravya had auspicious vehicles harnessed
Mounting an auspicious vehicle he set out from Thullakotthita accompanied by other auspicious vehicles in full royal pomp to see Ven
Ratthapala
Going as far by vehicle as the ground would permit he dismounted and went to Ven
Ratthapala accompanied by many eminent members of his court
On arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with Ven
Ratthapala
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to Ven
Ratthapala May Master Ratthapala sit here on the elephant rug
Never mind great king
You sit there
I am sitting on my own seat
So King Koravya sat down on the seat prepared
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Ratthapala There are cases where having suffered these four kinds of loss men shave off their hair  beard put on the ochre robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness
Which four
Loss through aging loss through illness loss of wealth  loss of relatives But Master Ratthapala has suffered none of these
What did he know or see or hear that Master Ratthapala went forth from the home life into homelessness
Great king there are four Dhamma summaries stated by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened
Having known  seen  heard them I went forth from the home life into homelessness
Which four
'The world is swept away
It does not endure' This is the first Dhamma summary stated by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened
Having known  seen  heard it I went forth from the home life into homelessness
'The world is without shelter without protector' This is the second Dhamma summary
'The world is without ownership
One has to pass on leaving everything behind' This is the third Dhamma summary
'The world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving' This is the fourth Dhamma summary
These great king are the four Dhamma summaries stated by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened
Having known  seen  heard them I went forth from the home life into homelessness
Master Ratthapala you say 'The world is swept away
It does not endure' Now how is the meaning of this statement to be understood
What do you think great king When you were twenty or twentyfive years old  an expert elephant rider an expert horseman an expert charioteer an expert archer an expert swordsman  were you strong in arm  strong in thigh fit  seasoned in warfare
Yes Master Ratthapala when I was twenty or twentyfive years old I was strong in arm  strong in thigh fit  seasoned in warfare
It was as if I had supernormal power
I do not see anyone who was my equal in strength
And what do you think great king Are you even now as strong in arm  strong in thigh as fit  as seasoned in warfare
Not at all Master Ratthapala
I'm now a feeble old man aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years old
Sometimes thinking 'I will place my foot here' I place it somewhere else
It was in reference to this great king that the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened said 'The world is swept away
It does not endure' Having known  seen  heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessness
It's amazing Master Ratthapala
It's astounding how well that has been said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened 'The world is swept away
It does not endure' For the world really is swept away Master Ratthapala
It does not endure
Now in this royal court there are elephant troops  cavalry  chariot troops  infantry that will serve to defend us from dangers
And yet you say 'The world is without shelter without protector' How is the meaning of this statement to be understood
What do you think great king Do you have any recurring illness
Yes Master Ratthapala I have a recurring windillness
Sometimes my friends  advisors relatives  bloodkinsmen stand around me saying 'This time King Koravya will die
This time King Koravya will die' And what do you think great king Can you say to your friends  advisors relatives  bloodkinsmen 'My friends  advisors relatives  bloodkinsmen are commanded all of you who are present share out this pain so that I may feel less pain'
Or do you have to feel that pain all alone
Oh no Master Ratthapala I can't say to my friends  advisors relatives  bloodkinsmen 'All of you who are present share out this pain so that I may feel less pain' I have to feel that pain all alone
It was in reference to this great king that the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened said 'The world is without shelter without protector' Having known  seen  heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessness
It's amazing Master Ratthapala
It's astounding how well that has been said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened 'The world is without shelter without protector' For the world really is without shelter Master Ratthapala
It is without protector
Now in this royal court there is a great deal of gold  silver stashed away underground  in attic vaults
And yet you say 'The world is without ownership
One has to pass on leaving everything behind' How is the meaning of this statement to be understood
What do you think great king
As you now enjoy yourself endowed  replete with the pleasures of the five senses can you say 'Even in the afterlife I will enjoy myself in the same way endowed  replete with the very same pleasures of the five senses'
Or will this wealth fall to others while you pass on in accordance with your kamma
Oh no Master Ratthapala I can't say 'Even in the afterlife I will enjoy myself in the same way endowed  replete with the very same pleasures of the five senses' This wealth will fall to others while I pass on in accordance with my kamma
It was in reference to this great king that the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened said 'The world is without ownership
One has to pass on leaving everything behind' Having known  seen  heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessness
It's amazing Master Ratthapala
It's astounding how well that has been said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened 'The world is without ownership
One has to pass on leaving everything behind' For the world really is without ownership Master Ratthapala
One has to pass on leaving everything behind
Now Master Ratthapala you say 'The world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving' How is the meaning of this statement to be understood
What do you think great king Do you now rule over the prosperous country of Kuru
That is so Master Ratthapala
I rule over the prosperous country of Kuru
What do you think great king Suppose a trustworthy reliable man of yours were to come to you from the east
On arrival he would say to you 'May it please your majesty to know I have come from the east
There I saw a great country powerful  prosperous populous  crowded with people
Plenty are the elephant troops there plenty the cavalry troops chariot troops  infantry troops
Plenty is the ivorywork there plenty the gold  silver both worked  unworked
Plenty are the women for the taking
It is possible with the forces you now have to conquer it
Conquer it great king' What would you do
Having conquered it Master Ratthapala I would rule over it
Now what do you think great king
Suppose a trustworthy reliable man of yours were to come to you from the west the north the south the other side of the ocean
On arrival he would say to you 'May it please your majesty to know I have come from the other side of the ocean
There I saw a great country powerful  prosperous populous  crowded with people
Plenty are the elephant troops there plenty the cavalry troops chariot troops  infantry troops
Plenty is the ivorywork there plenty the gold  silver both worked  unworked
Plenty are the women for the taking
It is possible with the forces you now have to conquer it
Conquer it great king' What would you do
Having conquered it Master Ratthapala I would rule over it too
It was in reference to this great king that the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened said 'The world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving' Having known  seen  heard this I went forth from the home life into homelessness
It's amazing Master Ratthapala
It's astounding how well that has been said by the Blessed One who knows  sees worthy  rightly selfawakened 'The world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving' For the world really is insufficient Master Ratthapala
It's insatiable a slave to craving
That is what Ven
Ratthapala said
Having said that he further said this
Apparently there were some discrepancies in the original discourse that subsequent editors tried to correct but it's hard to reach a definitive conclusion as to which version is closer to the original
On the one hand it might be that the two extra heaps were mentioned in the original but later deleted in some editions to bring the description in line with the fact that the later passage mentions heap in the singular on the other hand it might be that the original described the father making one heap and the editors later amended the passage to account for his later reference to three inheritances
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha on Vulture's Peak Mountain in the Boar's Cave
Then LongNails the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama I am of the view of the opinion that 'All is not pleasing to me' But even this view of yours Aggivessana  'All is not pleasing to me'  is even that not pleasing to you' Even if this view of mine were pleasing to me Master Gotama it would still be the same it would still be the same
Well Aggivessana there are more than many in the world who say 'It would still be the same it would still be the same' yet they both do not abandon that view and they cling to another view
There are fewer than few in the world who say 'It would still be the same it would still be the same' and they both abandon that view and do not cling to another view
There are some brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that 'All is pleasing to me' There are some brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that 'All is not pleasing to me' There are some brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that 'A part is pleasing to me a part is not pleasing to me'
With regard to those brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that 'All is pleasing to me' That view of theirs is close to being impassioned close to bondage close to delighting close to holding close to clinging
With regard to those brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that 'All is not pleasing to me' That view of theirs is close to not being impassioned close to nonbondage close to notdelighting close to notholding close to notclinging
When this was said LongNails the wanderer said to the Blessed One Master Gotama commends my viewpoint
Master Gotama recommends my viewpoint
With regard to those brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that 'A part is pleasing to me a part is not pleasing to me' Whatever is pleasing to them their view is close to being impassioned close to bondage close to delighting close to holding close to clinging
Whatever is not pleasing to them their view is close to not being impassioned close to nonbondage close to notdelighting close to notholding close to notclinging
With regard to those brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion 'All is pleasing to me' A wise person among them considers that 'If I were to grasp and insist firmly on this view of mine that All is pleasing to me and to state that Only this is true all else is worthless I would clash with two  the brahman or contemplative who is of the view of the opinion that All is not pleasing to me and the brahman or contemplative who is of the view of the opinion that A part is pleasing to me a part is not pleasing to me I would clash with these two
Where there is a clash there is dispute
Where there is a dispute quarreling
Where there is quarreling annoyance
Where there is annoyance frustration' Envisioning for himself clash dispute quarreling annoyance frustration he both abandons that view and does not cling to another view
Thus there is the abandoning of these views thus there is the relinquishing of these views
With regard to those brahmans  contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that 'All is not pleasing to me' A wise person among them considers that 'If I were to grasp and insist firmly on this view of mine that All is not pleasing to me and to state that Only this is true all else is worthless I would clash with two  the brahman or contemplative who is of the view of the opinion that All is pleasing to me and the brahman or contemplative who is of the view of the opinion that A part is pleasing to me a part is not pleasing to me I would clash with these two

Now Aggivessana this body  endowed with form composed of the four primary elements born from mother  father nourished with rice  porridge subject to inconstancy rubbing pressing dissolution and dispersion  should be envisioned as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
In one who envisions the body as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself any desire for the body attraction to the body following after the body is abandoned
There are these three kinds of feeling a pleasant feeling a painful feeling and neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
On the occasion when one feels a pleasant feeling one does not feel either a painful feeling or a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
One feels only a pleasant feeling on that occasion
On the occasion when one feels a painful feeling one does not feel either a pleasant feeling or a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
One feels only a painful feeling on that occasion
On the occasion when one feels a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling one does not feel either a pleasant feeling or a painful feeling
One feels only a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling on that occasion
A pleasant feeling is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen subject to ending subject to vanishing fading ceasing
A painful feeling is also inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen subject to ending subject to vanishing fading ceasing
A neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling is also inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen subject to ending subject to vanishing fading ceasing
Seeing this an instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with pleasant feeling disenchanted with painful feeling disenchanted with neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
Disenchanted he grows dispassionate
From dispassion he is released
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' A monk whose mind is thus released does not take sides with anyone does not dispute with anyone
He words things by means of what is said in the world but without grasping at it
Now at that time Ven
Sariputta was sitting behind the Blessed One fanning him
The thought occurred to him Indeed it seems that the Blessed One speaks to us of the abandoning of each of these mental qualities through direct knowledge
Indeed it seems that the One Wellgone speaks to us of the relinquishing of each of these mental qualities through direct knowledge As Ven
Sariputta was reflecting thus his mind was released from fermentations through notclinging
While in LongNails the wanderer there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
Then LongNails the wanderer  having seen the Dhamma having attained the Dhamma having known the Dhamma having fathomed the Dhamma having crossed over and beyond uncertainty having no more perplexity having gained fearlessness having becoming independent of others with regard to the Teacher's message  said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
Magandiya suppose that there was a leper covered with sores and infections devoured by worms picking the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterizing his body over a pit of glowing embers
His friends companions  relatives would take him to a doctor
The doctor would concoct medicine for him and thanks to the medicine he would be cured of his leprosy well  happy free master of himself going wherever he liked
Then suppose two strong men having grabbed him with their arms were to drag him to a pit of glowing embers
What do you think
Wouldn't he twist his body this way  that
Yes master Gotama
Why is that
The fire is painful to the touch very hot  scorching
Now what do you think Magandiya
Is the fire painful to the touch very hot  scorching only now or was it also that way before
Both now  before is it painful to the touch very hot  scorching master Gotama
It's just that when the man was a leper covered with sores and infections devoured by worms picking the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails his faculties were impaired which was why even though the fire was actually painful to the touch he had the skewed perception of 'pleasant' In the same way Magandiya sensual pleasures in the past were painful to the touch very hot  scorching sensual pleasures in the future will be painful to the touch very hot  scorching sensual pleasures at present are painful to the touch very hot  scorching but when beings are not free from passion for sensual pleasures  devoured by sensual craving burning with sensual fever  their faculties are impaired which is why even though sensual pleasures are actually painful to the touch they have the skewed perception of 'pleasant'
Now suppose that there was a leper covered with sores  infections devoured by worms picking the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterizing his body over a pit of glowing embers
The more he cauterized his body over the pit of glowing embers the more disgusting foulsmelling  putrid the openings of his wounds would become and yet he would feel a modicum of enjoyment  satisfaction because of the itchiness of his wounds
In the same way beings not free from passion for sensual pleasures  devoured by sensual craving burning with sensual fever  indulge in sensual pleasures
The more they indulge in sensual pleasures the more their sensual craving increases and the more they burn with sensual fever and yet they feel a modicum of enjoyment  satisfaction dependent on the five strings of sensuality
Now what do you think Magandiya
Have you ever seen or heard of a king or king's minister  enjoying himself provided  endowed with the five strings of sensuality without abandoning sensual craving without removing sensual fever  who has dwelt or will dwell or is dwelling free from thirst his mind inwardly at peace
No master Gotama
Very good Magandiya
Neither have I ever seen or heard of a king or king's minister  enjoying himself provided  endowed with the five strings of sensuality without abandoning sensual craving without removing sensual fever  who has dwelt or will dwell or is dwelling free from thirst his mind inwardly at peace
But whatever brahmans or contemplatives who have dwelt or will dwell or are dwelling free from thirst their minds inwardly at peace all have done so having realized  as it actually is present  the origination  disappearance the allure the danger  the escape from sensual pleasures having abandoned sensual craving and removed sensual fever
Then at that moment the Blessed One exclaimed
When this was said Magandiya the wanderer said to the Blessed One It's amazing master Gotama
It's astounding how this too is wellstated by master Gotama 'Freedom from disease the foremost good fortune
Unbinding the foremost ease' We have also heard this said by earlier wanderers in the lineage of our teachers 'Freedom from disease the foremost good fortune
Unbinding the foremost ease' This agrees with that
But as for what you have heard said by earlier wanderers in the lineage of your teachers Magandiya  'Freedom from disease the foremost good fortune
Unbinding the foremost ease'  which freedom from disease is that which Unbinding
When this was said Magandiya the wanderer rubbed his own limbs with his hand
This is that freedom from disease master Gotama he said
This is that Unbinding
For I am now free from disease happy and nothing afflicts me
Magandiya it's just as if there were a man blind from birth who couldn't see black objects white blue yellow red or pink objects who couldn't see even or uneven places the stars the sun or the moon
He would hear a man with good eyesight saying 'How wonderful good sirs is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean' He would go in search of something white
Then another man would fool him with a grimy oilstained rag 'Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean' The blind man would take it and put it on
Having put it on gratified he would exclaim words of gratification 'How wonderful good sirs is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean' Now what do you think Magandiya
When that man blind from birth took the grimy oilstained rag and put it on and having put it on gratified exclaimed words of gratification 'How wonderful good sirs is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean' Did he do so knowing  seeing or out of faith in the man with good eyesight
Of course he did it not knowing  not seeing master Gotama but out of faith in the man with good eyesight
In the same way Magandiya the wanderers of other sects are blind  eyeless
Without knowing freedom from disease without seeing Unbinding they still speak this verse
This verse was stated by earlier worthy ones fully selfawakened
But now it has gradually become a verse of runofthemill people
This body Magandiya is a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction
And yet you say with reference to this body which is a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction 'This is that freedom from disease master Gotama
This is that Unbinding' for you don't have the noble vision with which you would know freedom from disease and see Unbinding
I'm convinced master Gotama that you can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I would know freedom from disease that I would see Unbinding
Magandiya it's just as if there were a man blind from birth who couldn't see black objects white blue yellow red the sun or the moon
His friends companions  relatives would take him to a doctor
The doctor would concoct medicine for him but in spite of the medicine his eyesight would not appear or grow clear
What do you think Magandiya
Would that doctor have nothing but his share of weariness  disappointment
Yes master Gotama
In the same way Magandiya if I were to teach you the Dhamma  'This is that freedom from disease this is that Unbinding'  and you on your part did not know freedom from disease or see Unbinding that would be wearisome for me that would be troublesome for me
I'm convinced master Gotama that you can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I would know freedom from disease that I would see Unbinding
Magandiya it's just as if there were a man blind from birth who couldn't see black objects white blue yellow red the sun or the moon
Now suppose that a certain man were to take a grimy oilstained rag and fool him saying 'Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean' The blind man would take it and put it on
Then his friends companions  relatives would take him to a doctor
The doctor would concoct medicine for him purges from above  purges from below ointments  counterointments and treatments through the nose
And thanks to the medicine his eyesight would appear  grow clear
Then together with the arising of his eyesight he would abandon whatever passion  delight he felt for that grimy oilstained rag
And he would regard that man as an enemy  no friend at all and think that he deserved to be killed
'My gosh how long have I been fooled cheated  deceived by that man  his grimy oilstained rag
 Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean'
In the same way Magandiya if I were to teach you the Dhamma  'This is that freedom from Disease this is that Unbinding'  and you on your part were to know that freedom from Disease and see that Unbinding then together with the arising of your eyesight you would abandon whatever passion  delight you felt with regard for the five clingingaggregates
And it would occur to you 'My gosh how long have I been fooled cheated  deceived by this mind
For in clinging it was just form that I was clinging to it was just feeling just perception just fabrications just consciousness that I was clinging to
With my clinging as a requisite condition there arises becoming birth aging  death sorrow lamentation pains distresses  despairs
And thus is the origin of this entire mass of stress' I'm convinced master Gotama that you can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might rise up from this seat cured of my blindness
In that case Magandiya associate with men of integrity
When you associate with men of integrity you will hear the true Dhamma
When you hear the true Dhamma you will practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma
When you practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma you will know  see for yourself 'These things are diseases cancers arrows
And here is where diseases cancers  arrows cease without trace
With the cessation of my clinging comes the cessation of becoming
With the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
With the cessation of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering  stress
When this was said Magandiya the wanderer said Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
Let me obtain the going forth in Master Gotama's presence let me obtain admission
Anyone Magandiya who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth  admission in this doctrine  discipline must first undergo probation for four months
If at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth  admit him to the monk's state
But I know distinctions among individuals in this matter
Master Gotama if anyone who has previously belonged to another sect and desires the going forth  admission in this doctrine  discipline must first undergo probation for four months and if at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth  admit him to the monk's state then I am willing to undergo probation for four years
If at the end of four years the monks feel so moved let them give me the going forth  admit me to the monk's state
Then Magandiya the wanderer received the going forth  the admission in the Blessed One's presence
And not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus Ven
Magandiya became another one of the arahants
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he asked the Blessed One How is it Master Gotama does Master Gotama hold the view 'The cosmos is eternal only this is true anything otherwise is worthless'
no Then does Master Gotama hold the view 'The cosmos is not eternal only this is true anything otherwise is worthless'
no Then does Master Gotama hold the view 'The cosmos is finite only this is true anything otherwise is worthless'
no Then does Master Gotama hold the view 'The cosmos is infinite only this is true anything otherwise is worthless'
no Then does Master Gotama hold the view 'The soul  the body are the same only this is true anything otherwise is worthless'
no Then does Master Gotama hold the view 'The soul is one thing and the body another only this is true anything otherwise is worthless'
no Then does Master Gotama hold the view 'After death a Tathagata exists only this is true anything otherwise is worthless'
no Then does Master Gotama hold the view 'After death a Tathagata does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless'
no Then does Master Gotama hold the view 'After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless'
no Then does Master Gotama hold the view 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless'
no How is it Master Gotama when Master Gotama is asked if he holds the view 'the cosmos is eternal' 'after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless' he says 'no' in each case
Seeing what drawback then is Master Gotama thus entirely dissociated from each of these ten positions
Vaccha the position that 'the cosmos is eternal' is a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views
It is accompanied by suffering distress despair  fever and it does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation to calm direct knowledge full Awakening Unbinding
The position that 'the cosmos is not eternal'
'the cosmos is finite'
'the cosmos is infinite'
'the soul  the body are the same'
'the soul is one thing and the body another'
'after death a Tathagata exists'
'after death a Tathagata does not exist'
'after death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist'
'after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist' does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation to calm direct knowledge full Awakening Unbinding
Does Master Gotama have any position at all
A 'position' Vaccha is something that a Tathagata has done away with
What a Tathagata sees is this 'Such is form such its origination such its disappearance such is feeling such its origination such its disappearance such is perceptionsuch are fabricationssuch is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance' Because of this I say a Tathagata  with the ending fading away cessation renunciation  relinquishment of all construings all excogitations all Imaking  minemaking  obsessions with conceit  is through lack of clingingsustenance released
But Master Gotama the monk whose mind is thus released Where does he reappear
'Reappear' Vaccha doesn't apply
In that case Master Gotama he does not reappear
'Does not reappear' Vaccha doesn't apply
both does  does not reappear
doesn't apply
neither does nor does not reappear
doesn't apply
How is it Master Gotama when Master Gotama is asked if the monk reappears does not reappear both does  does not reappear neither does nor does not reappear he says 'doesn't apply' in each case
At this point Master Gotama I am befuddled at this point confused
The modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscured
Of course you're befuddled Vaccha
Of course you're confused
Deep Vaccha is this phenomenon hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
For those with other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers it is difficult to know
That being the case I will now put some questions to you
Answer as you see fit
What do you think Vaccha If a fire were burning in front of you would you know that 'This fire is burning in front of me'
yes And suppose someone were to ask you Vaccha 'This fire burning in front of you dependent on what is it burning' Thus asked how would you reply
I would reply 'This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass  timber as its sustenance' If the fire burning in front of you were to go out would you know that 'This fire burning in front of me has gone out'
yes And suppose someone were to ask you 'This fire that has gone out in front of you in which direction from here has it gone
East
West
North
Or south' Thus asked how would you reply
That doesn't apply Master Gotama
Any fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass and timber being unnourished  from having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other  is classified simply as 'out'
Even so Vaccha any physical form by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him That the Tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Freed from the classification of form Vaccha the Tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the sea
'Reappears' doesn't apply
'Does not reappear' doesn't apply
'Both does  does not reappear' doesn't apply
'Neither reappears nor does not reappear' doesn't apply
Any feeling Any perception Any fabrication
Any consciousness by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him That the Tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Freed from the classification of consciousness Vaccha the Tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the sea
'Reappears' doesn't apply
'Does not reappear' doesn't apply
'Both does  does not reappear' doesn't apply
'Neither reappears nor does not reappear' doesn't apply
When this was said the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One Master Gotama it is as if there were a great sala tree not far from a village or town From inconstancy its branches and leaves would wear away its bark would wear away its sapwood would wear away so that on a later occasion  divested of branches leaves bark  sapwood  it would stand as pure heartwood
In the same way Master Gotama's words are divested of branches leaves bark  sapwood and stand as pure heartwood
Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or were to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks
May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then as Ven
Malunkyaputta was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness These positions that are undeclared set aside discarded by the Blessed One  'The cosmos is eternal' 'The cosmos is not eternal' 'The cosmos is finite' 'The cosmos is infinite' 'The soul  the body are the same' 'The soul is one thing and the body another' 'After death a Tathagata exists' 'After death a Tathagata does not exist' 'After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist' 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist'  I don't approve I don't accept that the Blessed One has not declared them to me
I'll go ask the Blessed One about this matter
If he declares to me that 'The cosmos is eternal' that 'The cosmos is not eternal' that 'The cosmos is finite' that 'The cosmos is infinite' that 'The soul  the body are the same' that 'The soul is one thing and the body another' that 'After death a Tathagata exists' that 'After death a Tathagata does not exist' that 'After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist' or that 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist' then I will live the holy life under him
If he does not declare to me that 'The cosmos is eternal' or that 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist' then I will renounce the training and return to the lower life
Then when it was evening Ven
Malunkyaputta arose from seclusion and went to the Blessed One
On arrival having bowed down he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord just now as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness 'These positions that are undeclared set aside discarded by the Blessed One I don't approve I don't accept that the Blessed One has not declared them to me
I'll go ask the Blessed One about this matter
If he declares to me that The cosmos is eternal or that After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then I will live the holy life under him
If he does not declare to me that The cosmos is eternal or that After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then I will renounce the training and return to the lower life'
Lord if the Blessed One knows that 'The cosmos is eternal' then may he declare to me that 'The cosmos is eternal' If he knows that 'The cosmos is not eternal' then may he declare to me that 'The cosmos is not eternal' But if he doesn't know or see whether the cosmos is eternal or not eternal then in one who is unknowing  unseeing the straightforward thing is to admit 'I don't know
I don't see' If he doesn't know or see whether after death a Tathagata exists does not exist both exists  does not exist neither exists nor does not exist' then in one who is unknowing  unseeing the straightforward thing is to admit 'I don't know
I don't see' Malunkyaputta did I ever say to you 'Come Malunkyaputta live the holy life under me and I will declare to you that 'The cosmos is eternal' or 'The cosmos is not eternal' or 'The cosmos is finite' or 'The cosmos is infinite' or 'The soul  the body are the same' or 'The soul is one thing and the body another' or 'After death a Tathagata exists' or 'After death a Tathagata does not exist' or 'After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist' or 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist'
No lord
And did you ever say to me 'Lord I will live the holy life under the Blessed One and he will declare to me that 'The cosmos is eternal' or 'The cosmos is not eternal' or 'The cosmos is finite' or 'The cosmos is infinite' or 'The soul  the body are the same' or 'The soul is one thing and the body another' or 'After death a Tathagata exists' or 'After death a Tathagata does not exist' or 'After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist' or 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist'
No lord
Then that being the case foolish man who are you to be claiming grievancesmaking demands of anyone
Malunkyaputta if anyone were to say 'I won't live the holy life under the Blessed One as long as he does not declare to me that The cosmos is eternal or that After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist' the man would die and those things would still remain undeclared by the Tathagata
It's just as if a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poison
His friends  companions kinsmen  relatives would provide him with a surgeon and the man would say 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know whether the man who wounded me was a noble warrior a brahman a merchant or a worker' He would say 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know the given name  clan name of the man who wounded me until I know whether he was tall medium or short until I know whether he was dark ruddybrown or goldencolored until I know his home village town or city until I know whether the bow with which I was wounded was a long bow or a crossbow until I know whether the bowstring with which I was wounded was fiber bamboo threads sinew hemp or bark until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was wild or cultivated until I know whether the feathers of the shaft with which I was wounded were those of a vulture a stork a hawk a peacock or another bird until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was bound with the sinew of an ox a water buffalo a langur or a monkey' He would say 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was that of a common arrow a curved arrow a barbed a calftoothed or an oleander arrow' The man would die and those things would still remain unknown to him
In the same way if anyone were to say 'I won't live the holy life under the Blessed One as long as he does not declare to me that 'The cosmos is eternal' or that 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist' the man would die and those things would still remain undeclared by the Tathagata
Malunkyaputta it's not the case that when there is the view 'The cosmos is eternal' there is the living of the holy life
And it's not the case that when there is the view 'The cosmos is not eternal' there is the living of the holy life
When there is the view 'The cosmos is eternal' and when there is the view 'The cosmos is not eternal' there is still the birth there is the aging there is the death there is the sorrow lamentation pain despair  distress whose destruction I make known right in the here  now
It's not the case that when there is the view 'The cosmos is finite' there is the living of the holy life
And it's not the case that when there is the view 'The cosmos is infinite' there is the living of the holy life
When there is the view 'The cosmos is finite' and when there is the view 'The cosmos is infinite' there is still the birth there is the aging there is the death there is the sorrow lamentation pain despair  distress whose destruction I make known right in the here  now
It's not the case that when there is the view 'The soul  the body are the same' there is the living of the holy life
And it's not the case that when there is the view 'The soul is one thing and the body another' there is the living of the holy life
When there is the view 'The soul  the body are the same' and when there is the view 'The soul is one thing and the body another' there is still the birth there is the aging there is the death there is the sorrow lamentation pain despair  distress whose destruction I make known right in the here  now
It's not the case that when there is the view 'After death a Tathagata exists' there is the living of the holy life
And it's not the case that when there is the view 'After death a Tathagata does not exist' there is the living of the holy life
And it's not the case that when there is the view 'After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist' there is the living of the holy life
And it's not the case that when there is the view 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist' there is the living of the holy life
When there is the view 'After death a Tathagata exists' 'After death a Tathagata does not exist' 'After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist' 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist' there is still the birth there is the aging there is the death there is the sorrow lamentation pain despair  distress whose destruction I make known right in the here  now
So Malunkyaputta remember what is undeclared by me as undeclared and what is declared by me as declared
And what is undeclared by me
'The cosmos is eternal' is undeclared by me
'The cosmos is not eternal' is undeclared by me
'The cosmos is finite' 'The cosmos is infinite' 'The soul  the body are the same' 'The soul is one thing and the body another' 'After death a Tathagata exists' 'After death a Tathagata does not exist' 'After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist' 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist' is undeclared by me
And why are they undeclared by me
Because they are not connected with the goal are not fundamental to the holy life
They do not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation calming direct knowledge selfawakening Unbinding
That's why they are undeclared by me
And what is declared by me
'This is stress' is declared by me
'This is the origination of stress' is declared by me
'This is the cessation of stress' is declared by me
'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' is declared by me
And why are they declared by me
Because they are connected with the goal are fundamental to the holy life
They lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation calming direct knowledge selfawakening Unbinding
That's why they are declared by me
So Malunkyaputta remember what is undeclared by me as undeclared and what is declared by me as declared
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Malunkyaputta delighted in the Blessed One's words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Feeding Ground
At that time Ven
Rahula was staying at the Mango Stone
Then the Blessed One arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to where Ven
Rahula was staying at the Mango Stone
Ven
Rahula saw him coming from afar and on seeing him set out a seat  water for washing the feet
The Blessed One sat down on the seat set out and having sat down washed his feet
Ven
Rahula bowing down to the Blessed One sat to one side
Then the Blessed One having left a little bit of water in the water dipper said to Ven
Rahula Rahula do you see this little bit of leftover water remaining in the water dipper
Yes sir
That's how little of a contemplative there is in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie
Having tossed away the little bit of leftover water the Blessed One said to Ven
Rahula Rahula do you see how this little bit of leftover water is tossed away
Yes sir
Rahula whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away just like that
Having turned the water dipper upside down the Blessed One said to Ven
Rahula Rahula do you see how this water dipper is turned upside down
Yes sir
Rahula whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is turned upside down just like that
Having turned the water dipper rightside up the Blessed One said to Ven
Rahula Rahula do you see how empty  hollow this water dipper is
Yes sir
Rahula whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is empty  hollow just like that
Rahula it's like a royal elephant immense pedigreed accustomed to battles its tusks like chariot poles
Having gone into battle it uses its forefeet  hindfeet its forequarters  hindquarters its head  ears  tusks  tail but keeps protecting its trunk
The elephant trainer notices that and thinks 'This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king' But when the royal elephant having gone into battle uses its forefeet  hindfeet its forequarters  hindquarters its head  ears  tusks  tail  his trunk the trainer notices that and thinks 'This royal elephant has given up its life to the king
There is nothing it will not do'
In the same way Rahula when anyone feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie there is no evil I tell you he will not do
Thus Rahula you should train yourself 'I will not tell a deliberate lie even in jest'
What do you think Rahula What is a mirror for
For reflection sir
In the same way Rahula bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions are to be done with repeated reflection
Whenever you want to do a bodily action you should reflect on it 'This bodily action I want to do  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Would it be an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results then any bodily action of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do
But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily action with pleasant consequences pleasant results then any bodily action of that sort is fit for you to do
While you are doing a bodily action you should reflect on it 'This bodily action I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both you should give it up
But if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with it
Having done a bodily action you should reflect on it 'This bodily action I have done  did it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Was it an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life
Having confessed it you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily action with pleasant consequences pleasant results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualities
Whenever you want to do a verbal action you should reflect on it 'This verbal action I want to do  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Would it be an unskillful verbal action with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful verbal action with painful consequences painful results then any verbal action of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do

Was it an unskillful mental action with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful mental action with painful consequences painful results then you should feel distressed ashamed  disgusted with it
Feeling distressed ashamed  disgusted with it you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful mental action with pleasant consequences pleasant results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualities
Rahula all those brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions did it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions in just this way
All those brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the future who will purify their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions will do it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions in just this way
All those brahmans  contemplatives at present who purify their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions do it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions in just this way
Thus Rahula you should train yourself 'I will purify my bodily actions through repeated reflection
I will purify my verbal actions through repeated reflection
I will purify my mental actions through repeated reflection' That's how you should train yourself
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Rahula delighted in the Blessed One's words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's Monastery
Then the Blessed One early in the morning put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe went into Savatthi for alms
And Ven
Rahula early in the morning put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe went into Savatthi for alms following right behind the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One looking back at Rahula addressed him Rahula any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am' Just form O Blessed One
Just form O One Wellgone
Form Rahula  feeling  perception  fabrications  consciousness
Then the thought occurred to Ven
Rahula Who having been exhorted facetoface by the Blessed One would go into the town for alms today So he turned back and sat down at the foot of a tree folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect  setting mindfulness to the fore
Ven
Sariputta saw Ven
Rahula sitting at the foot of a tree his legs folded crosswise his body held erect  with mindfulness set to the fore
On seeing him he said to him Rahula develop the meditation of mindfulness of inout breathing
The meditation of mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is of great fruit of great benefit
Then Ven
Rahula emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the Blessed One and having bowed down sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to him How lord is mindfulness of inout breathing to be developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit
Rahula any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am' There are these five properties Rahula
Which five
The earth property the water property the fire property the wind property  the space property
And what is the earth property
The earth property can be either internal or external
What is the internal earth property
Anything internal within oneself that's hard solid  sustained head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver membranes spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces or anything else internal within oneself that's hard solid and sustained This is called the internal earth property
Now both the internal earth property  the external earth property are simply earth property
And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment 'This is not mine this is not me this is not my self' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the earth property and makes the earth property fade from the mind
And what is the water property
The water property may be either internal or external
What is the internal water property
Anything internal belonging to oneself that's water watery  sustained bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears oil saliva mucus oilofthejoints urine or anything else internal within oneself that's water watery  sustained This is called the internal water property
Now both the internal water property  the external water property are simply water property
And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment 'This is not mine this is not me this is not my self' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the water property and makes the water property fade from the mind
And what is the fire property
The fire property may be either internal or external
What is the internal fire property
Anything internal belonging to oneself that's fire fiery  sustained that by which is warmed aged  consumed with fever and that by which what is eaten drunk chewed  savored gets properly digested or anything else internal within oneself that's fire fiery  sustained This is called the internal fire property
Now both the internal fire property  the external fire property are simply fire property
And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment 'This is not mine this is not me this is not my self' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the fire property and makes the fire property fade from the mind
And what is the wind property
The wind property may be either internal or external
What is the internal wind property
Anything internal belonging to oneself that's wind windy  sustained upgoing winds downgoing winds winds in the stomach winds in the intestines winds that course through the body inandout breathing or anything else internal within oneself that's wind windy  sustained This is called the internal wind property
Now both the internal wind property  the external wind property are simply wind property
And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment 'This is not mine this is not me this is not my self' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the wind property and makes the wind property fade from the mind
And what is the space property
The space property may be either internal or external

Now both the internal space property  the external space property are simply space property
And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment 'This is not mine this is not me this is not my self' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the space property and makes the space property fade from the mind
Rahula develop the meditation in tune with earth
For when you are developing the meditation in tune with earth agreeable  disagreeable sensory impressions that have arisen will not stay in charge of your mind

Develop the meditation of mindfulness of inout breathing
Mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is of great fruit of great benefit
And how Rahula is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit
There is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' Or breathing in short he discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short he discerns 'I am breathing out short' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming mental fabrication'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in satisfying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out satisfying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in steadying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out steadying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in releasing the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out releasing the mind'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment'
This Rahula is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit
When mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued in this way even one's final inbreaths  outbreaths are known as they cease not unknown
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Rahula delighted in the Blessed One's words
Once Carpenter Fivetools went to see the Venerable Udayi
Having saluted him respectfully he sat down at one side
Thus seated he asked the Venerable Udayi
How many kinds of feelings reverend Udayi were taught by the Blessed One
Three kinds of feelings Carpenter were taught by the Blessed One pleasant painful and neutral feelings
These are the three feelings taught by the Blessed One
After these words Carpenter Fivetools said Not three kinds of feelings reverend Udayi were taught by the Blessed One
It is two kinds of feelings that were stated by the Blessed One pleasant and painful feelings
The neutral feeling was said by the Blessed One to belong to peaceful and sublime happiness
But the Venerable Udayi replied It is not two feelings that were taught by the Blessed One but three pleasant painful and neutral feelings
but neither was Carpenter Fivetools able to convince the Venerable Udayi nor could the Venerable Udayi convince Carpenter Fivetools
It so happened that Venerable Ananda had listened to that conversation and went to see the Blessed One about it
Having saluted the Blessed One respectfully he sat down at one side
Thus seated he repeated the entire conversation that had taken place between the Venerable Udayi and Carpenter Fivetools
The Blessed One said Ananda Udayi's way of presentation with which Carpenter Fivetools disagreed was correct indeed
But also Carpenter Fivetool's way of presentation with which Udayi disagreed was correct
In one way of presentation I have spoken of two kinds of feelings and in other ways of presentation I have spoken of three of six of eighteen of thirtysix and of one hundred and eight kinds of feelings
So the Dhamma has been shown by me in different ways of presentation
Regarding the Dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who do not agree with do not consent to and do not accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will quarrel and get into arguments and disputes hurting each other with sharp words
Regarding the Dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who agree with consent to and accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will live in concord and amity without dispute like milk with water looking at each other with friendly eyes
There are five strands of sense desire
What are these five
Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sensual desire and tempting to lust
Sounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sense desire and tempting to lust
These are the five strands of sense desire
The pleasure and joy arising dependent on these five strands of sense desire that is called sensual pleasure
Now if someone were to say 'This is the highest pleasure and joy that can be experienced' I would not concede that
And why not
Because there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
And what is this pleasure
Here quite secluded from sensual desires secluded from unwholesome states of mind a monk enters upon and abides in the first meditative absorption which is accompanied by thought conception and discursive thinking and has in it joy and pleasure born of seclusion
This is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
If someone were to say 'This is the highest pleasure that can be experienced' I would not concede that
And why not
Because there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
And what is that pleasure
Here with the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking a monk enters upon and abides in the second meditative absorption in the sphere of the infinity of space of the infinity of consciousness of nothingness of neitherperceptionnornonperception
If someone were to say 'This is the highest pleasure that can be experienced' I would not concede that
And why not
Because there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
And what is this pleasure
Here by completely surmounting the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception a monk enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling
This is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
It may happen Ananda that Wanderers of other sects will be saying this 'The recluse Gotama speaks of the Cessation of Perception and Feeling and describes it as pleasure
What is this and how is this'
Those who say so should be told 'The Blessed One describes as pleasure not only the feeling of pleasure
But a Tathagata describes as pleasure whenever and whereinsoever it is obtained' In AN the venerable Sariputta exclaims Nibbana is happiness friend Nibbana is happiness indeed The monk Udayi then asked How can there be happiness when there is no feeling The venerable Sariputta replied Just this is happiness friend that therein there is no feeling The continuation of that Sutta may also be compared with our text
On Nibbana as happiness see also AN
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on a tour of Kasi with a large community of monks
There he addressed the monks I abstain from the nighttime meal
As I am abstaining from the nighttime meal I sense nexttono illness nexttono affliction lightness strength  a comfortable abiding
Come now
You too abstain from the nighttime meal
As you are abstaining from the nighttime meal you too will sense nexttono illness nexttono affliction lightness strength  a comfortable abiding
As you say lord the monks responded
Then as he was wandering by stages in Kasi the Blessed One eventually arrived at a Kasi town called Kitagiri
And there he stayed in the Kasi town Kitagiri
Now at that time the monks led by Assaji  Punabbasu were residing in Kitagiri
Then a large number of monks went to them and on arrival said to them The Blessed One and the community of monks abstain from the nighttime meal
As they are abstaining from the nighttime meal they sense nexttono illness nexttono affliction lightness strength  a comfortable abiding
Come now friends
You too abstain from the nighttime meal
As you are abstaining from the nighttime meal you too will sense nexttono illness nexttono affliction lightness strength  a comfortable abiding
When this was said the monks led by Assaji  Punabbasu said to those monks Friends we eat in the evening in the morning  in the wrong time during the day
As we are eating in the evening in the morning  in the wrong time during the day we sense nexttono illness nexttono affliction lightness strength  a comfortable abiding
Why should we abandoning what is immediately visible chase after something subject to time
We will eat in the evening in the morning  in the wrong time during the day
When they were unable to convince the monks led by Assaji  Punabbasu those monks went to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk
In my name call the monks led by Assaji  Punabbasu saying 'The Teacher calls you friends' As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to the monks led by Assaji  Punabbasu on arrival he said The Teacher calls you friends
As you say friend the monks led by Assaji  Punabbasu replied
Then they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them Is it true monks that a large number of monks went to you and you said 'Why should we abandoning what is immediately visible chase after something subject to time
We will eat in the evening in the morning  in the wrong time during the day' Yes lord
Monks have you ever understood me to teach the Dhamma in this way 'Whatever a person experiences  pleasant painful or neitherpleasantnorpainful  his unskillful qualities decrease and his skillful qualities grow'
No lord
And haven't you understood me to teach the Dhamma in this way 'For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease
But there is the case where for someone feeling a pleasant feeling of that sort unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow
For someone feeling a painful feeling of this sort unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease
But there is the case where for someone feeling a painful feeling of that sort unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow
For someone feeling a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling of this sort unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease
But there is the case where for someone feeling a neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling of that sort unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow' Yes lord
Good monks
And if it were not known by me  not seen not observed not realized not touched through discernment  that 'For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease' then would it be fitting for me not knowing that to say 'Abandon that sort of pleasant feeling'
No lord
But because it is known by me  seen observed realized touched through discernment  that 'For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease' I therefore say 'Abandon that sort of pleasant feeling'
If it were not known by me  not seen not observed not realized not touched through discernment  that 'For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow' then would it be fitting for me not knowing that to say 'Enter  remain in that sort of pleasant feeling'
No lord
But because it is known by me  seen observed realized touched through discernment  that 'For someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow' I therefore say 'Enter  remain in that sort of pleasant feeling'
Monks I don't say of all monks that they have a task to do with heedfulness nor do I say of all monks that they have no task to do with heedfulness
Monks who are arahants whose mental fermentations are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosis I don't say of them that they have work to do with heedfulness
Why is that
They have done their task with heedfulness
They are incapable of being heedless
But as for monks in higher training who have not yet reached their hearts' goal who still aspire for the unexcelled freedom from bondage I say of them that they have a task to do with heedfulness
Why is that
'Perhaps these venerable ones when making use of suitable resting places associating with admirable friends balancing their faculties will reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for themselves in the here  now' Envisioning this fruit of heedfulness for these monks I say that they have a task to do with heedfulness
Monks there are these seven individuals to be found in the world
Which seven
One both ways one released through discernment a bodily witness one attained to view one released through conviction a Dhammafollower and a convictionfollower
And what is the individual both ways
There is the case where a certain individual remains touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless and  having seen with discernment  his fermentations are ended
This is called an individual both ways
Regarding this monk I do not say that he has a task to do with heedfulness
Why is that
He has done his task with heedfulness
He is incapable of being heedless
And what is the individual released through discernment
There is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless but  having seen with discernment  his fermentations are ended
This is called an individual who is released through discernment
Regarding this monk I do not say that he has a task to do with heedfulness
Why is that
He has done his task with heedfulness
He is incapable of being heedless
And what is the individual who is a bodily witness
There is the case where a certain individual remains touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless and  having seen with discernment  some of his fermentations are ended
This is called an individual who is a bodily witness
Regarding this monk I say that he has a task to do with heedfulness
Why is that
'Perhaps this venerable one when making use of suitable resting places associating with admirable friends balancing his faculties will reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now' Envisioning this fruit of heedfulness for this monk I say that he has a task to do with heedfulness
And what is the individual attained to view
There is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless but  having seen with discernment  some of his fermentations are ended and he has reviewed  examined with discernment the qualities proclaimed by the Tathagata
This is called an individual who is attained to view
Regarding this monk I say that he has a task to do with heedfulness
Why is that
'Perhaps this venerable one when making use of suitable resting places associating with admirable friends balancing his faculties will reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now' Envisioning this fruit of heedfulness for this monk I say that he has a task to do with heedfulness
And what is the individual released through conviction
There is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless but  having seen with discernment  some of his fermentations are ended and his conviction in the Tathagata is settled rooted and established
This is called an individual who is released through conviction
Regarding this monk I say that he has a task to do with heedfulness
Why is that
'Perhaps this venerable one when making use of suitable resting places associating with admirable friends balancing his faculties will reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now' Envisioning this fruit of heedfulness for this monk I say that he has a task to do with heedfulness
And what is the individual who is a Dhammafollower
There is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless nor  having seen with discernment  are his fermentations ended
But with a measure of reflection through discernment he has come to an agreement with the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata
And he has these qualities the faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration  the faculty of discernment
This is called an individual who is a Dhammafollower
Regarding this monk I say that he has a task to do with heedfulness
Why is that
'Perhaps this venerable one when making use of suitable resting places associating with admirable friends balancing his faculties will reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now' Envisioning this fruit of heedfulness for this monk I say that he has a task to do with heedfulness
And what is the individual who is a convictionfollower
There is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless nor  having seen with discernment  are his fermentations ended
But he has a measure of conviction in  love for the Tathagata
And he has these qualities the faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration  the faculty of discernment
This is called an individual who is a convictionfollower
Regarding this monk I say that he has a task to do with heedfulness
Why is that
'Perhaps this venerable one when making use of suitable resting places associating with admirable friends balancing his faculties will reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now' Envisioning this fruit of heedfulness for this monk I say that he has a task to do with heedfulness
Monks I do not say that the attainment of gnosis is all at once
Rather the attainment of gnosis is after gradual training gradual action gradual practice
And how is there the attainment of gnosis after gradual training gradual action gradual practice
There is the case where when conviction has arisen one visits
Having visited one grows close
Having grown close one lends ear
Having lent ear one hears the Dhamma
Having heard the Dhamma one remembers it
Remembering one penetrates the meaning of the teachings
Penetrating the meaning one comes to an agreement through pondering the teachings
There being an agreement through pondering the teachings desire arises
When desire has arisen one is willing
When one is willing one contemplates
Having contemplated one makes an exertion
Having made an exertion one realizes with the body the ultimate truth and having penetrated it with discernment sees it
Now monks there hasn't been that conviction there hasn't been that visiting there hasn't been that growing close that lending ear that hearing of the Dhamma that remembering that penetration of the meaning of the teachings that agreement through pondering the teachings that desire that willingness that contemplation that exertion
You have lost the way monks
You have gone the wrong way monks
How far have you strayed foolish men from this Dhamma  Discipline
Monks there is a fourphrased statement that when it is recited a wise man will in no long time learn the meaning through discernment
I will recite it and you learn it from me
But lord who are we to be learners of the Dhamma
Monks even with a teacher devoted to material things an heir of material things who lives attached to material things this sort of haggling wouldn't be proper 'If we get this we'll do it if we don't we won't' So how could it be with regard to the Tathagata who dwells entirely detached from material things
For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher's message  lives to penetrate it what accords with the Dhamma is this 'The Blessed One is the Teacher I am a disciple
He is the one who knows not I' For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher's message  lives to penetrate it the Teacher's message is healing  nourishing
For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher's message  lives to penetrate it what accords with the Dhamma is this 'Gladly would I let the flesh  blood in my body dry up leaving just the skin tendons  bones but if I have not attained what can be reached through human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing my persistence' For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher's message  lives to penetrate it one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturn
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
The Pali phrase for monks led by Assaji and Punabbasu is assajipunabbusakaa bhikkhuu
Both The MiddleLength Sayings and The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha mistakenly treat this phrase as the names of two monks Assaji and Punabbasuka
Actually the kaa at the end of the name is a suffix that converts it into an adjective describing a group following Assaji and Punabbasu
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then Pañcakanga the carpenter went to Ven
Udayin and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Udayin Venerable sir how many feelings has the Blessed One spoken of
Householder the Blessed One has spoken of three feelings a feeling of pleasure a feeling of pain a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain
These are the three feelings the Blessed One has spoken of
When this was said Pañcakanga the carpenter said to Ven
Udayin The Blessed One has not spoken of three feelings
He has spoken of two feelings a feeling of pleasure and a feeling of pain
As for the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain the Blessed One has spoken of it as a refined pleasure
A second time Ven
Udayin said to Pañcakanga the carpenter Householder the Blessed One has not spoken of two feelings
He has spoken of three feelings
A second time Pañcakanga the carpenter said to Ven
Udayin The Blessed One has not spoken of three feelings
He has spoken of two feelings
A third time Ven
Udayin said to Pañcakanga the carpenter Householder the Blessed One has not spoken of two feelings
He has spoken of three feelings
A third time Pañcakanga the carpenter said to Ven
Udayin The Blessed One has not spoken of three feelings
He has spoken of two feelings
Neither was Ven
Udayin able to convince Pañcakanga the carpenter nor was Pañcakanga the carpenter able to convince Ven
Udayin
Now Ven
Ananda overheard this discussion between Ven
Udayin and Pañcakanga
So he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he told the Blessed One of the entire discussion between Ven
Udayin and Pañcakanga
Ananda true was the exposition that Pañcakanga the carpenter would not accept from Ven
Udayin
And true was the exposition that Ven
Udayin would not accept from Pañcakanga the carpenter
There is the exposition by which I have spoken of two feelings the exposition by which I have spoken of three feelings five feelings six feelings eighteen feelings feelings feelings
Thus I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition
When I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition it can be expected that when there are those who do not consent to assent to or accept what is wellsaid and wellstated by one another there will be arguing quarreling  disputing and they will dwell wounding one another with the sword of the tongue
Thus I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition
When I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition it can be expected that when there are those who do consent to assent to  accept what is wellsaid and wellstated by one another they will live in harmony with courtesy without quarreling like milk mixed with water regarding one another with friendly eyes
Ananda there are these five strings of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Sounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Now whatever pleasure or happiness arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality that is called sensual pleasure
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters  remains in the cessation of perception  feeling
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Now it's possible Ananda that some wanderers of other persuasions might say 'Gotama the contemplative speaks of the cessation of perception  feeling and yet describes it as pleasure
What is this
How can this be' When they say that they are to be told 'It's not the case friends that the Blessed One describes only pleasant feeling as included under pleasure
Wherever pleasure is found in whatever terms the Blessed One describes it as pleasure' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Ananda delighted in the Blessed One's words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Anguttarapans at an Anguttarapan town named Apana
Then early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Apana for alms
Having wandered for alms in Apana and returning from his alms round after his meal he went to a certain forest grove for the day's abiding
Plunging into the grove he sat down for his day's abiding at the root of a certain tree
Ven
Udayin too early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe  bowl went into Apana for alms
Having wandered for alms in Apana and returning from his alms round after his meal he went to that forest grove for the day's abiding
Plunging into the grove he sat down for his day's abiding at the root of a certain tree
Then as he was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness So many painful things has the Blessed One taken away from us
So many pleasant things has he brought us
So many unskillful qualities has the Blessed One taken away from us
So many skillful qualities has he brought us
Then in the evening Ven
Udayin left seclusion and went to the Blessed One
On arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness 'So many painful things has the Blessed One taken away from us
So many pleasant things has he brought us
So many unskillful qualities has the Blessed One taken away from us
So many skillful qualities has he brought us' For in the past lord we used to eat in the morning in the evening and in the day at the wrong time
Then there was the time when the Blessed One addressed the monks saying 'Monks please discontinue that daytime meal at the wrong time' For just a day I was upset for just a day I was sad 'The exquisite staple  nonstaple foods that faithful householders give us during the day at the wrong time even those the Blessed One has us abandon even those the One Wellgone has us relinquish' But considering our love  respect  shame  compunction around the Blessed One we abandoned that daytime meal at the wrong time
So we ate both in the evening  in the morning
Then there was the time when the Blessed One addressed the monks saying 'Monks please discontinue that evening meal at the wrong time' For just a day I was upset for just a day I was sad 'The more exquisitely prepared of our two meals even that the Blessed One has us abandon even that the One Wellgone has us relinquish
It has happened lord that a man  obtaining some good curry ingredients during the day  would say to his wife 'Put this aside and we'll all eat it together in the evening' All fine cooking is done in the evening and next to none during the day
But considering our love  respect  shame  compunction around the Blessed One we abandoned that evening meal at the wrong time
It has happened lord that monks wandering for alms in the pitch dark of the night have walked into a wastewater pool fallen into a cesspool stumbled over a thorn patch or stumbled over a sleeping cow
They have encountered young hooligans on the way to or from a crime
They have been sexually propositioned by women
Once I went for alms in the pitch dark of night
A woman washing a pot saw me by a lightning flash and on seeing me screamed out 'I'm done for
A demon is after me' When this was said I said to her 'I'm no demon sister
I'm a monk waiting for alms' 'Then you're a monk whose daddy's dead and whose momma's dead
Better for you monk that your belly be slit open with a sharp butcher's knife than this prowling for alms for your belly's sake in the pitch dark of night On recollecting that lord the thought occurred to me 'So many painful things has the Blessed One taken away from us
So many pleasant things has he brought us
So many unskillful qualities has the Blessed One taken away from us
So many skillful qualities has he brought us' In the same way Udayin there are some worthless men who when I tell them 'Abandon this' say 'Why this petty elementary thing
He's too much of a stickler this contemplative' They don't abandon it
They're rude to me and to the monks keen on training
For them that's a strong snare a thick snare a heavy snare an unrotting snare and a thick yoke
 Suppose a quail were snared by a rotting creeper by which it could expect injury capture or death and someone were to say 'This rotting creeper by which this quail is snared and by which she could expect injury capture or death is for her a weak snare a feeble snare a rotting snare an insubstantial snare' Would the person speaking that way be speaking rightly
No lord
That rotting creeper is for her a strong snare a thick snare a heavy snare an unrotting snare and a thick yoke
In the same way Udayin there are some worthless men who when I tell them 'Abandon this' say 'Why this petty elementary thing
He's too much of a stickler this contemplative' They don't abandon it
They're rude to me and to the monks keen on training
For them that's a strong snare a thick snare a heavy snare an unrotting snare and a thick yoke
Now there are some clansmen who when I tell them 'Abandon this' say 'Why does the Blessed One have us abandon this
Why does the One Wellgone have us relinquish this petty elementary thing' But they abandon it and are not rude to me or to the monks keen on training
Having abandoned it they live unconcerned unruffled their wants satisfied with their mind like a wild deer
For them that's a weak snare a feeble snare a rotting snare an insubstantial snare
 Suppose a royal elephant  immense pedigreed accustomed to battles its tusks like chariot poles  were snared with thick leather snares but by twisting its body a bit it could break  burst those snares and go off wherever it liked
And suppose someone were to say 'Those thick leather snares by which the royal elephant was snared but which  by twisting its body a bit  it could break  burst and go off wherever it liked for him they were a strong snare a thick snare a heavy snare an unrotting snare and a thick yoke' Would the person speaking that way be speaking rightly'
No lord
Those thick leather snares were for him a weak snare a feeble snare a rotting snare an insubstantial snare
In the same way Udayin there are some clansmen who when I tell them 'Abandon this' say 'Why does the Blessed One have us abandon this
Why does the One Wellgone have us relinquish this petty elementary thing' But they abandon it and are not rude to me or to the monks keen on training
Having abandoned it they live unconcerned unruffled their wants satisfied with their mind like a wild deer
For them that's a weak snare a feeble snare a rotting snare an insubstantial snare
 Suppose there were a poor person penniless  indigent with a single little shack  dilapidated open to the crows not the best sort and a single bed  dilapidated not the best sort and a single pot of rice  gourd seeds  not the best sort and a single wife  not the best sort
He would go to a park and see a monk  his hands  feet washed after a delightful meal sitting in the cool shade committed to the heightened mind
The thought would occur to him 'How happy the contemplative state
How free of disease the contemplative state
O that I  shaving off my hair  beard and donning the ochre robe  might go forth from the household life into homelessness' But being unable to abandon his single little shack  dilapidated open to the crows not the best sort his single bed  dilapidated not the best sort his single pot of rice  gourd seeds  not the best sort and his single wife  not the best sort  he wouldn't be able to shave off his hair  beard to don the ochre robe or to go forth from the household life into homelessness
And suppose someone were to say 'That single little shack that single bed that single pot and that single wife  not the best sort  by which that man was snared which he was unable to abandon and because of which he couldn't shave off his hair  beard don the ochre robe and go forth from the household life into homelessness for him they were a weak snare a feeble snare a rotting snare an insubstantial snare' Would the person speaking that way be speaking rightly
No lord
That single hut that single bed that single pot that single wife were for that man a strong snare a thick snare a heavy snare an unrotting snare and a thick yoke
In the same way Udayin there are some worthless men who when I tell them 'Abandon this' say 'Why this petty elementary thing
He's too much of a stickler this contemplative' They don't abandon it
They're rude to me and to the monks keen on training
For them that's a strong snare a thick snare a heavy snare an unrotting snare and a thick yoke
Now suppose Udayin that there were a householder or householder's son  rich prosperous  wealthy  with vast amounts of gold ingots vast amounts of grain a vast number of fields a vast amount of land a vast number of wives and a vast number of male  female slaves
He would go to a park and see a monk  his hands  feet washed after a delightful meal sitting in the cool shade committed to the heightened mind
The thought would occur to him 'How happy the contemplative state
How free of disease the contemplative state
O that I  shaving off my hair  beard and donning the ochre robe  might go forth from the household life into homelessness' And being able to abandon his vast amounts of gold ingots his vast amounts of grain his vast number of fields his vast amount of land his vast number of wives and his vast number of male  female slaves he would be able to shave off his hair  beard to don the ochre robe and to go forth from the household life into homelessness
Now suppose someone were to say 'Those vast amounts of gold ingots and a vast number of male  female slaves by which that householder or householder's son was snared but which he was able to abandon so that he could shave off his hair  beard don the ochre robe and go forth from the household life into homelessness for him they were a strong snare a thick snare a heavy snare an unrotting snare and a thick yoke' Would the person speaking that way be speaking rightly
No lord
Those vast amounts of gold ingots were for him a weak snare a feeble snare a rotting snare an insubstantial snare'
In the same way Udayin there are some clansmen who when I tell them 'Abandon this' say 'Why does the Blessed One have us abandon this
Why does the One Wellgone have us relinquish this petty elementary thing' But they abandon it and are not rude to me or to the monks keen on training
Having abandoned it they live unconcerned unruffled their wants satisfied with their mind like a wild deer
For them that's a weak snare a feeble snare a rotting snare an insubstantial snare
Udayin there are these four types of people to be found existing in the world
Which four
There is the case where a certain person is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions
As he is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions memories  resolves associated with acquisitions assail him
He acquiesces to them
He does not abandon them dispel them demolish them or wipe them out of existence
I tell you Udayin that this sort of person is fettered not unfettered
Why is that
Because I have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of person
Then there is the case where a certain person is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions
As he is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions memories  resolves associated with acquisitions assail him
He does not acquiesce to them
He abandons them dispels them demolishes them  wipes them out of existence
I tell you Udayin that this sort of person is fettered not unfettered
Why is that
Because I have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of person
Then there is the case where a certain person is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions
As he is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions then  from time to time owing to lapses in mindfulness  he is assailed by memories  resolves associated with acquisitions
Slow is the arising of his mindfulness but then he quickly abandons dispels them demolishes them  wipes them out of existence
Just as when two or three drops of water fall onto an iron pan heated all day Slow is the falling of the drops of water but they quickly vanish  disappear
In the same way there is the case where a certain person is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions
As he is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions then  from time to time owing to lapses in mindfulness  he is assailed by memories  resolves associated with acquisitions
Slow is the arising of his mindfulness but then he quickly abandons dispels them demolishes them  wipes them out of existence
I tell you Udayin that this sort of person is fettered not unfettered
Why is that
Because I have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of person
Then there is the case where a certain person realizing that acquisitions are the root of suffering  stress is without acquisitions released in the ending of acquisitions
I tell you Udayin that this sort of person is unfettered not fettered
Why is that
Because I have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of person
There are these four types of people to be found existing in the world
And Udayin there are these five strings of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Sounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
These are the five strings of sensuality
Now any pleasure  happiness that arises dependent on these five strings of sensuality is called sensual pleasure a filthy pleasure a runofthemill pleasure an ignoble pleasure
And of this pleasure I say that it is not to be cultivated not to be developed not to be pursued that it is to be feared
Now there is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is called renunciationpleasure seclusionpleasure calmpleasure selfawakeningpleasure
And of this pleasure I say that it is to be cultivated to be developed to be pursued that it is not to be feared
Now there is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
That I tell you comes under the perturbable
And what comes under the perturbable there
The directed thoughts  evaluations that haven't ceased there that's what comes under the perturbable there
There is the case where a monk with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
That I tell you comes under the perturbable
And what comes under the perturbable there
The rapturepleasure that hasn't ceased there that's what comes under the perturbable there
There is the case where a monk with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' That I tell you comes under the perturbable
And what comes under the perturbable there
The equanimitypleasure that hasn't ceased there that's what comes under the perturbable there
There is the case where a monk with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
Now that I tell you comes under the imperturbable
Now there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
That I tell you isn't enough
Abandon it I tell you
Transcend it I tell you
And what is its transcending
There is the case where a monk enters  remains in the second jhana That is its transcending
But that too I tell you isn't enough
Abandon it I tell you
Transcend it I tell you
And what is its transcending
There is the case where a monk enters  remains in the third jhana That is its transcending
But that too I tell you isn't enough
Abandon it I tell you
Transcend it I tell you
And what is its transcending
There is the case where a monkenters  remains in the fourth jhana That is its transcending
But that too I tell you isn't enough
Abandon it I tell you
Transcend it I tell you
And what is its transcending
Then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
That is its transcending
But that too I tell you isn't enough
Abandon it I tell you
Transcend it I tell you
And what is its transcending
Then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
That is its transcending
But that too I tell you isn't enough
Abandon it I tell you
Transcend it I tell you
And what is its transcending
Then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
That is its transcending
But that too I tell you isn't enough
Abandon it I tell you
Transcend it I tell you
And what is its transcending
Then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
That is its transcending
But that too I tell you isn't enough
Abandon it I tell you
Transcend it I tell you
And what is its transcending
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters  remains in the cessation of perception  feeling
That is its transcending
Thus Udayin I speak even of the abandoning of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Do you see any fetter large or small of whose abandoning I don't speak
No lord
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Udayin delighted in the Blessed One's words
Thus have I heard
Once the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then Carpenter Fivetools went to see the Venerable Udayi
Having saluted him respectfully he sat down at one side
Thus seated he asked the Venerable Udayi
How many kinds of feelings reverend Udayi were taught by the Blessed One
Three kinds of feelings Carpenter were taught by the Blessed One pleasant painful and neutral feelings
These are the three feelings taught by the Blessed One
After these words Carpenter Fivetools said Not three kinds of feelings reverend Udayi were taught by the Blessed One
It is two kinds of feelings that were stated by the Blessed One pleasant and painful feelings
The neutral feeling was said by the Blessed One to belong to peaceful and sublime happiness
But the Venerable Udayi replied It is not two feelings that were taught by the Blessed One but three pleasant painful and neutral feelings
but neither was Carpenter Fivetools able to convince the Venerable Udayi nor could the Venerable Udayi convince Carpenter Fivetools
It so happened that Venerable Ananda had listened to that conversation and went to see the Blessed One about it
Having saluted the Blessed One respectfully he sat down at one side
Thus seated he repeated the entire conversation that had taken place between the Venerable Udayi and Carpenter Fivetools
The Blessed One said Ananda Udayi's way of presentation with which Carpenter Fivetools disagreed was correct indeed
But also Carpenter Fivetool's way of presentation with which Udayi disagreed was correct
In one way of presentation I have spoken of two kinds of feelings and in other ways of presentation I have spoken of three of six of eighteen of thirtysix and of one hundred and eight kinds of feelings
So the Dhamma has been shown by me in different ways of presentation
Regarding the Dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who do not agree with do not consent to and do not accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will quarrel and get into arguments and disputes hurting each other with sharp words
Regarding the Dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who agree with consent to and accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will live in concord and amity without dispute like milk with water looking at each other with friendly eyes
There are five strands of sense desire
What are these five
Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sensual desire and tempting to lust
Sounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sense desire and tempting to lust
These are the five strands of sense desire
The pleasure and joy arising dependent on these five strands of sense desire that is called sensual pleasure
Now if someone were to say 'This is the highest pleasure and joy that can be experienced' I would not concede that
And why not
Because there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
And what is this pleasure
Here quite secluded from sensual desires secluded from unwholesome states of mind a monk enters upon and abides in the first meditative absorption which is accompanied by thought conception and discursive thinking and has in it joy and pleasure born of seclusion
This is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
If someone were to say 'This is the highest pleasure that can be experienced' I would not concede that
And why not
Because there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
And what is that pleasure
Here with the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking a monk enters upon and abides in the second meditative absorption in the sphere of the infinity of space of the infinity of consciousness of nothingness of neitherperceptionnornonperception
If someone were to say 'This is the highest pleasure that can be experienced' I would not concede that
And why not
Because there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
And what is this pleasure
Here by completely surmounting the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception a monk enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling
This is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
It may happen Ananda that Wanderers of other sects will be saying this 'The recluse Gotama speaks of the Cessation of Perception and Feeling and describes it as pleasure
What is this and how is this'
Those who say so should be told 'The Blessed One describes as pleasure not only the feeling of pleasure
But a Tathagata describes as pleasure whenever and whereinsoever it is obtained' That is what the Blessed One said
The venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words
In AN the venerable Sariputta exclaims Nibbana is happiness friend Nibbana is happiness indeed The monk Udayi then asked How can there be happiness when there is no feeling The venerable Sariputta replied Just this is happiness friend that therein there is no feeling The continuation of that Sutta may also be compared with our text
On Nibbana as happiness see also AN
The Buddha often likened himself to a doctor offering a treatment for the sufferings of the heart
Unlike ordinary doctors however he could not show newcomers the state of health  nibbana  that his teaching was supposed to produce
If they followed his teaching they would see it for themselves
But until they followed his teaching he could offer them no empirical proof that nibbana was a genuine possibility
As he stated in MN the proof that he was awakened  and that awakening was a good thing  came with one's first taste of the Deathless at the first level of awakening called streamentry
However streamentry could be attained only through a serious commitment to the practice
Thus he had to provide other nonempirical means of persuasion to induce his listeners to give his teachings a serious try
One of these means was the pragmatic argument which differs from empirical arguments as follows
An empirical argument presents facts that logically imply that A must be true or false
A pragmatic argument focuses not on the facts related to A but on the behavior that can be expected from a person who believes or rejects A
The Buddha's main pragmatic argument is that if one accepted his teachings one would be likely to pay careful attention to one's actions so as to do no harm
This in and of itself is a worthy activity regardless of whether the rest of the path was true
When applying this argument to the issue of rebirth and karmic results the Buddha sometimes coupled it with a second pragmatic argument that resembles Pascal's wager If one practices the Dhamma one leads a blameless life in the hereandnow
Even if the afterlife and karmic results do not exist one has not lost the wager for the blamelessness of one's life is a reward in and of itself
If there is an afterlife with karmic results then one has won a double reward the blamelessness of one's life here and now and the good rewards of one's actions in the afterlife
These two pragmatic arguments form the central message of this sutta
The Pali title of this sutta is an adjective that has no exact equivalent in English
It is used in two different contexts
In the context of gambling it describes a die that has not been loaded to favor one side or the other
In the context of an argument it describes a position that is true regardless of which side of the argument is right
In other words if there is an argument as to whether A or notA is true if C is true regardless of whether A is true or not C is an apannaka position
Although this sutta is primarily concerned with the second context the Buddha implicitly makes the connection between this context and the first in stating that a person who rightly grasps the apannaka position has made a lucky throw whereas a person who has wrongly grasped it has made an unlucky throw
Thus to preserve this double context I have translated apannaka as safebet Coveryourbets might have been a more accurate translation but it would have been unwieldy
The sutta falls into two parts the first part covering his safebet arguments and the second part extolling the person who practices the Dhamma for tormenting neither himself nor others
The two parts are connected in that they both present pragmatic arguments for accepting the Buddha's teaching
The safebet arguments in the first part of the sutta follow two patterns
The first pattern covers controversies over whether there is a life after death whether actions bear results and whether there is a causal connection between one's actions and one's experience of pleasure and pain
The pattern here is as follows
It is noteworthy that the arguments in A and B are not safebet arguments for they assume that A is wrong and B is right
Whether these arguments date from the Buddha or were added at a later date no one knows
The second pattern in the first part covers two controversies whether or not a person can attain a total state of formlessness and whether or not a person can attain total cessation of becoming
In the context of the first controversy the safebet position is that even if there is no total attainment of formlessness that still opens the possibility that one could become a deva on the level of form
In the context of the second the safebet position is that even if there is no total cessation of becoming that still leaves open the possibility that one could become a deva on the formless level
One further reflects that total formlessness would open the way to greater peace than the level of form and that the cessation of becoming would open the way to greater freedom than formlessness
These last observations in no way prove that there is total formlessness or total cessation of becoming but they do incline the mind to view those possibilities favorably
The second part of the sutta divides people into four sorts those who torment themselves those who torment others those who torment themselves and others and those who torment neither themselves nor others
The first and third alternatives describe styles of religious practice that were common in the Buddha's time practices of selftorture and selfaffliction and the offering of sacrifices
The second alternative covers any and all bloody occupations
In opposition to these alternatives the Buddha presents the fourth alternative as ideal the practice of his teachings all the way to full liberation
For other pragmatic arguments for accepting and practicing the Dhamma see AN AN and SN
AN
also contains a variant on the wager argument given in this sutta
I have heard that on one occasion when the Blessed One was on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks he arrived at the brahman village called Sala
The brahman householders heard Master Gotama the contemplative  the son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clan  on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks  has arrived at Sala
And of that master Gotama this fine reputation has spread 'He is indeed a Blessed One an arahant rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessed
He has made known  having realized it through direct knowledge  this world with its devas maras  brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their rulers  common people
He has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
It is good to see such a worthy one' So the brahman householders of Sala went to the Blessed One
On arrival some of them bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side
Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one side
Some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palmtopalm over their hearts
Some of them sat to one side having announced their name  clan
Some of them sat to one side in silence
As they were sitting there the Blessed One asked them Householders is there any teacher agreeable to you in whom you have found grounded conviction
No lord there is no teacher agreeable to us in whom we have found grounded conviction
As you have not found an agreeable teacher you should adopt and practice this safebet teaching for this safebet teaching  when accepted and adopted  will be to your longterm welfare  happiness
And what is the safebet teaching
A
There are some contemplatives  brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view 'There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed
There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions
There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves'
B
Some contemplatives  brahmans speaking in direct opposition to those contemplatives  brahmans say this 'There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed
There are fruits  results of good  bad actions
There is this world  the next world
There is mother  father
There are spontaneously reborn beings there are contemplatives  brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves'
What do you think householders
Don't these contemplatives  brahmans speak in direct opposition to each other
Yes lord
A
Now householders of those contemplatives  brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view  'There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed
There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions
There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves'  it can be expected that shunning these three skillful activities  good bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conduct  they will adopt  practice these three unskillful activities bad bodily conduct bad verbal conduct bad mental conduct
Why is that
Because those venerable contemplatives  brahmans do not see in unskillful activities the drawbacks the degradation and the defilement nor in skillful activities the rewards of renunciation resembling cleansing
A
Because there actually is the next world the view of one who thinks 'There is no next world' is his wrong view
Because there actually is the next world when he is resolved that 'There is no next world' that is his wrong resolve
Because there actually is the next world when he speaks the statement 'There is no next world' that is his wrong speech
Because there actually is the next world when he says that 'There is no next world' he makes himself an opponent to those arahants who know the next world
Because there actually is the next world when he persuades another that 'There is no next world' that is persuasion in what is not true Dhamma
And in that persuasion in what is not true Dhamma he exalts himself and disparages others
Whatever good habituation he previously had is abandoned while bad habituation is manifested
And this wrong view wrong resolve wrong speech opposition to the arahants persuasion in what is not true Dhamma exaltation of self  disparagement of others These many evil unskillful activities come into play in dependence on wrong view
A

But if there is the next world then this venerable person  on the breakup of the body after death  will reappear in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell
Even if we didn't speak of the next world and there weren't the true statement of those venerable contemplatives  brahmans this venerable person is still criticized in the herenow by the observant as a person of bad habits  wrong view one who holds to a doctrine of nonexistence' If there really is a next world then this venerable person has made a bad throw twice in that he is criticized by the observant herenow and in that  with the breakup of the body after death  he will reappear in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell

Now householders of those contemplatives  brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view  'There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed
There are fruits  results of good  bad actions
There is this world  the next world
There is mother  father
There are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves'  it can be expected that shunning these three unskillful activities  bad bodily conduct bad verbal conduct bad mental conduct  they will adopt  practice these three skillful activities good bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conduct
Why is that
Because those venerable contemplatives  brahmans see in unskillful activities the drawbacks the degradation and the defilement and in skillful activities the rewards of renunciation resembling cleansing
B
Because there actually is the next world the view of one who thinks 'There is a next world' is his right view
Because there actually is the next world when he is resolved that 'There is a next world' that is his right resolve
Because there actually is the next world when he speaks the statement 'There is a next world' that is his right speech
Because there actually is the next world when he says that 'There is a next world' he doesn't make himself an opponent to those arahants who know the next world
Because there actually is the next world when he persuades another that 'There is a next world' that is persuasion in what is true Dhamma
And in that persuasion in what is true Dhamma he doesn't exalt himself or disparage others
Whatever bad habituation he previously had is abandoned while good habituation is manifested
And this right view right resolve right speech nonopposition to the arahants persuasion in what is true Dhamma nonexaltation of self  nondisparagement of others These many skillful activities come into play in dependence on right view

There are some contemplatives  brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view 'In acting or getting others to act in mutilating or getting others to mutilate in torturing or getting others to torture in inflicting sorrow or in getting others to inflict sorrow in tormenting or getting others to torment in intimidating or getting others to intimidate in taking life taking what is not given breaking into houses plundering wealth committing burglary ambushing highways committing adultery speaking falsehood  one does no evil
If with a razoredged disk one were to turn all the living beings on this earth to a single heap of flesh a single pile of flesh there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evil
Even if one were to go along the right bank of the Ganges killing and getting others to kill mutilating and getting others to mutilate torturing and getting others to torture there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evil
Even if one were to go along the left bank of the Ganges giving and getting others to give making sacrifices and getting others to make sacrifices there would be no merit from that cause no coming of merit
Through generosity selfcontrol restraint and truthful speech there is no merit from that cause no coming of merit'

There is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakened
He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its end
He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
A householder or householder's son hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects 'Household life is confining a dusty path
Life gone forth is the open air
It isn't easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
What if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessness'
So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness

Wherever he goes he takes only his barest necessities along
Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
On seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
On hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odor with the nose On tasting a flavor with the tongue On touching a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
When going forward and returning he makes himself alert
When looking toward and looking away when bending and extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe and his bowl when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and remaining silent he makes himself alert
Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue this noble restraint over the sense faculties this noble mindfulness  alertness he seeks out a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of straw
After his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the fore

Then with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
Then with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters and remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding'
Then with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives
He recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details
This too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
He sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in a good destination a heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations
He discerns as it is actually present that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignorance
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This is called an individual who neither torments himself nor is devoted to the practice of torturing himself who neither torments others nor is devoted to the practice of torturing others
Neither tormenting himself nor tormenting others he dwells in the herenow free of hunger unbound cooled sensitive to happiness with a Brahmalike mind
When this was said the brahman householders of Sala said Magnificent master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
We go to master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
May master Gotama remember us as lay followers who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life

Monks there are these three types of individuals to be found existing in the world
Which three
An individual like an inscription in rock an individual like an inscription in soil and an individual like an inscription in water
And how is an individual like an inscription in rock
There is the case where a certain individual is often angered and his anger stays with him a long time
Just as an inscription in rock is not quickly effaced by wind or water and lasts a long time in the same way a certain individual is often angered and his anger stays with him a long time
This is called an individual like an inscription in rock
And how is an individual like an inscription in soil
There is the case where a certain individual is often angered but his anger doesn't stay with him a long time
Just as an inscription in soil is quickly effaced by wind or water and doesn't last a long time in the same way a certain individual is often angered but his anger doesn't stay with him a long time
This is called an individual like an inscription in soil
And how is an individual like an inscription in water
There is the case where a certain individual  when spoken to roughly spoken to harshly spoken to in an unpleasing way  is nevertheless congenial companionable  courteous
Just as an inscription in water immediately disappears and doesn't last a long time in the same way a certain individual  when spoken to roughly spoken to harshly spoken to in an unpleasing way  is nevertheless congenial companionable  courteous
This is called an individual like an inscription in water
These are the three types of individuals to be found existing in the world 
In this discourse the Buddha shows the factors that go into deciding what is and is not worth saying
The main factors are three whether or not a statement is true whether or not it is beneficial and whether or not it is pleasing to others
The Buddha himself would state only those things that are true and beneficial and would have a sense of time for when pleasing and unpleasing things should be said
Notice that the possibility that a statement might be untrue yet beneficial is not even entertained
This discourse also shows in action the Buddha's teaching on the four categories of questions and how they should be answered
The prince asks him two questions and in both cases he responds first with a counterquestion before going on to give an analytical answer to the first question and a categorical answer to the second
Each counterquestion serves a double function to give the prince a familiar reference point for understanding the answer about to come and also to give him a chance to speak of his own intelligence and good motives
This provides him with the opportunity to save face after being stymied in his desire to best the Buddha in argument
The Commentary notes that the prince had placed his infant son on his lap as a cheap debater's trick if the Buddha had put him in an uncomfortable spot in the debate the prince would have pinched his son causing him to cry and thus effectively bringing the debate to a halt
The Buddha however uses the infant's presence to remove any sense of a debate and also to make an effective point
Taking Nigantha Nataputta's image of a dangerous object stuck in the throat he applies it to the infant and then goes on to make the point that unlike the Niganthas  who were content to leave someone with a potentially lethal object in the throat  the Buddha's desire is to remove such objects out of sympathy and compassion
In this way he brings the prince over to his side converting a potential opponent into a disciple
Thus this discourse is not only about right speech but also shows right speech in action
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Sanctuary
Then Prince Abhaya went to Nigantha Nataputta and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there Nigantha Nataputta said to him Come now prince
Refute the words of Gotama the contemplative and this admirable report about you will spread afar 'The words of Gotama the contemplative  so mighty so powerful  were refuted by Prince Abhaya' But how venerable sir will I refute the words of Gotama the contemplative  so mighty so powerful
Come now prince
Go to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival say this 'Lord would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others' If Gotama the contemplative thus asked answers 'The Tathagata would say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others' then you should say 'Then how is there any difference between you lord and runofthemill people
For even runofthemill people say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others' But if Gotama the contemplative thus asked answers 'The Tathagata would not say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others' then you should say 'Then how lord did you say of Devadatta that Devadatta is headed for destitution Devadatta is headed for hell Devadatta will boil for an eon Devadatta is incurable
For Devadatta was upset  disgruntled at those words of yours' When Gotama the contemplative is asked this twopronged question by you he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up
Just as if a twohorned chestnut were stuck in a man's throat he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up
In the same way when Gotama the contemplative is asked this twopronged question by you he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up
Responding As you say venerable sir Prince Abhaya got up from his seat bowed down to Nigantha Nataputta circumambulated him and then went to the Blessed One
On arrival he bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he glanced up at the sun and thought Today is not the time to refute the Blessed One's words
Tomorrow in my own home I will overturn the Blessed One's words So he said to the Blessed One May the Blessed One together with three others acquiesce to my offer of tomorrow's meal
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then Prince Abhaya understanding the Blessed One's acquiescence got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him and left
Then after the night had passed the Blessed One early in the morning put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe went to Prince Abhaya's home
On arrival he sat down on a seat made ready
Prince Abhaya with his own hand served  satisfied the Blessed One with fine staple  nonstaple foods
Then when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl Prince Abhaya took a lower seat and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others
Prince there is no categorical yesorno answer to that
Then right here lord the Niganthas are destroyed
But prince why do you say 'Then right here lord the Niganthas are destroyed'
Just yesterday lord I went to Nigantha Nataputta and he said to me'Come now prince
Go to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival say this Lord would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others Just as if a twohorned chestnut were stuck in a man's throat he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up
In the same way when Gotama the contemplative is asked this twopronged question by you he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up' Now at that time a baby boy was lying faceup on the prince's lap
So the Blessed One said to the prince What do you think prince If this young boy through your own negligence or that of the nurse were to take a stick or a piece of gravel into its mouth what would you do
I would take it out lord
If I couldn't get it out right away then holding its head in my left hand and crooking a finger of my right I would take it out even if it meant drawing blood
Why is that
Because I have sympathy for the young boy
In the same way prince
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial but unendearing  disagreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial and endearing  agreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying them
Why is that
Because the Tathagata has sympathy for living beings
Lord when wise nobles or brahmans householders or contemplatives having formulated questions come to the Tathagata and ask him does this line of reasoning appear to his awareness beforehand  'If those who approach me ask this I  thus asked  will answer in this way'  or does the Tathagata come up with the answer on the spot
In that case prince I will ask you a counterquestion
Answer as you see fit
What do you think are you skilled in the parts of a chariot
Yes lord
I am skilled in the parts of a chariot
And what do you think When people come  ask you 'What is the name of this part of the chariot' does this line of reasoning appear to your awareness beforehand  'If those who approach me ask this I  thus asked  will answer in this way'  or do you come up with the answer on the spot
Lord I am renowned for being skilled in the parts of a chariot
All the parts of a chariot are wellknown to me
I come up with the answer on the spot
In the same way prince when wise nobles or brahmans householders or contemplatives having formulated questions come to the Tathagata and ask him he comes up with the answer on the spot
Why is that
Because the property of the Dhamma is thoroughly penetrated by the Tathagata
From his thorough penetration of the property of the Dhamma he comes up with the answer on the spot 
When this was said Prince Abhaya said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
See also AN AN AN
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana
Then early in the morning the Blessed One having put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe went into Varanasi for alms
As he was walking for alms near the figtree at the cattle yoke he saw a certain monk whose delight was in what is empty whose delight was in exterior things his mindfulness muddled his alertness lacking his concentration lacking his mind gone astray his faculties uncontrolled
On seeing him the Blessed One said to him Monk monk don't let yourself putrefy
On one who lets himself putrefy  stink with the stench of carrion there's no way that flies won't swarm  attack
Then the monk  admonished with this the Blessed One's admonishment  came to his senses
So the Blessed One having gone for alms in Varanasi after the meal returning from his alms round addressed the monks
When this was said a certain monk said to the Blessed One What lord is putrefaction
What is the stench of carrion
What are flies
Greed monk is putrefaction
Ill will is the stench of carrion
Evil unskillful thoughts are flies
On one who lets himself putrefy  stink with the stench of carrion there's no way that flies won't swarm  attack
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali at Gotamaka Shrine
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said It's through direct knowledge that I teach the Dhamma not without direct knowledge
It's with a cause that I teach the Dhamma not without a cause
It's with marvels that I teach the Dhamma not without marvels
Because I teach the Dhamma through direct knowledge and not without direct knowledge because I teach the Dhamma with a cause and not without a cause because I teach the Dhamma with marvels and not without marvels there is good reason for my instruction good reason for my admonition
And that is enough for you to be content enough for you to be gratified enough for you to take joy that the Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One and the community has practiced rightly
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
And while this explanation was being given the tenthousand fold cosmos quaked
Editor's note According to the Commentary the audience for this sutta was the same group of monks who had been so displeased upon first hearing the Mulapariyaya Sutta
Monks there are these three forms of sagacity
Which three
Bodily sagacity verbal sagacity and mental sagacity
And what is bodily sagacity
There is the case where a monk abstains from taking life abstains from theft abstains from unchastity
This is called bodily sagacity
And what is verbal sagacity
There is the case where a monk abstains from lying abstains from divisive talebearing abstains from harsh language abstains from idle chatter
This is called verbal sagacity
And what is mental sagacity
There is the case where a monk who  with the wasting away of the mental fermentations  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and now
This is called mental sagacity
These monks are the three forms of sagacity
Then Anathapindika the householder went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Householder when the mind is unprotected bodily actions are unprotected as well verbal actions are unprotected as well mental actions are unprotected as well
When one's bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions are unprotected one's bodily actions get soggy one's verbal actions get soggy one's mental actions get soggy
When one's bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions are soggy one's bodily actions verbal actions mental actions rot
When one's bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions rot one's death is not auspicious the mode of one's dying not good
Just as when a peakroofed house is poorly roofed The peak of the roof is unprotected the roof beams are unprotected the walls are unprotected
The peak of the roof the roof beams the walls get soggy
The peak of the roof the roof beams the walls then rot
In the same way when the mind is unprotected bodily actions verbal actions mental actions are unprotected as well One's bodily verbal mental actions get soggy One's bodily verbal mental actions rot
When one's bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions rot one's death is not auspicious the mode of one's dying not good
Now when the mind is protected bodily actions are protected as well verbal actions are protected as well mental actions are protected as well
When one's bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions are protected one's bodily actions verbal actions mental actions don't get soggy
When one's bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions aren't soggy one's bodily actions verbal actions mental actions don't rot
When one's bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions don't rot one's death is auspicious the mode of one's dying is good
Just as when a peakroofed house is well roofed The peak of the roof is protected the roof beams are protected the walls are protected
The peak of the roof the roof beams the walls don't get soggy
The peak of the roof the roof beams the walls don't rot
In the same way when the mind is protected bodily actions verbal actions mental actions are protected as well One's bodily verbal mental actions don't get soggy One's bodily verbal mental actions don't rot
When one's bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions don't rot one's death is auspicious the mode of one's dying is good
The traditional title for this sutta has nothing to do with its content
Thus I have given it a new title
 the translator
A monk intent on heightened mind should attend periodically to three themes He should attend periodically to the theme of concentration he should attend periodically to the theme of uplifted energy he should attend periodically to the theme of equanimity
If the monk intent on heightened mind were to attend solely to the theme of concentration it is possible that his mind would tend to laziness
If he were to attend solely to the theme of uplifted energy it is possible that his mind would tend to restlessness
If he were to attend solely to the theme of equanimity it is possible that his mind would not be rightly concentrated for the ending of the fermentations
But when he attends periodically to the theme of concentration attends periodically to the theme of uplifted energy attends periodically to the theme of equanimity his mind is pliant malleable luminous  not brittle
It is rightly centered for the stopping of the fermentations
Just as if a goldsmith or goldsmith's apprentice were to set up a smelter
Having set up the smelter he would fire the receptacle
Having fired the receptacle he would take hold of some gold with his tongs and place it in the receptacle
Periodically he would blow on it periodically sprinkle it with water periodically examine it closely
If he were solely to blow on it it is possible that the gold would burn up
If he were solely to sprinkle it with water it is possible that the gold would grow cold
If he were solely to examine it closely it is possible that the gold would not come to full perfection
But when he periodically blows on it periodically sprinkles it with water periodically examines it closely the gold becomes pliant malleable  luminous
It is not brittle and is ready to be worked
Then whatever sort of ornament he has in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  the gold would serve his purpose
In the same way a monk intent on heightened mind should attend periodically to three themes he should attend periodically to the theme of concentration he should attend periodically to the theme of uplifted energy he should attend periodically to the theme of equanimity
If the monk intent on heightened mind were to attend solely to the theme of concentration it is possible that his mind would tend to laziness
If he were to attend solely to the theme of uplifted energy it is possible that his mind would tend to restlessness
If he were to attend solely to the theme of equanimity it is possible that his mind would not be rightly centered for the stopping of the fermentations
But when he attends periodically to the theme of concentration attends periodically to the theme of uplifted energy attends periodically to the theme of equanimity his mind is pliant malleable luminous and not brittle
It is rightly centered for the stopping of the fermentations
And then whichever of the higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening
If he wants he wields manifold supranormal powers
Having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one
He appears
He vanishes
He goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through space
He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water
He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land
Sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird
With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon so mighty and powerful
He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
He can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening
If he wants he hears  by means of the divine earelement purified and surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine and human whether near or far
He can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening
If he wants he knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awareness
He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion
He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion
He discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion
He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind
He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind
He discerns an excelled mind as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind
He discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind
He discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind
He can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening
If he wants he recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes and details
He can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening
If he wants he sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
He can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening
If he wants then through the ending of the mental fermentations he remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and now
He can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening
There were some strange people around in the Buddha's days believing some strange things  but that is no different from our own days when people still believe the most odd offbalance ideas
In this sutta we meet some people who believed that by imitating animals they would be saved
Maybe they're still with us too
Belief is often one thing action another
While beliefs sometimes influence actions for other people their beliefs are quite separate from what they do
But the Buddha says all intentional actions whether thoughts speech or bodily actions however expressed are kamma and lead the doer of them to experience a result sooner or later
In this sutta the Buddha classifies kamma into four groups
Dark kamma does not give a bright result nor does bright kamma lead to dark result
Kamma can be mixed where an action is done with a variety of motives some good some evil
And that kind of kamma also exists which gives up attachment to and interest in the other three and so leads beyond the range of kamma
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Koliyan country there is a town of the Koliyans called Haliddavasana
Then Punna a son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic and also Seniya a naked dog duty ascetic went to the Blessed One and Punna the ox duty ascetic paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side while Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic exchanged greetings with the Blessed One and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished he too sat down at one side curled up like a dog
When Punna the oxduty ascetic sat down he asked the Blessed One Venerable sir this naked dogduty ascetic Seniya does what is hard to do he eats his food when it is thrown on the ground
That dog duty has long been taken up and practiced by him
What will be his destination
What will be his future course
Enough Punna let that be
Do not ask me that
A second time A third time Punna the oxduty ascetic asked the Blessed One Venerable sir this naked dogduty ascetic Seniya does what is hard to do he eats his food when it is thrown on the ground
That dog duty has long been taken up and practiced by him
What will be his destination
What will be his future course
Well Punna since I certainly cannot persuade you when I say 'Enough Punna let that be
Do not ask me that' I shall therefore answer you
Here Punna someone develops the dog duty fully and unstintingly he develops the doghabit fully and unstintingly he develops the dog mind fully and unstintingly he develops dog behavior fully and unstintingly
Having done that on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of dogs
But if his view is such as this 'By this virtue or duty or asceticism or religious life I shall become a god or some god' that is wrong view in his case
Now there are two destinations for one with wrong view I say hell or the animal womb
So Punna if his dog duty is perfected it will lead him to the company of dogs if it is not it will lead him to hell
When this was said Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic wept and shed tears
Then the Blessed One told Punna son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic Punna I could not persuade you when I said 'Enough Punna let that be
Do not ask me that' Venerable sir I am not weeping that the Blessed One has spoken thus
Still this dog duty has long been taken up and practiced by me
Venerable sir there is this Punna a son of the Koliyans and an ox duty ascetic that ox duty has long been taken up and practiced by him
What will be his destination
What will be his future course
Enough Seniya let that be
Do not ask me that A second time A third time Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic asked the Blessed One Venerable sir there is this Punna a son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic that ox duty has long been taken up and practiced by him
What will be his destination
What will be his future course
Well Seniya since I certainly cannot persuade you when I say 'Enough Seniya let that be
Do not ask me that' I shall therefore answer you
Here Seniya someone develops the ox duty fully and unstintingly he develops the ox habit fully and unstintingly he develops the ox mind fully and unstintingly he develops the ox behavior fully and unstintingly
Having done that on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of oxen
But if his view is such as this 'By this virtue or duty or asceticism or religious like I shall become a god or some god' that is wrong view in his case
Now there are two destinations for one with wrong view I say hell or the animal womb
So Seniya if his ox duty is perfected it will lead him to the company of oxen if it is not it will lead him to hell
When this was said Punna a son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic wept and shed tears
Then the Blessed One told Seniya the naked dog duty ascetic Seniya I could not persuade you when I said 'Enough Seniya let that be
Do not ask me that' Venerable sir I am not weeping that the Blessed One has spoken thus
Still this ox duty has long been taken up and practiced by me
Venerable sir I have confidence in the Blessed One thus 'The Blessed One is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I may abandon this ox duty and that this naked dogduty ascetic Seniya may abandon that dog duty' Then Punna listen and heed well what I shall say
Yes venerable sir he replied
The Blessed One said this
Punna there are four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after realization myself with direct knowledge
What are the four
There is dark kamma with dark ripening there is bright kamma with bright ripening there is darkandbright kamma with darkandbright ripening and there is kamma that is not dark and not bright with neitherdarknorbright ripening that conduces to the exhaustion of kamma
What is dark kamma with dark ripening
Here someone produces a bodily process with affliction he produces a verbal process with affliction he produces a mental process with affliction
By so doing he reappears in a world with affliction
When that happens afflicting contacts touch him
Being touched by these he feels afflicting feelings entirely painful as in the case of beings in hell
Thus a being's reappearance is due to a being he reappears owing to the kammas he has performed
When he has reappeared contacts touch him
Thus I say are beings heirs of their kammas
This is called dark kamma with dark ripening
And what is bright kamma with bright ripening
Here someone produces a bodily process not with affliction he produces a verbal process not with affliction he produces a mental process not with affliction
By doing so he reappears in a world without affliction
When that happens unafflicting contacts touch him
Being touched by these he feels unafflicting feelings entirely pleasant as in the case of the Subhakinha the gods of Refulgent Glory
Thus a being's reappearance is due to a being he reappears owing to the kammas he has performed
When he has reappeared contacts touch him
Thus I say are beings heirs of their kammas
This is called bright kamma with bright ripening
What is darkandbright kamma with darkandbright ripening
Here someone produces a bodily process both with affliction and not with affliction verbal process mental process both with affliction and not with affliction
By doing so he reappears in a world both with and without affliction
When that happens both afflicting and unafflicting contacts touch him
Being touched by these he feels afflicting and unafflicting feelings with mingled pleasure and pain as in the case of human beings and some gods and some inhabitants of the states of deprivation
Thus a being's reappearance is due to a being he reappears owing to the kammas he has performed
When he has reappeared contacts touch him
Thus I say are beings heirs of their kammas
This is called darkandbright kamma with darkandbright ripening
What is neitherdarknorbright kamma with neitherdarknorbright ripening that leads to the exhaustion of kamma
As to these any volition in abandoning the kind of kamma that is dark with dark ripening any volition in abandoning the kind of kamma that is bright with bright ripening and any volition in abandoning the kind of kamma that is darkand bright with darkandbright ripening this is called neitherdarknorbright kamma with neitherdarknorbright ripening
These are the four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after realization myself with direct knowledge
When this was said Punna a son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent Master Gotama
The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing the hidden showing the way to one who is lost holding up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see forms
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
But Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic said Magnificent Master Gotama The Dhamma has been made clear for those with eyesight to see forms
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
I would receive the going forth under Master Gotama and the full admission
Seniya one who belonged formerly to another sect and wants the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline lives on probation for four months
At the end of the four months bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give him the going forth into homelessness and also the full admission to the bhikkhus' state
A difference in persons has become known to me in this
Venerable sir if those who belonged formerly to another sect and want the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live on probation for four months and at the end of four months bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give them the going forth into homelessness and the full admission to the bhikkhus' state I will live on probation for four years and at the end of the four years let bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give me the going forth into homelessness and the full admission to the bhikkhus' state
Seniya the naked dog duty ascetic received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admission
And not long after his full admission dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and selfcontrolled the venerable Seniya by realization himself with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abode in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
He had direct knowledge thus Birth is exhausted the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more of this to come
And the venerable Seniya became one of the arahants
Endowed with three characteristics a king's excellent thoroughbred steed is worthy of a king the wealth of a king and counts as one of the king's own limbs
Which three

There is the case where a monk discerns as it actually is present that 'This is stress' He discerns as it actually is present that 'This is the origination of stress' He discerns as it actually is present that 'This is the cessation of stress' He discerns as it actually is present that 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' This is how a monk is consummate in speed
Endowed with these three qualities is a monk worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect an unexcelled field of merit for the world
There are these three urgent duties of a farming householder
Which three
There is the case where a farming householder quickly gets his field wellplowed  wellharrowed
Having quickly gotten his field wellplowed  wellharrowed he quickly plants the seed
Having quickly planted the seed he quickly lets in the water  then lets it out
These are the three urgent duties of a farming householder
Now that farming householder does not have the power or might 'May my crops spring up today may the grains appear tomorrow and may they ripen the next day' But when the time has come the farming householder's crops spring up the grains appear and they ripen
In the same way there are these three urgent duties of a monk
Which three
The undertaking of heightened virtue the undertaking of heightened mind the undertaking of heightened discernment
These are the three urgent duties of a monk
Now that monk does not have the power or might 'May my mind be released from fermentations through lack of clingingsustenance today or tomorrow or the next day' But when the time has come his mind is released from fermentations through lack of clingingsustenance
Thus monks you should train yourselves 'Strong will be our desire for the undertaking of heightened virtue
Strong will be our desire for the undertaking of heightened mind
Strong will be our desire for the undertaking of heightened discernment' That's how you should train yourselves

Monks for anyone who says 'In whatever way a person makes kamma that is how it is experienced' there is no living of the holy life there is no opportunity for the right ending of stress
But for anyone who says 'When a person makes kamma to be felt in such  such a way that is how its result is experienced' there is the living of the holy life there is the opportunity for the right ending of stress

Suppose that a man were to drop a salt crystal into a small amount of water in a cup
What do you think
Would the water in the cup become salty because of the salt crystal and unfit to drink
Yes lord
Why is that
There being only a small amount of water in the cup it would become salty because of the salt crystal and unfit to drink
Now suppose that a man were to drop a salt crystal into the River Ganges
What do you think
Would the water in the River Ganges become salty because of the salt crystal and unfit to drink
No lord
Why is that
There being a great mass of water in the River Ganges it would not become salty because of the salt crystal or unfit to drink

Monks for anyone who says 'In whatever way a person makes kamma that is how it is experienced' there is no living of the holy life there is no opportunity for the right ending of stress
But for anyone who says 'When a person makes kamma to be felt in such  such a way that is how its result is experienced' there is the living of the holy life there is the opportunity for the right ending of stress

There are these gross impurities in gold dirty sand gravel  grit
The dirtwasher or his apprentice having placed in a vat washes it again  again until he has washed them away
When he is rid of them there remain the moderate impurities in the gold coarse sand  fine grit
He washes the gold again  again until he has washed them away
When he is rid of them there remain the fine impurities in the gold fine sand  black dust
The dirtwasher or his apprentice washes the gold again  again until he has washed them away
When he is rid of them there remains just the gold dust
The goldsmith or his apprentice having placed it in a crucible blows on it again  again to blow away the dross
The gold as long as it has not been blown on again  again to the point where the impurities are blown away as long as it is not refined  free from dross is not pliant malleable or luminous
It is brittle and not ready to be worked
But there comes a time when the goldsmith or his apprentice has blown on the gold again  again until the dross is blown away
The gold having been blown on again  again to the point where the impurities are blown away is then refined free from dross pliant malleable  luminous
It is not brittle and is ready to be worked
Then whatever sort of ornament he has in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  the gold would serve his purpose
In the same way there are these gross impurities in a monk intent on heightened mind misconduct in body speech  mind
These the monk  aware  able by nature  abandons dispels wipes out of existence
When he is rid of them there remain in him the moderate impurities thoughts of sensuality ill will  harmfulness
These he abandons dispels wipes out of existence

These he abandons dispels wipes out of existence
When he is rid of them there remain only thoughts of the Dhamma
His concentration is neither calm nor refined it has not yet attained serenity or unity and is kept in place by the fabrication of forceful restraint
But there comes a time when his mind grows steady inwardly settles down grows unified  concentrated
His concentration is calm  refined has attained serenity  unity and is no longer kept in place by the fabrication of forceful restraint
And then whichever of the higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening
If he wants he wields manifold supranormal powers
Having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one
He appears
He vanishes
He goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through space
He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water
He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land
Sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird
With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon so mighty and powerful
He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
He can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening
If he wants he hears  by means of the divine earelement purified and surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine and human whether near or far
He can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening
If he wants he knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awareness
He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion
He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion
He discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion
He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind
He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind

He discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind
He discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind

Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance

But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma

Monks this recitation of more than training rules comes every fortnight in reference to which sons of good families desiring the goal train themselves
There are these three trainings under which all that is gathered
Which three
The training in heightened virtue the training in heightened mind the training in heightened discernment

There is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue moderately accomplished in concentration and moderately accomplished in discernment
With reference to the lesser and minor training rules he falls into offenses and rehabilitates himself
Why is that
Because I have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances
But as for the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life he is one of permanent virtue one of steadfast virtue
Having undertaken them he trains in reference to the training rules
With the wasting away of three fetters he is one who has seven more times at most
Having transmigrated and wandered on among devas and human beings he will put an end to stress
 he is one going from good family to good family
Having transmigrated and wandered on among two or three good families he will put an end to stress
 he is one with one seed
Having arisen only once more in the human realm he will put an end to stress
 with the wasting away of three fetters and with the attenuation of passion aversion  delusion he is a oncereturner who  on returning only once more to this world  will put an end to stress
There is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue wholly accomplished in concentration and moderately accomplished in discernment
With reference to the lesser and minor training rules he falls into offenses and rehabilitates himself
Why is that
Because I have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances
But as for the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life he is one of permanent virtue one of steadfast virtue
Having undertaken them he trains in reference to the training rules
With the wasting away of the five lower fetters he is one going upstream to the Peerless 
 with the wasting away of the five lower fetters he is one unbound with fabrication
 with the wasting away of the five lower fetters he is one unbound without fabrication
 with the wasting away of the five lower fetters he is one unbound on arrival

 with the wasting away of the five lower fetters he is one unbound in between
There is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue wholly accomplished in concentration wholly accomplished in discernment
With reference to the lesser and minor training rules he falls into offenses and rehabilitates himself
Why is that
Because I have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances
But as for the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life he is one of permanent virtue one of steadfast virtue
Having undertaken them he trains in reference to the training rules
With the ending of effluents he dwells in the effluentfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having directly known and realized them for himself right in the hereandnow
Those who are partially accomplished attain a part those who are wholly accomplished the whole
The training rules I tell you are not in vain
The Commentary defines this category and the following one with this example Suppose that a nonreturner appears spontaneously in the Aviha Pure Abode where the lifespan is eons
If heshe attains unbinding after the first eons heshe is classed as one unbound on arrival
If heshe attains unbinding anywhere from between the first day in that Pure Abode up through the first eons heshe is classed as one unbound in between
For a nonreturner appearing spontaneously in any of the higher Pure Abodes where the lifespans get progressively longer the same proportions would hold
This way of classifying these two categories however doesn't make much sense for two reasons
The sutta lists the categories in ascending order and there's little reason to class one who takes eons to attain unbinding higher than one who takes only eons to do so
The second category actually includes the first so there would seem to be little reason to distinguish them as two separate categories
It would make better sense to define the categories this way One who attains unbinding relatively soon after arriving in a Pure Abode is one unbound on arrival
One who attains unbinding after leaving the human realm but before reaching a Pure Abode would be one unbound in between

The training rules I tell you are not in vain
On one occasion the Blessed One was living in Vesālī in the Great Wood
Then a certain Vajjian monk approached him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord this recitation of more than training rules comes every fortnight
I cannot train in reference to them
Monk can you train in reference to the three trainings the training in heightened virtue the training in heightened mind the training in heightened discernment 
Yes lord I can train in reference to the three trainings the training in heightened virtue the training in heightened mind the training in heightened discernment
Then train in reference to those three trainings the training in heightened virtue the training in heightened mind the training in heightened discernment
As you train in heightened virtue heightened mind  heightened discernment your passion aversion  delusion  when trained in heightened virtue heightened mind  heightened discernment  will be abandoned
You  with the abandoning of passion the abandoning of aversion the abandoning of delusion  will not do anything unskillful or engage in any evil
Later on that monk trained in reference to heightened virtue heightened mind  heightened discernment
His passion aversion  delusion  when trained in heightened virtue heightened mind  heightened discernment were abandoned
He  with the abandoning of passion the abandoning of aversion the abandoning of delusion  did not do anything unskillful or engage in any evil
Monks it is just as if a donkey were following right after a herd of cattle saying I too am a cow
I too am a cow Its color is not that of a cow its voice is not that of a cow its hoof is not that of a cow and yet it still keeps following right after the herd of cattle saying I too am a cow
I too am a cow In the same way there is the case where a certain monk follows right after the community of monks saying I too am a monk
I too am a monk He doesn't have the other monks' desire for undertaking the training in heightened virtue doesn't have their desire for undertaking the training in heightened mind doesn't have their desire for undertaking the training in heightened discernment and yet he still keeps following right after the community of monks saying I too am a monk
I too am a monk
So you should train yourselves 'Strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened virtue strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened mind strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened discernment' That is how you should train yourselves
Then Ven
Ananda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Ananda every precept  practice every life every holy life that is followed as of essential worth is every one of them fruitful
Lord that is not with a categorical answer
In that case Ananda give an analytical answer
When  by following a life of precept  practice a life a holy life that is followed as of essential worth  one's unskillful mental qualities increase while one's skillful mental qualities decline that sort of precept  practice life holy life that is followed as of essential worth is fruitless
But when  by following a life of precept  practice a life a holy life that is followed as of essential worth  one's unskillful mental qualities decline while one's skillful mental qualities increase that sort of precept  practice life holy life that is followed as of essential worth is fruitful
That is what Ven
Ananda said and the Teacher approved
Then Ven
Ananda The Teacher approves of me got up from his seat and having bowed down to the Blessed One and circumambulating him left
Then not long after Ven
Ananda had left the Blessed One said to the monks Monks Ananda is still in training but it would not be easy to find his equal in discernment
Then Ven
Ananda went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord this word 'becoming becoming'  to what extent is there becoming
Ananda if there were no kamma ripening in the sensualityproperty would sensualitybecoming be discerned
No lord
Thus kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moisture
The intention  aspiration of living beings hindered by ignorance  fettered by craving is established intuned to a lower property
Thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future
If there were no kamma ripening in the formproperty would formbecoming be discerned
No lord
Thus kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moisture
The intention  aspiration of living beings hindered by ignorance  fettered by craving is established intuned to a middling property
Thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future
If there were no kamma ripening in the formlessproperty would formlessbecoming be discerned
No lord
Thus kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moisture
The intention  aspiration of living beings hindered by ignorance  fettered by craving is established intuned to a refined property
Thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future
This is how there is becoming

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then Channa the Wanderer went to Ven
Ananda and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven

An aversive person his mind bound up overcome with aversion wills for his own detriment wills for the detriment of others wills for the detriment of both

Seeing these drawbacks in delusion we advocate the abandoning of delusion
But is there my friend a path is there a way to the abandoning of that passion aversion  delusion
Yes my friend there is a path there is a way to the abandoning of that passion aversion  delusion
And what is that path my friend what is that way to the abandoning of that passion aversion  delusion
Just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration

It is an auspicious path my friend Ananda it is an auspicious way to the abandoning of that passion aversion  delusion  enough for the sake of heedfulness
Monks there are these three roots of what is unskillful
Which three
Greed is a root of what is unskillful aversion is a root of what is unskillful delusion is a root of what is unskillful
Greed itself is unskillful
Whatever a greedy person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is unskillful
Whatever suffering a greedy person  his mind overcome with greed his mind consumed  wrongly inflicts on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment 'I have power
I want power' that too is unskillful
Thus it is that many evil unskillful qualitiesevents  born of greed caused by greed originated through greed conditioned by greed  come into play
Aversion itself is unskillful
Whatever an aversive person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is unskillful
Whatever suffering an aversive person  his mind overcome with aversion his mind consumed  wrongly inflicts on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment 'I have power
I want power' that too is unskillful
Thus it is that many evil unskillful qualities  born of aversion caused by aversion originated through aversion conditioned by aversion  come into play
Delusion itself is unskillful
Whatever a deluded person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is unskillful
Whatever suffering a deluded person  his mind overcome with delusion his mind consumed  wrongly inflicts on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment 'I have power
I want power' that too is unskillful
Thus it is that many evil unskillful qualities  born of delusion caused by delusion originated through delusion conditioned by delusion  come into play
And a person like this is called one who speaks at the wrong time speaks what is unfactual speaks what is irrelevant speaks contrary to the Dhamma speaks contrary to the Vinaya
Why
Because of having wrongly inflicted suffering on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment 'I have power
I want power' When told what is factual he denies it and doesn't acknowledge it
When told what is unfactual he doesn't make an ardent effort to untangle it 'This is unfactual
This is baseless' That's why a person like this is called one who speaks at the wrong time speaks what is unfactual speaks what is irrelevant speaks contrary to the Dhamma speaks contrary to the Vinaya
A person like this  his mind overcome with evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion his mind consumed  dwells in suffering right in the herenow  feeling threatened turbulent feverish  and at the breakup of the body after death can expect a bad destination
Just as a sal tree a birch or an aspen when smothered  surrounded by three parasitic vines falls into misfortune falls into disaster falls into misfortune  disaster in the same way a person like this  his mind overcome with evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion his mind consumed  dwells in suffering right in the herenow  feeling threatened turbulent feverish  and at the breakup of the body after death can expect a bad destination
These are the three roots of what is unskillful
Now there are these three roots of what is skillful
Which three
Lack of greed is a root of what is skillful lack of aversion is a root of what is skillful lack of delusion is a root of what is skillful
Lack of greed itself is skillful
Whatever an ungreedy person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is skillful
Whatever suffering an ungreedy person  his mind not overcome with greed his mind not consumed  does not wrongly inflict on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment 'I have power
I want power' that too is skillful
Thus it is that many skillful qualities  born of lack of greed caused by lack of greed originated through lack of greed conditioned by lack of greed  come into play
Lack of aversion itself is skillful
Lack of delusion itself is skillful
Whatever an undeluded person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is skillful
Whatever suffering an undeluded person  his mind not overcome with delusion his mind not consumed  does not wrongly inflict on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment 'I have power
I want power' that too is skillful
Thus it is that many skillful qualities  born of lack of delusion caused by lack of delusion originated through lack of delusion conditioned by lack of delusion  come into play
And a person like this is called one who speaks at the right time speaks what is factual speaks what is relevant speaks in line with the Dhamma speaks in line with the Vinaya
Why
Because of not having wrongly inflicted suffering on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment 'I have power
I want power' When told what is factual he acknowledges it and does not deny it
When told what is unfactual he makes an ardent effort to untangle it 'This is unfactual
This is baseless' That's why a person like this is called one who speaks at the right time speaks what is factual speaks what is relevant speaks in line with the Dhamma speaks in line with the Vinaya
In a person like this evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
He dwells in ease right in the herenow  feeling unthreatened placid unfeverish  and is unbound right in the herenow
Just as if there were a sal tree a birch or an aspen smothered  surrounded by three parasitic vines
A man would come along carrying a spade  a basket
He would cut the vines at the root and having cut them at the root would dig around them
Having dug around them he would pull them out even down to the rootlets
He would cut the stalks of the vines
Having cut them he would slice them into splinters
Having sliced them into splinters he would pound them into bits
Having pounded them into bits he would dry them in the wind  sun
Having dried them in the wind  sun he would burn them in a fire
Having burned them in a fire he would reduce them to powdered ash
Having reduced them to powdered ash he would winnow them before a high wind or let them be washed away in a swiftflowing stream
In that way the parasitic vines would have their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
In the same way in a person like this evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
He dwells in ease right in the herenow  feeling unthreatened placid unfeverish  and is unbound right in the herenow
These are the three roots of what is skillful
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migara's mother
Now at that time  it being the Uposatha day  Visakha Migara's mother went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her Well now Visakha why are you coming in the middle of the day
Today I am observing the Uposatha lord
Visakha there are these three Uposathas
Which three
The Uposatha of a cowherd the Uposatha of the Jains and the Uposatha of the Noble Ones
And what is the Uposatha of a cowherd
Just as when a cowherd returns the cattle to their owners in the evening he reflects 'Today the cattle wandered to that spot and this drank at this spot and that tomorrow they will wander to that spot and this will drink at this spot and that' in the same way there is the case where a certain person observing the Uposatha reflects 'Today I ate this sort of nonstaple food and that sort of staple food
Tomorrow I will eat that sort of nonstaple food and this sort of staple food' He spends the day with an awareness imbued with that covetousness with that greed
Such is the Uposatha of a cowherd Visakha
When this Uposatha of a cowherd is undertaken it is not of great fruit or great benefit not of great glory or great radiance
And what is the Uposatha of the Jains
There are the contemplatives called the Niganthas
They get their disciple to undertake the following practice 'Here my good man
Lay down the rod with regard to beings who live more than leagues to the east more than leagues to the west more than leagues to the north more than leagues to the south' Thus they get the disciple to undertake kindness  sympathy to some beings but not to others
On the Uposatha day they get their disciple to undertake the following practice 'Here my good man
Having stripped off all your clothing say this I am nothing by anything or of anything
Thus there is nothing by anything or of anything that is mine' Yet in spite of that his parents know of him that 'This is our child' And he knows of them that 'These are my parents' His wives  children know of him that 'This is our husband  father' And he knows of them that 'These are my wives  children' His workers  slaves know of him that 'This is our master' And he knows of them that 'These are my workers  slaves' Thus at a time when he should be persuaded to undertake truthfulness he is persuaded to undertake falsehood
At the end of the night he resumes the consumption of his belongings even though they aren't given back to him
This counts as stealing I tell you
Such is the Uposatha of the Jains Visakha
When this Uposatha of the Jains is undertaken it is not of great fruit or great benefit not of great glory or great radiance
And what is the Uposatha of the Noble Ones
It is the cleansing of the defiled mind through the proper technique

There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones recollects the devas thus 'There are the Devas of the Four Great Kings the Devas of the Thirtythree the Yama Devas the Contented Devas the devas who delight in creation the devas who have power over the creations of others the devas of Brahma's retinue the devas beyond them
Whatever conviction they were endowed with that  when falling away from this life  they rearose there the same sort of conviction is present in me as well

Furthermore the disciple of the noble ones reflects thus 'As long as they live the arahants  abandoning the taking of life  abstain from the taking of life
They dwell with their rod laid down their knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Today I too for this day  night  abandoning the taking of life  abstain from the taking of life
I dwell with my rod laid down my knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
By means of this factor I emulate the arahants and my Uposatha will be observed
'As long as they live the arahants  abandoning the taking of what is not given  abstain from taking what is not given
They take only what is given accept only what is given live not by stealing but by means of a self that has become pure
Today I too for this day  night  abandoning the taking of what is not given  abstain from taking what is not given
I take only what is given accept only what is given live not by stealing but by means of a self that has become pure

Such is the Uposatha of the Noble Ones Visakha
When this Uposatha of the Noble Ones is undertaken it is of great fruit  great benefit of great glory  great radiance

Suppose that one were to exercise kingship rule  sovereignty over these sixteen great lands replete with the seven treasures ie over the Angas Maghadans Kasis Kosalans Vajjians Mallas Cetis Vansans Kurus Pañcalas Macchas Surasenas Assakas Avantis Gandharans  Kambojans It would not be worth onesixteenth of this Uposatha endowed with eight factors
Why is that
Kingship over human beings is a meager thing when compared with heavenly bliss
Fifty human years are equal to one day  night among the Devas of the Four Great Kings
Thirty such days  nights make a month
Twelve such months make a year
Five hundred such heavenly years constitute the lifespan among the Devas of the Four Great Kings
Now it is possible that a certain man or woman  from having observed this Uposatha endowed with eight factors  on the breakup of the body after death might be reborn among the Devas of the Four Great Kings
It was in reference to this that it was said 'Kingship over human beings is a meager thing when compared with heavenly bliss'
A human century is equal to one day  night among the Devas of the ThirtyThree
Thirty such days  nights make a month One thousand such heavenly years constitute the lifespan among the Devas of the Thirtythree
Now it is possible that a certain man or woman  from having observed this Uposatha endowed with eight factors  on the breakup of the body after death might be reborn among the Devas of the Thirtythree
It was in reference to this that it was said 'Kingship over human beings is a meager thing when compared with heavenly bliss'
Two human centuries are equal to one day  night among the Yama Devas Two thousand such heavenly years constitute the lifespan among the Yama Devas
Four human centuries are equal to one day  night among the Contented Devas Four thousand such heavenly years constitute the lifespan among the Contented Devas
Eight human centuries is equal to one day  night among the devas who delight in creation Eight thousand such heavenly years constitute the lifespan among the devas who delight in creation
Sixteen human centuries are equal to one day  night among the devas who have power over the creations of others
Thirty such days  nights make a month
Twelve such months make a year
Sixteen thousand such heavenly years constitute the lifespan among the devas who have power over the creations of others
Now it is possible that a certain man or woman  from having observed this Uposatha endowed with eight factors  on the breakup of the body after death might be reborn among the devas who have power over the creations of others
It was in reference to this that it was said 'Kingship over human beings is a meager thing when compared with heavenly bliss'
I have heard that on one occasion Ven
Ananda was staying in Kosambi at Ghosita's monastery
Then a certain householder a disciple of the Fatalists went to him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Ananda Among us sir whose Dhamma is welltaught
Who has practiced well in this world
Who in the world is wellgone
In that case householder I will question you in return
Answer as you see fit
Now what do you think those who teach a Dhamma for the abandoning of passion for the abandoning of aversion for the abandoning of delusion  is their Dhamma welltaught or not
Or how does this strike you
Sir those who teach a Dhamma for the abandoning of passion for the abandoning of aversion for the abandoning of delusion  their Dhamma is welltaught
That's how it strikes me
And what do you think householder those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion for the abandoning of aversion for the abandoning of delusion  have they practiced well in this world or not
Or how does this strike you
Sir those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion for the abandoning of aversion for the abandoning of delusion  they have practiced well in this world
That's how it strikes me
And what do you think householder those whose passion is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising those whose aversion is abandoned whose delusion is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising are they in this world wellgone or not
Or how does this strike you
Sir those whose passion aversion delusion is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising they in this world are wellgone
That's how it strikes me
In this way householder you have answered yourself 'Those who teach a Dhamma for the abandoning of passion for the abandoning of aversion for the abandoning of delusion  their Dhamma is welltaught
Those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion for the abandoning of aversion for the abandoning of delusion  they have practiced well in this world
Those whose passion aversion delusion is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising they in this world are wellgone' How amazing sir
How astounding that there is neither extolling of one's own Dhamma nor deprecation of another's but just the teaching of the Dhamma in its proper sphere speaking to the point without mentioning oneself
You venerable sir teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of passion aversion delusion
Your Dhamma is welltaught
You have practiced for the abandoning of passion aversion delusion
You have practiced well in this world
Your passion aversion delusion is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
You in this world are wellgone
Magnificent Master Ananda
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Ananda  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Buddha for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
May Master Ananda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life
Uposatha days are times of renewed dedication to Dhamma practice observed by lay followers and monastics throughout the world of Theravada Buddhism
For monastics these are often days of more intensive reflection and meditation
In many monasteries physical labor is curtailed
On New Moon and Full Moon days the fortnightly confession and recitation of the Bhikkhu Patimokkha takes place
Lay people observe the Eight Precepts on Uposatha days as a support for meditation practice and as a way to reenergize commitment to the Dhamma
Whenever possible lay people use these days as an opportunity to visit the local monastery in order to make special offerings to the Sangha to listen to Dhamma and to practice meditation with Dhamma companions late into the night
For those not closely affiliated with a local monastery it can simply be an opportunity to step up one's efforts in meditation while drawing on the invisible support of millions of other practicing Buddhists around the world
The calendar of Uposatha days is calculated using a complex traditional formula that is loosely based on the lunar calendar with the result that the dates do not always coincide with the actual astronomical dates
To further complicate matters each sect within Theravada Buddhism tends to follow a slightly different calendar
Several fullmoon Uposatha days hold special significance in the Buddhist calendar
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park
Now at that time the Blessed One had just recovered from being ill was not long recovered from his illness
Then Mahanama the Sakyan went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One For a long time I have known the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One that 'There is knowledge for one who is concentrated not for one who is not concentrated' Now does concentration come first and knowledge after or does knowledge come first and concentration after
Then the thought occurred to Ven
Ananda Here the Blessed One has just recovered from being ill is not long recovered from his illness and yet Mahanama the Sakyan asks him this very deep question
What if I were to take Mahanama the Sakyan to one side and teach him the Dhamma So Ven
Ananda taking Mahanama the Sakyan by the arm led him to one side and said to him Mahanama the Blessed One has talked both of the virtue of one who is in training and of the virtue of one whose training is complete
He has talked both of the concentration of one who is in training and of the concentration of one whose training is complete
He has talked both of the discernment of one who is in training and of the discernment of one whose training is complete
And what is the virtue of one who is in training
There is the case where a monk is virtuous
He dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in his behavior  sphere of activity
He trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest fault
This is called the virtue of one who is in training
And what is the concentration of one who is in training
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is called the concentration of one who is in training
And what is the discernment of one who is in training
There is the case where a monk discerns as it actually is that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' This is called the discernment of one who is in training
Then there is the disciple of the noble ones  thus consummate in virtue thus consummate in concentration thus consummate in discernment  who through the ending of the mental fermentations enters  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having known  made them manifest for himself right in the here  now
In this way Mahanama the Blessed One has talked both of the virtue of one who is in training and of the virtue of one whose training is complete
He has talked both of the concentration of one who is in training and of the concentration of one whose training is complete
He has talked both of the discernment of one who is in training and of the discernment of one whose training is complete
Monks if you are asked by wanderers of other sects 'Friends there are these three qualities
Which three
Passion aversion  delusion
These are the three qualities
Now what is the difference what the distinction what the distinguishing factor among these three qualities'  when thus asked how would you answer those wanderers of other sects
For us lord the teachings have the Blessed One as their root their guide  their arbitrator
It would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statement
Having heard it from the Blessed One the monks will remember it
In that case monks listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said Monks if you are asked by wanderers of other sects 'Friends there are these three qualities
Which three
Passion aversion  delusion
These are the three qualities
Now what is the difference what the distinction what the distinguishing factor among these three qualities'  when thus asked you should answer those wanderers of other sects in this way 'Friends passion carries little blame and is slow to fade
Aversion carries great blame and is quick to fade
Delusion carries great blame and is slow to fade
 'But what friends is the reason what the cause why unarisen passion arises or arisen passion tends to growth  abundance' 'The theme of the attractive' it should be said
'For one who attends inappropriately to the theme of the attractive unarisen passion arises and arisen passion tends to growth  abundance'
 'But what friends is the reason what the cause why unarisen aversion arises or arisen aversion tends to growth  abundance' 'The theme of irritation' it should be said
'For one who attends inappropriately to the theme of irritation unarisen aversion arises and arisen aversion tends to growth  abundance'
 'But what friends is the reason what the cause why unarisen delusion arises or arisen delusion tends to growth  abundance' 'Inappropriate attention' it should be said
'For one who attends inappropriately unarisen delusion arises and arisen delusion tends to growth  abundance'
 'But what friends is the reason what the cause why unarisen passion does not arise or arisen passion is abandoned' 'The theme of the unattractive' it should be said
'For one who attends appropriately to the theme of the unattractive unarisen passion does not arise and arisen passion is abandoned'
 'But what friends is the reason what the cause why unarisen aversion does not arise or arisen aversion is abandoned' 'Good will as an awarenessrelease' it should be said
'For one who attends appropriately to good will as an awarenessrelease unarisen aversion does not arise and arisen aversion is abandoned'
 'But what friends is the reason what the cause why unarisen delusion does not arise or arisen delusion is abandoned' 'Appropriate attention' it should be said
'For one who attends appropriately unarisen delusion does not arise and arisen delusion is abandoned
This is the reason this the cause why unarisen delusion does not arise and arisen delusion is abandoned'
Monks there are these three topics for discussion
Which three
One may talk about the past saying 'Thus it was in the past' One may talk about the future saying 'Thus it will be in the future' Or one may talk about now in the present saying 'Thus it is now in the present'
Monks it's through his way of participating in a discussion that a person can be known as fit to talk with or unfit to talk with
If a person when asked a question doesn't give a categorical answer to a question deserving a categorical answer doesn't give an analytical answer to a question deserving an analytical answer doesn't give a counterquestion to a question deserving a counterquestion doesn't put aside a question deserving to be put aside then  that being the case  he is a person unfit to talk with

If a person when asked a question puts down crushes him ridicules him grasps at his little mistakes then  that being the case  he is a person unfit to talk with
But if a person when asked a question doesn't put down doesn't crush him doesn't ridicule him doesn't grasp at his little mistakes then  that being the case  he is a person fit to talk with
Monks it's through his way of participating in a discussion that a person can be known as drawing near or not drawing near
One who lends ear draws near one who doesn't lend ear doesn't draw near
Drawing near one clearly knows one quality comprehends one quality abandons one quality and realizes one quality
Clearly knowing one quality comprehending one quality abandoning one quality and realizing one quality one touches right release
For that's the purpose of discussion that's the purpose of counsel that's the purpose of drawing near that's the purpose of lending ear ie the liberation of the mind through no clinging
Thus I heard
On one occasion the venerable Nandaka was living at Savatthi in the Eastern Monastery Migara's Mother's Palace
Then Migara's grandson Salha and Pekhuniya's grandson Rohana went to the venerable Nandaka and after salutation they sat down at one side
When they had done so the venerable Nandaka said to Migara's grandson Salha
Come Salha do not be satisfied with hearsay or with tradition or with legendary lore or with what has come down in scriptures or with conjecture or with logical inference or with weighing evidence or with a liking for a view after pondering it or with someone else's ability or with the thought 'The monk is our teacher' When you know in yourself 'These things are unprofitable liable to censure condemned by the wise being adopted and put into effect they lead to harm and suffering' then you should abandon them
What do you think
Is there greed  Yes venerable sir  Covetousness is the meaning of that I say
Through greed a covetous man kills breathing things takes what is not given commits adultery and utters falsehood and he gets another to do likewise
Will that be long for his harm and suffering  Yes venerable sir  What do you think is there hate  Yes venerable sir  Illwill is the meaning of that I say
Through hate a malevolent man kills breathing things Will that be long for his harm and suffering  Yes venerable sir  What do you think
Is there delusion  Yes venerable sir  Ignorance is the meaning of that I say
Through ignorance a deluded man kills breathing things Will that be long for his harm and suffering  Yes venerable sir
What do you think
Are these things profitable or unprofitable  Unprofitable venerable sir  Reprehensible or blameless  Reprehensible venerable sir  Condemned or commended by the wise  Condemned by the wise venerable sir  Being adopted and put into effect do they lead to harm and suffering or do they not or how does it appear to you in this case  Being adopted and put into effect venerable sir they lead to harm and suffering
So it appears in this case  Now that was the reason why I told you 'Come Salha do not be satisfied with hearsay When you know in yourself These things are unprofitable then you should abandon them'
Come Salha do not be satisfied with hearsay or with the thought 'The monk is our teacher' When you know in yourself 'These things are profitable blameless commended by the wise being adopted and put into effect they lead to welfare and happiness' then you should practice them and abide in them
What do you think
Is there nongreed  Yes venerable sir  Uncovetousness is the meaning of that I say
Through nongreed an uncovetous man does not kill breathing things or take what is not given or commit adultery or utter falsehood and he gets another to do likewise
Will that be long for his welfare and happiness  Yes venerable sir  What do you think
Is there nonhate  Yes venerable sir  Non illwill is the meaning of that I say
Through non illwill an unmalevolent man does not kill breathing things Will that be long for his welfare and happiness  Yes venerable sir  What do you think
Is there nondelusion  Yes venerable sir  True knowledge is the meaning of that I say
Through nondelusion a man with true knowledge does not kill breathing things Will that be long for his welfare and happiness  Yes venerable sir
What do you think
Are these things profitable or unprofitable  Profitable venerable sir  Reprehensible or blameless  Blameless venerable sir  Condemned or commended by the wise  Commended by the wise venerable sir  Being adopted and put into effect do they lead to welfare and happiness or do they not or how does it appear to you in this case  Being adopted and put into effect venerable sir they lead to welfare and happiness
So it appears to us in this case  Now that was the reason why I told you 'Come Salha do not be satisfied with hearsay when you know in yourself These things are profitable then you should practice them and abide in them'
Now a disciple who is ennobled who has rid himself in this way of covetousness and illwill and is undeluded abides with his heart imbued with lovingkindness extending over one quarter likewise the second quarter likewise the third quarter likewise the fourth quarter and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides with his heart abundant exalted measureless in lovingkindness without hostility or illwill extending over the allencompassing world
He abides with his heart imbued with compassion gladness equanimity extending over the allencompassing world
Now he understands this state of contemplation in this way 'There is this
There is what has been abandoned
There is a superior goal
And there is an ultimate escape from this whole field of perception'
When he knows and sees in this way his heart is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignorance
When liberated there comes thereafter the knowledge that it is liberated
He knows that birth is ended that the Divine Life has been lived out that what had to be done is done and that there is no more of this to come
He understands thus 'Formerly there was greed which was bad and now there is none which is good
Formerly there was hate which was bad and now there is none which is good
Formerly there was delusion which was bad and now there is none which is good' So here and now in this very life he is parched no more his fires of greed hate and delusion are extinguished and cooled out experiencing bliss he abides divinely pure in himself
Monks uneducated runofthemill people describe three things as motherchildseparating dangers
Which three
There comes a time when a great fireconflagration breaks out
When a great fireconflagration breaks out it burns villages towns  cities
When it is burning villages towns  cities a mother there can't get to her child and the child can't get to its mother
This is the first thing that uneducated runofthemill people describe as a motherchildseparating danger
Then again there comes a time when a great cloud arises
When a great cloud arises a great flood of water is produced
When a great flood of water is produced it floods villages towns  cities
When it is flooding villages towns  cities a mother there can't get to her child and the child can't get to its mother

The danger of aging the danger of illness the danger of death
A mother can't get with regard to her child who is aging 'I am aging but may my child not age' A child can't get with regard to its mother who is aging 'I am aging but may my mother not age'
A mother can't get with regard to her child who is growing ill 'I am growing ill but may my child not grow ill' A child can't get with regard to its mother who is growing ill 'I am growing ill but may my mother not grow ill'
A mother can't get with regard to her child who is dying 'I am dying but may my child not die' A child can't get with regard to its mother who is dying 'I am dying but may my mother not die'
These are the three things that are motherchildseparating dangers
There is a path there is a practice that leads to the abandoning and overcoming of these three motherchilduniting dangers and these three motherchildseparating dangers
And which is that path which is that practice
Just this very noble eightfold path ie right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration

I heard thus
Once the Blessed One while wandering in the Kosala country with a large community of bhikkhus entered a town of the Kalama people called Kesaputta
The Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta Reverend Gotama the monk the son of the Sakyans has while wandering in the Kosala country entered Kesaputta
The good repute of the Reverend Gotama has been spread in this way Indeed the Blessed One is thus consummate fully enlightened endowed with knowledge and practice sublime knower of the worlds peerless guide of tamable men teacher of divine and human beings which he by himself has through direct knowledge understood clearly
He set forth the Dhamma good in the beginning good in the middle good in the end possessed of meaning and the letter and complete in everything and he proclaims the holy life that is perfectly pure
Seeing such consummate ones is good indeed
Then the Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta went to where the Blessed One was
On arriving there some paid homage to him and sat down on one side some exchanged greetings with him and after the ending of cordial memorable talk sat down on one side some saluted him raising their joined palms and sat down on one side some announced their name and family and sat down on one side some without speaking sat down on one side
The Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta sitting on one side said to the Blessed One There are some monks and brahmans venerable sir who visit Kesaputta
They expound and explain only their own doctrines the doctrines of others they despise revile and pull to pieces
Some other monks and brahmans too venerable sir come to Kesaputta
They also expound and explain only their own doctrines the doctrines of others they despise revile and pull to pieces
Venerable sir there is doubt there is uncertainty in us concerning them
Which of these reverend monks and brahmans spoke the truth and which falsehood
It is proper for you Kalamas to doubt to be uncertain uncertainty has arisen in you about what is doubtful

A person is a thief unchaste a liar a divisive speaker a harsh speaker an idle chatterer greedy malicious a holder of wrong views because of what was done in the past' When one falls back on what was done in the past as being essential monks there is no desire no effort 'This should be done

Sustained byclinging to the six properties there is an alighting of an embryo
There being an alighting there is nameform
From nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media
From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling
To one experiencing feeling I declare 'This is stress' I declare 'This is the origination of stress' I declare 'This is the cessation of stress' I declare 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress'
And what is the noble truth of stress
Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with what is not loved is stressful separation from what is loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful
In short the five clingingaggregates are stressful
This is called the noble truth of stress
And what is the noble truth of the origination of stress
From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications
From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform
From nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media
From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling

From birth as a requisite condition then old age  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress  suffering
This is called the noble truth of the origination of stress
And what is the noble truth of the cessation of stress
From the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications
From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness
From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameform
From the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of the six sense media

From the cessation of birth then old age  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress  suffering
This is called the noble truth of the cessation of stress
And what is the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress
Just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
This is called the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress
' There are these four noble truths is a Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted undefiled blameless not faulted by knowledgeable brahmans  contemplatives' Thus was it said
And in reference to this was it said
Translator's note Although this discourse is often cited as the Buddha's carte blanche for following one's own sense of right and wrong it actually says something much more rigorous than that
Traditions are not to be followed simply because they are traditions
Reports are not to be followed simply because the source seems reliable
One's own preferences are not to be followed simply because they seem logical or resonate with one's feelings
Instead any view or belief must be tested by the results it yields when put into practice and  to guard against the possibility of any bias or limitations in one's understanding of those results  they must further be checked against the experience of people who are wise
The ability to question and test one's beliefs in an appropriate way is called appropriate attention
The ability to recognize and choose wise people as mentors is called having admirable friends
According to Iti  these are respectively the most important internal and external factors for attaining the goal of the practice
For further thoughts on how to test a belief in practice see MN MN AN and AN
For thoughts on how to judge whether another person is wise see MN AN and AN
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks arrived at Kesaputta a town of the Kalamas
The Kalamas of Kesaputta heard it said Gotama the contemplative  the son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clan  has arrived at Kesaputta
And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread 'He is indeed a Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessed
He has made known  having realized it through direct knowledge  this world with its devas maras  brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their rulers  common people has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
It is good to see such a worthy one' So the Kalamas of Kesaputta went to the Blessed One
On arrival some of them bowed down to him and sat to one side
Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one side
Some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palmtopalm over their hearts
Some of them sat to one side having announced their name  clan
Some of them sat to one side in silence
As they sat there the Kalamas of Kesaputta said to the Blessed One Lord there are some brahmans  contemplatives who come to Kesaputta
They expound  glorify their own doctrines but as for the doctrines of others they deprecate them revile them show contempt for them  disparage them
And then other brahmans  contemplatives come to Kesaputta
They expound  glorify their own doctrines but as for the doctrines of others they deprecate them revile them show contempt for them  disparage them
They leave us absolutely uncertain  in doubt Which of these venerable brahmans  contemplatives are speaking the truth and which ones are lying
Of course you are uncertain Kalamas
Of course you are in doubt
When there are reasons for doubt uncertainty is born
So in this case Kalamas don't go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought 'This contemplative is our teacher' When you know for yourselves that 'These qualities are unskillful these qualities are blameworthy these qualities are criticized by the wise these qualities when adopted  carried out lead to harm  to suffering'  then you should abandon them
What do you think Kalamas
When greed arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm
For harm lord
And this greedy person overcome by greed his mind possessed by greed kills living beings takes what is not given goes after another person's wife tells lies and induces others to do likewise all of which is for longterm harm  suffering
Yes lord
Now what do you think Kalamas
When aversion arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm
For harm lord
And this aversive person overcome by aversion his mind possessed by aversion kills living beings takes what is not given goes after another person's wife tells lies and induces others to do likewise all of which is for longterm harm  suffering
Yes lord
Now what do you think Kalamas
When delusion arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm
For harm lord
And this deluded person overcome by delusion his mind possessed by delusion kills living beings takes what is not given goes after another person's wife tells lies and induces others to do likewise all of which is for longterm harm  suffering
Yes lord
So what do you think Kalamas Are these qualities skillful or unskillful
Unskillful lord
Blameworthy or blameless
Blameworthy lord
Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise
Criticized by the wise lord
When adopted  carried out do they lead to harm  to suffering or not
When adopted  carried out they lead to harm  to suffering
That is how it appears to us
So as I said Kalamas 'Don't go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought This contemplative is our teacher When you know for yourselves that These qualities are unskillful these qualities are blameworthy these qualities are criticized by the wise these qualities when adopted  carried out lead to harm  to suffering  then you should abandon them' Thus was it said
And in reference to this was it said
Now Kalamas don't go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought 'This contemplative is our teacher' When you know for yourselves that 'These qualities are skillful these qualities are blameless these qualities are praised by the wise these qualities when adopted  carried out lead to welfare  to happiness'  then you should enter  remain in them
What do you think Kalamas
When lack of greed arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm
For welfare lord
And this ungreedy person not overcome by greed his mind not possessed by greed doesn't kill living beings take what is not given go after another person's wife tell lies or induce others to do likewise all of which is for longterm welfare  happiness
Yes lord
What do you think Kalamas
When lack of aversion arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm
For welfare lord
And this unaversive person not overcome by aversion his mind not possessed by aversion doesn't kill living beings take what is not given go after another person's wife tell lies or induce others to do likewise all of which is for longterm welfare  happiness

For welfare lord
And this undeluded person not overcome by delusion his mind not possessed by delusion doesn't kill living beings take what is not given go after another person's wife tell lies or induce others to do likewise all of which is for longterm welfare  happiness
Yes lord

Skillful lord
Blameworthy or blameless
Blameless lord
Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise
Praised by the wise lord
When adopted  carried out do they lead to welfare  to happiness or not

And in reference to this was it said
Now Kalamas one who is a disciple of the noble ones  thus devoid of greed devoid of ill will undeluded alert  resolute  keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with good will
Thus he keeps pervading above below  all around everywhere  in every respect the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will

Now Kalamas one who is a disciple of the noble ones  his mind thus free from hostility free from ill will undefiled  pure  acquires four assurances in the herenow
'If there is a world after death if there is the fruit of actions rightly  wrongly done then this is the basis by which with the breakup of the body after death I will reappear in a good destination the heavenly world' This is the first assurance he acquires
'But if there is no world after death if there is no fruit of actions rightly  wrongly done then here in the present life I look after myself with ease  free from hostility free from ill will free from trouble' This is the second assurance he acquires
'If evil is done through acting still I have willed no evil for anyone
Having done no evil action from where will suffering touch me' This is the third assurance he acquires
'But if no evil is done through acting then I can assume myself pure in both respects' This is the fourth assurance he acquires
One who is a disciple of the noble ones  his mind thus free from hostility free from ill will undefiled  pure  acquires these four assurances in the herenow

Having done no evil action from where will suffering touch me' This is the third assurance he acquires
'But if no evil is done through acting then I can assume myself pure in both ways' This is the fourth assurance he acquires
One who is a disciple of the noble ones  his mind thus free from hostility free from ill will undefiled  pure  acquires these four assurances in the herenow
Magnificent lord
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
We go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks
May the Blessed One remember us as lay followers who have gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life

Now suppose that not far from a village or town there were a dense forest grove and there in the grove was a tree with delicious fruit abundant fruit but with no fruit fallen to the ground

Why don't I climb the tree eat what I like and fill my clothes with the fruit' So having climbed the tree he would eat what he liked and fill his clothes with the fruit
Then a second man would come along desiring fruit looking for fruit searching for fruit and carrying a sharp ax
Plunging into the forest grove he would see the tree and the thought would occur to him 'This is a tree with delicious fruit abundant fruit and there is no fruit fallen to the ground and I don't know how to climb a tree
Why don't I chop down this tree at the root eat what I like and fill my clothes with the fruit' So he would chop the tree at the root

Now when the disciple of the noble ones has arrived at this purity of equanimity  mindfulness he recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there

On one occasion Ven
Ananda was staying near Vesali at Veluvagamaka
Now on that occasion Dasama the householder from Atthakanagara had arrived at Pataliputta on some business
Then he went to a certain monk at Kukkata Monastery and on arrival said to him Where is Ven
Ananda staying now
I'd like to see him
Householder the Ven
Ananda is staying near Vesali at Veluvagamaka
Then Dasama the householder from Atthakanagara on completing his business at Pataliputta went to Ven
Ananda at Veluvagamaka near Vesali
On arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Ananda Venerable sir is there a single quality declared by the Blessed One  the one who knows the one who sees worthy  rightly selfawakened  where the unreleased mind of a monk who dwells there heedful ardent  resolute becomes released or his unended fermentations go to their total ending or he attains the unexcelled security from the yoke that he had not attained before
Yes householder there is And what is that one quality venerable sir
There is the case householder where a monk withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He reflects on this and discerns 'This first jhana is fabricated  intended
Now whatever is fabricated  intended is inconstant  subject to cessation' Staying right there he reaches the ending of the mental fermentations
Or if not then  through this very Dhammapassion this Dhammadelight and from the total wasting away of the first five Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world
This householder is a single quality declared by the Blessed One  the one who knows the one who sees worthy  rightly selfawakened  where the unreleased mind of a monk who dwells there heedful ardent  resolute becomes released or his unended fermentations go to their total ending or he attains the unexcelled security from the yoke that he had not attained before
Then again a monk keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will
He reflects on this and discerns 'This awarenessrelease through good will is fabricated  intended
Now whatever is fabricated  intended is inconstant  subject to cessation' Staying right there he reaches the ending of the mental fermentations

Then again a monk  with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space'  enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
He reflects on this and discerns 'This attainment of the infinitude of space is fabricated  intended

When this was said Dasama the householder from Atthakanagara said to Ven
Ananda Venerable Ananda just as if a man seeking a single opening onto treasure were all at once to come upon eleven openings onto treasure in the same way I  seeking a single doorway to the Deathless  have all at once come to hear of eleven doorways to the Deathless
And just as if a man whose house had eleven doors could take himself to safety by means of any one of those doors in the same way I can take myself to safety by means of any one of these eleven doors to the Deathless
Venerable sir when sectarians search for a teacher's fee for their teachers why shouldn't I pay homage to Ven
Ananda
So Dasama the householder from Atthakanagara having assembled the community of monks from Vesali and Pataliputta with his own hands served  satisfied them with refined staple  nonstaple foods
He presented a pair of cloths to each monk and a triple robe to Ven
Ananda
And for Ven
Ananda he had a dwelling built worth five hundred

Translator's note The Buddha praised Dhammadinna the nun as the foremost Dhamma teacher among his nun disciples
In this discourse she answers questions put to her by a layman  Visakha  who according to the commentary was her former husband a merchant of Rajagaha and a nonreturner
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Sanctuary
Then Visakha the lay follower went to Dhammadinna the nun and on arrival having bowed down to her sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to her 'Selfidentification selfidentification' it is said lady
Which selfidentification is described by the Blessed One
There are these five clingingaggregates friend Visakha form as a clingingaggregate feeling as a clingingaggregate perception as a clingingaggregate fabrications as a clingingaggregate consciousness as a clingingaggregate
These five clingingaggregates are the selfidentification described by the Blessed One
Saying Yes lady Visakha the lay follower delighted  rejoiced in what Dhammadinna the nun had said
Then he asked her a further question 'The origination of selfidentification the origination of selfidentification' it is said lady
Which origination of selfidentification is described by the Blessed One
The craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming This friend Visakha is the origination of selfidentification described by the Blessed One
'The cessation of selfidentification the cessation of selfidentification' it is said lady
Which cessation of selfidentification is described by the Blessed One
The remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very craving This friend Visakha is the cessation of selfidentification described by the Blessed One
'The way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentification the way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentification' it is said lady
Which way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentification is described by the Blessed One
Precisely this noble eightfold path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration This friend Visakha is the way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentification described by the Blessed One
Is it the case lady that clinging is the same thing as the five clingingaggregates or is it something separate
Friend Visakha neither is clinging the same thing as the five clingingaggregates nor is it something separate
Whatever desire  passion there is with regard to the five clingingaggregates that is the clinging there
But lady how does selfidentification come about
There is the case friend Visakha where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He assumes feeling to be the self
He assumes perception to be the self
He assumes fabrications to be the self
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
This is how selfidentification comes about
But lady how does selfidentification not come about
There is the case where a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He does not assume feeling to be the self
He does not assume perception to be the self
He does not assume fabrications to be the self
He does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
This is how selfidentification does not come about
Now again lady what is the noble eightfold path
This is the noble eightfold path friend Visakha right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
Is the noble eightfold path fabricated or unfabricated
The noble eightfold path is fabricated
And are the three aggregates included under the noble eightfold path lady or is the noble eightfold path included under the three aggregates
The three aggregates are not included under the noble eightfold path friend Visakha but the noble eightfold path is included under the three aggregates
Right speech right action  right livelihood come under the aggregate of virtue
Right effort right mindfulness  right concentration come under the aggregate of concentration
Right view  right resolve come under the aggregate of discernment
Now what is concentration lady what qualities are its themes what qualities are its requisites and what is its development
Singleness of mind is concentration friend Visakha the four frames of reference are its themes the four right exertions are its requisites and any cultivation development  pursuit of these qualities is its development
Now lady what are fabrications
These three fabrications friend Visakha bodily fabrications verbal fabrications  mental fabrications
But what are bodily fabrications
What are verbal fabrications
What are mental fabrications
Inout breaths are bodily fabrications
Directed thought  evaluation are verbal fabrications
Perceptions  feelings are mental fabrications
But why are inout breaths bodily fabrications
Why are directed thought  evaluation verbal fabrications
Why are perceptions  feelings mental fabrications
Inout breaths are bodily these are things tied up with the body
That's why inout breaths are bodily fabrications
Having first directed one's thoughts and made an evaluation one then breaks out into speech
That's why directed thought  evaluation are verbal fabrications
Perceptions  feelings are mental these are things tied up with the mind
That's why perceptions  feelings are mental fabrications
Now lady how does the attainment of the cessation of perception  feeling come about
The thought does not occur to a monk as he is attaining the cessation of perception  feeling that 'I am about to attain the cessation of perception  feeling' or that 'I am attaining the cessation of perception  feeling' or that 'I have attained the cessation of perception  feeling' Instead the way his mind has previously been developed leads him to that state
But when a monk is attaining the cessation of perception  feeling which things cease first bodily fabrications verbal fabrications or mental fabrications
When a monk is attaining the cessation of perception  feeling friend Visakha verbal fabrications cease first then bodily fabrications then mental fabrications
Now lady how does emergence from the cessation of perception  feeling come about
The thought does not occur to a monk as he is emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling that 'I am about to emerge from the cessation of perception  feeling' or that 'I am emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling' or that 'I have emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling' Instead the way his mind has previously been developed leads him to that state
But when a monk is emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling which things arise first bodily fabrications verbal fabrications or mental fabrications
When a monk is emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling friend Visakha mental fabrications arise first then bodily fabrications then verbal fabrications
When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling lady how many contacts make contact
When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling friend Visakha three contacts make contact contact with emptiness contact with the signless  contact with the undirected
When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling lady to what does his mind lean to what does it tend to what does it incline
When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling friend Visakha his mind leans to seclusion tends to seclusion inclines to seclusion
Now lady how many kinds of feeling are there
These three kinds of feeling pleasant feeling painful feeling  neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
What is pleasant feeling
What is painful feeling
What is neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
Whatever is experienced physically or mentally as pleasant  gratifying is pleasant feeling
Whatever is experienced physically or mentally as painful  hurting is painful feeling
Whatever is experienced physically or mentally as neither gratifying nor hurting is neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
In what way is pleasant feeling pleasant lady and in what way painful
Pleasant feeling is pleasant in remaining  painful in changing friend Visakha
Painful feeling is painful in remaining  pleasant in changing
Neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling is pleasant in occurring together with knowledge and painful in occurring without knowledge
What obsession gets obsessed with pleasant feeling
What obsession gets obsessed with painful feeling
What obsession gets obsessed with neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
Passionobsession gets obsessed with pleasant feeling
Resistanceobsession gets obsessed with painful feeling
Ignoranceobsession gets obsessed with neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
Does passionobsession get obsessed with all pleasant feeling
Does resistanceobsession get obsessed with all painful feeling
Does ignoranceobsession get obsessed with all neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
No But what is to be abandoned with regard to pleasant feeling
What is to be abandoned with regard to painful feeling
What is to be abandoned with regard to neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
Passionobsession is to be abandoned with regard to pleasant feeling
Resistanceobsession is to be abandoned with regard to painful feeling
Ignoranceobsession is to be abandoned with regard to neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
Is passionobsession to be abandoned with regard to all pleasant feeling
Is resistanceobsession to be abandoned with regard to all painful feeling
Is ignoranceobsession to be abandoned with regard to all neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
No There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With that he abandons passion
No passionobsession gets obsessed there
There is the case where a monk considers 'O when will I enter  remain in the dimension that those who are noble now enter  remain in' And as he thus nurses this yearning for the unexcelled liberations there arises within him sorrow based on that yearning
With that he abandons resistance
No resistanceobsession gets obsessed there
There is the case where a monk with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
With that he abandons ignorance
No ignoranceobsession gets obsessed there
Now what lady lies on the other side of pleasant feeling
Passion lies on the other side of pleasant feeling
And what lies on the other side of painful feeling
Resistance lies on the other side of painful feeling 
What lies on the other side of neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
Ignorance lies on the other side of neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling
What lies on the other side of ignorance
Clear knowing lies on the other side of ignorance
What lies on the other side of clear knowing
Release lies on the other side of clear knowing
What lies on the other side of release
Unbinding lies on the other side of release
What lies on the other side of Unbinding
You've gone too far friend Visakha
You can't keep holding on up to the limit of questions
For the holy life gains a footing in Unbinding culminates in Unbinding has Unbinding as its final end
If you wish go to the Blessed One and ask him the meaning of these things
Whatever he says that's how you should remember it
Then Visakha the lay follower delighting  rejoicing in what Dhammadinna the nun had said bowed down to her and keeping her to his right went to the Blessed One
On arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he told the Blessed One the full extent of the conversation he had had with Dhammadinna the nun
When this was said the Blessed One said to him Dhammadinna the nun is wise Visakha a woman of great discernment
If you had asked me those things I would have answered you in the same way she did
That is the meaning of those things
That is how you should remember it
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Visakha the lay follower delighted in the Blessed One's words
For some reason the editors of neither edition seem to have been aware of the reading in the other edition
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks replied
Monks there are these four ways of taking on practices
Which four
There is the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present but yields pain in the future
There is the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present and yields pain in the future
There is the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present but yields pleasure in the future
There is the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present and yields pleasure in the future
Now what is the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present but yields pain in the future
There are some brahmans  contemplatives who hold to a doctrine a view like this 'There is no harm in sensual pleasures' Thus they meet with their downfall through sensual pleasures
They consort with women wanderers who wear their hair coiled in a topknot
The thought occurs to them 'Now what future danger concerning sensual pleasures do those brahmans  contemplatives foresee that they have spoken of the relinquishment of sensual pleasures and describe the full comprehension of sensual pleasures
It's pleasant the touch of this woman wanderer's soft tender downy arm'
Thus they meet with their downfall through sensual pleasures
Then having met with their downfall through sensual pleasures with the breakup of the body after death they go to a bad bourn destitution the realm of the hungry shades hell
There they experience sharp burning pains
They say 'This was the future danger concerning sensual pleasures those brahmans  contemplatives foresaw that they spoke of the relinquishment of sensual pleasures and described the full comprehension of sensual pleasures
It's because of sensual pleasures as a result of sensual pleasures that we're now experiencing these sharp burning pains'
Just as if a maluva creeper pod were to burst open in the last month of the hot season and a maluva creeper seed were to fall at the foot of a sala tree
The deva living in the tree would become frightened apprehensive  anxious
Her friends  companions relatives  kin  garden devas forest devas tree devas devas living in herbs grass  forest monarchs  would gather together to console her 'Have no fear have no fear
In all likelihood a peacock is sure to swallow this maluva creeper seed or a deer will eat it or a brush fire will burn it up or woodsmen will pick it up or termites will carry it off and anyway it probably isn't really a seed'
And then no peacock swallowed it no deer ate it no brush fire burned it up no woodsmen picked it up no termites carried it off and it really was a seed
Watered by a rainladen cloud it sprouted in due course and curled its soft tender downy tendril around the sala tree
The thought occurred to the deva living in the sala tree 'Now what future danger did my friends  companions relatives  kin  garden devas forest devas tree devas devas living in herbs grass  forest monarchs  foresee in that maluva creeper seed that they gathered together to console me Have no fear have no fear
In all likelihood a peacock is sure to swallow this maluva creeper seed or a deer will eat it or a brush fire will burn it up or woodsmen will pick it up or termites will carry it off and anyway it probably isn't really a seed It's pleasant the touch of this maluva creeper's soft tender downy tendril'
Then the creeper having enwrapped the sala tree having made a canopy over it  cascading down around it caused the massive limbs of the sala tree to come crashing down
The thought occurred to the deva living in the tree 'This was the future danger my friends foresaw in that maluva creeper seed that they gathered together to console me It's because of that maluva creeper seed that I'm now experiencing sharp burning pains'
In the same way monks there are some brahmans  contemplatives who hold to a doctrine a view like this 'There is no harm in sensual pleasures' Thus they meet with their downfall through sensual pleasures
They consort with women wanderers who wear their hair coiled in a topknot
The thought occurs to them 'Now what future danger do those brahmans  contemplatives foresee that they teach the relinquishment  analysis of sensual pleasures
It's pleasant the touch of this woman wanderer's soft tender downy arm'
Thus they meet with their downfall through sensual pleasures
Then having met with their downfall through sensual pleasures with the breakup of the body after death they go to a bad bourn destitution the realm of the hungry shades hell
There they experience sharp burning pains
They say 'This was the future danger concerning sensual pleasures those brahmans  contemplatives foresaw that they spoke of the relinquishment of sensual pleasures and described the full comprehension of sensual pleasures
It's because of sensual pleasures as a result of sensual pleasures that we're now experiencing these sharp burning pains'
This is called the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present but yields pain in the future
And what is the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present and yields pain in the future
There is the case where someone is a clothless ascetic rejecting conventions licking his hands not coming when asked not staying when asked
He doesn't consent to food brought to him or food dedicated to him or to an invitation to a meal
He accepts nothing from the mouth of a pot or from the mouth of a bowl
He accepts nothing from across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a nursing woman from a woman lying with a man from a food collection from where a dog is waiting or flies are buzzing
He takes no fish or meat
He drinks no liquor wine or fermented drink
He limits himself to one house  one morsel a day or two houses  two morsels seven houses  seven morsels
He lives on one saucerful a day two seven saucerfuls a day
He takes food once a day once every two days once every seven days and so on up to a fortnight devoted to regulating his intake of food
He is an eater of greens millet wild rice hideparings moss rice bran ricescum sesame flour grass or cow dung
He lives on forest roots  berries
He feeds on fallen fruits
He wears hemp canvas shrouds refuse rags tree bark antelope hide strips of antelope hide kusagrass garments bark garments woodshaving garments headhair garments animal wool owl's wings
He is a hairbeard puller one devoted to the practice of pulling out his hair  beard
He is a stander one who rejects seats
He is a handsaroundtheknees sitter one devoted to the exertion of sitting with his hands around his knees
He is a spikemattresser one who makes his bed on a bed of spikes
He is a thirdtimeintheevening bather one who stays devoted to the practice of bathing in water
Thus in a variety of ways he stays devoted to the practice of tormenting  afflicting the body
With the breakup of the body after death he goes to a bad bourn destitution the realm of the hungry shades hell
This is called the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present and yields pain in the future
And what is the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present but yields pleasure in the future
There is the case of a person who is normally strongly passionate by nature and frequently experiences pain  grief born of passion a person who is normally strongly aversive by nature and frequently experiences pain  grief born of aversion a person who is normally strongly deluded by nature and frequently experiences pain  grief born of delusion
Even though touched with pain  grief crying with a tearful face he lives the holy life that is utterly perfect surpassingly pure
With the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the good bourn the heavenly world
This is called the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present but yields pleasure in the future
And what is the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present and yields pleasure in the future
There is the case of a person who is not normally strongly passionate by nature and doesn't frequently experience pain  grief born of passion who is not normally strongly aversive by nature and doesn't frequently experience pain  grief born of aversion who is not normally strongly deluded by nature and doesn't frequently experience pain  grief born of delusion
Quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities he enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
With the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the good bourn the heavenly world
This is called the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present and yields pleasure in the future
And these are the four ways of taking on practices
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park
Now at that time a new reception hall had just been built by the Kapilavatthu Sakyans and it had not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative brahman or anyone at all in human form
So the Kapilavatthu Sakyans went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to him Lord a new reception hall has just been built by the Kapilavatthu Sakyans and it has not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative brahman or anyone at all in human form
May the Blessed One be the first to use it
When the Blessed One has used it first the Kapilavatthu Sakyans will use it afterwards
That will be for their longterm welfare  happiness
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Sensing his acquiescence the Kapilavatthu Sakyans got up from their seats bowed down to him circumambulated him and then went to the new reception hall
On arrival they spread it all over with felt rugs arranged seats set out a water vessel and raised an oil lamp
Then they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down stood to one side
As they were standing there they said to him Lord the reception hall has been covered all over with felt rugs seats have been arranged a water vessel has been set out and an oil lamp raised
It is now time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fit
So the Blessed One putting on his robe and taking up his bowl  outer robe went together with a community of monks to the reception hall
On arrival he washed his feet entered the hall and sat with his back to the central post facing east
The community of monks washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the western wall facing east ranged around the Blessed One
The Kapilavatthu Sakyans washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the eastern wall facing west ranged around the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One  having spent most of the night instructing urging rousing  encouraging the Kapilavatthu Sakyans with a Dhamma talk  said to Ven
Ananda Ananda speak to the Kapilavatthu Sakyans about the person who follows the practice for one in training
My back aches
I will rest it
Ven
Ananda responded As you say lord
Then the Blessed One having arranged his outer robe folded in four lay down on his right side in the lion's sleeping posture with one foot on top of the other mindful  alert having made a mental note to get up
Then Ven
Ananda addressed Mahanama the Sakyan There is the case Mahanama where a disciple of the noble ones is consummate in virtue guards the doors to his sense faculties knows moderation in eating is devoted to wakefulness is endowed with seven qualities and obtains at will  without trouble or difficulty  the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the herenow
And how is the disciple of the noble ones consummate in virtue
There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is virtuous
He dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in his behavior  sphere of activity
He trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults
This is how the disciple of the noble ones is consummate in virtue
And how does the disciple of the noble ones guard the doors to his sense faculties
There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones on seeing a form with the eye doesn't grasp at any theme or variations by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
He practices for its restraint
He guards the faculty of the eye
He achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye
On hearing a sound with the ear
On smelling an aroma with the nose
On tasting a flavor with the tongue
On feeling a tactile sensation with the body
On cognizing an idea with the intellect he doesn't grasp at any theme or variations by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
He practices for its restraint
He guards the faculty of the intellect
He achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellect
This is how the disciple of the noble ones guards the doors to his sense faculties
And how does the disciple of the noble ones know moderation in eating
There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones considering it appropriately takes his food not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival  continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking 'I will destroy old feelings  not create new feelings
Thus I will maintain myself be blameless  live in comfort' This is how the disciple of the noble ones knows moderation in eating
And how is the disciple of the noble ones devoted to wakefulness
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones sitting  pacing back  forth cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check
During the first watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check
During the second watch of the night reclining on his right side he takes up the lion's posture one foot placed on top of the other mindful alert with his mind set on getting up
During the last watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check
This is how the monk is devoted to wakefulness
And how is the disciple of the noble ones endowed with seven qualities
 There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones has conviction is convinced of the Tathagata's Awakening 'Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in clearknowing  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed'
 He feels shame at bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct
 He feels concern for bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct
 He has heard much has retained what he has heard has stored what he has heard
Whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end that  in their meaning  expression  proclaim the holy life that is entirely complete  pure those he has listened to often retained discussed accumulated examined with his mind and wellpenetrated in terms of his views
 He keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities
He is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities
 He is mindful endowed with excellent proficiency in mindfulness remembering  recollecting even things that were done  said long ago
 He is discerning endowed with discernment of arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress
This is how the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with seven qualities
And how does the disciple of the noble ones obtain at will  without trouble or difficulty  the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the herenow
There is the case where quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities the disciple of the noble ones enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is how the disciple of the noble ones obtains at will  without trouble or difficulty  the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the herenow
Now when a disciple of the noble ones is consummate in virtue in this way guards the doors to his sense faculties in this way knows moderation in eating in this way is devoted to wakefulness in this way is endowed with seven qualities in this way and obtains at will  without trouble or difficulty  the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the herenow in this way then he is called a disciple of the noble ones who follows the practice for one in training whose eggs are unspoiled who is capable of breaking out capable of awakening capable of attaining the supreme rest from the yoke

Just as if a hen had eight ten or twelve eggs that she covered rightly warmed rightly  incubated rightly Even though this wish did not occur to her  'O that my chicks might break through the egg shells with their spiked claws or beaks and hatch out safely'  still it is possible that the chicks would break through the shells with their spiked claws or beaks and hatch out safely
In the same way when a disciple of the noble ones is consummate in virtue in this way guards the doors to his sense faculties in this way knows moderation in eating in this way is devoted to wakefulness in this way is endowed with seven qualities in this way and obtains at will  without trouble or difficulty  the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the herenow in this way then he is called a disciple of the noble ones who follows the practice for one in training whose eggs are unspoiled who is capable of breaking out capable of awakening capable of attaining the supreme rest from the yoke
Now when the disciple of the noble ones has arrived at this purity of equanimity  mindfulness he recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes  details
This is his first breaking out like that of the hen's chicks from their shells
When the disciple of the noble ones has arrived at this purity of equanimity  mindfulness he sees  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away  reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
This is his second breaking out like that of the hen's chicks from their shells
When the disciple of the noble ones has arrived at this purity of equanimity  mindfulness he enters  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  now
This is his third breaking out like that of the hen's chicks from their shells
Now when the disciple of the noble ones is consummate in virtue that is a matter of his conduct
When he guards the doors to his sense faculties knows moderation in eating is devoted to wakefulness is endowed with seven qualities that is a matter of his conduct
When he obtains at will  without trouble or difficulty  the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the herenow that is a matter of his conduct
When he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes  details that is a matter of his clearknowing
When he sees  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing When he enters  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  now that is a matter of his clearknowing
This Mahanama is called a disciple of the noble ones who is consummate in clearknowing consummate in conduct consummate in clearknowing  conduct
And by the Brahma Sanankumara this verse was said
This verse was wellsung by the Brahma Sanankumara not illsung wellsaid not illsaid connected with the goal not unconnected with the goal
It was endorsed by the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One got up and said to Ven
Ananda Good good Ananda
What you have said to the Kapilavatthu Sakyans about the person who follows the practice for one in training is good
That is what Ven
Ananda said and the Teacher approved
Gratified the Kapilavatthu Sakyans delighted in Ven
Ananda's words
One in training is a person who has attained at least streamentry but not yet arahantship
In this sutta the Buddha faces two antagonists Baka a brahma who believes that his brahmaattainment is the highest attainment there is and Mara who wants to keep Baka under his power by allowing Baka to maintain his deluded opinion and to prevent the Buddha from sharing his awakened knowledge with others
Of the two Mara is the more insidious a point illustrated by the fact that Mara always speaks through someone else and never directly shows his face

In overcoming his antagonists the Buddha asserts the superiority of his knowledge in two major fashions through a description of his awakened knowledge and through a display of psychic powers
The Buddha describes his awakened knowledge in a variety of ways
Some of these assertions  in particular the assertion of a consciousness not mediated by any of the six senses  are extremely important dhamma lessons which are further explained in the notes
But as the sutta shows even the Buddha's description of these teachings was not enough to win over Baka or the members of his following
They were convinced only when the Buddha then performed a feat of psychic power that even Baka could not fathom and illustrated the Buddha's major point
Up to then in identifying Mara and the range of Baka's power the Buddha was in effect saying I see you but you don't see me With his display of psychic power in which brahma and his following could not see him but could hear his voice he demonstrated his point in such graphic terms that Baka and his following were immediately won over
In this way the protagonists of this sutta react in a way very different from that of a typical modern reader
We at present when reading this sutta may be more impressed with the Buddha's explanation of his awakened knowledge than we are with the account of his display of psychic power for after all both aspects of the sutta  the description of the Buddha's knowledge and the description of his psychic power  are for us just that descriptions
But for those who witnessed it his display of power was an undeniable fact that went beyond words
They saw him go beyond their range
Prior to that display they regarded his claims of knowledge simply as that mere claims
When he showed however that he could perform a miracle that even Baka could not perform they were forced to concede his superiority
Thus this sutta imparts a lesson often forgotten at present that the Buddha taught not only by word but also by example and that some of his examples required a dimension of power that even the gods could not match
Strictly speaking of course the Buddha's display of power did not prove that he had gone beyond becoming
After all in becoming invisible to Baka he may simply have gone to another level of becoming of which Baka was unaware
However the Buddha correctly surmised that a display of power would subdue the pride of his listeners awaken a sense of conviction in his attainment and thus enable them to enter the path of practice
As he states in MN only when one sees the four noble truths  usually a synonym for streamentry  is one's conviction in the Buddha's Awakening confirmed
Only when one puts an end to one's mental fermentations does one have firm proof of the Buddha's Awakening
The Buddha notes in DN that a display of psychic powers can sometimes backfire in that one's audience might assume that one is engaging in cheap magic tricks
Thus instead of inspiring conviction the display simply increases doubt
Nevertheless there are other instances in the Canon  most notably in the story of the Kassapa brothers and that of Angulimala  where the Buddha was able to display his powers to good effect
Still because he could not trust even his arahant disciples to possess his same sense of when such powers would work and when they would backfire he forbade his disciples from displaying psychic powers to lay people

The conclusion of the sutta states that the sutta's name comes from two facets of the story the fact that it contains an invitation from a brahma  when Baka welcomes the Buddha to his realm  and from the silencing of Mara
The first point is clear enough but the second requires explanation
It is a play on the word brahma which is not only a noun denoting the highest levels of devas but also an adjective meaning of great or high power The Buddha's last statement in which he declares his freedom from rebirth is something of an invitation to Mara Mara is welcome to refute it if he can
Up to that point Mara has phrased his threats to the Buddha in terms of the fortunate rebirths the Buddha will experience if he obeys Mara's advice and the unfortunate ones he will experience if he doesn't
Now that the Buddha declares in a way that Mara cannot refute that he has abandoned all possible conditions for rebirth Mara has nothing more on which to base his threats
Thus he is left speechless
In this way the Buddha's last statement is a brahmainvitation a statement that anyone is welcome to refute but of such great power that no one can refute it at all
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said On one occasion recently I was staying in Ukkattha in the Subhaga forest at the root of a royal sala tree
Now on that occasion an evil viewpoint had arisen to BakaBrahma 'This is constant
This is permanent
This is eternal
This is total
This is not subject to falling away  for this does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear
And there is no other higher escape'
So I  having known with my awareness the train of thought in Baka Brahma's awareness  as a strong man would extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm vanished into the root of the royal sala tree in the Subhaga forest in Ukkattha and appeared in that brahma world
Baka Brahma saw me coming in the distance and on seeing me said 'Come good sir
You are wellcome good sir
It has been long good sir since you arranged to come here  for this good sir is constant
This is permanent
This is eternal
This is total
This is not subject to falling away  for here one does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear
And there is no other higher escape'
When this was said I told Baka Brahma 'How immersed in ignorance is Baka Brahma
How immersed in ignorance is Baka Brahma  in that what is actually inconstant he calls constant What is actually impermanent he calls permanent What is actually noneternal he calls eternal What is actually partial he calls total What is actually subject to falling away he calls not subject to falling away Where one takes birth ages dies falls away and reappears he says For here one does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear And there being another higher escape he says There is no other higher escape'
Then Mara the Evil One taking possession of an attendant of the Brahma assembly said to me 'Monk
Monk
Don't attack him
Don't attack him
For this Brahma monk is the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be
There were monk before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world
'They with the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life were established in a coarse body
There were monk before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world
'They with the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life were established in a refined body
So I tell you monk Please good sir do only as Brahma says
Don't defy the word of Brahma
If you defy the word of Brahma then  as a man when the goddess of fortune approaches chases her away with a stick or as a man falling into hell loses hold of the earth with his hands and feet  that will be what you have accomplished
Please good sir do only as Brahma says
Don't defy the word of Brahma
Don't you see that Brahma's assembly has gathered' And so Mara the Evil One directed my attention to Brahma's assembly
When this was said I told Mara the Evil One 'I know you Evil One
Don't assume He doesn't know me You are Mara Evil One
And Brahma and Brahma's assembly and the attendants of Brahma's assembly have all fallen into your hands
They have all fallen into your power
And you think This one too has come into my hands has come under my control But Evil One I have neither come into your hands nor have I come under your control'
When this was said Baka Brahma told me 'But good sir what is actually constant I call constant What is actually permanent I call permanent What is actually eternal I call eternal What is actually total I call total What is actually not subject to falling away I call not subject to falling away Where one does not take birth age die fall away or reappear I say For this does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear And there being no other higher escape I say There is no other higher escape
'There were monk before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world whose ascetic practice lasted as long as your entire life span
They knew when there was another higher escape that there was another higher escape or when there was no other higher escape that there was no other higher escape
So I tell you monk both that you will not find another higher escape and that to that extent you will reap your share of trouble  weariness
Monk if you relish earth you will lie close to me lie within my domain for me to banish and to do with as I like
If you relish liquid fire wind beings devas Pajapati brahma you will lie close to me lie within my domain for me to banish and to do with as I like'
'I too know that brahma
If I relish earth I will lie close to you lie within your domain for you to banish and to do with as you like
If I relish liquid fire wind beings devas Pajapati brahma I will lie close to you lie within your domain for you to banish and to do with as you like
Moreover I discern your sphere I discern your splendor Baka Brahma has this much great power
Baka Brahma has this much great might
Baka Brahma has this much great influence'
'Well monk how do you discern my sphere how do you discern my splendor Baka Brahma has this much great power
Baka Brahma has this much great might
Baka Brahma has this much great influence'
'That brahma is how I discern your sphere that is how I discern your splendor Baka Brahma has this much great power
Baka Brahma has this much great might
Baka Brahma has this much great influence There are brahma bodies other than yours that you don't know don't see but that I know I see
There is brahma the body named Abhassara from which you fell away  reappeared here
From your having lived here so long your memory of that has become muddled
That is why you don't know it don't see it but I know it I see it
Thus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be inferior
I am actually superior to you
'There is brahma the body named Subhakinha the body named Vehapphala which you don't know don't see but that I know I see
Thus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be your inferior
I am actually superior to you
'Having directly known earth as earth and having directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the earthness of earth I wasn't earth I wasn't in earth I wasn't coming from earth I wasn't Earth is mine I didn't affirm earth
Thus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be inferior
I am actually superior to you
'Having directly known liquid as liquid fire as fire wind as wind beings as beings devas as devas Pajapati as Pajapati brahma as brahma the radiant as radiant the beautiful black as the beautiful black the skyfruit as the skyfruit the conqueror as the conqueror
'Having directly known the all as the all and having directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the allness of the all I wasn't the all I wasn't in the all I wasn't coming forth from the all I wasn't The all is mine I didn't affirm the all
Thus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing so how could I be inferior
I am actually superior to you'
'If good sir you have directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the allness of the all may it not turn out to be actually vain and void for you'
has not been experienced through the earthness of earth the liquidity of liquid the fieriness of fire the windiness of wind the allness of the all'
'Well then good sir I will disappear from you'
'Well then brahma disappear from me if you can'
Then Baka Brahma 'I will disappear from Gotama the contemplative
I will disappear from Gotama the contemplative' was not able to disappear from me
When this was said I said to Baka Brahma 'Well then brahma I will disappear from you'
'Well then good sir disappear from me if you can'
So then monks I fabricated a fabrication of psychic power to the extent that Brahma the Brahma assembly and the attendants of the Brahma assembly heard my voice but did not see me
Having disappeared I recited this verse
Then in Brahma the Brahma assembly and the attendants of the Brahma assembly there arose a sense of amazement  awe 'How amazing
How awesome
 The great power the great might of Gotama the contemplative
Never before have we seen or heard of any other contemplative or brahman of such great power such great might as that of this Gotama the contemplative who went forth from a Sakyan clan
Living in a generation that so delights in becoming so rejoices in becoming is so fond of becoming he has pulled out becoming by the root'
Then Mara the Evil One taking possession of an attendant of the Brahma assembly said to me 'If good sir this is what you discern if this is what you have awakened to do not lead disciples or those gone forth
Do not teach the Dhamma to disciples or those gone forth
Do not yearn for disciples or those gone forth
There were good sir before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world who claimed to be worthy  rightly selfawakened
They led disciples  those gone forth
They taught the Dhamma to disciples  those gone forth
They yearned for disciples  those gone forth
Having led disciples  those gone forth having taught the Dhamma to disciples  those gone forth having yearned for disciples  those gone forth they  on the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life  were established in a coarse body
'There were good sir before your time brahmans  contemplatives in the world who claimed to be worthy  rightly selfawakened
They did not lead disciples or those gone forth
They did not teach the Dhamma to disciples or those gone forth
They did not yearn for disciples or those gone forth
Having not led disciples or those gone forth having not taught the Dhamma to disciples or those gone forth having not yearned for disciples or those gone forth they  on the breakup of the body with the cutting off of life  were established in a refined body
'So monk I tell you this Please good sir be effortless
Abide committed to a pleasant abiding in the herenow  for it is skillful good sir that this not be taught
Don't instruct others'
When this was said I told Mara the Evil One 'I know you Evil One
Don't assume He doesn't know me You are Mara Evil One
And it's not sympathetic to welfare that you speak thus to me
It's sympathetic to what is not welfare that you speak thus to me
You think this Evil One Those to whom Gotama the contemplative will teach the Dhamma will defy my sovereignty
Without being rightly selfawakened Evil One your contemplatives  brahmans claimed to be rightly selfawakened
I however being rightly selfawakened claim to be rightly selfawakened
For when the Tathagata is teaching the Dhamma to his disciples he is Such
When he is not teaching the Dhamma to his disciples he is Such
When leading his disciples he is Such
When not leading his disciples he is Such
Why is that
The fermentations that defile that lead to further becoming that disturb that ripen in stress that tend to future birth aging  death Those the Tathagata has abandoned their root destroyed like an uprooted palmyra tree deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Just as a palmyra tree with its crown cut off is incapable of growing again so too the fermentations that defile that lead to further becoming that disturb that ripen in stress that tend to future birth aging  death Those the Tathagata has abandoned their root destroyed like an uprooted palmyra tree deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising' Thus because of the silencing of Mara and because of the brahma's invitation this discourse is entitled The Brahma Invitation
Just as if there were a roofed house or a roofed hall having windows on the north the south or the east
When the sun rises and a ray has entered by way of the window where does it land
On the western wall lord
And if there is no western wall where does it land
On the ground lord
And if there is no ground where does it land
On the water lord
And if there is no water where does it land
It does not land lord
In the same way where there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food contact intellectual intention consciousness where there is no delight no craving then consciousness does not land there or grow
Where consciousness does not land or grow nameform does not alight
Where nameform does not alight there is no growth of fabrications
Where there is no growth of fabrications there is no production of renewed becoming in the future
Where there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth aging  death
That I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despair
In other words normal sensory consciousness is experienced because it has a surface against which it lands the sense organs and their objects which constitute the all For instance we experience visual consciousness because of the eye and forms of which we are conscious
Consciousness without surface however is directly known without intermediary free from any dependence on conditions at all
This consciousness thus differs from the consciousness factor in dependent coarising which is defined in terms of the six sense media
Lying outside of time and space it would also not come under the consciousnessaggregate which covers all consciousness near and far past present and future
And as SN
notes the word all in the Buddha's teaching covers only the six sense media which is another reason for not including this consciousness under the aggregates
However the fact that it is outside of time and space  in a dimension where there is no here there or in between no coming no going or staying  means that it cannot be described as permanent or omnipresent terms that have meaning only within space and time
Some have objected to the equation of this consciousness with nibbana on the grounds that nibbana is nowhere else in the Canon described as a form of consciousness
Thus they have proposed that consciousness without surface be regarded as an arahant's consciousness of nibbana in meditative experience and not nibbana itself
This argument however contains a flaw If nibbana is an object of mental consciousness it would come under the all as an object of the intellect
There are passages in the Canon that describe meditators experiencing nibbana as a dhamma but these passages seem to indicate that this description applies up through the level of nonreturning
Other passages however describe nibbana as the ending of all dhammas
For instance Sn quotes the Buddha as calling the attainment of the goal the transcending of all dhammas
Sn and Sn state that the arahant has transcended dispassion said to be the highest dhamma
Thus for the arahant nibbana is not an object of consciousness
Instead it is directly known without mediation
Because consciousness without feature is directly known without mediation there seems good reason to equate the two
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's Monastery
Then Ven
Maha Kotthita arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to Ven
Sariputta and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Sariputta Friend 'One of poor discernment one of poor discernment' Thus is it said
To what extent is one said to be 'one of poor discernment'
'One doesn't discern one doesn't discern' Thus friend one is said to be 'one of poor discernment' And what doesn't one discern
One doesn't discern 'This is stress' One doesn't discern 'This is the origination of stress' One doesn't discern 'This is the cessation of stress' One doesn't discern 'This is the practice leading to the cessation of stress' 'One doesn't discern one doesn't discern' Thus one is said to be 'one of poor discernment' Saying Very good friend Ven
Maha Kotthita  delighting in  approving of Ven
Sariputta's statement  asked him a further question Discerning discerning' Thus is it said
To what extent friend is one said to be 'discerning'
'One discerns one discerns' Thus friend one is said to be 'discerning' And what does one discern
One discerns 'This is stress' One discerns 'This is the origination of stress' One discerns 'This is the cessation of stress' One discerns 'This is the practice leading to the cessation of stress' 'One discerns one discerns' Thus one is said to be 'discerning' 'Consciousness consciousness' Thus is it said
To what extent friend is it said to be 'consciousness'
'It cognizes it cognizes' Thus friend it is said to be 'consciousness' And what does it cognize
It cognizes 'pleasant' It cognizes 'painful' It cognizes 'neither painful nor pleasant' 'It cognizes it cognizes' Thus it is said to be 'consciousness' Discernment  consciousness friend Are these qualities conjoined or disjoined
Is it possible having separated them one from the other to delineate the difference between them
Discernment  consciousness are conjoined friend not disjoined
It's not possible having separated them one from the other to delineate the difference between them
For what one discerns that one cognizes
What one cognizes that one discerns
Therefore these qualities are conjoined not disjoined and it is not possible having separated them one from another to delineate the difference between them
Discernment  consciousness friend What is the difference between these qualities that are conjoined not disjoined
Discernment  consciousness friend Of these qualities that are conjoined not disjoined discernment is to be developed consciousness is to be fully comprehended
'Feeling feeling' Thus is it said
To what extent friend is it said to be 'feeling'
'It feels it feels' Thus friend it is said to be 'feeling' And what does it feel
It feels pleasure
It feels pain
It feels neither pleasure nor pain
'It feels it feels' Thus it is said to be 'feeling' 'Perception perception' Thus is it said
To what extent friend is it said to be 'perception'
'It perceives it perceives' Thus friend it is said to be 'perception' And what does it perceive
It perceives blue
It perceives yellow
It perceives red
It perceives white
'It perceives it perceives' Thus it is said to be 'perception' Feeling perception  consciousness friend Are these qualities conjoined or disjoined
Is it possible having separated them one from another to delineate the difference among them
Feeling perception  consciousness are conjoined friend not disjoined
It is not possible having separated them one from another to delineate the difference among them
For what one feels that one perceives
What one perceives that one cognizes
Therefore these qualities are conjoined not disjoined and it is not possible having separated them one from another to delineate the difference among them
Friend what can be known with the purified intellectconsciousness divorced from the five faculties
Friend with the purified intellectconsciousness divorced from the five faculties the dimension of the infinitude of space can be known 'infinite space' The dimension of the infinitude of consciousness can be known 'infinite consciousness' The dimension of nothingness can be known 'There is nothing'
With what does one know a quality that can be known
One knows a quality that can be known with the eye of discernment
And what is the purpose of discernment
The purpose of discernment is direct knowledge its purpose is full comprehension its purpose is abandoning
Friend how many conditions are there for the arising of right view
Friend there are two conditions for the arising of right view the voice of another and appropriate attention
These are the two conditions for the arising of right view
And assisted by how many factors does right view have awarenessrelease as its fruit  reward and discernmentrelease as its fruit  reward
Assisted by five factors right view has awarenessrelease as its fruit  reward and discernmentrelease as its fruit  reward
There is the case where right view is assisted by virtue assisted by learning assisted by discussion assisted by tranquility assisted by insight
Assisted by these five factors right view has awarenessrelease as its fruit  reward and discernmentrelease as its fruit  reward
Friend how many kinds of becoming are there
Friend there are these three kinds of becoming sensual becoming form becoming formless becoming
And how is further becoming in the future brought about
The delight now here now there of beings hindered by ignorance  fettered by craving That's how further becoming in the future is brought about
And how is further becoming in the future not brought about
Through the fading of ignorance the arising of clear knowing  the cessation of craving That's how further becoming in the future is not brought about
What friend is the first jhana
There is the case friend where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
This is called the first jhana
And how many factors does the first jhana have
The first jhana has five factors
There is the case where in a monk who has attained the fivefactored first jhana there occurs directed thought evaluation rapture pleasure  singleness of mind
It's in this way that the first jhana has five factors
And how many factors are abandoned in the first jhana and with how many is it endowed
Five factors are abandoned in the first jhana and with five is it endowed
There is the case where in a monk who has attained the first jhana sensual desire is abandoned ill will is abandoned sloth  torpor is abandoned restlessness  anxiety is abandoned uncertainty is abandoned
And there occur directed thought evaluation rapture pleasure  singleness of mind
It's in this way that five factors are abandoned in the first jhana and with five it is endowed
Friend there are these five faculties each with a separate range a separate domain and they do not experience one another's range  domain the eyefaculty the earfaculty the nosefaculty the tonguefaculty  the bodyfaculty
Now what do these five faculties  each with a separate range a separate domain not experiencing one another's range  domain the eyefaculty the earfaculty the nosefaculty the tonguefaculty  the bodyfaculty  have as their arbitrator
What experiences their ranges  domains
Friend these five faculties  each with a separate range a separate domain not experiencing one another's range  domain the eyefaculty the earfaculty the nosefaculty the tonguefaculty  the bodyfaculty  have the intellect as their arbitrator
The intellect is what experiences their ranges  domains
Now these five faculties  the eyefaculty the earfaculty the nosefaculty the tonguefaculty  the bodyfaculty In dependence on what do they remain standing
These five faculties  the eyefaculty the earfaculty the nosefaculty the tonguefaculty  the bodyfaculty  remain standing in dependence on vitality
And vitality remains standing in dependence on what
Vitality remains standing in dependence on heat
And heat remains standing in dependence on what
Heat remains standing in dependence on vitality
Just now friend Sariputta we understood you to say 'Vitality remains standing in dependence on heat' And just now we understood you to say 'Heat remains standing in dependence on vitality' Now how is the meaning of these statements to be seen
In that case friend I will give you analogy for there are cases where it is through an analogy that an intelligent person understands the meaning of a statement
Suppose an oil lamp is burning
Its radiance is discerned in dependence on its flame and its flame is discerned in dependence on its radiance
In the same way vitality remains standing in dependence on heat and heat remains standing in dependence on vitality
Friend are vitalityfabrications the same thing as feelingstates
Or are vitalityfabrications one thing and feelingstates another
Vitalityfabrications are not the same thing as feelingstates friend
If vitalityfabrications were the same thing as feelingstates the emergence of a monk from the attainment of the cessation of feeling  perception would not be discerned
It's because vitalityfabrications are one thing and feelingstates another that the emergence of a monk from the attainment of the cessation of perception  feeling is discerned
When this body lacks how many qualities does it lie discarded  forsaken like a senseless log
When this body lacks these three qualities  vitality heat  consciousness  it lies discarded  forsaken like a senseless log
What is the difference between one who is dead who has completed his time and a monk who has attained the cessation of perception  feeling
In the case of the one who is dead who has completed his time his bodily fabrications have ceased  subsided his verbal fabrications his mental fabrications have ceased  subsided his vitality is exhausted his heat subsided  his faculties are scattered
But in the case of a monk who has attained the cessation of perception  feeling his bodily fabrications have ceased  subsided his verbal fabrications his mental fabrications have ceased  subsided his vitality is not exhausted his heat has not subsided  his faculties are exceptionally clear
This is the difference between one who is dead who has completed his time and a monk who has attained the cessation of perception  feeling
Friend how many conditions are there for the attainment of the neitherpleasantnorpainful awarenessrelease
Friend there are four conditions for the attainment of the neitherpleasantnorpainful awarenessrelease
There is the case where a monk with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
These are the four conditions for the attainment of the neitherpleasantnorpainful awarenessrelease
How many conditions are there for the attainment of the themeless awarenessrelease
There are two conditions for the attainment of the themeless awarenessrelease lack of attention to all themes and attention to the themeless property

And how many conditions are there for the emergence from the themeless awarenessrelease
There are two conditions for the emergence from the themeless awarenessrelease attention to all themes and lack of attention to the themeless property
These are the two conditions for the emergence from the themeless awarenessrelease
The immeasurable awarenessrelease the nothingness awarenessrelease the emptiness awarenessrelease the themelessawarenessrelease Are these qualities different in meaning  different in name or are they one in meaning and different only in name
The immeasurable awarenessrelease the nothingness awarenessrelease the emptiness awarenessrelease the themelessawarenessrelease There is a way of explanation by which these qualities are different in meaning  different in name and there is a way of explanation by which these qualities are one in meaning and different only in name
And what is the way of explanation by which these qualities are different in meaning  different in name
There is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with good will
Thus he keeps pervading above below  all around everywhere  in every respect the allencompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will

This is called the immeasurable awarenessrelease
And what is the nothingness awarenessrelease
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
This is called the nothingness awarenessrelease
And what is the emptiness awarenessrelease
There is the case where a monk having gone into the wilderness to the root of a tree or into an empty dwelling considers this 'This is empty of self or of anything pertaining to self' This is called the emptiness awarenessrelease
And what is the themeless awarenessrelease

This is called the themeless awarenessrelease
This is the way of explaining by which these qualities are different in meaning  different in name
And what is the way of explaining whereby these qualities are one in meaning and different only in name
Passion friend is a making of limits
Aversion is a making of limits
Delusion is a making of limits
In a monk whose fermentations are ended these have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Now to the extent that there is immeasurable awarenessrelease the unprovoked awarenessrelease is declared the foremost
And this unprovoked awarenessrelease is empty of passion empty of aversion empty of delusion
Passion is a something
Aversion is a something
Delusion is a something

That is what Ven
Sariputta said
Gratified Ven
Maha Kotthita delighted in Ven
Sariputta's words
I have heard that on one occasion while the Blessed One was on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks he arrived at Salavatika
The brahman householders of Sala heard it said Gotama the contemplative  the son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clan  on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks  has arrived at Sala
And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread 'He is indeed a Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessed
He has made known  having realized it through direct knowledge  this world with its devas maras  brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their rulers  common people has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect  pure
It is good to see such a worthy one' So the brahman householders of Sala went to the Blessed One
On arrival some of them bowing down to him sat to one side
Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one side
Some of them placing their hands palmtopalm over the heart in his direction sat to one side
Some of them announcing their name and clan in his presence sat to one side
Some of them remaining silent sat to one side
As they were sitting there the brahman householders of Sala said to the Blessed One What is the reason Master Gotama what is the condition whereby some beings here with the breakup of the body after death reappear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
And what is the reason what is the condition whereby some beings here with the breakup of the body after death reappear in the good destinations in the heavenly world
Householders it's by reason of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct that some beings here with the breakup of the body after death reappear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
It's by reason of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct that some beings here with the breakup of the body after death reappear in the good destinations in the heavenly world
We don't understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's brief statement the detailed meaning of what he hasn't analyzed
It would be good if Master Gotama would teach the Dhamma so that we would understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's brief statement the detailed meaning of what he hasn't analyzed
Very well in that case householders listen  pay careful attention
I will speak
As you say master the brahman householders of Sala responded to the Blessed One
The Blessed One said Householders there are three sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the body four sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with speech and three sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the mind
And how are there three sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the body
There is the case where a certain person takes life is brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beings
He takes what is not given
He takes in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them
He engages in sensual misconduct
He gets sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man
This is how there are three sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the body
And how are there four sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with speech
There is the case where a certain person engages in false speech
When he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness 'Come  tell good man what you know' If he doesn't know he says 'I know' If he does know he says 'I don't know' If he hasn't seen he says 'I have seen' If he has seen he says 'I haven't seen' Thus he consciously tells lies for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of a certain reward
He engages in divisive speech
What he has heard here he tells there to break those people apart from these people here
What he has heard there he tells here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus breaking apart those who are united and stirring up strife between those who have broken apart he loves factionalism delights in factionalism enjoys factionalism speaks things that create factionalism
He engages in abusive speech
He speaks words that are harsh cutting bitter to others abusive of others provoking anger and destroying concentration
He engages in idle chatter
He speaks out of season speaks what isn't factual what isn't in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya words that are not worth treasuring
This is how there are four sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with speech
And how are there three sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the mind
There is the case where a certain person is covetous
He covets the belongings of others thinking 'O that what belongs to others would be mine'
He bears ill will corrupt in the resolves of his heart 'May these beings be killed or cut apart or crushed or destroyed or may they not exist at all'
He has wrong view is warped in the way he sees things 'There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed
There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions
There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no contemplatives or brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' 
This is how there are three sorts of unDhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the mind
It's by reason of this unDhamma conduct  dissonant conduct that some beings here with the breakup of the body after death reappear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
Householders there are three sorts of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with the body four sorts of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with speech and three sorts of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with the mind
And how are there three sorts of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with the body
There is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of life
He dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given
He doesn't take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them
Abandoning sensual misconduct he abstains from sensual misconduct
He doesn't get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man
This is how there are three sorts of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with the body
And how are there three sorts of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with speech
There is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speech
When he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness 'Come  tell good man what you know' If he doesn't know he says 'I don't know' If he does know he says 'I know' If he hasn't seen he says 'I haven't seen' If he has seen he says 'I have seen' Thus he doesn't consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any reward
Abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech
He speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the world
Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech
What he has heard here he doesn't tell there to break those people apart from these people here
What he has heard there he doesn't tell here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concord
Abandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speech
He speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at large
Abandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter
He speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya
He speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal
This is how there are four sorts of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with speech
And how are there three sorts of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with the mind
There is the case where a certain person is not covetous
He doesn't covet the belongings of others thinking 'O that what belongs to others would be mine'
He bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heart
'May these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with ease' 
He has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things 'There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed
There are fruits  results of good  bad actions
There is this world  the next world
There is mother  father
There are spontaneously reborn beings there are contemplatives  brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' 
This is how there are three sorts of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with the mind
It's by reason of this Dhamma conduct  harmonious conduct that some beings here with the breakup of the body after death reappear in the good destinations in the heavenly world
Householders if one  a person of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct  should wish 'O if I with the breakup of the body after death were to reappear among welltodo noble warriors it is possible that one  with the breakup of the body after death  would appear among welltodo noble warriors
Why is that
Because one is a person of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct

If one  a person of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct  should wish 'O if I with the breakup of the body after death were to reappear among welltodo brahmans it is possible that one  with the breakup of the body after death  would appear among welltodo brahmans

If one  a person of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct  should wish 'O if I with the breakup of the body after death were to reappear among welltodo householders it is possible that one  with the breakup of the body after death  would appear among welltodo householders

If one  a person of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct  should wish 'O if I with the breakup of the body after death were to reappear among the devas of the Four Great Kings it is possible that one  with the breakup of the body after death  would appear among the devas of the Four Great Kings
Why is that

Why is that
Because one is a person of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct

If one  a person of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct  should wish 'O if I with the breakup of the body after death were to reappear among the Not Falling Away devas the Untroubled devas the Goodlooking devas the Clearseeing devas the Peerless devas it is possible that one  with the breakup of the body after death  would appear among the Peerless devas
Why is that
Because one is a person of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct

If one  a person of Dhamma conduct harmonious conduct  should wish 'O if I with the breakup of the body after death were to reappear among the devas who have reached the dimension of the infinitude of space the devas who have reached the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the devas who have reached the dimension of nothingness the devas who have reached the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception it is possible that one  with the breakup of the body after death  would appear among the devas who have reached the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Why is that

When this was said the brahman householders of Sala said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
We go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
May Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge from this day forward for life
This and the following passages on the power of a wish made by a virtuous person are apparently related to a principle  expressed in SN
 that a wish made by a virtuous person can succeed through the purity of hisher virtue
However other passages in the Canon suggest that virtue on its own  even when combined with the levels of conviction and discernment embodied in the three types of skillful mental action  may not be enough for any of the attainments listed here
In other words the ten types of skillful action may be necessary causes for these attainments but they may not be sufficient causes
For example MN states that one must be generous in order to be born into a wealthy family
AN
states that the rebirth into the six deva realms beginning with the devas of the Four Great Kings is based on five qualities conviction virtue learning generosity and discernment
AN
correlates different motivations for giving with the attainment of different levels of rebirth among these realms after death
AN
and state that rebirth in Brahma's retinue can follow on the attainment of the first jhana or the meditative development of immeasurable good will
It should also be noted in line with MN that skillful conduct in this lifetime is not always rewarded in the immediate next birth either because of previous bad actions or because of bad actions adopted toward the end of one's life
In such a case the desired destination will be delayed to a later lifetime
This may be why the Buddha states that it is possible that a person of Dhamma conduct will attain hisher desired destination in the next life
Only with the attainment of streamentry is one guaranteed not to fall into the lower realms
Conversely it is not always the case that a person who engages in unskillful conduct in this lifetime will go to a lower destination in the next
There is always the possibility that such a person may have good kamma from the past or may change hisher ways later in this lifetime
In SN
the Buddha criticizes those who teach that misdeeds inevitably lead to a bad destination in the next lifetime saying that anyone who believed such a teaching and knew that heshe had already committed misdeeds would feel that heshe had already been consigned to hell
A more skillful way to regard past misdeeds would be to recognize that they were wrong to resolve not to repeat them and to develop attitudes of immeasurable goodwill compassion empathetic joy and equanimity to reinforce one's resolve not to treat anyone in an unskillful way
AN
adds that the results of past misdeeds can be mitigated both through the practice of the four immeasurables and through training the mind so that it is not overcome by feelings of pleasure or pain
These are the devas on the level of form
The commentary notes that the term Radiant devas is actually a class name encompassing the following three levels the devas of Limited Radiance the devas of Immeasurable Radiance and the devas of Streaming Radiance
Similarly the Beautiful devas encompass the devas of Limited Beauty the devas of Immeasurable Beauty and the Beautiful Black devas
According to AN
and rebirth among the devas of Streaming Radiance can follow on the attainment of the second jhana or the meditative development of immeasurable compassion rebirth among the Beautiful Black devas can follow on the attainment of the third jhana or the meditative development of immeasurable empathetic joy rebirth among the Skyfruit devas can follow on the attainment of the fourth jhana or the meditative development of immeasurable equanimity
An Abhidhamma text the Vibhanga  drawing on a passage in DN  mentions another level of devas of form not listed here the Nonpercipient beings a level in which there is no perception at all
The commentary explains that they are not listed here because this attainment is open to hermits and seers outside the Buddha's teaching and does not require virtue
This however ignores the fact that the four jhanas and four formless states are also open to people outside the Buddha's teaching and although virtue helps with the attainment of jhana it is nowhere stated in the Canon that the jhanas cannot be attained by a person whose virtue is not pure
A more likely reason for omitting the Nonpercipient beings here is that this state unlike the jhanas and four formless states is not conducive to the arising of insight and so would not be considered a desirable goal
The brahmans of this discourse intelligent people asked a question about the causality of rebirth  why is one reborn in the states of deprivation while others make it to the heaven worlds
The Buddha then analyzes what kind of kamma will take one to a low rebirth
You see any of your own actions here
Then you know what to do about it for if one makes any of these ten courses of unwholesome kamma strong in oneself a result can be expected at least on the dissolution of the body after death if not in this life
The ten courses of wholesome kamma follow
They should be strengthened in oneself repeated frequently so that they become habitual
If one recognizes any of one's own actions among them then just guard against the conceit I am good
The last part of the sutta deals with the aspirations which one may have for rebirth at the time of death
Of course one's previously made kamma must be such that it will support such aspirations
A miser might aspire to riches but his kamma will give him poverty
If a person has kept the Uposatha and generally all the precepts and been generous and truthful as well this is the passport to heavenly birth
Beyond this it is necessary also to be proficient in jhana and one will gain rebirth among the Brahmas according to proficiency in this
For the next five Brahmaplanes the state of nonreturning is required while for the last four one must have gained the formless attainments
Finally one may aspire to no rebirth to arahantship but of course the aspiration alone is not sufficient  practice and sufficient insightwisdom are needed
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and eventually he arrived at a Kosalan brahman village called Sala
The brahman householders of Sala heard A monk called Gotama it seems a son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and has come to Sala
Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect 'That Blessed One is such since he is arahant and Fully Enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable teacher of men to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed
He describes this world with its gods its Maras and its Divinities this generation with its monks and brahmans with its kings and its people which he has himself realized through direct knowledge
He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with meaning and phrasing he affirms a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure' Now it is good to see such arahants
The brahman householders of Sala went to the Blessed One and some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side some exchanged greetings with him and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished sat down at one side some raised hands palms together in salutation to the Blessed One and sat down at one side some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One's presence and sat down at one side some kept silence and sat down at one side
When they were seated they said to the Blessed One Master Gotama what is the reason what is the condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell and what is the reason what is the condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world
Householders it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of unrighteous conduct that beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell
It is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of righteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world
We do not understand the detailed meaning of this utterance of Master Gotama's spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning
It would be good if Master Gotama taught us the Dhamma so that we might understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's utterance spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning
Then householders listen and heed well what I shall say
Yes venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Householders there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
There are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
There are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
And how are there three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
Here someone is a killer of living beings he is murderous bloodyhanded given to blows and violence and merciless to all living beings
He is a taker of what is not given he takes as a thief another's chattels and property in the village or in the forest
He is given over to misconduct in sexual desires he has intercourse with such as are protected by the mother father brother sister relatives as have a husband as entail a penalty and also with those that are garlanded in token of betrothal
That is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
And how are there four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
Here someone speaks falsehood when summoned to a court or to a meeting or to his relatives' presence or to his guild or to the royal family's presence and questioned as a witness thus 'So good man tell what you know' then not knowing he says 'I know' or knowing he says 'I do not know' not seeing he says 'I see' or seeing he says 'I do not see' in full awareness he speaks falsehood for his own ends or for another's ends or for some trifling worldly end
He speaks maliciously he is a repeater elsewhere of what is heard here for the purpose of causing division from these or he is a repeater to these of what is heard elsewhere for the purpose of causing division from those and he is thus a divider of the united a creator of divisions who enjoys discord rejoices in discord delights in discord he is a speaker of words that create discord
He speaks harshly he utters such words as are rough hard hurtful to others censorious of others bordering on anger and unconducive to concentration
He is a gossip as one who tells that which is unseasonable that which is not fact that which is not good that which is not the Dhamma that which is not the Discipline and he speaks out of season speech not worth recording which is unreasoned indefinite and unconnected with good
That is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
And how are there three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
Here someone is covetous he is a coveter of another's chattels and property thus 'Oh that what is another's were mine' Or he has a mind of illwill with the intention of a mind affected by hate thus 'May these beings be slain and slaughtered may they be cut off perish or be annihilated' Or he has wrong view distorted vision thus 'There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed no fruit and ripening of good and bad kammas no this world no other world no mother no father no spontaneously beings no good and virtuous monks and brahmans that have themselves realized by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world' That is how there are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
So householders it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of unrighteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell
Householders there are three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
There are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
There are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
And how are there three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
Here someone abandoning the killing of living beings becomes one who abstains from killing living beings with rod and weapon laid aside gentle and kindly he abides compassionate to all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he becomes one who abstains from taking what is not given he does not take as a thief another's chattels and property in the village or in the forest
Abandoning misconduct in sexual desires he becomes one who abstains from misconduct in sexual desires he does not have intercourse with such women as are protected by mother father brother sister relatives as have a husband as entail a penalty and also those that are garlanded in token of betrothal
That is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
And how are there four of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
Here someone abandoning false speech becomes one who abstains from false speech when summoned to a court or to a meeting or to his relatives' presence or to his guild or to the royal family's presence and questioned as a witness thus 'So good man tell what you know' not knowing he says 'I do not know' or knowing he says 'I know' not seeing he says 'I do not see' or seeing he says 'I see' he does not in full awareness speak falsehood for his own ends or for another's ends or for some trifling worldly end
Abandoning malicious speech he becomes one who abstains from malicious speech as one who is neither a repeater elsewhere of what is heard here for the purpose of causing division from these nor a repeater to these of what is heard elsewhere for the purpose of causing division from those who is thus a reuniter of the divided a promoter of friendships enjoying concord rejoicing in concord delighting in concord he becomes a speaker of words that promote concord
Abandoning harsh speech he becomes one who abstains from harsh speech he becomes a speaker of such words as are innocent pleasing to the ear and lovable as go to the heart are civil desired of many and dear to many
Abandoning gossip he becomes one who abstains from gossip as one who tells that which is seasonable that which is factual that which is good that which is the Dhamma that which is the Discipline he speaks in season speech worth recording which is reasoned definite and connected with good
That is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
And how are there three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
Here someone is not covetous he is not a coveter of another's chattels and property thus 'Oh that what is another's were mine' He has no mind of illwill with the intention of a mind unaffected by hate thus 'May these beings be free from enmity affliction and anxiety may they live happily' He has right view undistorted vision thus 'There is what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed and there is fruit and ripening of good and bad kammas and there is this world and the other world and mother and father and spontaneously beings and good and virtuous monks and brahmans that have themselves realized by direct knowledge and declared this world and the other world' That is how there are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
So householders it is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of righteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world
If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish 'Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the warriornobles of great property' it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he may do so
Why is that
Because he observes conduct that is in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
If a householder who observes conduct is accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish 'Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the brahmans of great property' it is possible
If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma' I might reappear in the company of householders of great property' it is possible
If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish 'Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the gods of the Four Kings' it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he may do so
Why is that
Because he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish 'Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the gods of the base consisting of neitherperceptionnornonperception' it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he may do so
Why is that
Because he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish 'Oh that by realization myself with direct knowledge I may here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of the heart and the deliverance by wisdom that are taintfree with exhaustion of taints' it is possible that by realization himself with direct knowledge he may here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of the heart and the deliverance by wisdom that are taintfree with exhaustion of taints
Why is that
Because he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
When this was said the brahman householders of Sala said to the Blessed One
Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent Master Gotama
The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing the hidden showing the way to one who was lost holding up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyes to see forms
We go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
From today let Master Gotama accept us as followers who have gone to him for refuge for life
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Angas
Now the Angas have a town named Assapura
There the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said 'Contemplative contemplatives' That is how people perceive you
And when asked 'What are you' you claim that 'We are contemplatives' So with this being your designation and this your claim this is how you should train yourselves 'We will undertake  practice those qualities that make one a contemplative that make one a brahman so that our designation will be true and our claim accurate so that the services of those whose robes almsfood lodging and medicinal requisites we use will bring them great fruit  great reward and so that our going forth will not be barren but fruitful  fertile'
And what monks are the qualities that make one a contemplative that make one a brahman
'We will be endowed with conscience  concern ' That's how you should train yourselves

We will practice for its restraint
We will protect the faculty of the eye
We will achieve restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye

During the first watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth we will cleanse the mind of any qualities that would hold it in check
During the second watch of the night reclining on his right side we will take up the lion's posture one foot placed on top of the other mindful alert with the mind set on getting up

There is the case where a monk seeks out a secluded dwelling a forest the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle grove the open air a heap of straw
After his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the fore
Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness
He cleanses his mind of covetousness
Abandoning ill will and anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings
He cleanses his mind of ill will and anger
Abandoning sloth and drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness mindful alert percipient of light
He cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsiness
Abandoning restlessness and anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilled
He cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxiety
Abandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities
He cleanses his mind of uncertainty
Suppose that a man taking a loan invests it in his business affairs
His business affairs succeed
He repays his old debts and has extra left over for maintaining his wife
The thought would occur to him 'Before taking a loan I invested it in my business affairs
Now my business affairs have succeeded
I have repaid my old debts and have extra left over for maintaining my wife' Because of that he would gain joy  experience happiness
Now suppose that a man falls sick  in pain  seriously ill
He does not enjoy his meals and has no measure of strength in his body
At a later time he is released from that sickness
He enjoys his meals and has a measure of strength in his body
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was sick Now I am released from that sickness
I enjoy my meals and have a measure of strength in my body' Because of that he would gain joy  experience happiness
Now suppose that a man is bound in prison
At a later time he is released from that bondage safe  sound with no loss of property
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was bound in prison
Now I am released from that bondage safe  sound with no loss of my property' Because of that he would gain joy  experience happiness
Now suppose that a man subject to others not subject to himself unable to go where he likes
At a later time he is released from that slavery subject to himself not subject to others freed able to go where he likes
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was a slave Now I am released from that slavery subject to myself not subject to others freed able to go where I like' Because of that he would gain joy  experience happiness
Now suppose that a man carrying money  goods is traveling by a road through desolate country
At a later time he emerges from that desolate country safe  sound with no loss of property
The thought would occur to him 'Before carrying money  goods I was traveling by a road through desolate country
Now I have emerged from that desolate country safe  sound with no loss of my property' Because of that he would gain joy  experience happiness
In the same way when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself the monk regards it as a debt a sickness a prison slavery a road through desolate country
But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself he regards it as unindebtedness good health release from prison freedom a place of security
Seeing that they have been abandoned within him he becomes glad
Glad he becomes enraptured
Enraptured his body grows tranquil
His body tranquil he is sensitive to pleasure
Feeling pleasure his mind becomes concentrated
Quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluation
He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal
Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again and again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within and without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of withdrawal
There's nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal
Furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assurance
He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure
Just like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time and again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate and pervade suffuse and fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure
There's nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composure
And furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born and growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated and pervaded suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
There's nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
And furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure and stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasure nor stress
He sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
There's nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives
He recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details
Just as if a man were to go from his home village to another village and then from that village to yet another village and then from that village back to his home village
The thought would occur to him 'I went from my home village to that village over there
There I stood in such a way sat in such a way talked in such a way and remained silent in such a way
From that village I went to that village over there and there I stood in such a way sat in such a way talked in such a way and remained silent in such a way
From that village I came back home' In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives
He recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
He sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
Just as if there were a tall building in the central square and a man with good eyesight standing on top of it were to see people entering a house leaving it walking along the street and sitting in the central square

Here are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting' In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations

This verse comes at the end of the Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd where the Buddha develops the simile of a herd of cows getting safely across the ford of a raging river
The strong old bulls plunge straight in and show the way to the others  these are likened to the arahants who make their way across the flood of death to the safety of the further shore
The other members of the herd also make their way across according to their capabilities from the heifers and young oxen to the youngsters and the newborn calves just as the various groups of Buddhist followers attain the goal in due course by different methods
The Buddha of course is the one who has first cut the current of the river with his wisdom to show the way to the safety of nibbana
It is hard to know how best to translate this word in this context
Its meaning is clear enough being simply a form of the verb to cut But how does one cut a stream
We immediately think of cutting off the flow of water but this is not what happens when a river is forded
Bhikkhus anamoli and Bodhi throughout their translation of this discourse speak of the stream as being breasted This term expresses well the sense in which one boldly stands up to the current as it swirls around one's body during the crossing
I have settled upon the word penetrated although it may sound odd at first because it communicates the basic sense of cutting or parting
In other contexts such as in the Simile of the Raft the emphasis is upon crossing the flood but the image is different in this verse
Mara is the embodiment of the lower reaches of our human nature  those parts of ourselves rooted in greed hatred and delusion that prompt us to act selfishly and without care
His stream can be taken as representing samsara the onflowing of unwholesome states unskillful intentions and unfortunate karma constructions
We can follow the current of this stream willfully selfgratification being the path of least resistance or despite our best efforts we can get swept away in the mighty flood of suffering that causes us to be reborn in other afflicted states after each painful and tragic death
We can imagine the force of this imagery in the deadflat plains of Northern India which are chiseled with innumerable rushing streams and mighty rivers
The monks went on retreat for three months during the rainy season because the rivers were uncrossable as much as for any other reason
The safety of the other shore is within reach of the monks because the Buddha has shown that the crossing is possible
He has disrupted the current by his passage holding firm against the current with every step and has removed many of the obstacles and hindrances in doing so
But his followers still need to put forth their own effort to get across
The newborn calf in the Discourse of the Cowherd is not carried across the flood on someone's back but is urged across by its mother's lowing So in addition to the intrepidity of his leading example the Buddha also plays the role of the lowing mother helping even the weakest member of the herd across the danger with the compassionate encouragement of his teaching
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Vesali at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest
And on that occasion he had finished dressing in the morning and was carrying his bowl and outer robe planning to enter Vesali for alms
Then Saccaka a Nigantha while walking and wandering around to exercise his legs went to the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest
Ven
Ananda saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said to the Blessed One Venerable sir here comes Saccaka the Nigantha a debater a sophist wellregarded by people at large
He is intent on the disparagement of the Buddha the disparagement of the Dhamma the disparagement of the Sangha
It would be good if the Blessed One would sit down for a moment out of sympathy So the Blessed One sat down on a prepared seat
Then Saccaka the Nigantha went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One There are Master Gotama some brahmans  contemplatives who live committed to the development of the body but not to the development of the mind
They are touched by bodily painful feeling
It has happened in the past that when one was touched by bodily painful feeling his thighs would grow rigid his heart would burst hot blood would gush from his mouth he would go mad out of his mind
His mind was thus subservient to his body and fell under the power of the body
Why was that
A lack of development of the mind
Then there are some brahmans  contemplatives who live committed to the development of the mind but not to the development of the body
They are touched by mental painful feeling
It has happened in the past that when one was touched by mental painful feeling his thighs would grow rigid his heart would burst hot blood would gush from his mouth he would go mad out of his mind
His body was thus subservient to his mind and fell under the power of the mind
Why was that
A lack of development of the body
The thought has occurred to me that the disciples of Gotama the contemplative live committed to the development of the mind but not to the development of the body
But what have you learned Aggivessana about the development of the body
There are for example Nanda Vaccha Kisa Sankicca and Makkhali Gosala
They are clothless ascetics rejecting conventions licking their hands not coming when called not staying when asked
They don't consent to food brought to them or food dedicated to them or to an invitation to a meal
They accept nothing from the mouth of a pot or from the mouth of a bowl
They accept nothing from across a threshold across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a nursing woman from a woman living with a man from where it is announced that food is to be distributed from where a dog is waiting or flies are buzzing
They take no fish or meat
They drink no liquor wine or fermented drink
They limit themselves to one house  one morsel a day or two houses  two morsels seven houses  seven morsels
They live on one saucerful a day two seven saucerfuls a day
They take food once a day once every two days once every seven days and so on up to a fortnight devoted to regulating their intake of food
But Aggivessana do they survive just on that
No Master Gotama
Sometimes they eat outstanding staple foods chew on outstanding nonstaple foods taste outstanding delicacies and drink outstanding drinks
They rescue the body  its strength fortify it and fatten it
What they earlier abandoned Aggivessana they later gather up
This is how there is decrease  increase of the body
But what have you learned Aggivessana about the development of the mind
Yet Saccaka the Nigantha when asked by the Blessed One about the development of the mind was unable to respond
Then the Blessed One said to Saccaka The ones you described just now as developed in the development of the body That is not legitimate development of the body in the discipline of the noble ones
As you don't understand the development of the body from where would you understand the development of the mind
Nevertheless as to how one is undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind and developed in body and developed in mind listen and pay close attention
I will speak
As you say Master Gotama Saccaka responded
The Blessed One said And how is one undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind
There is the case where a pleasant feeling arises in an uneducated runofthemill person
On being touched by the pleasant feeling he becomes impassioned with pleasure and is reduced to being impassioned with pleasure
His pleasant feeling ceases
With the cessation of the pleasant feeling there arises a painful feeling
On being touched with the painful feeling he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught
When that pleasant feeling had arisen in him it invaded his mind and remained because of his lack of development of the body
When that painful feeling had arisen in him it invaded his mind and remained because of his lack of development of the mind
This is how one is undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind
And how is one developed in body and developed in mind
There is the case where a pleasant feeling arises in a welleducated disciple of the noble ones
On being touched by the pleasant feeling he doesn't become impassioned with pleasure and is not reduced to being impassioned with pleasure
His pleasant feeling ceases
With the cessation of the pleasant feeling there arises a painful feeling
On being touched with the painful feeling he doesn't sorrow grieve or lament beat his breast or becomes distraught
When that pleasant feeling had arisen in him it didn't invade his mind and remain because of his development of the body
When that painful feeling had arisen in him it didn't invade his mind and remain because of his development of the mind
This is how one is developed in body and developed in mind
I have confidence in Master Gotama that Master Gotama is developed in body and developed in mind
Well Aggivessana you are certainly being rude and presumptuously speaking your words but nevertheless I will respond to you
Ever since I shaved my hair  beard put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness it has not been possible for a pleasant feeling that has arisen to invade my mind and remain or for a painful feeling that has arisen to invade my mind and remain
But perhaps there has never arisen in Master Gotama the sort of pleasant feeling that having arisen would invade the mind and remain
Perhaps there has never arisen in Master Gotama the sort of painful feeling that having arisen would invade the mind and remain
Why wouldn't it have Aggivessana
Before my Awakening when I was still an unawakened Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me 'Household life is confining a dusty path
Life gone forth is the open air
It isn't easy living in a home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
What if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessness'
So at a later time when I was still young blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life having shaved off my hair  beard  though my parents wished otherwise and were grieving with tears on their faces  I put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness
Having gone forth in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Alara Kalama and on arrival said to him 'Friend Kalama I want to practice in this doctrine  discipline'
When this was said he replied to me 'You may stay here my friend
This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teacher's knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledge'
It was not long before I quickly learned the doctrine
As far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with others
I thought 'It isn't through mere conviction alone that Alara Kalama declares I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwells knowing  seeing this Dhamma' So I went to him and said 'To what extent do you declare that you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma' When this was said he declared the dimension of nothingness
I thought 'Not only does Alara Kalama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
I too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
What if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Alara Kalama declares he has entered  dwells in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge' So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
I went to him and said 'Friend Kalama is this the extent to which you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge'
'Yes my friend'
'This friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge'
'It is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life
So the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge
And the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
The Dhamma I know is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma I know
As I am so are you as you are so am Come friend let us now lead this community together'
In this way did Alara Kalama my teacher place me his pupil on the same level with himself and pay me great honor
But the thought occurred to me 'This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness' So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I left
In search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Uddaka Ramaputta and on arrival said to him 'Friend Uddaka I want to practice in this doctrine  discipline'
When this was said he replied to me 'You may stay here my friend
This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teacher's knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledge'
It was not long before I quickly learned the doctrine
As far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with others
I thought 'It wasn't through mere conviction alone that Rama declared I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwelled knowing  seeing this Dhamma' So I went to Uddaka and said 'To what extent did Rama declare that he had entered  dwelled in this Dhamma' When this was said Uddaka declared the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
I thought 'Not only did Rama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
I too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
What if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge' So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
I went to Uddaka and said 'Friend Uddaka is this the extent to which Rama entered  dwelled in this Dhamma having realized it for himself through direct knowledge'
'Yes my friend'
'This friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge'
'It is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life
So the Dhamma Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge
And the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge
The Dhamma he knew is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma he knew
As he was so are you as you are so was he
Come friend lead this community'
In this way did Uddaka Ramaputta my companion in the holy life place me in the position of teacher and pay me great honor
But the thought occurred to me 'This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception' So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I left
In search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I wandered by stages in the Magadhan country and came to the military town of Uruvela
There I saw some delightful countryside with an inspiring forest grove a clearflowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for almsgoing on all sides
The thought occurred to me 'How delightful is this countryside with its inspiring forest grove clearflowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for almsgoing on all sides
This is just right for the striving of a clansman intent on striving' So I sat down right there thinking 'This is just right for striving'
Then these three similes  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to me
Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of timber lying in the water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking 'I'll light a fire
I'll produce heat' Now what do you think
Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the wet sappy timber lying in the water
No Master Gotama
Why is that
Because the timber is wet  sappy and besides it is lying in the water
Eventually the man would reap only his share of weariness  disappointment
So it is with any brahman or contemplative who does not live withdrawn from sensuality in body  mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst  fever for sensuality is not relinquished  stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is incapable of knowledge vision  unexcelled selfawakening
This was the first simile  spontaneous never before heard  that appeared to me
Then a second simile  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to me
Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking 'I'll light a fire
I'll produce heat' Now what do you think
Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the wet sappy timber lying on land far from water
No Master Gotama
Why is that
Because the timber is wet  sappy even though it is lying on land far from water
Eventually the man would reap only his share of weariness  disappointment
So it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body only but whose desire infatuation urge thirst  fever for sensuality is not relinquished  stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is incapable of knowledge vision  unexcelled selfawakening
This was the second simile  spontaneous never before heard  that appeared to me
Then a third simile  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to me
Suppose there were a dry sapless piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking 'I'll light a fire
I'll produce heat' Now what do you think
Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the dry sapless timber lying on land
Yes Master Gotama
Why is that
Because the timber is dry  sapless and besides it is lying on land far from water
So it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body  mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst  fever for sensuality is relinquished  stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is capable of knowledge vision  unexcelled selfawakening
This was the third simile  spontaneous never before heard  that appeared to me
I thought 'Suppose that I clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth were to beat down constrain  crush my mind with my awareness' So clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth I beat down constrained  crushed my mind with my awareness
Just as a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain  crush him in the same way I beat down constrained  crushed my mind with my awareness
As I did so sweat poured from my armpits
And although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused  uncalm because of the painful exertion
But the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
I thought 'Suppose I were to become absorbed in the trance of nonbreathing' So I stopped the inbreaths  outbreaths in my nose  mouth
As I did so there was a loud roaring of winds coming out my earholes just like the loud roar of winds coming out of a smith's bellows So I stopped the inbreaths  outbreaths in my nose  mouth  ears
As I did so extreme forces sliced through my head just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword Extreme pains arose in my head just as if a strong man were tightening a turban made of tough leather straps around my head Extreme forces carved up my stomach cavity just as if a butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox There was an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms were to roast  broil him over a pit of hot embers
And although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused  uncalm because of the painful exertion
But the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
Devas on seeing me said 'Gotama the contemplative is dead' Other devas said 'He isn't dead he's dying' Others said 'He's neither dead nor dying he's an arahant for this is the way arahants live'
I thought 'Suppose I were to practice going altogether without food' Then devas came to me and said 'Dear sir please don't practice going altogether without food
If you go altogether without food we'll infuse divine nourishment in through your pores and you will survive on that' I thought 'If I were to claim to be completely fasting while these devas are infusing divine nourishment in through my pores I would be lying' So I dismissed them saying 'Enough'
I thought 'Suppose I were to take only a little food at a time only a handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soup' So I took only a little food at a time only a handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soup
My body became extremely emaciated
Simply from my eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems My backside became like a camel's hoof My spine stood out like a string of beads My ribs jutted out like the jutting rafters of an old rundown barn The gleam of my eyes appeared to be sunk deep in my eye sockets like the gleam of water deep in a well My scalp shriveled  withered like a green bitter gourd shriveled  withered in the heat  the wind The skin of my belly became so stuck to my spine that when I thought of touching my belly I grabbed hold of my spine as well and when I thought of touching my spine I grabbed hold of the skin of my belly as well If I urinated or defecated I fell over on my face right there Simply from my eating so little if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair  rotted at its roots  fell from my body as I rubbed simply from eating so little
People on seeing me would say 'Gotama the contemplative is black' Other people would say 'Gotama the contemplative isn't black he's brown' Others would say 'Gotama the contemplative is neither black nor brown he's goldenskinned' So much had the clear bright color of my skin deteriorated simply from eating so little
I thought 'Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the past have felt painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost
None have been greater than this
Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the future will feel painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost
None will be greater than this
Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the present are feeling painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost
None is greater than this
But with this racking practice of austerities I haven't attained any superior human state any distinction in knowledge or vision worthy of the noble ones
Could there be another path to Awakening'
I thought 'I recall once when my father the Sakyan was working and I was sitting in the cool shade of a roseapple tree then  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities  I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
Could that be the path to Awakening' Then following on that memory came the realization 'That is the path to Awakening' I thought 'So why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities' I thought 'I am no longer afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities but that pleasure is not easy to achieve with a body so extremely emaciated
Suppose I were to take some solid food some rice  porridge' So I took some solid food some rice  porridge
Now five monks had been attending on me thinking 'If Gotama our contemplative achieves some higher state he will tell us' But when they saw me taking some solid food  some rice  porridge  they were disgusted and left me thinking 'Gotama the contemplative is living luxuriously
He has abandoned his exertion and is backsliding into abundance'
So when I had taken solid food and regained strength then  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
With the fading of rapture I remained equanimous mindful  alert and sensed pleasure with the body
I entered  remained in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  I entered  remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives
I recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth twofive tenfifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  details
This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beings
I saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations
I discerned as it was actually present that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignorance
With release there was the knowledge 'Released' I discerned that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
I recall having taught the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds and yet each one of them assumes of me 'Gotama the contemplative is teaching the Dhamma attacking just me' but it shouldn't be seen in that way
The Tathagata rightly teaches them the Dhamma simply for the purpose of giving knowledge
At the end of that very talk I steady the mind inwardly settle it concentrate it and unify it in the same theme of concentration as before in which I almost constantly dwell
That is credible for the Master Gotama as would be the case for one who is worthy  rightly selfawakened
But does the Master Gotama recall sleeping during the day
I recall Aggivessana in the last month of the hot season after the meal returning from my almsround setting out my outer robe folded in four lying down on my right side and falling asleep while mindful  alert
There are some brahmans  contemplatives Master Gotama who would call that dwelling in delusion
It's not to that extent that one is deluded or undeluded Aggivessana
As to how one is deluded or undeluded listen and pay close attention
I will speak
As you say Master Gotama Saccaka responded
The Blessed One said In whomever the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death are not abandoned Him I call deluded
For it is from not abandoning the fermentations that one is deluded
In whomever the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death are abandoned Him I call undeluded
For it is from abandoning the fermentations that one is undeluded
In the Tathagata Aggivessana the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arising
Just as a palmyra cut off at the crown is incapable of further growth in the same way in the Tathagata the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arising
When this was said Saccaka the Nigantha said to the Blessed One It's amazing Master Gotama
It's astounding  that when Master Gotama is addressed rudely again  again is assailed by presumptuous courses of speech the color of his skin brightens the color of his face clears as would be the case with one who is worthy and rightly selfawakened
I recall engaging Purana Kassapa in debate
He when engaged in debate by me spoke evasively and led the discussion astray displayed irritation aversion  peevishness
But when Master Gotama is addressed rudely again  again is assailed by presumptuous courses of speech the color of his skin brightens the color of his face clears as would be the case with one who is worthy and rightly selfawakened
I recall engaging Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakambala Pakudha KaccayanaSañjaya Velatthaputta Nigantha Nataputa in debate
He when engaged in debate by me spoke evasively and led the discussion astray displayed irritation aversion  peevishness
But when Master Gotama is addressed rudely again  again is assailed by presumptuous courses of speech the color of his skin brightens the color of his face clears as would be the case with one who is worthy and rightly selfawakened
And now Master Gotama I am going
Many are my duties many my responsibilities
Then do Aggivessana what you think it is now time to do
So Saccaka the Nigantha delighting in  approving of the Blessed One's words got up from his seat and left
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesālī at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest
And on that occasion Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason was dwelling in Vesālī  a debater a sophist wellregarded by people at large
He made this statement before the assembly in Vesālī I see no contemplative or brahman the head of an order the head of a group or even one who claims to be an arahant rightly selfawakened who  engaged in debate with me  would not shiver quiver shake  break out in sweat under the armpits
Even if I were to engage a senseless stump in debate it  engaged with me in debate  would shiver quiver  shake to say nothing of a human being
Then early in the morning Ven
Assaji adjusted his under robe and  carrying his bowl  robes  went into Vesālī for alms
Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason walking  wandering around Vesālī to exercise his legs saw Ven
Assaji coming from afar
On seeing him he went up to him and exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to him Master Assaji how does Gotama the contemplative discipline his disciples
Or what part of his instruction is generally presented to his disciples
Aggivessana the Blessed One disciplines his disciples in this way this part of the Blessed One's instruction is generally presented to his disciples 'Form is inconstant
Feeling is inconstant
Perception is inconstant
Fabrications are inconstant
Consciousness is inconstant
Form is notself
Feeling is notself
Perception is notself
Fabrications are notself
Consciousness is notself
All fabrications are inconstant
All phenomena are notself' This Aggivessana is the way in which the Blessed One disciplines his disciples this part of the Blessed One's instruction is generally presented to his disciples
What a bad thing to hear we have heard Master Assaji when we have heard that Gotama the contemplative teaches this sort of thing
Perhaps sooner or later we might go to meet with Gotama the contemplative
Perhaps there might be some discussion
Perhaps we might pry him away from that evil viewpoint
Now on that occasion five hundred Licchavis had gathered at a meeting hall on some business or other
So Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason went to those Licchavis and on arrival said to them Come out good Licchavis
Come out good Licchavis
Today will be my discussion with Gotama the contemplative
If he takes the position with me that was taken with me by his famous disciples the monk named Assaji then just as a strong man seizing a longhaired ram by the hair would drag him to and drag him fro and drag him all around in the same way I statement by statement will drag Gotama the contemplative to and drag him fro and drag him all around
Just as a strong distillery worker throwing a large distiller's strainer into a deep water tank and grabbing it by the corners would drag it to and drag it fro and drag it all around in the same way I statement by statement will drag Gotama the contemplative to and drag him fro and drag him all around
Just as a strong distillery ruffian grabbing a horsehair strainer by the corners would shake it down and shake it out and thump it in the same way I statement by statement will shake Gotama the contemplative down and shake him out and thump him
Just as a sixtyyear old elephant plunging into a deep pond would amuse itself playing the game of hempwashing in the same way I will amuse myself playing the game of hempwashing Gotama the contemplative as it were
Come on out good Licchavis
Come on out good Licchavis
Today will be my discussion with Gotama the contemplative
Then some of the Licchavis said Who is Gotama the contemplative that he will refute the statement of Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason
It's Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason who will refute the statement of Gotama the contemplative Some of the Licchavis said Who is Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason that he will refute the statement of Gotama the contemplative
It's Gotama the contemplative who will refute the statement of Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason
So Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason surrounded by five hundred Licchavis went to the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest
Now on that occasion a large number of monks were doing walking meditation in the open air
So Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason went up to the monks and said Where masters is Master Gotama now
We want to see Master Gotama
The Blessed One Aggivessana having plunged into the Great Forest is sitting under a certain tree for the day's abiding
Then Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason together with a large group of Licchavis plunged into the Great Forest and went to the Blessed One
On arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
Some of the Licchavis having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
Some of the Licchavis exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one side
Some of the Licchavis having raised their hands palmtopalm in front of the chest sat to one side
Some of the Licchavis after announcing their name and clan sat to one side
Some of the Licchavis staying silent sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I would like to question Master Gotama on a certain point if Master Gotama would grant me the favor of an answer to the question
Ask Aggivessana as you see fit
How does Master Gotama discipline his disciples
Or what part of his instruction is generally presented to his disciples
Aggivessana I discipline my disciples in this way this part of my instruction is generally presented to my disciples 'Form is inconstant
Feeling is inconstant
Perception is inconstant
Fabrications are inconstant
Consciousness is inconstant
Form is notself
Feeling is notself
Perception is notself
Fabrications are notself
Consciousness is notself
All fabrications are inconstant
All phenomena are notself' This Aggivessana is the way in which I discipline my disciples this part of my instruction is generally presented to my disciples
A simile occurs to me Master Gotama
Let it occur to you Aggivessana
Just as any seeds that exhibit growth increase  proliferation all do so in dependence on the earth or just as any activities requiring strength that are done all are done in dependence on the earth in the same way Master Gotama an individual with form as self taking a stance on form produces merit or demerit
An individual with feeling as self with perception as self with fabrications as self with consciousness as self taking a stance on consciousness produces merit or demerit
Then Aggivessana are you saying 'Form is my self feeling is my self perception is my self fabrications are my self consciousness is my self'
Yes Master Gotama I'm saying that 'Form is my self feeling is my self perception is my self fabrications are my self consciousness is my self' As does this great multitude 
What does this great multitude have to do with you
Please focus just on your own assertion
Yes Master Gotama I'm saying that 'Form is my self feeling is my self perception is my self fabrications are my self consciousness is my self' Very well then Aggivessana I will crossquestion you on this matter
Answer as you see fit
What do you think
Would a consecrated noblewarrior king  such as King Pasenadi of Kosala or King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha  wield the power in his own domain to execute those who deserve execution to fine those who deserve to be fined and to banish those who deserve to be banished
Yes Master Gotama he would wield the power in his own domain to execute those who deserve execution to fine those who deserve to be fined and to banish those who deserve to be banished
Even these oligarchic groups such as the Vajjians  Mallans wield the power in their own domains to execute those who deserve execution to fine those who deserve to be fined and to banish those who deserve to be banished to say nothing of a consecrated noblewarrior king such as King Pasenadi of Kosala or King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha
He would wield it and he would deserve to wield it
What do you think Aggivessana
When you say 'Form is my self' do you wield power over that form 'May my form be thus may my form not be thus'
When this was said Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason was silent
A second time the Blessed One said to Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason What do you think Aggivessana
When you say 'Form is my self' do you wield power over that form 'May my form be thus may my form not be thus'
When this was said Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason was silent a second time
Then the Blessed One said to him Answer now Aggivessana
This is not the time to be silent
When anyone doesn't answer when asked a legitimate question by the Tathāgata up to three times his head splits into seven pieces right here
Now on that occasion the spirit Vajirapāṇin carrying an iron thunderbolt was poised in the air above Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason If Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason doesn't answer when asked a legitimate question by the Blessed One up to three times I will split his head into seven pieces right here
The Blessed One saw the spirit Vajirapāṇin as did Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason
So Saccaka  afraid terrified his hair standing on end  seeking shelter in the Blessed One seeking a caveasylum in the Blessed One seeking refuge in the Blessed One  said to the Blessed One Let Master Gotama ask me
I will answer
What do you think Aggivessana
When you say 'Form is my self' do you wield power over that form 'May my form be thus may my form not be thus'
No Master Gotama
Pay attention Aggivessana and answer after having paid attention
What you said after isn't consistent with what you said before nor is what you said before consistent with what you said after
What do you think Aggivessana
When you say 'Feeling is my self Perception is my self Fabrications are my self Consciousness is my self' do you wield power over that consciousness 'May my consciousness be thus may my consciousness not be thus'
No Master Gotama
Pay attention Aggivessana and answer after having paid attention
What you said after isn't consistent with what you said before nor is what you said before consistent with what you said after
What do you think Aggivessana
Is form constant or inconstant
Inconstant Master Gotama
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful Master Gotama
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No Master Gotama
Is feeling constant or inconstant
Inconstant Master Gotama
Is perception constant or inconstant
Inconstant Master Gotama
Are fabrications constant or inconstant
Inconstant Master Gotama
What do you think Aggivessana
Is consciousness constant or inconstant
Inconstant Master Gotama
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful Master Gotama
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No Master Gotama
What do you think Aggivessana
When one adheres to stress holds to stress is attached to stress and envisions of stress that 'This is mine this is my self this is what I am' would he comprehend stress or dwell having totally destroyed stress
How could that be Master Gotama
No Master Gotama
That being the case Aggivessana don't you adhere to stress hold to stress aren't you attached to stress and don't you envision of stress that 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
How could that not be the case Master Gotama
Yes Master Gotama
Suppose a man  in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood  were to enter a forest taking a sharp ax
There he would see a large plantain trunk straight young immature
He would cut it at the root and having cut it at the root cut off the crown
Having cut off the crown he would unfurl the leaf sheaths
Unfurling the leaf sheaths he wouldn't even find sapwood there to say nothing of heartwood
In the same way Aggivessana when you are interrogated rebuked  pressed by me with regard to your own statement you are empty void mistaken
But it was you who made this statement before the assembly in Vesālī 'I see no contemplative or brahman the head of an order the head of a group or even one who claims to be an arahant rightly selfawakened who  engaged in debate with me  would not shiver quiver shake  break out in sweat under the armpits
Even if I were to engage a senseless stump in debate it  engaged with me in debate  would shiver quiver  shake to say nothing of a human being' But now some drops of sweat coming out of your forehead drenching your upper robe are landing on the ground whereas now I have no sweat on my body And the Blessed One uncovered his goldencolored body to the assembly
When this was said Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason fell silent abashed sitting with his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words
Then Dummukha the Licchavison  sensing that Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason was silent abashed sitting with his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words  said to the Blessed One Lord a simile has occurred to me
Let it occur to you Dummukha the Blessed One said
Suppose lord that not far from a village or town was a pond
There in it was a crab
Then a number of boys  girls leaving the village or town would go to the pond and on arrival would go down to bathe in it
Taking the crab out of the water they would place it on the ground
And whenever the crab extended a leg the boys or girls would cut it off break it and smash it with sticks or stones right there so that the crab  with all its legs cut off broken  smashed  would be unable to get back in the water as before
In the same way whatever Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason's writhings capers  contortions the Blessed One has cut them off broken them and smashed them all so that Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason is now unable to approach the Blessed One again for the purpose of debate
When this was said Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason said to Dummukha the Licchavison Just you wait Dummukha
Just you wait Dummukha
You're a bigmouth Dummukha
We're not taking counsel with you
We're here taking counsel with Master Gotama Let that be Master Gotama our words  those of other ordinary contemplatives  brahmans  prattled prattling as it were
Now Master Gotama to what extent is a disciple of Master Gotama one who carries out his message carries out his instruction one who has crossed over  beyond doubt one with no more questioning one who has gained fearlessness and dwells independent of others with regard to the Teacher's message
There is the case Aggivessana where a disciple of mine sees with right discernment any form whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form as it has come to be  as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
He sees with right discernment any feeling any perception any fabrications any consciousness whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness as it has come to be  as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
It's to this extent Aggivessana that a disciple of mine is one who carries out my message carries out my instruction one who has crossed over  beyond doubt one with no more questioning one who has gained fearlessness and dwells independent of others with regard to the Teacher's message
And to what extent Master Gotama is a monk an arahant one whose mental effluents are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal laid to waste the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis
There is the case Aggivessana where a monk  having seen with right discernment any form whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form as it has come to be  as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am' is through lack of clingingsustenance released
Having seen with right discernment any feeling any perception any fabrications any consciousness whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness as it has come to be  as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am' he is through lack of clingingsustenance released
It's to this extent Aggivessana that a monk is an arahant one whose mental effluents are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal laid to waste the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis
One thus released is endowed with three unsurpassables unsurpassable vision unsurpassable practice unsurpassable release
And a monk whose mind is thus released still honors respects reveres  worships the Tathāgata Awakened the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma for awakening
Tamed the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma for taming
Tranquil the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma for tranquility
Having crossed over the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma for crossing over
Totally unbound the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma for total Unbinding
When this was said Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason said to the Blessed One It is we Master Gotama who were insolent we who were reckless in that we construed that Master Gotama could be attacked statement by statement
For there might be safety for a person who has attacked a rutting elephant but there is no safety for a person who has attacked Master Gotama
There might be safety for a person who has attacked a mass of fire but there is no safety for a person who has attacked Master Gotama
There might be safety for a person who has attacked a fanged snake a poisonous snake but there is no safety for a person who has attacked Master Gotama
It is we Master Gotama who were insolent we who were reckless in that we construed that Master Gotama could be attacked statement by statement
May Master Gotama together with the community of monks acquiesce to my offer of tomorrow's meal
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason sensing the Blessed One's acquiescence addressed the Licchavis Listen Master Licchavis
Gotama the contemplative is invited for tomorrow together with the community of monks
Offer to me what you construe to be proper for him
Then after the night had passed the Licchavis offered to Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason a food offering of approximately five hundred oblationdishes
Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason after having exquisite staple  nonstaple food prepared in his own monastery announced the time to the Blessed One It's time Master Gotama
The meal is ready
So the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his under robe and  carrying his bowl  robes  went together with the community of monks to Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason's monastery
On arrival he sat down on a seat laid out
Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason with his own hand served  satisfied the community of monks headed by the Blessed One with exquisite staple  nonstaple food
Then when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl Saccaka the Nigaṇṭhason taking a lower seat sat down to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama may the merit and accoutrements of the merit of this gift be exclusively for the happiness of the donors
Aggivessana whatever has come from a recipient such as you  not without passion not without aversion not without delusion  that will be for the donors
Whatever has come from a recipient such as me  without passion without aversion without delusion  that will be for you
For more on the Buddha's approach to argument and debate see Skill in Questions chapters one and five
This sutta teaches how to understand the relationship of consciousness to rebirth in a way that helps put an end to rebirth
Although the Buddha never used any word corresponding to rebirth in his teachings he did describe birth as a process following on death again and again as long as the appropriate conditions are present
In other words even though he didn't use the word rebirth his teachings on birth are teachings on repeated birth how it happens how it inherently involves suffering and stress and how it can be brought to an end
The idea that death can be followed by birth was not universally accepted in India in the Buddha's time
As DN and MN show some prominent contemplative schools actively rejected the idea of rebirth while others affirmed it
Thus when the Buddha taught rebirth he wasn't simply following an unexamined cultural assumption
He was consciously taking a stand on one of the controversial issues of his time
However his explanation of rebirth differed from other schools on both sides of the issue in that he avoided the question of whether or not there's a what that gets reborn or if there is a what what it is
He also discouraged such speculations as If I take rebirth what was I in the past and what will I be in the future 
He put all these questions aside because they interfered with the path of practice leading to the end of suffering
Instead he focused on the process of how birth happens because the process involves factors that are immediately apparent to one's awareness throughout life and lie enough under one's control to turn them toward the ending of birth
An understanding of the process as process  and in particular as an example of the process of dependent coarising  can actually contribute to the end to suffering because it gives guidance in how to apply the tasks appropriate for the four noble truths to all the factors in the process leading up to birth
One of the salient features of dependent coarising is its lack of outside context
In other words it avoids any reference to the presence or absence of a self around or a world behind the processes it describes
This allows one to focus directly on the factors of the process as factors parts of a causal chain
And this in turn makes it easier to notice which factors  such as ignorance  cause suffering and should thus be abandoned which ones  such as attention and intention  can be converted to the path to the end of suffering and so should be developed before they too are abandoned and which ones  such as clinging and becoming  constitute suffering and so should be comprehended to the point of disenchantment and dispassion leading to release
This sutta concerns a monk  Sāti the Fisherman's Son  who refuses to heed the Buddha's care in treating all the elements of the process of wandering on from birth to birth as processes
Sāti states that in his understanding of the Buddha's teachings consciousness is the what that does the wandering on
His fellow monks and then the Buddha treat him and his erroneous view in a way that parallels the way they treat Ariṭṭha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers in MN
First the narrator notes that the view is not merely wrong but actually evil and pernicious To adopt it would be to place an obstacle in one's path
The monks try unsuccessfully to dissuade Sāti from his view after which they report the case to the Buddha
The Buddha calls Sāti into his presence and after ascertaining that Sāti will not abandon his view even when reprimanded by the Buddha himself he abandons Sāti as too recalcitrant to teach and turns to crossquestion the monks as to the relevant right view of how consciousness functions in the process leading to repeated birth
The Buddha's treatment of Sāti might seem harsh but he is actually acting out of compassion for the monks in the assembly in case any of them might be swayed by Sāti's position
Seeing Sāti as a lost cause the Buddha doesn't want this lost cause to cause further losses among the other monks
We have to remember that during the Buddha's lifetime there were no written accounts of his teachings the monks and nuns all had to rely on their memory of what they had heard directly from him or through wordofmouth from fellow members of the Saṅgha
Thus the Buddha saw the need to establish orthodoxy whenever a member of the Saṅgha was espousing false interpretations of his teaching
Because Sāti's pernicious view deals with issues that are much more complex than those touched on in Ariṭṭha's the Buddha's crossquestioning of the monks here is correspondingly longer and more complex than in MN
However the complexity can be comprehended by keeping in mind that essentially the crossquestioning aims at accomplishing two things at once In providing a correct understanding of consciousness as a conditioned phenomenon it also shows why the sort of question Sāti was trying to answer is illconceived
The first part of the crossquestioning treats the conditioned nature of consciousness as a process in the context of two frameworks the standard description of the factors of dependent coarising and the four nutriments of consciousness
Following the pattern of dependent coarising the Buddha first classifies consciousness in terms of the way it arises in dependence on the six sensemedia
This analysis points to the way consciousness functions as a subfactor under the factor of contact in dependent coarising
It's in dependence on a pair that consciousness comes into play
And how does consciousness come into play in dependence on a pair
In dependence on the eye  forms there arises eyeconsciousness
The eye is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Forms are inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Thus this pair is both wavering  fluctuating  inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Eyeconsciousness is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Whatever is the cause the requisite condition for the arising of eyeconsciousness that is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Having arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor how could eyeconsciousness be constant
The coming together the meeting the convergence of these three phenomena is eyecontact

The discussion then switches to consciousness as dependent on four types of nutriment physical food contact intellectual intention and consciousness itself
Here the sutta focuses on the need  in practice  to see this dependence as it actually occurs and on the need to use this view for the proper purpose
As other passages in the Canon point out the purpose of all Dhamma teachings is to induce the disenchantmentdistaste for the nutriment that will allow for release
For a monk practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma this is what accords with the Dhamma that he keep cultivating disenchantmentdistaste with regard to form feeling perception fabrications consciousness
As he keeps cultivating disenchantmentdistaste with regard to form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness
As he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he is totally released from form feeling perception fabrications consciousness
He is totally released from sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
He is totally released I tell you from suffering  stress 
Just as the ocean has a single taste  that of salt  in the same way this DhammaVinaya has a single taste that of release
In other words the ability of the monks to give in unison the right answers to the Buddha's questions does not fulfill the teaching's purpose
The right answers are meant to be used as tools to induce a sense of disenchantmentdistaste for continued feeding on the processes leading to suffering
This sense of disenchantmentdistaste is what leads to release
The reference to the raft analogy here is another point on which this sutta parallels MN in which the monks also give correct answers in unison to the Buddha's questions
Perhaps the reason for why the raft analogy is cited in both suttas is that it was seen as a corrective for the sort of complacency that can come when one can recite with others an orthodox view
At any rate the discussion of consciousness in the framework of nutriment is then tied into the discussion of dependent coarising through the fact that nutriment is dependent on craving
This places nutriment in the position of clingingsustenance in dependent coarising  as dependent on craving and acting as a condition for becoming
This placement is affirmed by passages elsewhere in the Canon that speak of consciousness plus its nutriment as among the subfactors providing the conditions for further becoming
Kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moisture
The consciousness of living beings hindered by ignorance  fettered by craving is established intuned to a lower property a middling property a refined property
Thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future
This is how there is becoming 
Like the earth property monks is how the four standingspots for consciousness should be seen
Like the liquid property is how delight  passion should be seen
Like the five types of propagation is how consciousness together with its nutriment should be seen 
Given that consciousness also functions at a point in dependent coarising prior to sensory contact  as following on fabrication and preceding nameandform  it thus plays a role at three stages in the process as a factor following on fabrication as a subfactor of contact and as a subfactor of clinging
The remainder of the Buddha's crossquestioning of the monks further explores the framework of dependent coarising arriving at the conclusion that a person thus trained in understanding dependent coarising would no longer be interested in pursuing questions of identity and existence  such as Am I Am I not What am I What was I What will I be This is because as MN points out such questions are instances of inappropriate attention and as SN
points out the framework of dependent coarising classes inappropriate attention under the factor of name as a cause of suffering
Thus the discussion arrives at the reasons why the Buddha was so careful to put the sort of question asked and answered by Sāti aside
The sutta then turns to the path of practice by which an understanding of dependent coarising can gain the power and focus needed to put an end to suffering
It begins with an account of birth noting that the birth of a human being requires not only that the parents have intercourse when the mother is in her season but also that a gandhabba is present
Usually in the Canon the term gandhabba means a being on the lowest level of the celestial devas  devas who are often represented as obsessed with lust
However the Commentary notes that gandhabba in this context means a being whose kamma enables it to take birth on that occasion an interpretation supported by a discussion in MN
By introducing a being into the discussion the Buddha might be suspected of introducing a what into his discussion of birth
However on the level of dependent coarising the Buddha did not treat the concept of a being as a what His definition of a being shows that he recommended that it too be regarded as a process
As he was sitting there Ven
Rādha said to the Blessed One 'A being' lord
'A being' it's said
To what extent is one said to be 'a being'
Any desire passion delight or craving for form Rādha When one is caught up there tied up there one is said to be 'a being'
Any desire passion delight or craving for feeling perception fabrications
Any desire passion delight or craving for consciousness Rādha When one is caught up there tied up there one is said to be 'a being' 
Thus the Buddha advocated viewing a being simply as a process of attachment to desire passion delight and craving
And it is precisely this attachment to craving that allows for rebirth after death
Just as a fire burns with sustenance and not without sustenance even so I designate the rebirth of one who has sustenance and not of one without sustenance
But Master Gotama at the moment a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance what do you designate as its sustenance then
Vaccha when a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance I designate it as windsustained for the wind is its sustenance at that time
And at the moment when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body what do you designate as its sustenance then
Vaccha when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body I designate it as cravingsustained for craving is its sustenance at that time 
However a being  in the Buddha's sense of the term  not only takes birth after the death of the body it can also take birth die and be reborn many times in the course of a day  as attachment develops for one desire ends and then develops for another desire
This is why the processes leading to rebirth after death can be observed and redirected in the present moment during life
This is why the ability to understand and observe the processes of dependent coarising is so important in putting an end to rebirth on all its many levels
To emphasize the desirability of putting an end to rebirth the sutta moves from the topic of conception to note the pains and anxieties suffered by the mother in carrying the fetus and giving birth
But then what does her child do
He spends his time in trivial pursuits childish games and then as he grows older the quest for sensual pleasures
If the child  now an adult  realizes the limited nature of such an existence he gains conviction in the need to practice the Dhamma
He becomes a monk develops virtue and concentration and then on the basis of his attainment in concentration he approaches the senses in a way that overcomes the limitations experienced by one who approaches them simply for the pursuit of sensual pleasure
This the Buddha says is a short description of the destruction of craving  and by implication of the ending of the consciousness and the birth that depend on craving as a condition
One of the ironies in the organization of the sutta is that after a long detailed discussion of discernment virtue and concentration the description of how these factors actually are brought together to arrive at the end of craving and birth leaves out many important details
For instance there is no discussion of how once the monk has attained concentration he uses it wisely in such a way that actually puts an end to craving
As the Buddha states in other suttas  such as MN MN and AN
 it is possible to attain strong states of concentration and use them not as a basis of release but as a basis for increased defilement and attachment
This means that the Buddha is not being coy when he states at the end of this long sutta that his discussion of the destruction of craving is brief
It's up to the reader to put the elements of triple training together in practice to see how they lead from a limited awareness through a limitless awareness to total release
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove Anāthapiṇḍika's park
Now on that occasion this pernicious viewpoint had arisen in the monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not another A large number of monks heard They say that this pernicious viewpoint has arisen in the monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son 'As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not another' So they went to the monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son and on arrival said to him Is it true friend Sāti that this pernicious viewpoint has arisen in you  'As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not another'
Exactly so friends
I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One such that it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not another
Then those monks desiring to pry the monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son away from that pernicious viewpoint quizzed him back  forth and rebuked him saying Don't say that friend Sāti
Don't slander the Blessed One for it is not good to slander the Blessed One
The Blessed One would not say anything like that
In many ways friend the Blessed One has said of dependently coarisen consciousness 'Apart from a requisite condition there is no comingintoplay of consciousness' And yet even though he was quizzed back  forth and rebuked by those monks the monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son through stubbornness and attachment to that very same pernicious viewpoint continued to insist Exactly so friends
I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One such that it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not another
So when the monks were unable to pry the monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son away from that pernicious viewpoint they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they
So the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk
In my name call the monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son saying 'The Teacher calls you friend Sāti' As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to the monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son on arrival he said The Teacher calls you friend Sāti
As you say friend the monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son replied
Then he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Sāti that this pernicious view has arisen in you  'As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not another'
Exactly so lord
As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not another
Which consciousness Sāti is that 
This speaker this knower lord that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  evil actions
Then the Blessed One said to the monks What do you think monks
Is this monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son even warm in this Dhamma  Vinaya
How could he be lord
No lord
When this was said the monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son sat silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words
Then the Blessed One seeing that the monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son was sitting silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words said to him Worthless man you will be recognized for your own pernicious viewpoint
I will crossquestion the monks on this matter
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks do you too understand the Dhamma as taught by me in the same way that the monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son does when through his own poor grasp he not only slanders us but also digs himself up and produces much demerit for himself
No lord for in many ways the Blessed One has said of dependently coarisen consciousness 'Apart from a requisite condition there is no comingintoplay of consciousness' It's good monks that you understand the Dhamma taught by me in this way for in many ways I have said of dependently coarisen consciousness 'Apart from a requisite condition there is no comingintoplay of consciousness' But this monk Sāti the Fisherman's Son through his own poor grasp has not only slandered us but has also dug himself up producing much demerit for himself
That will lead to this worthless man's longterm harm  suffering
Consciousness monks is classified simply by the requisite condition in dependence on which it arises

Monks there are these four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be born
Which four
Physical food gross or refined contact as the second intellectual intention the third and consciousness the fourth
Now these four nutriments have what as their cause what as their origination through what are they born through what are they brought into being
These four nutriments have craving as their cause craving as their origination are born from craving are brought into being from craving
And this craving has what as its cause what as its origination through what is it born through what is it brought into being
Craving has feeling as its cause is brought into being through feeling
And this feeling has what as its cause through what is it brought into being
Feeling has contact as its cause
And this contact has what as its cause through what is it brought into being
Contact has the six sensemedia as its cause
And these six sensemedia have what as their cause through what are they brought into being
The six sensemedia have nameform as their cause
And this nameform has what as its cause through what is it brought into being
Nameform has consciousness as its cause
And this consciousness has what as its cause through what is it brought into being
Consciousness has fabrications as its cause
And these fabrications have what as their cause through what are they brought into being
Fabrications have ignorance as their cause ignorance as their origination are born from ignorance are brought into being from ignorance
'From birth as a requisite condition comes agingdeath' Thus was it said
Now monks is it the case that from birth as a requisite condition comes agingdeath or not or how is it here
Lord from birth as a requisite condition comes agingdeath
That's how it is for us here From birth as a requisite condition comes agingdeath
'From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications' Thus was it said
Now monks is it the case that from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications or not or how is it here
Lord from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications
That's how it is for us here From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications
It's good monks that you say that and I say that too
When this is that is
From the arising of this comes the arising of that
'From the cessation of birth comes the cessation of agingdeath' Thus was it said
Now monks is it the case that from the cessation of birth comes the cessation of agingdeath or not or how is it here

It's good monks that you say that and I say that too
When this isn't that isn't
From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that
Now monks knowing thus and seeing thus would you run after the past thinking 'Were we in the past
Were we not in the past
What were we in the past
How were we in the past
Having been what what were we in the past'
No lord
Knowing thus and seeing thus would you run after the future thinking 'Shall we be in the future
Shall we not be in the future
What shall we be in the future
How shall we be in the future
Having been what what shall we be in the future'
No lord
Knowing thus and seeing thus would you be inwardly perplexed about the immediate present thinking 'Am I
Am I not

How am I
Where has this being come from
Where is it bound'
No lord
Knowing thus and seeing thus would you say 'The Teacher is our respected mentor
We speak thus out of respect for the Teacher'
No lord
Knowing thus and seeing thus would you say 'The Contemplative says this
We speak thus in line with the Contemplative's words'
No lord
Knowing thus and seeing thus would you dedicate yourselves to another teacher
No lord
Knowing thus and seeing thus would you return to the observances grand ceremonies  auspicious rites of common contemplatives  brahmans as having any essence
No lord
Is it the case that you speak simply in line with what you have known seen  understood for yourselves
Yes lord
Good monks
You have been guided by me in this Dhamma which is to be seen here  now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the observant for themselves
For it has been said 'This Dhamma is to be seen here  now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be by the observant for themselves' and it was in reference to this that it was said
Then for nine or ten months the mother shelters the embryo in her womb with great anxiety as a heavy burden
Then at the end of nine or ten months she gives birth with great anxiety as a heavy burden
Then when the child is born she feeds it with her own blood  for mother's milk is called blood in the discipline of the noble ones
Then as the child grows and his faculties mature he plays at children's games toy plows stick games somersaults toy windmills toy measures toy carts and a toy bow  arrow
As he grows and his faculties mature he enjoys himself provided  endowed with the five strings of sensuality forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing enticing accompanied with sensual desire sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable via the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing enticing accompanied with sensual desire
On seeing a form with the eye he is infatuated with pleasing forms and gets upset over unpleasing forms
He dwells with bodymindfulness unestablished with limited awareness
He doesn't discern as it has come to be the awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease where those evil unskillful qualities cease without remainder
Engaged thus in compliance  opposition he relishes any feeling he feels  pleasure pain neitherpleasurenorpain  welcomes it  remains fastened to it
As he relishes that feeling welcomes it  remains fastened to it delight arises
Now any delight in feeling is clingingsustenance
From his clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth
From birth as a requisite condition then agingdeath sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress  suffering
On hearing a sound with the ear
On smelling an aroma with the nose
On tasting a flavor with the tongue
On sensing a tactile sensation with the body
On cognizing an idea with the intellect he is infatuated with pleasing ideas and gets upset over unpleasing ideas
He dwells with bodymindfulness unestablished with limited awareness
He doesn't discern as it has come to be the awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease where those evil unskillful qualities cease without remainder
Engaged thus in compliance  opposition he relishes any feeling he feels  pleasure pain neitherpleasurenorpain  welcomes it  remains fastened to it
As he relishes that feeling welcomes it  remains fastened to it delight arises
Now any delight in feeling is clingingsustenance
From his clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth
From birth as a requisite condition then agingdeath sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress  suffering
Now there is the case where a Tathāgata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakened
He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its end
He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
He hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathāgata and reflects 'Household life is confining a dusty path
Life gone forth is the open air
It isn't easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
What if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessness'
So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness
When he has thus gone forth endowed with the monks' training  livelihood then  abandoning the taking of life  he abstains from the taking of life
He dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given
He takes only what is given accepts only what is given lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure
This too is part of his virtue
Abandoning uncelibacy he lives a celibate life aloof refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way
Abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech
He speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the world
Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech
What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here
What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concord
Abandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speech
He speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing and pleasing to people at large
Abandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter
He speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma and the Vinaya
He speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal
He abstains from damaging seed  plant life
He eats only once a day refraining from the evening meal and from food at the wrong time of day
He abstains from dancing singing instrumental music and from watching shows
He abstains from wearing garlands and from beautifying himself with scents  cosmetics
He abstains from high and luxurious beds  seats
He abstains from accepting gold  money
He abstains from accepting uncooked grain raw meat women  girls male  female slaves goats  sheep fowl  pigs elephants cattle steeds  mares fields  property
He abstains from running messages from buying  selling from dealing with false scales false metals  false measures from bribery deception  fraud
He abstains from mutilating executing imprisoning highway robbery plunder and violence
He is content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hunger
Just as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hunger
Wherever he goes he takes only his barest necessities along
Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
On seeing a form with the eye he doesn't grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
On hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an aroma with the nose On tasting a flavor with the tongue On touching a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect he doesn't grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
When going forward and returning he makes himself alert
When looking toward and looking away when bending and extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe and his bowl when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and remaining silent he makes himself alert
Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue this noble restraint over the sense faculties this noble mindfulness  alertness he seeks out a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of straw
After his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the fore
Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness
He cleanses his mind of covetousness
Abandoning ill will  anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings
He cleanses his mind of ill will  anger
Abandoning sloth  drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth  drowsiness mindful alert percipient of light
He cleanses his mind of sloth  drowsiness
Abandoning restlessness  anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilled
He cleanses his mind of restlessness  anxiety
Abandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities
He cleanses his mind of uncertainty
Having abandoned these five hindrances  imperfections of awareness that weaken discernment  then quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities he enters and remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters and remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding'
With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of joy  distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
On seeing a form with the eye he isn't infatuated with pleasing forms and doesn't get upset over unpleasing forms
He dwells with bodymindfulness established with unlimited awareness
He discerns as it has come to be the awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease where those evil unskillful qualities cease without remainder
Having thus abandoned compliance  opposition he doesn't relish any feeling he feels  pleasure pain neitherpleasurenorpain  doesn't welcome it doesn't remain fastened to it
As he doesn't relish that feeling doesn't welcome it  doesn't remain fastened to it delight doesn't arise
From the cessation of his delight comes the cessation of clingingsustenance
From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then agingdeath sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress  suffering
On hearing a sound with the ear
On smelling an aroma with the nose
On tasting a flavor with the tongue
On sensing a tactile sensation with the body
On cognizing an idea with the intellect he isn't infatuated with pleasing ideas and doesn't get upset over unpleasing ideas
He dwells with bodymindfulness established with unlimited awareness
He discerns as it has come to be the awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease where those evil unskillful qualities cease without remainder
Having thus abandoned compliance  opposition he doesn't relish any feeling he feels  pleasure pain neitherpleasurenorpain  doesn't welcome it doesn't remain fastened to it
As he doesn't relish that feeling doesn't welcome it  doesn't remain fastened to it delight doesn't arise
From the cessation of his delight comes the cessation of clingingsustenance
From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then agingdeath sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress  suffering
Monks remember this my brief release through the destruction of craving and Sāti the Fisherman's Son as tied up in the great net of craving the great tangle of craving
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
The Buddha knowing that there are two types of consciousness  the consciousness aggregate which is experienced in conjunction with the six sense media and consciousness without surface which is experienced independently of the six sense media  is here giving Sāti the chance to identify which of the two types he has interpreted as running and wandering on
Sāti's answer shows that he is talking about the first type
The remaining discussion of consciousness throughout this sutta is thus directed at this first type
It would have been interesting to see how the Buddha would have attacked Sāti's misunderstanding had Sāti stated that he was talking about the second
On the topic of consciousness without surface see DN note and MN note
The Pali here is Nanu mayā moghapurisa anekapariyāyena paṭiccasamuppannaṃ viññāṇaṃ vuttaṃ 'Aññatra paccayā n'atthi viññāṇassa sambhavoti'
If the first part of this sentence were a complete sentence its syntax  putting the topic of what is described in the accusative followed by the word vuttaṃ plus the speaker in the instrumental  could be translated in line with either of two patterns
An example of the first pattern is in SN Paṭiccasamuppannaṃ kho ānanda dukkhaṃ vuttaṃ mayā  nanda stress has been described by me as dependently coarisen In other words the pattern is X has been described as Y by the speaker
An example of the second pattern is in AN Sekhampi kho mahānāma sīlaṃ vuttaṃ bhagavatā asekhampi sīlaṃ vuttaṃ bhagavatā  Mahānāma the virtue of one in training has been described by the Blessed One and the virtue of one beyond training has been described by the Blessed One This pattern is X has been described by the speaker Another example of this pattern is in SN Idaṃ kho gahapati dhātunānattaṃ vuttaṃ bhagavatā cakkhudhātu rūpadhātu cakkhuviññāṇadhātu manodhātu dhammadhātu manoviññāṇadhātu  Householder this diversity of properties has been described by the Blessed One eyeproperty form property eyeconsciousness property intellectproperty idea property intellectconsciousness property Again X has been described by the speaker
To make a literal translation of the entire passage here in line with the first pattern would yield Worthless man hasn't consciousness been described as dependently coarisen by me in many ways 'Apart from a requisite condition there is no comingintoplay of consciousness'
To make a literal translation in line with the second pattern would yield Worthless man hasn't dependently coarisen consciousness been described by me in many ways 'Apart from a requisite condition there is no comingintoplay of consciousness'
The translator of MLS renders the sentence both ways
When it earlier appears in the mouths of the monks reprimanding Sāti she renders it in line with the first pattern For reverend Sāti in many a figure is conditioned genesis spoken of in connection with consciousness by the Lord saying 'Apart from condition there is no origination of consciousness' When the sentence appears in the Buddha's mouth she renders it in line with the second pattern Foolish man has not consciousness generated by conditions been spoken of in many a figure by me saying Apart from condition there is no origination of consciousness
The translators of MLDB consistently follow the first pattern in rendering this sentence Misguided man have I not stated in many ways consciousness to be dependently arisen since without a condition there is no origination of consciousness around the sentence beginning Apart from or without More on this below
The substantive difference in these two patterns is that the first could be taken as implying that all consciousness is dependently coarisen whereas the second states explicitly that the Buddha's words Apart from condition there is no origination of consciousness apply specifically to one type of consciousness  consciousness arising in dependence on the coarising of conditions  leaving open the possibility that there is another type of consciousness to which these words do not apply
Arguing from translations rendered in line with the first pattern people have asserted that the two passages in the Canon referring to consciousness without surface are not in keeping with the principle expressed here that all consciousness is dependently coarisen
Thus the argument continues those two passages cannot be accepted as coming genuinely from the Buddha whereas this passage in MN definitely can
There are three main problems with this argument
The first is that throughout the suttas when consciousness as an active agent is discussed without modifiers it is always with reference to the consciousness aggregate as that is the sort of consciousness occurring within the territory delimited by the way the Buddha explicitly defines the term all
That is clearly the topic of discussion here
Consciousness without surface is discussed explicitly only in passages where the Buddha is citing the superiority of his attainment over that of brahmas In knowing this sort of consciousness which performs no active role and lies outside of the term all he knows something that brahmas do not
At the same time to lie outside of the consciousness aggregate it would also have to lie outside of the dimensions of time and space as that aggregate is defined as covering all consciousness past future and present far and near
Because the consciousness discussed in this sutta is an active agent functions within the dimensions of time and space and definitely lies within the term all all references can be understood to apply solely to the consciousness aggregate
What this means is that even if we were to follow the first pattern in translating this sentence  if it were a sentence  we would not have to adopt the argument drawn from it the people advancing this argument force the passage to say more than it actually says when taken in the context of the suttas as a whole
Second it is a poor interpretative strategy to give unnecessary privilege to one passage of the Canon at the expense of two others when we have no way of proving which passages in the suttas are most authentic
This is especially true in light of the fact that the passage here  even if we took it as a complete sentence  would not demand a single unequivocal interpretation
To force such an interpretation on it knowing that that would discredit other passages as inauthentic is unfair to the texts
The third problem with the argument for using this passage to reject DN and MN however is the most telling The first part of the above sentence is not a complete sentence
It is followed by a passage in quotation marks 'Aññatra paccayā n'atthi viññāṇassa sambhavoti' The only way to make sense of this punctuation is to take this passage in quotation marks as constituting what is said about X as named in the first part of the sentence
In other words this constitutes the description that the Buddha has made about dependentlycoarisen consciousness
The second pattern is the only one that make sense in this context Worthless man hasn't dependently coarisen consciousness been described by me in many ways 'Apart from a requisite condition there is no comingintoplay of consciousness'
Thus it is clear that the Buddha here is discussing dependently coarisen consciousness in a way that does not preclude the possibility that there is also a consciousness that lies beyond the six sensemedia is not dependently coarisen and is neither momentary nor eternal as it stands outside the dimension of time
Gandhabba usually means a low level of celestial deva
Devas on this level are frequently represented in the Canon as obsessed with sexual desire
However the Commentary here notes that gandhabba here does not mean a being standing near watching the couple have sexual intercourse
Rather it means the being driven by kamma who will take birth on that occasion
This interpretation is seconded by a passage in MN which builds on the brahman assumption that a person maintains the same caste from one life to the next
 'Do you know how there is the descent of an embryo'
 'Yes master we know how there is the descent of an embryo
There is the case where the mother  father have come together the mother is fertile and a gandhabba is standing present
The coming together of these three is the descent of the embryo'
'But do you know for sure whether the gandhabba is a noble warrior a brahman a merchant or a worker'
'No master'
'That being the case do you know who you are'
'That being the case master we don't know who we are'
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery

That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Sanctuary
Then a number of monks from the native land having completed the Rains Retreat in the native land went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them Monks whom in our native land do the nativeland monks  his companions in the holy life  esteem in this way 'Having few wants himself he gives talks to the monks on fewness of wants
Contented himself he gives talks to the monks on contentment
Secluded himself he gives talks to the monks on seclusion
Unentangled himself he gives talks to the monks on nonentanglement
Having aroused persistence in himself he gives talks to the monks on arousing persistence
Consummate in his own virtue he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in virtue
Consummate in his own concentration he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in concentration
Consummate in his own discernment he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in discernment
Consummate in his own release he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in release
Consummate in his own knowledge  vision of release he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in the knowledge  vision of release
He is one who exhorts informs instructs urges rouses  encourages his companions in the holy life' Lord the monk named Punna Mantaniputta is esteemed by the nativeland monks  his companions in the holy life  in this way 'Having few wants himself he gives talks to the monks on fewness of wants
Contented himself he gives talks to the monks on contentment
Secluded himself he gives talks to the monks on seclusion
Unentangled himself he gives talks to the monks on nonentanglement
Having aroused persistence in himself he gives talks to the monks on arousing persistence
Consummate in his own virtue he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in virtue
Consummate in his own concentration he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in concentration
Consummate in his own discernment he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in discernment
Consummate in his own release he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in release
Consummate in his own knowledge  vision of release he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in the knowledge  vision of release
He is one who exhorts informs instructs urges rouses  encourages his companions in the holy life' Now at that time Ven
Sariputta was sitting not far from the Blessed One
The thought occurred to him It's a gain a great gain for Ven
Punna Mantaniputta that his knowledgeable companions in the holy life speak his praise point by point in the presence of the Teacher and that the Teacher seconds that praise
Maybe sometime or other I too will go to meet with Ven
Punna Mantaniputta maybe I'll have some conversation with him
Then the Blessed One having stayed at Rajagaha as long as he liked set out wandering to Savatthi
Wandering by stages he arrived there and stayed in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Ven
Punna Mantaniputta heard The Blessed One has arrived at Savatthi and is staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery Setting his lodgings in order and taking his robes  bowl he set out wandering to Savatthi
Wandering by stages he went to where the Blessed One was staying in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
On arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged him with a Dhamma talk
Then Ven
Punna  instructed urged roused  encouraged with the Blessed One's Dhamma talk delighting  approving of the Blessed One's words  got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him and went to the Grove of the Blind for the day's abiding
Then a certain monk went to Ven
Sariputta and on arrival said to him Friend Sariputta the monk named Punna Mantaniputta whom you have so often praised  instructed urged roused  encouraged with the Blessed One's Dhamma talk delighting  approving of the Blessed One's words  has gotten up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him and has gone to the Grove of the Blind for the day's abiding So Ven
Sariputta quickly picked up a sitting cloth and followed right behind Ven
Punna keeping his head in sight
Ven
Punna plunged into the Grove of the Blind and sat down in the shade of a tree for the day's abiding
Ven
Sariputta also plunged into the Grove of the Blind and sat down in the shade of a tree for the day's abiding
Then in the evening Ven
Sariputta arose from his seclusion and went to Ven
Punna
On arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Punna My friend is the holy life lived under the Blessed One
Yes my friend
And is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of virtue
No my friend
Then is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of mind
No my friend
Then is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of view
No my friend
Then is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of the overcoming of perplexity
No my friend
Then is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge  vision of what is  is not the path
No my friend
Then is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge  vision of the way
No my friend
Then is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge  vision
No my friend
When asked if the holy life is lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of virtue you say 'No my friend' When asked if the holy life is lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity in terms of mind view the overcoming of perplexity knowledge  vision of what is  is not the path knowledge  vision of the way knowledge  vision you say 'No my friend' For the sake of what then my friend is the holy life lived under the Blessed One
The holy life is lived under the Blessed One my friend for the sake of total Unbinding through lack of clinging
But is purity in terms of virtue total Unbinding through lack of clinging
No my friend
Then is purity in terms of mind view the overcoming of perplexity knowledge  vision of what is  is not the path knowledge  vision of the way knowledge  vision total Unbinding through lack of clinging
No my friend
Then is total Unbinding through lack of clinging something apart from these qualities
No my friend
When asked if purity in terms of virtue mind view the overcoming of perplexity knowledge  vision of what is  is not the path knowledge  vision of the way knowledge  vision is total Unbinding through lack of clinging you say 'No my friend' But when asked if total Unbinding through lack of clinging is something apart from these qualities you say 'No my friend' Now how my friend is the meaning of these statements to be understood
If the Blessed One had described purity in terms of virtue as total Unbinding through lack of clinging my friend then he would have defined something still accompanied by clinging as total Unbinding through lack of clinging
If he had described purity in terms of mind view the overcoming of perplexity knowledge  vision of what is  is not the path knowledge  vision of the way knowledge  vision as total Unbinding through lack of clinging then he would have defined something still accompanied by clinging as total Unbinding through lack of clinging
But if total Unbinding through lack of clinging were apart from these qualities then a runofthemill person would be totally unbound inasmuch as a runofthemill person is apart from these qualities
So my friend I will give you an analogy for there are cases where it's through analogies that knowledgeable people can understand the meaning of what is being said
Suppose that while King Pasenadi Kosala was staying at Savatthi some urgent business were to arise at Saketa and that between Savatthi and Saketa seven relay chariots were made ready for him
Coming out the door of the inner palace in Savatthi he would get in the first relay chariot
By means of the first relay chariot he would reach the second relay chariot
Getting out of the first relay chariot he would get in the second relay chariot
By means of the second relay chariot he would reach the third by means of the third he would reach the fourth by means of the fourth the fifth by means of the fifth the sixth by means of the sixth he would reach the seventh relay chariot
Getting out of the sixth relay chariot he would get in the seventh relay chariot
By means of the seventh relay chariot he would finally arrive at the door of the inner palace at Saketa
As he arrived there his friends  companions relatives  kin would ask him 'Great king did you come from Savatthi to the door of the inner palace in Saketa by means of this chariot' Answering in what way my friend would King Pasenadi Kosala answer them correctly
Answering in this way my friend he would answer them correctly 'Just now as I was staying at Savatthi some urgent business arose at Saketa and between Savatthi and Saketa seven relay chariots were made ready for me
Coming out the door of the inner palace in Savatthi I got in the first relay chariot
By means of the first relay chariot I reached the second relay chariot
Getting out of the first relay chariot I got in the second relay chariot
By means of the second relay chariot I reached the third by means of the third I reached the fourth by means of the fourth the fifth by means of the fifth the sixth by means of the sixth I reached the seventh relay chariot
Getting out of the sixth relay chariot I got in the seventh relay chariot
By means of the seventh relay chariot I finally arrived at the door of the inner palace at Saketa' Answering in this way he would answer them correctly
In the same way my friend purity in terms of virtue is simply for the sake of purity in terms of mind
Purity in terms of mind is simply for the sake of purity in terms of view
Purity in terms of view is simply for the sake of purity in terms of the overcoming of perplexity
Purity in terms of the overcoming of perplexity is simply for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge  vision of what is  is not the path
Purity in terms of knowledge  vision of what is  is not the path is simply for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge  vision of the way
Purity in terms of knowledge  vision of the way is simply for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge  vision
Purity in terms of knowledge  vision is simply for the sake of total Unbinding through lack of clinging
And it's for the sake of total Unbinding through lack of clinging that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One
When this was said Ven
Sariputta said to Ven
Punna Mantaniputta What is your name friend and how do your companions in the holy life know you
My name is Punna friend and my companions in the holy life know me as Mantaniputta
How amazing my friend how astounding that Ven
Punna Mantaniputta has answered point by point with profound profound discernment in the manner of a learned disciple who has rightly understood the Teacher's message
It's a gain a great gain for any of his companions in the holy life who get to see him and visit with him
Even if they had to carry him around on a cushion placed on top of their heads in order to see him and visit with him it would be a gain for them a great gain
And the fact that I have gotten to see him and visit with him has been a gain a great gain for me
When this was said Ven
Punna said to Ven
Sariputta And what is your name friend and how do your companions in the holy life know you
My name is Upatissa friend and my companions in the holy life know me as Sariputta
What
I've been talking with the disciple who is like the Teacher himself without knowing that it is Ven
Sariputta
Had I known it was Ven
Sariputta I wouldn't have answered at such length
How amazing my friend how astounding that Ven
Sariputta has questioned point by point with profound profound discernment in the manner of a learned disciple who has rightly understood the Teacher's message
It's a gain a great gain for any of his companions in the holy life who get to see him and visit with him
Even if they had to carry him around on a cushion placed on top of their heads in order to see him and visit with him it would be a gain for them a great gain
And the fact that I have gotten to see him and visit with him has been a gain a great gain for me
In this way did both great beings rejoice in each other's good words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Now at that time Janussonin the brahman was driving out of Savatthi in the middle of the day in a totally white roofedchariot
He saw Pilotika the wanderer coming from afar and on seeing him said to him Now where is Master Vacchayana coming from in the middle of the day
Sir I have come here from the presence of Gotama the contemplative
And what does a wise person think about Gotama the contemplative's acuity of discernment
Sir who am I to know Gotama the contemplative's acuity of discernment
Wouldn't one have to be his equal to know his acuity of discernment
Master Vacchayana praises Gotama the contemplative with lavish praise indeed
Sir who am I to praise Gotama the contemplative
He is praised by the praised as the best of beings human  divine
Seeing what reasons does Master Vacchayana have such high confidence in Gotama the contemplative
Sir suppose an elephant hunter were to enter an elephant forest and were to see there a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in width
He would come to the conclusion 'What a big bull elephant' In the same way when I saw four footprints in Gotama the contemplative I came to the conclusion 'The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly' Which four
There is the case where I see certain noble warriors who are pundits subtle skilled in debate like hairsplitting marksmen
They prowl about as it were shooting philosophical positions to pieces with their dialectic
They hear 'Gotama the contemplative they say will visit that village or town' They formulate a question thus 'Having gone to Gotama the contemplative we will ask him this question of ours
If having been asked like this he answers like this we will refute his teaching like this
And if having been asked like this he answers like that we will refute his teaching like that'
They hear 'Gotama the contemplative is visiting that village or town' They go to him and he instructs urges rouses  encourages them with a talk on Dhamma
Having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by him with a talk on Dhamma they don't even ask him their question so since when could they refute him
As it turns out they become his disciples
When I saw this first footprint in Gotama the contemplative I came to the conclusion 'The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly'
Then there is the case where I see certain brahmans
Then there is the case where I see certain householders
Then there is the case where I see certain contemplatives who are pundits subtle skilled in debate like hairsplitting marksmen
They prowl about as it were shooting philosophical positions to pieces with their dialectic
They hear 'Gotama the contemplative they say will visit that village or town' They formulate a question thus 'Having gone to Gotama the contemplative we will ask him this question of ours
If having been asked like this he answers like this we will refute his teaching like this
And if having been asked like this he answers like that we will refute his teaching like that'
They hear 'Gotama the contemplative is visiting that village or town' They go to him and he instructs urges rouses  encourages them with a talk on Dhamma
Having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by him with a talk on Dhamma they don't even ask him their question so since when could they refute him
As it turns out they ask him for the opportunity to go forth from the home life into homelessness
He gives them the Goingforth
Having gone forth there  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  they in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for themselves in the here  now
They say 'How near we were to being lost
How near we were to being lost
Before though we weren't contemplatives we claimed to be contemplatives
Though we weren't brahmans we claimed to be brahmans
Though we weren't arahants we claimed to be arahants
But now we are contemplatives now we are brahmans now we are arahants'
When I saw this fourth footprint in Gotama the contemplative I came to the conclusion 'The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly'
When this was said Janussonin the brahman got down from his totally white roofedchariot and  arranging his upper robe over one shoulder and extending his hands in reverent salutation in the direction of the Blessed One  exclaimed this exclamation three times
Homage to the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened
Homage to the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened
Homage to the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened
May I at some time or another meet with Master Gotama
May there be some conversation
Then Janussonin the brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he told the Blessed One the entirety of his conversation with Pilotika the wanderer
When he was finished the Blessed One said to him It's not to that extent brahman that the elephant footprint simile is complete in its details
As to how it is complete in its details listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say sir Janussonin the brahman responded
The Blessed One said Suppose an elephant hunter were to enter an elephant forest and were to see there a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in width
A skilled elephant hunter would not yet come to the conclusion 'What a big bull elephant' Why is that
Because in an elephant forest there are dwarf female elephants with big feet
The footprint might be one of theirs
So he follows along and sees in the elephant forest a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in width and some scratch marks high up
A skilled elephant hunter would not yet come to the conclusion 'What a big bull elephant' Why is that
Because in an elephant forest there are tall female elephants with prominent teeth  big feet
The footprint might be one of theirs
So he follows along and sees in the elephant forest a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in width with some scratch marks and tusk slashes high up
A skilled elephant hunter would not yet come to the conclusion 'What a big bull elephant' Why is that
Because in an elephant forest there are tall female elephants with tusks  big feet
The footprint might be one of theirs
So he follows along and sees in the elephant forest a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in width with some scratch marks and tusk slashes high up and some brokenoff branches
And he sees that bull elephant at the foot of the tree or in an open clearing walking standing sitting or lying down
He comes to the conclusion 'That's the big bull elephant'
In the same way brahman there is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakened
He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its end
He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
A householder or householder's son hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects 'Household life is confining a dusty path
Life gone forth is the open air
It isn't easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
What if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessness'
So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness
When he has thus gone forth endowed with the monks' training  livelihood then  abandoning the taking of life  he abstains from the taking of life
He dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given
He takes only what is given accepts only what is given lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure
This too is part of his virtue
Abandoning uncelibacy he lives a celibate life aloof refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way
Abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech
He speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the world
Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech
What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here
What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concord
Abandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speech
He speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing and pleasing to people at large
Abandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter
He speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma and the Vinaya
He speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal
He abstains from damaging seed and plant life
He eats only once a day refraining from the evening meal and from food at the wrong time of day
He abstains from dancing singing instrumental music and from watching shows
He abstains from wearing garlands and from beautifying himself with scents and cosmetics
He abstains from high and luxurious beds and seats
He abstains from accepting gold and money
He abstains from accepting uncooked grain raw meat women and girls male and female slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle steeds and mares fields and property
He abstains from running messages from buying and selling from dealing with false scales false metals and false measures from bribery deception and fraud
He abstains from mutilating executing imprisoning highway robbery plunder and violence
He is content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hunger
Just as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hunger
Wherever he goes he takes only his barest necessities along
Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
On seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
On hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odor with the nose On tasting a flavor with the tongue On touching a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
When going forward and returning he acts with alertness
When looking toward and looking away when bending and extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe and his bowl when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and remaining silent he acts with alertness
Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue this noble restraint over the sense faculties this noble mindfulness  alertness he seeks out a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of straw
After his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the fore
Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness
He cleanses his mind of covetousness
Abandoning ill will and anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings
He cleanses his mind of ill will and anger
Abandoning sloth and drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness mindful alert percipient of light
He cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsiness
Abandoning restlessness and anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilled
He cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxiety
Abandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities
He cleanses his mind of uncertainty
Having abandoned these five hindrances  imperfections of awareness that weaken discernment  then quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluation
This brahman is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata but a disciple of the noble ones would not yet come to the conclusion 'The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly'
Then with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure onepointedness of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assurance
This too is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata but a disciple of the noble ones would not yet come to the conclusion 'The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly'
Then with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding'
This too is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata but a disciple of the noble ones would not yet come to the conclusion 'The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly'
Then with the abandoning of pleasure and pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
This too is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata but a disciple of the noble ones would not yet come to the conclusion 'The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly'
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives
He recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details
This too is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata but a disciple of the noble ones would not yet come to the conclusion 'The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly'
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
He sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
This too is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata but a disciple of the noble ones would not yet come to the conclusion 'The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly'
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations
He discerns as it has come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations'
This too is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata
A disciple of the noble ones has not yet come to conclusion but he comes to the conclusion 'The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly'
His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignorance
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This too is called a footprint of the Tathagata a scratch mark of the Tathagata a tusk slash of the Tathagata and it is here that a disciple of the noble ones has come to conclusion 'The Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has practiced rightly' When this was said Janussonin the brahman said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
The sentence stating that the streamenterer has come to a conclusion without coming to conclusion is a play on words
The idiomatic expression for coming to a conclusion  nittham gacchati  can also mean coming to a finish reaching completion or coming to an end
To distinguish these two meanings the text here uses the form nitthangato to mean having come to a finish and nittham gacchati to mean coming to a conclusion
This particular way of distinguishing the meanings however is not adhered to consistently across the Canon
On the one hand Dhp  like this sutta  uses the word nitthangato to describe an arahant
On the other a series of suttas beginning at AN some lay disciples are each described as tathaagate nitthangato which could either mean that they have come to a definite conclusion about the Tathagata or that they have finished their training under the Tathagata
Some of the disciples named in these suttas  such as Citta Mahanama Ugga Anathapindika and Jivaka Komarabhacca  are in other parts of the Canon described as streamwinners or nonreturners
However the description of their attainment here contains a mixture of terms some normally associated with streamentry some with arahantship
The pattern of the suttas is this Endowed with six qualities Tapussa the householder has come to conclusion in the Tathagata seen the deathless and goes about having realized the deathless
Which six
Verified confidence in the Buddha verified confidence in the Dhamma verified confidence in the Sangha noble virtue noble knowledge noble release Of these six qualities the first four are normally associated with streamentry the last two with arahantship
It may be that the last two are meant here in a nontechnical sense which would mean that nitthangato here means simply coming to a definite conclusion about the Tathagata
AN
plays with the two meanings of nittha in another way
The Buddha describes ten types of individuals all of whom he says are nitthangataa in me In this case nitthangato would simply mean having come to a definite conclusion
Of the ten types he adds the nitthaa  or completion of the training  of five occurs here in the human realm the nitthaa of five occurs away from here
In the first five he includes three types of streamwinners oncereturners and those who attain arahantship in the present life
In the latter five he includes five types of nonreturners
Thus as with the suttas in AN VI nitthangato here means simply coming to a definite conclusion about the Tathagata
And the lack of consistency surrounding this term in the suttas suggests that it is not a technical term
This would confirm the impression the two meanings of nittha are used more as an opportunity for word play a game in which inconsistency is not a vice
For more on word play in the Canon see The Atthakavagga An Introduction
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery
Then Piṅgalakoccha the brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama these contemplatives  brahmans each with his group each with his community each the teacher of his group an honored leader wellregarded by people at large  ie Pūraṇa Kassapa Makkhali Gosāla Ajita Kesakambalin Pakudha Kaccāyana Sañjaya Velaṭṭhaputta  the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim or do they all not have direct knowledge or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them not
Enough brahman
Put this question aside
I will teach you the Dhamma
Listen and pay close attention
I will speak
Yes sir Piṅgalakoccha the brahman responded to the Blessed One
The Blessed One said Brahman it's as if a man in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood  passing over the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood passing over the sapwood passing over the inner bark passing over the outer bark  cutting away the twigs  leaves were to go off carrying them thinking 'heartwood' A man with good eyesight seeing him would say 'Ah how this good man didn't know heartwood didn't know sapwood didn't know inner bark didn't know outer bark didn't know twigs  leaves
That's why he in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood  passing over the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood passing over the sapwood passing over the inner bark passing over the outer bark  cutting away the twigs  leaves went off carrying them thinking heartwood Whatever heartwoodbusiness he had with heartwood his purpose won't be served'
Or brahman it's as if a man in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood  passing over the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood passing over the sapwood passing over the inner bark  cutting away the outer bark were to go off carrying it thinking 'heartwood' A man with good eyesight seeing him would say 'Ah how this good man didn't know heartwood didn't know sapwood didn't know inner bark didn't know outer bark didn't know twigs  leaves

Or brahman it's as if a man in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood cutting away just the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood were to go off carrying it knowing 'heartwood' A man with good eyesight seeing him would say 'Ah how this good man did know heartwood did know sapwood did know inner bark did know outer bark did know twigs  leaves
That's why he in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood cutting away just the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood went off carrying it knowing heartwood Whatever heartwoodbusiness he had with heartwood his purpose will be served'
In the same way brahman there is the case where a certain son of good family out of conviction goes forth from the home life into homelessness 'I am beset by birth by agingdeath by sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs beset by stress overcome with stress
Perhaps the end of this entire mass of stress might be discerned' Having thus gone forth he encounters gain offerings  fame
He is gratified with that gain offerings  fame his resolve fulfilled
Because of that gain offerings  fame he exalts himself and disparages others 'I am a person with gain offerings  fame but these other monks are unknown  of little influence' He doesn't generate desire or exert himself for the realization of those qualities that are higher  more sublime than gain offerings  fame
He is drooping  lax
Just like the man who in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood  passing over the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood passing over the sapwood passing over the inner bark passing over the outer bark  cutting away the twigs  leaves went off carrying them thinking 'heartwood' Whatever heartwoodbusiness he had with heartwood his purpose won't be served
This individual I tell you is similar to that
Furthermore there is the case where an individual out of conviction goes forth from the home life into homelessness 'Perhaps the end of this entire mass of stress might be discerned' Having thus gone forth he encounters gain offerings  fame
He is not gratified with that gain offerings  fame his resolve not fulfilled
He generates desire  exerts himself for the realization of those qualities that are higher  more sublime than gain offerings  fame
He is not drooping or lax
He achieves consummation in virtue
He is gratified with that consummation in virtue his resolve fulfilled
Because of that consummation in virtue he exalts himself and disparages others 'I am a person of virtue with fine qualities but these other monks are unvirtuous with evil qualities' He doesn't generate desire or exert himself for the realization of those qualities that are higher  more sublime than consummation in virtue
He is drooping  lax

He is gratified with that consummation in concentration his resolve fulfilled
Because of that consummation in concentration he exalts himself and disparages others 'I am concentrated my mind at singleness but these other monks are unconcentrated their minds scattered' He doesn't generate desire or exert himself for the realization of those qualities that are higher  more sublime than consummation in concentration
He is drooping  lax
Just like the man who in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood  passing over the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood passing over the sapwood  cutting away the inner bark went off carrying it thinking 'heartwood' Whatever heartwoodbusiness he had with heartwood his purpose won't be served

And which brahman are the qualities that are higher  more sublime than knowledge  vision
There is the case where a monk  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
This is a quality higher  more sublime than knowledge  vision

Furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
This too is a quality higher  more sublime than knowledge  vision
Furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' This too is a quality higher  more sublime than knowledge  vision
Furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  he enters  remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
This too is a quality higher  more sublime than knowledge  vision
Furthermore with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' he enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
This too is a quality higher  more sublime than knowledge  vision
Furthermore with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' he enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
This too is a quality higher  more sublime than knowledge  vision
Furthermore with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' he enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
This too is a quality higher  more sublime than knowledge  vision
Furthermore with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness he enters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
This too is a quality higher  more sublime than knowledge  vision
Furthermore with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception he enters  remains in the cessation of perception  feeling
And having seen with discernment his fermentations are completely ended
This too is a quality higher  more sublime than knowledge  vision
These are the qualities higher  more sublime than knowledge  vision
Just like the man who in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood cutting away just the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood went off carrying it knowing 'heartwood' Whatever heartwoodbusiness he had with heartwood his purpose will be served
This individual I tell you is similar to that
Brahman this holy life doesn't have as its reward gain offerings  fame doesn't have as its reward consummation of virtue doesn't have as its reward consummation of concentration doesn't have as its reward knowledge  vision but the unprovoked awarenessrelease That is the purpose of this holy life that is its heartwood that its final end
When this was said Piṅgalakoccha the brahman said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord

Akuppa
This term is sometimes translated as unshakable but it literally means unprovoked The reference is apparently to the theory of dhātu or properties underlying physical or psychological events in nature
The physical properties according to this theory are four earth liquid heat and wind
Three of them  liquid heat  wind  are potentially active
When they are aggravated agitated or provoked  the Pali term here 'pakuppati' is used also on the psychological level where it means angered or upset  they act as the underlying cause for natural activity
When the provocation ends the corresponding activity subsides
Now there comes a time friends when the external liquid property is provoked and at that time the external earth property vanishes
There comes a time friends when the external liquid property is provoked and washes away village town city district  country
There comes a time when the water in the great ocean drops down one hundred leagues two hundred three hundred four hundred five hundred six hundred seven hundred leagues

A similar theory attributes the irruption of mental states to the provocation of the properties of sensuality form or formlessness
In dependence on the property of sensuality there occurs the perception of sensuality
In dependence on the perception of sensuality there occurs the resolve for sensuality the desire for sensuality the fever for sensuality the quest for sensuality
Questing for sensuality monks an uninstructed runofthemill person conducts himself wrongly through three means through body through speech  through mind
Even unbinding is described as a property
However there is a crucial difference in how unbinding is attained in that the unbinding property is not provoked
Any events that depend on the provocation of a property are inherently unstable and inconstant subject to change when the provocation ends
But because true release is not caused by the provocation of anything it is not subject to change
In have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha on Vulture Peak mountain not long after Devadatta had left
Referring to Devadatta the Blessed One addressed the monks
Monks there is the case where a certain son of good family out of conviction goes forth from the home life into homelessness 'I am beset by birth by agingdeath by sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs beset by stress overcome with stress
Perhaps the end of this entire mass of stress might be discerned' Having thus gone forth he encounters gain offerings  fame
He is gratified with that gain offerings  fame his resolve fulfilled
Because of that gain offerings  fame he exalts himself and disparages others 'I am a person with gain offerings  fame but these other monks are unknown  of little influence' He is intoxicated with that gain offerings  fame heedless about it and falls into heedlessness
Being heedless he dwells in suffering  stress

Being heedful he achieves a nonoccasional liberation
And it is impossible monks there is no opportunity for that monk to fall from that nonoccasional release
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
This translation follows the Sri Lankan and Burmese editions of the Canon
The Thai and PTS editions at this point say Being heedful he achieves an occasional liberation
And it is possible monks there is the opportunity for that monk to fall from that occasional release However when the passage is repeated after the simile the these editions read Being heedful he achieves a nonoccasional liberation
And it is impossible monks there is no opportunity for that monk to fall from that nonoccasional release Because this inconsistency seems anomalous the Sri LankanBurmese reading seems preferable
Occasional liberationrelease is the temporary release from such things as the hindrances attained when entering right concentration or the temporary release from some of the factors of lower states of jhāna attained when entering higher states of jhāna
This release lasts only as long as the necessary causal factors are still in place
Nonoccasional liberationrelease according to the Commentary covers all of the transcendent attainments the paths and fruitions of streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship along with unbinding
Thus if the Commentary is right here nonoccasional liberationrelease has a broader meaning than the unprovoked release mentioned below as that covers only the fruition of arahantship and unbinding
Although the path factors are needed to reach these attainments they do not cause them just as a path to a mountain does not cause the mountain to be
This release is beyond time  and thus nonoccasional  in that the falling away of the path factors would not end it
Akuppa
This term is sometimes translated as unshakable but it literally means unprovoked The reference is apparently to the theory of dhātu or properties underlying physical or psychological events in nature
The physical properties according to this theory are four earth liquid heat and wind
Three of them  liquid heat  wind  are potentially active
When they are aggravated agitated or provoked  the Pali term here 'pakuppati' is used also on the psychological level where it means angered or upset  they act as the underlying cause for natural activity
When the provocation ends the corresponding activity subsides
Now there comes a time friends when the external liquid property is provoked and at that time the external earth property vanishes
There comes a time friends when the external liquid property is provoked and washes away village town city district  country
There comes a time when the water in the great ocean drops down one hundred leagues two hundred three hundred four hundred five hundred six hundred seven hundred leagues
There comes a time when the water in the great ocean stands seven palmtrees deep six five four three two palmtrees deep one palmtree deep
There comes a time when the water in the great ocean stands seven fathoms deep six five four three two fathoms deep one fathom deep
There comes a time when the water in the great ocean stands half a fathom deep hipdeep kneedeep ankle deep
There comes a time when the water in the great ocean is not even the depth of the first joint of a finger
There comes a time friends when the external fire property is provoked and consumes village town city district  country and then coming to the edge of a green district the edge of a road the edge of a rocky district to the water's edge or to a lush wellwatered area goes out from lack of sustenance
There comes a time when people try to make fire using a wingbone  tendon parings
There comes a time friends when the external wind property is provoked and blows away village town city district  country
There comes a time when in the last month of the hot season people try to start a breeze with a fan or bellows and even the grass at the fringe of a thatch roof doesn't stir

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There Ven
Sariputta addressed the monks saying Friend monks
Yes friend the monks responded
Ven
Sariputta said Friends just as the footprints of all legged animals are encompassed by the footprint of the elephant and the elephant's footprint is reckoned the foremost among them in terms of size in the same way all skillful qualities are gathered under the four noble truths
Under which four
Under the noble truth of stress under the noble truth of the origination of stress under the noble truth of the cessation of stress and under the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress
And what is the noble truth of stress
Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful
In short the five clingingaggregates are stressful
And which are the five clingingaggregates
The form clingingaggregate the feeling clingingaggregate the perception clingingaggregate the fabrication clingingaggregate  the consciousness clingingaggregate
And what is the form clingingaggregate
The four great existents and the form derived from them
And what are the four great existents
The earth property the liquid property the fire property  the wind property
And what is the earth property
The earth property can be either internal or external
Which is the internal earth property
Whatever internal within oneself is hard solid  sustained head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces or whatever else internal within oneself is hard solid  sustained This is called the internal earth property
Now both the internal earth property and the external earth property are simply earth property
And that should be seen as it actually is with right discernment 'This is not mine this is not me this is not my self' When one sees it thus as it actually is with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the earth property and makes the mind dispassionate toward the earth property
Now there comes a time friends when the external liquid property is provoked and at that time the external earth property vanishes
So when even in the external earth property  so vast  inconstancy will be discerned destructibility will be discerned a tendency to decay will be discerned changeability will be discerned then what in this shortlasting body sustained by clinging is 'I' or 'mine' or 'what I am'
It has here only a 'no'
Now if other people insult malign exasperate  harass a monk he discerns that 'A painful feeling born of earcontact has arisen within me
And that is dependent not independent
Dependent on what
Dependent on contact' And he sees that contact is inconstant feeling is inconstant perception is inconstant consciousness is inconstant
His mind with the property as its objectsupport leaps up grows confident steadfast  released
And if other people attack the monk in ways that are undesirable displeasing  disagreeable  through contact with fists contact with stones contact with sticks or contact with knives  the monk discerns that 'This body is of such a nature that contacts with fists come contacts with stones come contacts with sticks come  contacts with knives come
Now the Blessed One has said in his exhortation of the simile of the saw Monks even if bandits were to carve you up savagely limb by limb with a twohandled saw he among you who let his heart get angered even at that would not be doing my bidding So my persistence will be aroused  untiring my mindfulness established  unconfused my body calm  unaroused my mind centered  unified
And now let contact with fists come to this body let contact with stones with sticks with knives come to this body for this is how the Buddha's bidding is done'
And if in the monk recollecting the Buddha Dhamma  Sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is not established he feels apprehensive at that and gives rise to a sense of urgency 'It is a loss for me not a gain illgotten for me not wellgotten that when I recollect the Buddha Dhamma  Sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is not established within me' Just as when a daughterinlaw on seeing her fatherinlaw feels apprehensive and gives rise to a sense of urgency in the same way if in the monk recollecting the Buddha Dhamma  Sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is not established he feels apprehensive at that and gives rise to a sense of urgency 'It is a loss for me not a gain illgotten for me not wellgotten that when I recollect the Buddha Dhamma  Sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is not established within me'
But if in the monk recollecting the Buddha Dhamma  Sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is established then he is gratified at that
And even to this extent friends the monk has accomplished a great deal
And what is the liquid property
The liquid property may be either internal or external
What is the internal liquid property
Whatever internal belonging to oneself is liquid watery  sustained bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine or whatever else internal within oneself is liquid watery  sustained This is called the internal liquid property
Now both the internal liquid property and the external liquid property are simply liquid property
And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment 'This is not mine this is not me this is not my self' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the liquid property and makes the mind dispassionate toward the liquid property
Now there comes a time friends when the external liquid property is provoked and washes away village town city district  country

What is the internal fire property
Whatever internal belonging to oneself is fire fiery  sustained that by which is warmed aged  consumed with fever and that by which what is eaten drunk chewed  savored gets properly digested or whatever else internal within oneself is fire fiery  sustained This is called the internal fire property

Now if internally the eye is intact but externally forms do not come into range nor is there a corresponding engagement then there is no appearing of the corresponding type of consciousness
If internally the eye is intact and externally forms come into range but there is no corresponding engagement then there is no appearing of the corresponding type of consciousness
But when internally the eye is intact and externally forms come into range and there is a corresponding engagement then there is the appearing of the corresponding type of consciousness
The form of what has thus come into being is gathered under the form clingingaggregate
The feeling of what has thus come into being is gathered under the feeling clingingaggregate
The perception of what has thus come into being is gathered under the perception clingingaggregate
The fabrications of what has thus come into being are gathered under the fabrication clingingaggregate
The consciousness of what has thus come into being is gathered under the consciousness clingingaggregate
One discerns 'This it seems is how there is the gathering meeting  convergence of these five clingingaggregates
Now the Blessed One has said Whoever sees dependent coarising sees the Dhamma whoever sees the Dhamma sees dependent coarising And these things  the five clingingaggregates  are dependently coarisen
Any desire embracing grasping  holdingon to these five clingingaggregates is the origination of stress
Any subduing of desire  passion any abandoning of desire  passion for these five clingingaggregates is the cessation of stress' And even to this extent friends the monk has accomplished a great deal
Now if internally the ear is intact

That is what Ven
Sariputta said
Gratified the monks delighted in Ven
Sariputta's words
Some scholars have suggested that of the many autobiographical accounts of the Buddha's Awakening presented in the Pali canon this is the earliest
From that assumption they have further suggested that because this account does not mention the four noble truths either in connection with the Awakening or with the Buddha's instructions to his first disciples the four noble truths must have been a later doctrine
There is little reason however to accept these suggestions
To begin with the sutta does not recount the Buddha's period of austerities prior to his Awakening nor does it tell of how the group of five monks attended to him during that period and later left him when he abandoned his austerities and yet toward the end of the sutta the Buddha alludes to those two incidents in a way indicating that he assumes them to be familiar to his listeners
Thus if anything the accounts that do explicitly relate those events  such as the one in MN  would seem to be earlier
Secondly the lack of reference to the four noble truths does not indicate that they were not actually involved in the Awakening or the first sermon
As is always the case in the Buddha's autobiographical accounts in the Canon this account is designed to convey a lesson and the lesson is clearly articulated toward the beginning of the sutta the difference between noble search and ignoble search
The account then illustrates the Buddha's own noble search and his later teaching career in the terms introduced by the lesson the search for the unborn agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless undefiled unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding In particular all the events mentioned in the account revolve around the issue of the Deathless the discovery of the Deathless the teaching of the Deathless and the Buddha's success in helping others to attain the Deathless
Had the lesson of the sutta concerned the four noble truths they would probably have been mentioned in the account
Thus there seems little reason to regard this sutta as proof that the four noble truths were a later teaching
Nevertheless this sutta offers many excellent lessons in the Dhamma in addition to mentioning a few incidents in the Buddha's life that are found nowhere else in the Sutta Pitaka
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe he went into Savatthi for alms
Then a large number of monks went to Ven
Ananda and said It has been a long time friend Ananda since we have heard a Dhamma talk in the Blessed One's presence
It would be good if we could get to hear a Dhamma talk in the Blessed One's presence
In that case venerable ones go to the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman
Perhaps you will get to hear a Dhamma talk in the Blessed One's presence
As you say friend the monks replied to Ven
Ananda and left
Then the Blessed One having gone for alms after his meal on returning from his alms round said to Ven
Ananda Ananda let's go to the Eastern Park the palace of Migara's mother for the day's abiding
As you say lord Ven
Ananda replied to the Blessed One
So the Blessed One together with Ven
Ananda went to the Eastern Park the palace of Migara's mother for the day's abiding
Then in the evening emerging from seclusion he said to Ven
Ananda Ananda let's go to the Eastern Gatehouse to bathe our limbs
As you say lord Ven
Ananda replied to the Blessed One
So the Blessed One together with Ven
Ananda went to the Eastern Gatehouse to bathe his limbs
Having bathed his limbs at the Eastern Gatehouse coming out of the water he stood in his lower robe drying his limbs
Then Ven
Ananda said to him Lord the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman is not far away
Pleasing is the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman
Delightful is the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman
It would be good if the Blessed One went to the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman out of sympathy The Blessed One acquiesced through silence
So the Blessed One went to the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman
Now at that time a large number of monks had gathered in the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman for a Dhamma discussion
The Blessed One stood outside the door waiting for the discussion to end
On knowing that the discussion had ended clearing his throat he tapped at the door
The monks opened the door for him
Entering the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman the Blessed One sat down on a seat made ready
As he was sitting there he addressed the monks For what discussion are you gathered together here
In the midst of what discussion have you been interrupted
Lord our interrupted Dhamma discussion was about the Blessed One himself and then the Blessed One arrived
Good monks
It's fitting that you as sons of good families who have gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should gather for Dhamma discussion
When you have gathered you have two duties either Dhamma discussion or noble silence

Monks there are these two searches ignoble search  noble search
And what is ignoble search
There is the case where a person being subject himself to birth seeks what is likewise subject to birth
Being subject himself to aging illness death sorrow defilement he seeks what is likewise subject to illness death sorrow defilement
And what may be said to be subject to birth
Spouses  children are subject to birth
Men  women slaves goats  sheep fowl  pigs elephants cattle horses  mares gold  silver are subject to birth
Subject to birth are these acquisitions and one who is tied to them infatuated with them who has totally fallen for them being subject to birth seeks what is likewise subject to birth
And what may be said to be subject to aging illness death sorrow defilement
Spouses  children men  women slaves goats  sheep fowl  pigs elephants cattle horses  mares gold  silver are subject to aging illness death sorrow defilement
Subject to aging illness death sorrow defilement are these acquisitions and one who is tied to them infatuated with them who has totally fallen for them being subject to birth seeks what is likewise subject to aging illness death sorrow defilement
This is ignoble search
And what is the noble search
There is the case where a person himself being subject to birth seeing the drawbacks of birth seeks the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding
Himself being subject to aging illness death sorrow defilement seeing the drawbacks of aging illness death sorrow defilement seeks the agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless undefiled unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding
This is the noble search
I too monks before my Awakening when I was an unawakened bodhisatta being subject myself to birth sought what was likewise subject to birth
Being subject myself to aging illness death sorrow defilement I sought what was likewise subject to illness death sorrow defilement
The thought occurred to me 'Why do I being subject myself to birth seek what is likewise subject to birth
Being subject myself to aging illness death sorrow defilement why do I seek what is likewise subject to illness death sorrow defilement
What if I being subject myself to birth seeing the drawbacks of birth were to seek the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding
What if I being subject myself to aging illness death sorrow defilement seeing the drawbacks of aging illness death sorrow defilement were to seek the agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding'
So at a later time while still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life  and while my parents unwilling were crying with tears streaming down their faces  I shaved off my hair  beard put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness
Having thus gone forth in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Alara Kalama and on arrival said to him 'Friend Kalama I want to practice in this doctrine  discipline'
When this was said he replied to me 'You may stay here my friend
This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teacher's knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledge'
It was not long before I quickly learned the doctrine
As far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with others
I thought 'It isn't through mere conviction alone that Alara Kalama declares I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwells knowing  seeing this Dhamma' So I went to him and said 'To what extent do you declare that you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma' When this was said he declared the dimension of nothingness
I thought 'Not only does Alara Kalama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
I too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
What if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Alara Kalama declares he has entered  dwells in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge' So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
I went to him and said 'Friend Kalama is this the extent to which you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge'
'Yes my friend'
'This friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge'
'It is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life
So the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge
And the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
The Dhamma I know is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma I know
As I am so are you as you are so am Come friend let us now lead this community together'
In this way did Alara Kalama my teacher place me his pupil on the same level with himself and pay me great honor
But the thought occurred to me 'This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness' So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I left
In search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Uddaka Ramaputta and on arrival said to him 'Friend Uddaka I want to practice in this doctrine  discipline'
When this was said he replied to me 'You may stay here my friend
This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teacher's knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledge'
It was not long before I quickly learned the doctrine
As far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with others
I thought 'It wasn't through mere conviction alone that Rama declared I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwelled knowing  seeing this Dhamma' So I went to Uddaka and said 'To what extent did Rama declare that he had entered  dwelled in this Dhamma' When this was said Uddaka declared the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
I thought 'Not only did Rama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
I too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
What if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge' So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
I went to Uddaka and said 'Friend Uddaka is this the extent to which Rama entered  dwelled in this Dhamma having realized it for himself through direct knowledge'
'Yes my friend'
'This friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge'
'It is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life
So the Dhamma Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge
And the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge
The Dhamma he knew is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma he knew
As he was so are you as you are so was he
Come friend lead this community'
In this way did Uddaka Ramaputta my companion in the holy life place me in the position of teacher and pay me great honor
But the thought occurred to me 'This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception' So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I left
In search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I wandered by stages in the Magadhan country and came to the military town of Uruvela
There I saw some delightful countryside with an inspiring forest grove a clearflowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for almsgoing on all sides
The thought occurred to me 'How delightful is this countryside with its inspiring forest grove clearflowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for almsgoing on all sides
This is just right for the exertion of a clansman intent on exertion' So I sat down right there thinking 'This is just right for exertion'
Then monks being subject myself to birth seeing the drawbacks of birth seeking the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding I reached the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding
Being subject myself to aging illness death sorrow defilement seeing the drawbacks of aging illness death sorrow defilement seeking the agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding I reached the agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding
Knowledge  vision arose in me 'Unprovoked is my release
This is the last birth
There is now no further becoming'
Then the thought occurred to me 'This Dhamma that I have attained is deep hard to see hard to realize peaceful refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
But this generation delights in attachment is excited by attachment enjoys attachment
For a generation delighting in attachment excited by attachment enjoying attachment thisthat conditionality  dependent coarising are hard to see
This state too is hard to see the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding
And if I were to teach the Dhamma and others would not understand me that would be tiresome for me troublesome for me'
Just then these verses unspoken in the past unheard before occurred to me
As I reflected thus my mind inclined to dwelling at ease not to teaching the Dhamma
Then Brahma Sahampati having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in my awareness thought 'The world is lost
The world is destroyed
The mind of the Tathagata the Arahant the Rightly Selfawakened One inclines to dwelling at ease not to teaching the Dhamma' Then just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm Brahma Sahampati disappeared from the Brahmaworld and reappeared in front of me
Arranging his upper robe over one shoulder he knelt down with his right knee on the ground saluted me with his hands before his heart and said to me 'Lord let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma
Let the OneWellGone teach the Dhamma
There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are falling away because they do not hear the Dhamma
There will be those who will understand the Dhamma'
That is what Brahma Sahampati said
Having said that he further said this
Then having understood Brahma's invitation out of compassion for beings I surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened One
As I did so I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much those with keen faculties and those with dull those with good attributes and those with bad those easy to teach and those hard some of them seeing disgrace  danger in the other world
Just as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some lotuses  born  growing in the water  might flourish while immersed in the water without rising up from the water some might stand at an even level with the water while some might rise up from the water and stand without being smeared by the water  so too surveying the world with the eye of an Awakened One I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much those with keen faculties and those with dull those with good attributes and those with bad those easy to teach and those hard some of them seeing disgrace  danger in the other world
Having seen this I answered Brahma Sahampati in verse
Then Brahma Sahampati thinking 'The Blessed One has given his consent to teach the Dhamma' bowed down to me and circling me on the right disappeared right there
Then the thought occurred to me 'To whom should I teach the Dhamma first
Who will quickly understand this Dhamma' Then the thought occurred to me 'This Alara Kalama is wise competent intelligent
He has long had little dust in his eyes
What if I were to teach him the Dhamma first
He will quickly understand this Dhamma' Then devas came to me and said 'Lord Alara Kalama died seven days ago' And knowledge  vision arose within me 'Alara Kalama died seven days ago' The thought occurred to me 'A great loss has Alara Kalama suffered
If he had heard this Dhamma he would have quickly understood it'
Then the thought occurred to me 'To whom should I teach the Dhamma first
Who will quickly understand this Dhamma' Then the thought occurred to me 'This Uddaka Ramaputta is wise competent intelligent
He has long had little dust in his eyes
What if I were to teach him the Dhamma first
He will quickly understand this Dhamma' Then devas came to me and said 'Lord Uddaka Ramaputta died last night' And knowledge  vision arose within me 'Uddaka Ramaputta died last night' The thought occurred to me 'A great loss has Uddaka Ramaputta suffered
If he had heard this Dhamma he would have quickly understood it'
Then the thought occurred to me 'To whom should I teach the Dhamma first
Who will quickly understand this Dhamma' Then the thought occurred to me 'They were very helpful to me the group of five monks who attended to me when I was resolute in exertion
What if I were to teach them the Dhamma first' Then the thought occurred to me 'Where are the group of five monks staying now' And with the divine eye purified  surpassing the human I saw that they were staying near Varanasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana
Then having stayed at Uruvela as long as I liked I set out to wander by stages to Varanasi
Upaka the Ajivaka saw me on the road between Gaya and the Awakening and on seeing me said to me 'Clear my friend are your faculties
Pure your complexion and bright
On whose account have you gone forth
Who is your teacher
In whose Dhamma do you delight'
When this was said I replied to Upaka the Ajivaka in verses
'From your claims my friend you must be an infinite conqueror'
When this was said Upaka said 'May it be so my friend' and  shaking his head taking a sideroad  he left
Then wandering by stages I arrived at Varanasi at the Deer Park in Isipatana to where the group of five monks were staying
From afar they saw me coming and on seeing me made a pact with one another 'Friends here comes Gotama the contemplative living luxuriously straying from his exertion backsliding into abundance
He doesn't deserve to be bowed down to to be greeted by standing up or to have his robe  bowl received
Still a seat should be set out if he wants to he can sit down' But as I approached they were unable to keep to their pact
One standing up to greet me received my robe  bowl
Another spread out a seat
Another set out water for washing my feet
However they addressed me by name and as 'friend'
So I said to them 'Don't address the Tathagata by name and as friend The Tathagata friends is a worthy one rightly selfawakened
Lend ear friends the Deathless has been attained
I will instruct you
I will teach you the Dhamma
Practicing as instructed you will in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for yourselves in the here  now'
When this was said the group of five monks replied to me 'By that practice that conduct that performance of austerities you did not attain any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble one
So how can you now  living luxuriously straying from your exertion backsliding into abundance  have attained any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble one'
When this was said I replied to them 'The Tathagata monks is not living luxuriously has not strayed from his exertion has not backslid into abundance
The Tathagata friends is a worthy one rightly selfawakened
Lend ear friends the Deathless has been attained
I will instruct you
I will teach you the Dhamma
Practicing as instructed you will in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for yourselves in the here  now'
A second time A third time the group of five monks said to me 'By that practice that conduct that performance of austerities you did not attain any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble one
So how can you now  living luxuriously straying from your exertion backsliding into abundance  have attained any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble one'
When this was said I replied to the group of five monks 'Do you recall my ever having spoken in this way before'
'No lord'
'The Tathagata monks is not living luxuriously has not strayed from his exertion has not backslid into abundance
The Tathagata friends is a worthy one rightly selfawakened
Lend ear friends the Deathless has been attained
I will instruct you
I will teach you the Dhamma
Practicing as instructed you will in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for yourselves in the here  now'
And so I was able to convince them
I would teach two monks while three went for alms and we six lived off what the three brought back from their alms round
Then I would teach three monks while two went for alms and we six lived off what the two brought back from their alms round
Then the group of five monks  thus exhorted thus instructed by me  being subject themselves to birth seeing the drawbacks of birth seeking the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding reached the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding
Being subject themselves to aging illness death sorrow defilement seeing the drawbacks of aging illness death sorrow defilement seeking the agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding they reached the agingless illnessless deathless sorrowless unexcelled rest from the yoke Unbinding
Knowledge  vision arose in them 'Unprovoked is our release
This is the last birth
There is now no further becoming'
Monks there are these five strings of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Sounds cognizable via the ear  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Aromas cognizable via the nose  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Tastes cognizable via the tongue  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
These are the five strings of sensuality
And any brahmans or contemplatives tied to these five strings of sensuality  infatuated with them having totally fallen for them consuming them without seeing their drawbacks or discerning the escape from them  should be known as having met with misfortune having met with ruin Mara can do with them as he will
Just as if a wild deer were to lie bound on a heap of snares it should be known as having met with misfortune having met with ruin the hunter can do with it as he will
When the hunter comes it won't get away as it would like
In the same way any brahmans or contemplatives tied to these five strings of sensuality  infatuated with them having totally fallen for them consuming them without seeing their drawbacks or discerning the escape from them  should be known as having met with misfortune having met with ruin Mara can do with them as he will
But any brahmans or contemplatives not tied to these five strings of sensuality  uninfatuated with them having not totally fallen for them consuming them seeing their drawbacks and discerning the escape from them  should be known as not having met with misfortune not having met with ruin Mara cannot do with them as he will
Just as if a wild deer were to lie unbound on a heap of snares it should be known as not having met with misfortune not having met with ruin the hunter cannot do with it as he will
When the hunter comes it will get away as it would like
In the same way any brahmans or contemplatives not tied to these five strings of sensuality  uninfatuated with them having not totally fallen for them consuming them seeing their drawbacks and discerning the escape from them  should be known as not having met with misfortune not having met with ruin Mara cannot do with them as he will
Suppose that a wild deer is living in a wilderness glen
Carefree it walks carefree it stands carefree it sits carefree it lies down
Why is that
Because it has gone beyond the hunter's range
In the same way a monk  quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
This monk is said to have blinded Mara
Trackless he has destroyed Mara's vision and has become invisible to the Evil One

Then again the monk with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
This monk is said to have blinded Mara
Trackless he has destroyed Mara's vision and has become invisible to the Evil One
Then again the monk with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' This monk is said to have blinded Mara
Trackless he has destroyed Mara's vision and has become invisible to the Evil One
Then again the monk with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
This monk is said to have blinded Mara
Trackless he has destroyed Mara's vision and has become invisible to the Evil One
Then again the monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
This monk is said to have blinded Mara
Trackless he has destroyed Mara's vision and has become invisible to the Evil One
Then again the monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
This monk is said to have blinded Mara
Trackless he has destroyed Mara's vision and has become invisible to the Evil One
Then again the monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
This monk is said to have blinded Mara
Trackless he has destroyed Mara's vision and has become invisible to the Evil One
Then again the monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
This monk is said to have blinded Mara
Trackless he has destroyed Mara's vision and has become invisible to the Evil One
Then again the monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters  remains in the cessation of perception  feeling
And having seen with discernment his mental fermentations are completely ended
This monk is said to have blinded Mara
Trackless he has destroyed Mara's vision and has become invisible to the Evil One
Having crossed over he is unattached in the world
Carefree he walks carefree he stands carefree he sits carefree he lies down
Why is that
Because he has gone beyond the Evil One's range
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
Phagguna if anyone were to reproach you right to your face even then you should abandon those urges and thoughts which are worldly
There Phagguna you should train yourself thus 'Neither shall my mind be affected by this nor shall I give vent to evil words but I shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and I shall not give in to hatred' This is how Phagguna you should train yourself
Phagguna if anyone were to give you a blow with the hand or hit you with a clod of earth or with a stick or with a sword even then you should abandon those urges and thoughts which are worldly
There Phagguna you should train yourself thus 'Neither shall my mind be affected by this nor shall I give vent to evil words but I shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and I shall not give in to hatred' This is how Phagguna you should train yourself
In the past monks in this very Savatthi there was a mistress Vedehika by name
And monks this good reputation had spread about the mistress Vedehika 'The mistress Vedehika is gentle the mistress Vedehika is meek the mistress Vedehika is calm' Now monks the mistress Vedehika had a maidservant Kali by name who was able energetic and very methodical in her work
Then monks it occurred to Kali the maidservant 'This good reputation has spread about my lady The mistress Vedehika is gentle the mistress Vedehika is meek the mistress Vedehika is calm Could it be that my lady does have anger within her which she does not show or could it be that she does not have anger
Or is it because I am methodical in my job that my lady though she does have anger within does not show it and not because she does not have anger
Why don't I test my lady'
Thus monks the maidservant Kali got up late the next morning
And monks the mistress Vedehika told this to the maidservant Kali 'Hey you Kali'  'What is it lady'  'Why did you get up so late'  'Oh that is nothing lady'  'What
That is nothing indeed
You bad maidservant you got up late' Angry and displeased she frowned
Then monks it occurred to Kali the maidservant 'Though she does have anger within my lady does not show it it is not that she does not have anger
It is because I am methodical in my job that though she does have anger within my lady does not show it and not because she does not have anger
Why don't I test my lady further'
Now monks Kali the maidservant got up even later than before
Then monks the mistress Vedehika told the maidservant Kali 'Hey you Kali'  'What is it lady'  'Why did you get up even later than before'  'Oh that is nothing lady'  'What
That is nothing indeed
You bad maidservant you got up even later than before' Angry and displeased she gave vent to her displeasure
Then monks it occurred to the maidservant Kali 'Though she does have anger within my lady does not show it it is not that she does not have anger
It is because I am methodical in my job that though she does have anger within my lady does not show it and not because she does not have anger
Why don't I test my lady further'
And monks the maidservant Kali got up even later than before
Then monks the mistress Vedehika told the maidservant Kali 'Hey you Kali'  'What is it lady'  'Why did you get up so late'  'Oh that is nothing lady'  'What
That is nothing indeed
You bad maidservant you got up so late' And angry and displeased she hit her on the head with the doorbar
And this injured her head
Now monks the maidservant Kali with her head injured and blood oozing went about among the neighbors shouting 'Look sirs at the deed of the gentle one
Look sirs at the deed of the meek one
Look sirs at the deed of the calm one
How can she saying to her own maidservant You got up late today angry and displeased having taken a doorbar give me a blow on the head and injure my head'
And then monks this illrepute spread thereafter about the mistress Vedehika 'The mistress Vedehika is violent the mistress Vedehika is arrogant the mistress Vedehika is not calm'
In the same way monks some monk here is very gentle very meek and very calm so long as disagreeable ways of speech do not assail him but when disagreeable ways of speech do assail the monk it is then that the monk is to be judged whether he is 'gentle' 'meek' or 'calm' Monks I do not call that monk 'dutiful' who is dutiful on account of the requisites he gets ie the robe almsfood lodging and medicaments whereby he falls into pseudodutifulness
And why
For monks when that monk fails to get the requisites of the robe almsfood lodging and medicaments he ceases to be dutiful and is not in keeping with the norms of dutifulness
But monks whichever monk out of reverence for the Teaching out of respect for the Teaching out of dedication to the Teaching showing honor to the Teaching and giving regard to the Teaching comes to be dutiful and is in keeping with the norms of dutifulness him do I consider as dutiful
Therefore monks you should consider 'Only out of reverence for the Teaching out of respect for the Teaching out of dedication to the Teaching showing honor to the Teaching and giving regard to the Teaching shall we become dutiful shall we be in keeping with the norms of dutifulness' Thus indeed monks you should train yourselves
Monks there are these five modes of speech which people might use when speaking to you  speech that is timely or untimely true or false gentle or harsh with a good or a harmful motive and with a loving heart or hostility
Monks some might speak to you using speech that is timely or untimely monks some might speak to you according to truth or falsely monks some might speak to you gently or harshly monks some might speak to you with a good motive or with a harmful motive monks some might speak to you with a loving heart or with hostility
On all occasions monks you should train yourselves thus 'Neither shall our minds be affected by this nor for this matter shall we give vent to evil words but we shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and we shall not give in to hatred
On the contrary we shall live projecting thoughts of universal love to that very person making him as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love  thoughts that have grown great exalted and measureless
We shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will' It is in this way monks that you should train yourselves
Suppose monks a person were to come to you holding a hoe and a basket and he were to say 'I shall make this great earth earthless' Then he would strew the earth here and there spit here and there and urinate here and there and would say' 'Be earthless be earthless' What do you think monks would this person render this great earth earthless
No indeed not most venerable sir
And why
Because this great earth most venerable sir is deep and without measure
It cannot possibly be turned earthless
On the contrary that person would only reap weariness and frustration
In the same way monks others may use these five modes of speech when speaking to you  speech that is timely or untimely true or false gentle or harsh with a good or a harmful motive and with a loving heart or hostility
In this way monks you should train yourselves 'Neither shall our minds be affected by this nor for this matter shall we give vent to evil words but we shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and we shall not give in to hatred
On the contrary we shall live projecting thoughts of universal love to that very person making him as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love  thoughts that have grown great exalted and measureless
We shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will' It is in this way monks that you should train yourselves
Suppose monks a person were to approach you carrying paints of lacquer turmeric indigo or carmine and he were to say 'I will draw this picture I will make this painting appear on this empty space' What do you think monks could he make this painting appear on empty space
No indeed not most venerable sir
And why not
Because this empty space most venerable sir is formless and invisible
He cannot possibly draw a picture or make a painting appear on this empty space
On the contrary that person will only reap weariness and frustration
In the same way monks others may use these five modes of speech when speaking to you  speech that is timely or untimely true or false gentle or harsh with a good or a harmful motive and with a loving heart or hostility
In this way monks you should train yourselves 'Neither shall our minds be affected by this nor for this matter shall we give vent to evil words but we shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and we shall not give in to hatred

We shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will' It is in this way monks that you should train yourselves
Suppose monks a person were to come holding a burning grasstorch and he were to say 'With this burning grasstorch I shall set fire to and scorch this river Ganges' What do you think monks could that person set fire to and scorch the river Ganges with a grasstorch
No indeed not most venerable sir
And why not
Because most venerable sir the river Ganges is deep and without measure
It is not possible to set fire to and scorch the river Ganges with a burning grasstorch
On the contrary that person will only reap weariness and frustration
In the same way monks others may use these five modes of speech when speaking to you  speech that is timely or untimely true or false gentle or harsh with a good or a harmful motive and with a loving heart or hostility

We shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will' It is in this way monks that you should train yourselves
Suppose monks there was a supple and silky leather bag made of catskin that had been beaten tanned cured and fully processed and made completely free of all creases and wrinkles
Then a man were to come with a stick or mallet and say 'With this stick or mallet I shall make creases and wrinkles in this supple and silky catskin bag which has been beaten tanned cured and fully processed and made free of creases and wrinkles' What do you think monks could that person with a stick or mallet make creases and wrinkles in that supple and silky catskin bag which has been beaten tanned cured and fully processed and made free of creases and wrinkles
No indeed not most venerable sir
And why not
Because most venerable sir that supple and silky leather bag made of catskin has been beaten tanned cured and fully processed and made free of creases and wrinkles
It is not possible to make creases and wrinkles in it with a stick or mallet
On the contrary he will only reap weariness and frustration
In the same way monks others may use these five modes of speech when speaking to you  speech that is timely or untimely true or false gentle or harsh with a good or a harmful motive and with a loving heart or hostility

We shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will' It is in this way monks that you should train yourselves
Monks even if bandits were to savagely sever you limb by limb with a doublehandled saw even then whoever of you harbors ill will at heart would not be upholding my Teaching
Monks even in such a situation you should train yourselves thus 'Neither shall our minds be affected by this nor for this matter shall we give vent to evil words but we shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and we shall not give in to hatred
On the contrary we shall live projecting thoughts of universal love to those very persons making them as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love  thoughts that have grown great exalted and measureless
We shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will' It is in this way monks that you should train yourselves
Monks if you should keep this instruction on the Parable of the Saw constantly in mind do you see any mode of speech subtle or gross that you could not endure
No Lord
Therefore monks you should keep this instruction on the Parable of the Saw constantly in mind
That will conduce to your wellbeing and happiness for long indeed
That is what the Blessed One said
Delighted those monks acclaimed the Teaching of the Blessed One
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks replied
The Blessed One said When a monk is intent on the heightened mind there are five themes he should attend to at the appropriate times
Which five
There is the case where evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  arise in a monk while he is referring to and attending to a particular theme
He should attend to another theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful
When he is attending to this other theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful then those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
Just as a skilled carpenter or his apprentice would use a small peg to knock out drive out and pull out a large one in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  arise in a monk while he is referring to and attending to a particular theme he should attend to another theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful
When he is attending to this other theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful then those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
If evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to this other theme connected with what is skillful he should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts 'Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful these thoughts of mine are blameworthy these thoughts of mine result in stress' As he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
Just as a young woman  or man  fond of adornment would be horrified humiliated and disgusted if the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human being were hung from her neck in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to this other theme connected with what is skillful he should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts 'Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful these thoughts of mine are blameworthy these thoughts of mine result in stress' As he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
If evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts he should pay no mind and pay no attention to those thoughts
As he is paying no mind and paying no attention to them those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
Just as a man with good eyes not wanting to see forms that had come into range would close his eyes or look away in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts he should pay no mind and pay no attention to those thoughts
As he is paying no mind and paying no attention to them those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
If evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts he should attend to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts
As he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
Just as the thought would occur to a man walking quickly 'Why am I walking quickly
Why don't I walk slowly' So he walks slowly
The thought occurs to him 'Why am I walking slowly
Why don't I stand' So he stands
The thought occurs to him 'Why am I standing
Why don't I sit down' So he sits down
The thought occurs to him 'Why am I sitting
Why don't I lie down' So he lies down
In this way giving up the grosser posture he takes up the more refined one
In the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts he should attend to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts
As he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
If evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts then  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he should beat down constrain and crush his mind with his awareness
As  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he is beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
Just as a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain and crush him in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts  imbued with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts then  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he should beat down constrain and crush his mind with his awareness
As  with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he is beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it
Now when a monk attending to another theme scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it He is then called a monk with mastery over the ways of thought sequences
He thinks whatever thought he wants to and doesn't think whatever thought he doesn't
He has severed craving thrown off the fetters and  through the right penetration of conceit  has made an end of suffering and stress
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
Thus have I heard
At one time the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's Pleasance
The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus and they replied to him saying Reverend Sir The Blessed One spoke as follows
Five things should be reflected on from time to time by the bhikkhu who is intent on the higher consciousness
What five
When evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion arise in a bhikkhu through reflection on an adventitious object he should reflect on a different object which is connected with skill
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
Like an experienced carpenter or carpenter's apprentice striking hard at pushing out and getting rid of a coarse peg with a fine one should the bhikkhu in order to get rid of the adventitious object reflect on a different object which is connected with skill
Then the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
If the evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu who in order to get rid of an adventitious object reflects on a different object which is connected with skill he should ponder on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts thus Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful blameworthy and productive of misery
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
Like a welldressed young man or woman who feels horrified humiliated and disgusted because of the carcass of a snake dog or human that is hung round his or her neck should the bhikkhu in whom unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his reflection on the object which is connected with skill ponder on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts thus Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful blameworthy and productive of misery
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
If evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu who ponders on their disadvantageousness he should in regard to them endeavor to be without attention and reflection
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
Like a keeneyed man shutting his eyes and looking away from some direction in order to avoid seeing visible objects come within sight should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his pondering on their disadvantageousness endeavor to be without attention and reflection as regards them
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
If evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu in spite of his endeavor to be without attention and reflection as regards evil unskillful thoughts he should reflect on the removal of the source of those unskillful thoughts
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
Just as a man finding no reason for walking fast walks slowly finding no reason for walking slowly stands finding no reason for standing sits down finding no reason for sitting down lies down and thus getting rid of a posture rather uncalm resorts to a restful posture just so should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts arise in spite of his endeavor to be without attention and reflection regarding them reflect on the removal of the source of those unskillful thoughts
Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
If evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu in spite of his reflection on the removal of a source of unskillful thoughts he should with clenched teeth and the tongue pressing on the palate restrain subdue and beat down the mind by the mind
Then the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
Like a strong man holding a weaker man by the head or shoulders and restraining subduing and beating him down should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his reflection on the source of unskillful thoughts restrain subdue and beat down the mind by the mind with clenched teeth and the tongue pressing on the palate
Then the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappear
By their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within
When indeed bhikkhus evil unskillful thoughts due to reflection on an adventitious object are eliminated when they disappear and the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within through his reflection on an object connected with skill through his pondering on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts his endeavoring to be without attentiveness and reflection as regards those thoughts or through his restraining subduing and beating down of the evil mind by the good mind with clenched teeth and tongue pressing on the palate that bhikkhu is called a master of the paths along which thoughts travel
The thought he wants to think that he thinks the thought he does not want to think that he does not think
He has cut down craving removed the fetter rightly mastered pride and made an end of suffering
The Blessed One said this and the bhikkhus glad at heart approved of his words
This is a discourse about clinging to views
Its central message is conveyed in two similes among the most famous in the Canon the simile of the watersnake and the simile of the raft
Taken together these similes focus on the skill needed to grasp right view properly as a means of leading to the cessation of suffering rather than an object of clinging and then letting it go when it has done its job
The first section of the discourse leading up to the simile of the watersnake focuses on the danger of misapprehending the Dhamma in general and particularly the teachings on sensuality
The discourse doesn't explain how the offending monk Arittha formulated his misapprehension of the Dhamma but the Commentary suggests a plausible scenario
Here the monk having gone into seclusion reasons as follows 'There are people living the household life enjoying the five pleasures of the senses who are streamwinners oncereturners and nonreturners
As for monks they see pleasurable forms cognizable via the eye hear smell taste feel tactile sensations cognizable via the body
They use soft carpets and clothing
All this is proper
Then why shouldn't the sight sound smell taste and feel of a woman be proper
They too are proper' Thus comparing a mustard seed with Mount Sineru he gives rise to the pernicious viewpoint 'Why did the Blessed One  binding the ocean as it were with great effort  formulate the first parajika training rule
There is nothing wrong with that act' Regardless of how Arittha actually arrived at his position the Commentary's suggestion makes an important point that just because an idea can be logically inferred from the Dhamma does not mean that the idea is valid or useful
The Buddha himself makes the same point in AN
Monks these two slander the Tathagata
Which two
He who explains a discourse whose meaning needs to be inferred as one whose meaning has already been fully drawn out
And he who explains a discourse whose meaning has already been fully drawn out as one whose meaning needs to be inferred Having established this point the discourse illustrates it with the simile of the watersnake which in turn is an introduction to the simile of the raft
It is important to underline the connection between these two similes for it is often missed
Many a casual reader has concluded from the simile of the raft simply that the Dhamma is to be let go
In fact one major Mahayana text  the Diamond Sutra  interprets the raft simile as meaning that one has to let go of the raft in order to cross the river
However the simile of the watersnake makes the point that the Dhamma has to be grasped the trick lies in grasping it properly
When this point is then applied to the raft simile the implication is clear One has to hold onto the raft properly in order to cross the river
Only when one has reached the safety of the further shore can one let go
Taken together these two similes set the stage for the remainder of the discourse which focuses on the teaching of notself
This is one of the most easily misapprehended teachings in the Canon largely because it is possible to draw the wrong inferences from it
Two mistaken inferences are particularly relevant here
The first concerns the range of the notself teaching
Some have argued that because the Buddha usually limits his teachings on notself to the five aggregates  form feeling perceptions fabrications and consciousness  he leaves open the possibility that something else may be regarded as self
Or as the argument is often phrased he denies the limited temporal self as a means of pointing to one's identity with the larger unlimited cosmic self
However in this discourse the Buddha explicitly phrases the notself teaching in such a way as to refute any notion of cosmic self
Instead of centering his discussion of notself on the five aggregates he focuses on the first four aggregates plus two other possible objects of selfidentification both more explicitly cosmic in their range all that can be seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect and the cosmos as a whole eternal and unchanging
In fact the Buddha holds this last view up to particular ridicule as the teaching of a fool for two reasons that are developed at different points in this discourse If the cosmos were me then it must also be mine which is obviously not the case
There is nothing in the experience of the cosmos that fits the bill of being eternal unchanging or that deserves to be clung to as me or mine
The second mistaken inference is that given the thoroughness with which the Buddha teaches notself one should draw the inference that there is no self
This inference is treated less explicitly in this discourse although it is touched upon briefly in terms of what the Buddha teaches here and how he teaches
In terms of what He explicitly states he cannot envision a doctrine of self that if clung to would not lead to sorrow lamentation pain grief  despair
He does not list all the possible doctrines of self included under this statement but MN provides at least a partial list
I have a self I have no self It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self or This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternity
This is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views
Bound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
He is not freed I tell you from suffering  stress
Thus the view I have no self is just as much a doctrine of self as the view I have a self Because the act of clinging involves what the Buddha calls Imaking  the creation of a sense of self  if one were to cling to the view that there is no self one would be creating a very subtle sense of self around that view
But as he says the Dhamma is taught for the elimination of all viewpositions determinations biases inclinations  obsessions for the stilling of all fabrications for the relinquishing of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding
Thus it is important to focus on how the Dhamma is taught Even in his most thoroughgoing teachings about notself the Buddha never recommends replacing the assumption that there is a self with the assumption that there is no self
Instead he only goes so far as to point out the drawbacks of various ways of conceiving the self and then to recommend dropping them
For example in his standard series of questions building on the logic of the inconstancy and stress of the aggregates he does not say that because the aggregates are inconstant and stressful there is no self
He simply asks When they are inconstant and stressful is it proper to assume that they are me my self what I am
Now because the sense of self is a product of Imaking this question seeks to do nothing more than to induce disenchantment and dispassion for that process of Imaking so as to put a stop to it
Once that is accomplished the teaching has fulfilled its purpose in putting an end to suffering and stress
That's the safety of the further shore
As the Buddha says in this discourse Both formerly and now monks I declare only stress and the cessation of stress As he also says here when views of self are finally dropped one is free from agitation and as MN points out when one is truly unagitated one is unbound
The raft has reached the shore and one can leave it there  free to go where one likes in a way that cannot be traced
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's park
Now on that occasion this pernicious viewpoint had arisen in the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructions A large number of monks heard They say that this pernicious viewpoint has arisen in the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers 'As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructions' So they went to the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers and on arrival said to him Is it true friend Arittha that this pernicious viewpoint has arisen in you  'As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructions'
Yes indeed friends
I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One and those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructions
Then those monks desiring to pry the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers away from that pernicious viewpoint quizzed him back and forth and rebuked him saying Don't say that friend Arittha
Don't misrepresent the Blessed One for it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One
The Blessed One would not say anything like that
In many ways friend the Blessed One has described obstructive acts and when indulged in they are genuine obstructions
The Blessed One has said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction much stress much despair  greater drawbacks
The Blessed One has compared sensual pleasures to a chain of bones of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks
The Blessed One has compared sensual pleasures to a lump of flesh a grass torch a pit of glowing embers a dream borrowed goods the fruits of a tree a butcher's ax and chopping block swords and spears a snake's head of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks And yet even though he was quizzed back  forth and rebuked by those monks the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers through stubbornness and attachment to that very same pernicious viewpoint continued to insist Yes indeed friends
I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One and those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructions
So when the monks were unable to pry the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers away from that pernicious viewpoint they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they 
So the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk
In my name call the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers saying 'The Teacher calls you friend Arittha' As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers on arrival he said The Teacher calls you friend Arittha
As you say my friend the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers replied
Then he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Arittha that this pernicious viewpoint has arisen in you  'As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructions'
Yes indeed lord
I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One and those acts the Blessed One says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructions
Worthless man from whom have you understood that Dhamma taught by me in such a way
Worthless man haven't I in many ways described obstructive acts
And when indulged in they are genuine obstructions
