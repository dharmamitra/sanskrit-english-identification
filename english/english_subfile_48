Having heard the Buddhas words Venerable Rāhula and the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse on Intention  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park  At that time the Worldhonored One told the monks If a person does an action intentionally then he will have to experience its result either in this life or in the next life I say If a person does an action unintentionally then he will not have to experience the result I say In this connection there are three intentionally done bodily actions that are unwholesome have suffering as their fruit and result in the experience of suffering There are four verbal actions and three mental actions that are unwholesome have suffering as their fruit and result in the experience of suffering What are the three intentionally done bodily actions that are unwholesome have suffering as their fruit and result in the experience of suffering The first is killing living beings someone is extremely evil and bloodthirsty has the desire to harm and has no compassion toward living being including insects The second is taking what is not given someone has attachment to anothers property and with thieving intent takes it The third is sexual misconduct someone has sexual relations with a woman who is under the protection of her father or under the protection of her mother or under the protection of both father and mother or under the protection of her sisters or under the protection of her brothers or under the protection of her parentsinlaw or under the protection of her relatives or under the protection of her clan or with a woman who is married to another man  the fear of being punished or with who has been garlanded as a sign of betrothal These are the three intentionally done bodily actions that are unwholesome have suffering as their fruit and result in the experience of suffering What are the four intentionally done verbal actions that are unwholesome have suffering as their fruit and result in the experience of suffering The first is false speech someone perhaps in an assembly or among ones retainers or in the kings palace on being told Say what you know claims to know what he does not know or claims not to know what he does know claims to have seen what he has not seen c or claims not to have seen what he did see be it for his own sake or for the sake of others or for the sake of profit he knowingly speaks falsehood The second is divisive speech someone wishes to divide others hearing something from this person he tells it to that person in order to harm this person hearing something from that person he tells it to this person in order to harm that person He desires to divide those who are united and to further split those who are already divided he creates factions delights in factions and praises factions The third is harsh speech someone utters speech that is rough and rude in tone offensive words that grate on the ear that people neither enjoy nor desire he utters such speech as causes others suffering and vexation that is not conductive to concentration The fourth is frivolous speech someone makes talk that is untimely untrue talk meaningless talk talk that is contrary to the Dharma that is not calming furthermore he praises what is not conductive to calming and teaches and admonishes others in an untimely and unwholesome way These are the four intentionally done verbal actions that are unwholesome have suffering as their fruit and result in the experience of suffering What are the three intentionally done mental actions that are unwholesome have suffering as their fruit and result in the experience of suffering The first is covetousness someone views anothers wealth and lifestyle constantly longing for them and wishing If only I could get that The second is ill will someones mind is filled with ill will and he thinks Those beings should be killed bound arrested removed or banished His wish is for them to experience immeasurable suffering The third is wrong view someone holds distorted views Views such as these tenets such as these There is no offering no sacrifice there are no incantations no wholesome or unwholesome actions no results of wholesome or unwholesome actions there is neither this world nor another world  there are no father and mother there are no True Persons in the world who are headed for a supreme attainment who are well gone and well directed who have known and realized for themselves this world and the other world and who dwell having personally realized These are the three intentionally done mental actions that are unwholesome have suffering as their fruit and result in the experience of suffering A learned noble disciple abandons unwholesome bodily actions and practices wholesome bodily actions he abandons unwholesome verbal and mental actions and practices wholesome verbal and mental actions That learned noble disciple endowed with diligence and virtue in this way achieves pure bodily actions pure verbal actions and pure mental actions He abandons ill will and quarrel discards sloth and torpor is without restlessness and conceit he cuts off doubt he transcends arrogance has right mindfulness and right attentiveness and is without confusion With a mind imbued with lovingkindness he dwells pervading one direction likewise the second the third and the fourth direction and also the four intermediate directions above and below all around everywhere With a mind imbued with lovingkindness free from fetters or resentment without ill will or quarrel he dwells pervading the entire world that is boundless exalted immeasurable and well cultivated He thinks Formerly my mind was narrow and not well cultivated now my mind is immeasurable and well cultivated If the learned noble disciple whose mind is thus immeasurable and well cultivated had earlier neglected his practice because of bad friends and done unwholesome actions then he will no longer be led along by them They cannot corrupt him and will not accompany him further Suppose there were a young boy or a young girl who since birth had been able to practice liberation of the mind through lovingkindness Would he or she later perform unwholesome bodily verbal or mental actions The monks replied No Worldhonored One And why not Since he or she has never done an evil deed how could evil deeds arise a  Therefore a man or woman whether layperson or renunciant should always diligently practice liberation of the mind through lovingkindness If that man or woman whether layperson or renunciant practices liberation of the mind through lovingkindness when going toward the other world will not take this body along will proceed in accordance with mind Monks you should think like this Formerly I was negligent and did unwholesome deeds Let all their results be experienced now not in the next life One who practices liberation of the mind through lovingkindness in this way immeasurable and well cultivated will definitely attain the fruit of nonreturning or else attain that which is still higher with compassion with empathic joy and with equanimity Free from fetters or resentment without ill will or quarrel he dwells pervading the entire world boundless exalted immeasurable and well cultivated He thinks Formerly my mind was narrow and not well cultivated now my mind is immeasurable and well cultivated If the learned noble disciple whose mind is thus immeasurable and well cultivated had earlier neglected his practice because of bad friends and done unwholesome actions then he will no longer be led along by them They cannot corrupt him and will not accompany him further Suppose there were a young boy or a young girl who since birth had been able to practice liberation of the mind through equanimity Would he or she later perform unwholesome bodily verbal or mental actions b The monks replied No Worldhonored One And why not Since he or she has never done an evil deed how could evil deeds arise  Therefore a man or woman whether layperson or renunciant should always diligently practice liberation of the mind through equanimity  If that man or woman whether layperson or renunciant practices liberation of the mind through equanimity when going toward the other world  will not take this body along will proceed in accordance with mind Monks you should think like this Formerly I was negligent and did unwholesome deeds Let all their results be experienced now not in the next life One who practices liberation of the mind through equanimity in this way immeasurable and well cultivated will definitely attain the fruit of nonreturning or else attain that which is still higher This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse to the Kālāmas  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha who was wandering in the territory of the Kālāmas together with a great company of monks having arrived at Kesaputta was staying in a rosewood grove north of Kesaputta At that time the Kālāmas of Kesaputta heard that the renunciant Gotama a son of the Sakyans who had gone forth from the Sakya clan to train in the path was wandering in the territory of the Kālāmas together with a great company of monks and having arrived at Kesaputta was staying in a rosewood grove north of Kesaputta the renunciant Gotama had a great reputation which had spread in all the ten directions The renunciant Gotama is a Tathāgata free from attachment fully awakened accomplished in knowledge and conduct a Wellgone One a knower of the world an unsurpassed one a trainer of those to be tamed a teacher of gods and human beings and known as the Buddha the Fortunate One In this world with its gods Māras Brahmās renunciants and brahmins from human beings to gods he has understanding and awakening by himself and dwells having personally realized it The Dharma he teaches is good in the beginning good in the middle and  good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing revealing a holy life endowed with purity If one visits such a Tathāgata who is free from attachment and fully awakened pays homage to him respectfully and serves him then one will quickly get good rewards c We should go together to see the renunciant Gotama and pay homage to him Having learned  the Kālāmas of Kesaputta left Kesaputta relatives walking in groups together They went north toward the rosewood grove to visit the Worldhonored One and pay homage to him Having approached the Buddha some of the Kālāmas paid respect with their heads at the Buddhas feet and sat to one side some exchanged courteous greetings with the Buddha and sat to one side some saluted the Buddha with their palms placed together and sat to one side and some having seen the Buddha from a distance sat down silently When each of the Kālāmas was seated and settled the Buddha taught them Dharma exhorting encouraging and delighting them Having by countless skillful means taught them Dharma having exhorted encouraged and delighted them he remained silent Then the Kālāmas having been taught Dharma by the Buddha having been exhorted encouraged and delighted rose from their seats arranged their clothes so as to bare one shoulder saluted the Buddha by placing their palms together and said to the Worldhonored One Gotama some renunciant or brahmin approaches Kālāmas and just praises what he himself has come to know and see while denouncing and disparaging what others have come to know and see And then Gotama another renunciant or brahmin approaches Kālāmas and also praises what he himself has come to know and see while denouncing and disparaging what others have come to know and see Gotama having heard these we have come to doubt Which of these renunciants or brahmins is right and which is wrong The Worldhonored One told them  Kālāmas do not doubt When there is doubt hesitation arises Kālāmas you yourselves do not have clear knowledge about whether there is a next life or whether there is no next life Kālāmas you yourselves also do not have clear knowledge about what action is an offense and what action is not an offense Kālāmas you should know that all actions have three causes sources roots causal conditions What are the three Kālāmas desire is a cause a source a root a causal condition of actions Kālāmas hatred and ignorance are causes sources roots causal conditions of actions Kālāmas someone who has desire becomes overwhelmed by desire their mind is never satisfied Such a one may kill living beings or take what is not given or engage in sexual misconduct or knowingly speak falsehood or drink intoxicating liquor Kālāmas someone who has hatred becomes overwhelmed by hatred their mind is never satisfied Such a one may kill living beings or take what is not given or engage in sexual misconduct or knowingly speak falsehood or drink intoxicating liquor Kālāmas someone who is ignorant becomes overwhelmed by ignorance their mind is never satisfied Such a one may kill living beings or take what is not given or engage in sexual

mind lovingkindness and compassion benefit all  including insects He purifies his mind with regard to killing living beings Kālāmas a learned noble disciple abstains from taking what is not given

unite those that are divided delighting in unity He does not belong to any faction and does not delight in or praise factions He has purified his mind with regard to divisive speech Kālāmas a learned noble disciple abstains from harsh speech has given up harsh speech He has given up the type of speech that consists of words that are rough and rude in tone offensive words that grate on the ear that

and beneficial that are pleasant to the ear and enter the mind that are enjoyable and desirable that give others happiness words endowed with meaning that do not make others afraid and that help others to attain concentration He purifies his mind with regard to harsh speech Kālāmas a learned noble disciple abstains from frivolous speech and abandons frivolous speech He speaks at the time speaking what is true what is Dharma what is meaningful what is calming delighting in speaking what is calming matter he teaches well and admonishes well in accordance with the time and in a proper way He purifies his mind with regard to frivolous speech  Kālāmas a learned noble disciple abstains from covetousness and abandons covetousness his mind is not full of envy on seeing anothers wealth

there are results of wholesome or unwholesome deeds there is this world and the other world there are father and mother there are True Persons in the world who are headed for a supreme attainment who are well gone and well directed who in this world and another world have understanding and awakening by themselves and dwell having personally realized it In this manner Kālāmas a learned noble disciple achieves purity of bodily actions achieves purity of verbal and mental actions He abandons ill will and quarrel discards sloth and torpor is without restlessness or conceit and cuts off doubt

quarrel he dwells pervading the entire world boundless exalted immeasurable and well cultivated It is the same with compassion empathic joy and equanimity free from fetters and resentment without ill

without ill will or quarrel and he obtains four assurances What are the four there is this world and another world there are results of wholesome and unwholesome actions then upholding and being endowed with this right view and action in conformity with it at the breaking up of the body after my death I will certainly go to a good realm of existence be reborn in a heavenly realm Thus Kālāmas this is the first assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment without ill will or quarrel Again Kālāmas there is neither this world nor another world there are no results of wholesome and unwholesome actions then in this case in this lifetime I am not censured by others for this belief but am praised for having right attentiveness as one who is diligent and one who is said to have right view Thus Kālāmas this is the second assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment without ill will or quarrel Again Kālāmas Whatever I have done I have certainly done no evil and I recollect no evil Since I have done no evil whence could suffering arise Thus Kālāmas this is the third assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment without ill will or quarrel Again Kālāmas Whatever I may have done I have certainly done no evil and I have not violated the world either out of fear or without fear I have always had compassion and empathy for the  entire world My mind has been free of contention with beings untainted and delighted Thus Kālāmas this is the fourth assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment without ill will or quarrel These Kālāmas are the four assurances obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment without ill will or quarrel The Kālāmas said to the Worldhonored One Indeed Gotama the mind of a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment without ill will or quarrel obtains four assurances What are the four there is this world and another world there are results of wholesome and unwholesome actions then upholding and being endowed with this right view and with action in conformity with it at the breaking up of the body after my death I will certainly go to a good realm of existence and be reborn in a heavenly realm Thus Gotama this is the first assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment without ill will or quarrel Again Gotama there is neither this world nor another world there are no results of wholesome and unwholesome actions then in this case in this lifetime I am not censured by others for this belief but am praised for having right attentiveness as one who is diligent and is said to have right view Thus Gotama this is the second assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment without ill will or quarrel Again Gotama Whatever I may have done I have certainly done no evil and I recollect no evil Since I have done no evil whence could suffering arise cThus Gotama this is the third assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment without ill will or quarrel Again Gotama Whatever I may have done I have certainly done no evil and I have not violated the world either out of fear or without fear I have always had compassion and empathy for the entire world My mind has been free of contention with beings untainted and delighted Thus Gotama this is the fourth assurance obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment without ill will or quarrel These Gotama are the four assurances obtained by a learned noble disciple whose mind is free from fetters and resentment without ill will or quarrel Gotama we have come to know it Wellgone One we have understood it Worldhonored One we go for lifelong refuge to the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks May the Worldhonored One accept us as lay followers From this day forth until life ends we go for refuge This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words all the people of Kālāma and the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse to Gāmaṇi  aThus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Nālandā in Pāvārikas mango grove At that time Asita Devala had a son named Gāmaṇi who was of majestic complexion and build radiant and bright Just before dawn approached the place where the Buddha was paid homage at the Buddhas feet and stood to one side Gāmaṇi the son of Asita Devala said Worldhonored One brahmins arrogantly claim that they serve various gods and that they can at will cause beings to reach a good realm of existence after death to be reborn in a heavenly realm The Worldhonored  One is the King of Dharma The Worldhonored One said Now Gāmaṇi I shall ask you something Answer according to your understanding What do you think Gāmaṇi If in a village there are men and women who are lazy and indolent and who behave in evil ways undertaking the ten unwholesome courses of actionkilling living beings taking what is not given sexual misconduct false speech  wrong viewand at the time of their death crowds of people come placing their palms together praising and imploring saying You men and women who have been lazy and indolent and have behaved in evil ways undertaking the ten unwholesome courses of actionkilling living beings taking what is not given sexual misconduct false speech  wrong view because of this conditioned by this after the breaking up of the body at death you shall reach a good realm of existence and be reborn in a heavenly realm Gāmaṇi those men and women who have been lazy and indolent and have behaved in evil ways undertaking the ten unwholesome courses of actionkilling living beings taking what is not given sexual misconduct false speech   wrong viewon being urged by those crowds of people who come placing their palms together praising and imploring them will they because of this conditioned by this after the breaking up of the body at death reach a good realm of existence and be reborn in a heavenly realm Very good Gāmaṇi Why so That those men and women who have been lazy and indolent and who behaved in evil ways undertaking the ten unwholesome courses of actionkilling living beings taking what  is not given sexual misconduct false speech  wrong viewon being approached by crowds of people placing their palms together praising and imploring them that because of this conditioned by this after the breaking up of the body at death they should reach a good realm of existence and be reborn in a heavenly realm this is not possible Suppose Gāmaṇi there was a deep lake full of water located not far from a village and a man was to throw a large heavy rock into it If a crowd of people came along and placing their palms together praising and imploring said May you float up and come outwhat do you think Gāmaṇi On being urged by that crowd of people who have come placing their palms together praising and imploring because of this conditioned by this would that large heavy rock come out Gāmaṇi replied No Worldhonored One So it is Gāmaṇi Those men and women who have been lazy and indolent and have behaved in evil ways having undertaken the ten unwholesome courses of actionkilling living beings taking what is not given sexual misconduct false speech  wrong view on being approached  by crowds of people placing their palms together praising and imploring them that because of this conditioned by this after the breaking up of the body at death they should reach a good realm of existence and be reborn in a heavenly realm this is not possible And why not These ten unwholesome courses of action are black and have black results by nature they incline downward certainly leading to a bad realm of existence What do you think Gāmaṇi If in a village there are men and women who are diligent and energetic and practice the sublime Dharma undertaking the ten wholesome courses of actionthey refrain from killing and have abandoned killing  taking what is not given  sexual misconduct  false speech  they abstain from wrong view and have abandoned wrong view they have acquired b right viewand at the time of their death crowds of people come placing their palms together praising and imploring them saying You men and women have been diligent and energetic and have practiced the sublime Dharma undertaking the ten wholesome courses of actionyou refrained from killing and had abandoned killing  taking what is not given  sexual misconduct  false speech  you abstained from wrong view and had abandoned wrong view had acquired right viewand because of this conditioned by this after the breaking up of the body at death you shall reach a bad realm of existence be reborn in hell What do you think Gāmaṇi Those men and women who have been diligent and energetic and have practiced the sublime Dharma undertaking the ten wholesome courses of action refrained from killing and had abandoned killing  taking what is not given  sexual misconduct  false speech   abstained from wrong view and had abandoned wrong view had acquired right viewon being urged by the crowds of people who come placing their palms together praising and imploring will they because of this conditioned by this after the breaking up of the body at death reach a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell Gāmaṇi replied No Worldhonored One The Worldhonored One praised him saying Very good Gāmaṇi Gāmaṇi those men and women who have been diligent and energetic and practiced the sublime Dharma undertaking the ten wholesome courses of actionthey refrained from killing and had abandoned killing  taking what is not given  sexual misconduct  false speech  they abstained from wrong view and abandoned wrong view had acquired right viewon being urged by crowds of people placing their palms together praising and imploring that because of this conditioned by this after the breaking up of the body at death they should reach a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell this is not possible  Why so Gāmaṇi these ten wholesome courses of action are white and have white results by nature they ascend certainly reaching a good realm of existence Gāmaṇi suppose there were a deep lake full of water located not far from a village and a man were to throw into the water a jar full of ghee and oil and then break it so that fragments of the jar sank downward while the ghee and oil floated upward Gāmaṇi it is the same with those men and women who have been diligent and energetic and have practiced the sublime Dharma undertaking the ten wholesome courses of action they refrained from killing and had abandoned killing  taking what is not given  sexual misconduct  false speech   they abstained from wrong view and abandoned wrong view had acquired right view At the time of their death the body which is gross matter composed of the four elements was born of father and mother nourished and raised in dependence on food and endured being sat down or laid down to be massaged and bathed is of a nature to break up of a nature to cease of a nature to be dispersed After death it will be pecked at by ravens or eaten by tigers and wolves or burned or buried and finally become ashes and dust their mind their mental faculty their consciousness having been constantly pervaded by faith diligence much learning generosity and wisdom because of this conditioned by this by nature they will ascend to be reborn in a good realm of existence Gāmaṇi those who kill living beings if they refrain from killing and abandon killing then they are on the path of uplift the path of ascent and progress the path to a good realm of existence Gāmaṇi those who take what is not given  sexual misconduct  false speech  those who have wrong view if they abstain from wrong view and acquire right view then they are on the path of uplift the path of ascent and progress the path to a good realm of existence Moreover Gāmaṇi there is another path of uplift path of ascent and progress path to a good realm of existence What Gāmaṇi is this other path of uplift the path of ascent and c progress the path to a good realm of existence It is the eightfold noble path right view   right concentrationthese eight Gāmaṇi this too is a path of uplift a path of ascent and progress a path to a good realm of existence This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words Gāmaṇi and the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse to Sīha  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in the Gabled Hall near the Monkey Lake At that time many Licchavis from Vesālī had come together in the assembly hall frequently speaking in praise of the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks At that time Senior Minister Sīha a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas was also in the assembly Then Senior Minister Sīha had the wish to visit the Buddha and pay homage to him Senior Minister Sīha went first to the place of the Nigaṇṭhas and told the Nigaṇṭhas Venerable sirs I wish to go and visit the renunciant Gotama Then the Nigaṇṭhas reprimanded Sīha saying You should not wish to visit the renunciant Gotama Sīha to visit  a doctrine of inaction is inauspicious and it is also inauspicious to pay homage  Those many Licchavis from Vesālī came together again in the assembly hall a second and a third time frequently speaking in praise of the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks and a second and a third time Senior Minister Sīha a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas was in the assembly Then a second and a third time Senior Minister Sīha had the wish to visit the Buddha and pay homage to him Senior Minister Sīha without asking leave of the Nigaṇṭhas approached the Buddha Having exchanged greetings he sat down to one side and said aI have heard thus The renunciant Gotamas doctrine is based on inaction and he proclaims to people a teaching of inaction Gotama if someone speaks thus The renunciant Gotamas doctrine is based on inaction and he proclaims to people a teaching of inaction is that person not misrepresenting the renunciant Gotama Does he speak what is true Does he speak what is Dharma Does he speak the Dharma according to the Dharma Does he not fall into error and incur censure according to the Dharma The Worldhonored One replied The renunciant Gotamas doctrine is based on inaction

does not fall into error or incur censure according to the Dharma Why is that Sīha there is a way in which according to the true Dharma one would not misrepresent  The renunciant Gotamas doctrine is

spirits of great might and saluting them with palms together In these ways they experience untold suffering in the practice of selfmortification Sīha there is such asceticism I do not deny it But Sīha such asceticism is lowly action leading to suffering leading to distress a practice of worldlings it is not the noble path Sīha if there are renunciants and brahmins whose method of asceticism consists in knowing  abandoning them to cease completely rooting them out and cutting them off so that they will never arise again then I proclaim this asceticism Sīha for the Tathāgata free from attachment and fully awakened the method of asceticism consisted in knowing  abandoning them  to cease completely rooting them out and cutting them off so that they would never arise again For this reason I practiced asceticism Sīha this is the way in which according to the true Dharma one would not misrepresent  The renunciant Gotamas doctrine is based on asceticism and he proclaims to people a teaching of asceticism Again Sīha what is the way in which according to the true Dharma one would not misrepresent  The renunciant  Gotamas doctrine is based on not entering a womb  and he proclaims to people a teaching of not entering a womb Sīha if there are renunciants and brahmins who higher knowledge abandon future rebirth in a womb to cease completely rooting it out and cutting it off so that it will not arise again I proclaim that they will not enter a womb Sīha the Tathāgata free from attachment and fully awakened higher knowledge abandoned future rebirth in a womb to cease completely rooted it out and cut it off so that it will not arise again For this reason I will not again enter a womb Sīha this is a way in which according to the true Dharma one would not misrepresent  The renunciant Gotamas doctrine is based on not entering a womb  and he proclaims to people a teaching of not entering a womb Again Sīha what is the way in which according to the true Dharma one would not misrepresent  The renunciant Gotamas doctrine is based on attaining peace and he proclaims to people a teaching of attaining peace Sīha attained fully the summit of the holy life for the sake of which a clansman shaves off hair and beard dons the yellow robe leaves home out of faith and goes forth to practice the path In this very life I have personally attained understanding and awakening and I dwell having personally realized I know as it really is Birth is ended the holy life has been established what was to be done has been done There will not be another existence Having attained peace myself I bring peace to other monks nuns laymen and laywomen Having brought peace to them I bring liberation from birth to other living beings who are subject to birth  subject to old age  subject to disease  subject to death  I bring liberation from sorrow sadness and defilements to other beings who are subject to sorrow sadness and defilements The renunciant Gotamas doctrine is based on attaining peace and he proclaims to people a teaching of peace bSenior Minister Sīha said to the Worldhonored One Gotama I have known it Wellgone One I have understood it Gotama it is as when someone with clear vision uncovers what was covered exposes what was covered or shows the way to one who was lost or offers a light in the darkness so that those with eyes can see forms In the same way the renunciant Gotama has taught me the Dharma using countless skillful means to reveal its meaning in various ways Worldhonored One I now go for refuge to the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks May the Worldhonored One accept me as a lay follower From this day forth until life ends I go for refuge Worldhonored One just as a person who raises a bad horse expecting to get benefit from it only tires himself and gets no benefitWorldhonored One I was like this Those foolish Nigaṇṭhas lack right knowledge they do not know for themselves Not recognizing the fertile field  and not examining for myself long revered them made offerings and paid them homage expecting to get benefit from it but I only suffered in vain Worldhonored One for a second time I now go for refuge to the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks May the Worldhonored One accept me as a lay follower From this day forth until life ends I go for refuge Worldhonored One I was formerly ignorant Whatever faith and respect I had for those foolish Nigaṇṭhas has today been cut off Because I was deceived Worldhonored One for a third time I now go for refuge to the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks May the Worldhonored One accept me as a lay follower From this day forth until life ends I go for refuge This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words Senior Minister Sīha and the monks were delighted and remembered them well c   The Discourse to the Nigaṇṭhas  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans in Devadaha  There the Worldhonored One told the monks The Nigaṇṭhas hold this view and declare Whatever one experiences is caused by what was done in the past If past karma is eradicated through asceticism and no new is created then all karma comes to cease all karma having ceased the cessation of suffering is attained the cessation of suffering being attained the end of suffering is attained I therefore approached them and on arriving I asked Nigaṇṭhas do you hold this view and declare Whatever one experiences is caused by what was done in the past If past karma is eradicated through asceticism and no new is created then all karma comes to cease all karma having ceased the cessation of suffering is attained the cessation of suffering being attained the end of suffering is attained They replied That is so Gotama I also asked those Nigaṇṭhas Do you personally have clear knowledge that I existed in the past or I did not exist in the past I did evil in the past or I did not do evil in the past This much of the suffering that I created has already been exhausted or This much of the suffering that I created has not yet been exhausted or When this has been exhausted when its exhaustion is attained then by practicing I will realize in this lifetime the eradication of all unwholesome states and the attainment of manifold wholesome states They replied No Gotama I also said to those Nigaṇṭhas you do not personally have clear knowledge that I existed in the past or I did not exist in the past I did evil in the past or I did not do evil in the past This much of the suffering that I created has already been exhausted or This much of the suffering that I created has not been exhausted or When this has been exhausted when its exhaustion is attained then by practicing I will realize in this lifetime the eradication  of all unwholesome states and the attainment of manifold wholesome states How then can you claim Whatever one experiences is caused by what was done in the past If past karma is eradicated through asceticism and no new is created then all karma comes to cease all karma having ceased the cessation of suffering is attained the cessation of suffering being attained the end of suffering is attained Nigaṇṭhas if you personally had clear knowledge that I existed in the past or I did not exist in the past I did evil in the past or I did not do evil in the past This much of the suffering that I created has already been exhausted or This much of the suffering that I created has not been exhausted or When this has been exhausted when its exhaustion is attained then by practicing I will realize in this lifetime the eradication of all unwholesome states and the attainment of manifold wholesome states then Nigaṇṭhas you could claim Whatever one experiences is caused by what was done in the past If past karma is eradicated through asceticism and no new is created all karma comes to cease all karma having ceased the cessation of suffering is attained the cessation of suffering being attained the end of suffering is attained Nigaṇṭhas suppose that a mans body has been wounded by a poisoned arrow and because of being wounded by this poisoned arrow extreme pain arises Then out of sympathy and concern about the wound his kinsmen and relatives call a surgeon to pull out the arrow for his benefit and wellbeing The surgeon comes and with a sharp knife cuts the wound open and while the wound is being cut open extreme pain arises again Having cut the wound open the surgeon probes for the metal arrowhead and while he is probing for the arrowhead extreme pain arises again Having probed and found the arrowhead he pulls it out and while he is pulling it out extreme pain arises again Having pulled out the arrowhead he dresses and bandages the wound and while he is bandaging it extreme pain arises again After the arrowhead has been pulled out a that man regains his vigor and feels well Without any damage to his faculties he recovers and is just as he was before Nigaṇṭhas that man personally having clear knowledge thinks Formerly I was wounded by a poisoned arrow and because of that extreme pain arose Then out of sympathy and concern about the wound my kinsmen and relatives called a surgeon to pull out the arrow for the sake of my benefit and wellbeing The surgeon came and with a sharp knife cut the wound open and while the wound was being cut open extreme pain arose again Having cut the wound open the surgeon probed for the metal arrowhead and while he was probing for the arrowhead extreme pain arose again Having probed and found the arrowhead he pulled it out and while he was pulling it out extreme pain arose again Having pulled out the arrowhead he dressed and bandaged the wound and while he was bandaging it extreme pain arose again After the arrowhead had been pulled out I regained my vigor and felt well Without any damage to my faculties I recovered and was just as I had been before In the same way Nigaṇṭhas if you personally had clear knowledge that I existed in the past or I did not exist in the past I did evil in the past or I did not do evil in the past This much of the suffering that I created has already been exhausted or This much of the suffering that I created has not been exhausted or When this has been exhausted when its exhaustion is attained then by practicing I will realize in this lifetime the eradication of all unwholesome states and the attainment of manifold wholesome states then Nigaṇṭhas you could claim Whatever one experiences is caused by what was done in the past If past karma is eradicated through asceticism and no new is created all karma comes to cease all karma having ceased the cessation of suffering is attained the cessation of suffering being attained the end of suffering is attained I asked them in this way but I did not see any of the Nigaṇṭhas able to answer me saying Gotama it is so or It is not so  Again I asked the Nigaṇṭhas If the Nigaṇṭhas strong striving and strong asceticism will at that time strong pain arise in the Nigaṇṭhas They replied Yes Gotama If the Nigaṇṭhas middling striving and middling asceticism will at that time middling pain arise in the Nigaṇṭhas They replied Yes Gotama If the Nigaṇṭhas weak striving and weak asceticism will at that time weak pain arise in the Nigaṇṭhas They replied Yes Gotama That is to say the Nigaṇṭhas strong striving and strong asceticism at that time strong pain arises in the Nigaṇṭhas they middling striving and middling asceticism at that time middling pain arises in the Nigaṇṭhas they weak striving and weak asceticism at that time weak pain arises in the Nigaṇṭhas When the Nigaṇṭhas strong striving and strong asceticism at that time strong pain is calmed by the Nigaṇṭhas they middling striving and middling asceticism at that time middling pain is calmed by the Nigaṇṭhas they weak striving and weak asceticism at that time weak pain is calmed by the Nigaṇṭhas Whether they act like this or do not act like this to calm that extreme pain that great and heavy pain it should be known that the Nigaṇṭhas are producing pain in the present life But the Nigaṇṭhas are enveloped by ignorance possessed by ignorance saying Whatever one experiences is caused by what was done in the past If past karma is eradicated through asceticism and no new is created all karma comes to cease all karma having ceased the cessation of suffering is attained the cessation of suffering being attained the end of suffering is attained b I asked them in this way but I did not find any Nigaṇṭha able to answer me saying Gotama it is so or It is not so I also asked the Nigaṇṭhas Nigaṇṭhas if there is an action whose result is to be experienced as happiness can that action through striving and through asceticism be turned into having suffering as its result They replied No Gotama Nigaṇṭhas if there is an action whose result is to be experienced as suffering can that action through striving and through asceticism be turned into having happiness as its result They replied No Gotama Nigaṇṭhas if there is an action whose result is to be experienced in this lifetime can that action through striving and through asceticism be turned into having its result in a later life They replied No Gotama Nigaṇṭhas if there is an action whose result is to be experienced in a later life can that action through striving and through asceticism be turned into having its result in this lifetime They replied No Gotama Nigaṇṭhas if there is an action whose result has not yet matured can that action through striving and through asceticism be turned into having its result matured They replied No Gotama Nigaṇṭhas if there is an action whose result has matured can that action through striving and through asceticism be made otherwise They replied No Gotama That is to say Nigaṇṭhas an action whose result is to be experienced as happiness that action cannot through striving and through asceticism be turned into having suffering as its result Nigaṇṭhas an action whose result is to be experienced as suffering that action cannot through striving and through asceticism be turned into having happiness as its result Nigaṇṭhas an action whose result is to be experienced in this lifetime that action cannot through striving and through asceticism be turned into having its result in a later life  Nigaṇṭhas an action whose result is to be experienced in a later life that action cannot through striving and through asceticism be turned into having its result in this lifetime Nigaṇṭhas an action whose result has not yet matured that action cannot through striving and through asceticism be turned into having its result matured Nigaṇṭhas an action whose result has matured that action cannot through striving and through asceticism be made otherwise Therefore Nigaṇṭhas your effort is in vain your striving is empty and futile c Then those Nigaṇṭhas told me if you now restrain your body speech and mind then through this you will not create any further evil karma Again I asked those Nigaṇṭhas Do you believe in venerable teacher the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta without having any doubts They replied Gotama we believe in venerable teacher the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta without having any doubts Again I said to those Nigaṇṭhas There are five things which may have a twofold result in the present life They are belief liking oral tradition memory and wellconsidered view Nigaṇṭhas a person who himself says what is untrue could as believable as likable as traditional as memorable as a wellconsidered view They replied Yes Gotama Then I said further to those Nigaṇṭhas it is an untrue statement how could it be believable how could it be likable how could it be traditional how could it be memorable how could it be well contemplated the person who himself says what is untrue has belief  has liking  has heard  has memory  has considered well if the Nigaṇṭhas speak thus then they incur a fivefold censure according to the Dharma and can be reproached What are the five If all the pleasure and pain that these beings now experience is caused by actions done have done evil in the past Because that would be the reason why the Nigaṇṭhas now experience extreme pain This is the first on which the Nigaṇṭhas can be reproached Again if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused by the company they kept then the Nigaṇṭhas have kept evil company in the past Because that would be why the Nigaṇṭhas now experience extreme pain This is the second on which the Nigaṇṭhas can be reproached Again if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused by destiny then the Nigaṇṭhas have had an evil destiny in the past Because that would be why the Nigaṇṭhas now experience extreme pain This is the third on which the Nigaṇṭhas can be reproached Again if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused by views then the Nigaṇṭhas have held evil views in the past Because that would be why the Nigaṇṭhas now experience extreme pain This is the fourth on which the Nigaṇṭhas can be reproached Again if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused and created by a supreme god then in the past the Nigaṇṭhas have been created by an evil supreme god Because that would be why the Nigaṇṭhas now experience extreme pain This is the fifth on which the Nigaṇṭhas can be reproached If in the past the Nigaṇṭhas did evil  kept evil company  had an evil destiny  held evil views an evil supreme god and they were created by this evil supreme god and if because of this the Nigaṇṭhas now experience extreme painthen for these reasons on these grounds the Nigaṇṭhas can be reproached aThe Dharma which I came to know by myself and realized by myself and which I have proclaimed to you cannot be refuted cannot be defiled cannot be prevailed over by any renunciant brahmin god Māra Brahmā or anyone else in the world Why is it that the Dharma which I came to know by myself and realized by myself and which I have proclaimed to you cannot be refuted cannot be defiled cannot be prevailed over by any renunciant brahmin god Māra Brahmā or anyone else in the world If a monk abandons unwholesome bodily actions and practices wholesome bodily actions abandons unwholesome verbal and mental actions and practices wholesome verbal and mental actions then in regard to future suffering  he personally knows there will be no future suffering for me In accordance with the Dharma he attains happiness and will not discard it Aspiring to eliminate a cause of suffering he may practice with aspiration or aspiring to eliminate a cause of suffering he may practice equanimity aspiration If aspiring to eliminate a cause of suffering he practices with aspiration and if he then develops his practice with aspiration and eliminates that  then the suffering comes to be extinguished If aspiring to eliminate a cause of suffering he practices equanimity aspiration and if he then develops his practice with equanimity and eliminates that  then the suffering comes to be extinguished Then the monk has this thought According to ones behavior according to ones deeds unwholesome states arise and wholesome states cease If I eliminate my suffering for myself then unwholesome states will cease and wholesome states will arise Now I would better eliminate my suffering for myself Then he eliminates the suffering and once the suffering has been eliminated unwholesome states cease and wholesome states arise and he  no longer needs to eliminate suffering Because monks his original purpose has been achieved it is not the case that he might need to eliminate suffering again Monks it is just as a fletcher may use a template to straighten an arrow but once the arrow has been straightened he has no further use for the template Because that persons original purpose has been achieved it is not the case that he might need to use the template again In the same way a monk has this thought According to ones behavior according to ones deeds unwholesome states arise and wholesome states cease If I eliminate my suffering for myself then unwholesome states will cease and wholesome states will arise Now I would better eliminate my suffering for myself Then he eliminates the suffering and once the suffering has been eliminated unwholesome states cease and wholesome states arise and he no longer needs to eliminate the suffering Because his original purpose has been achieved it is not the case that he might need to eliminate this suffering again Monks suppose that a man loves a woman is attached to her and has high regard for her but the woman instead gets talking with someone else exchanges greetings with him and they go off and spend the night together Would because of this physical and mental suffering vexation and extreme grief and sorrow arise in that man The monks replied Yes indeed Worldhonored One And why That man loves the woman is attached to her and has high regard for her but then that woman instead gets talking with someone else exchanges greetings with him and they go off to spend the night together How could because of this physical and mental suffering vexation and extreme grief and sorrow not arise in that man  Monks suppose that man thinks like this bI love that woman and have high regard for her but that woman instead got talking with another man exchanged greetings with him and they went off to spend the night together Because of my suffering and sadness shouldnt I now rather cut off my love and attachment for that woman Then that man because of his own suffering and sadness cuts off his love and attachment for that woman If that woman as before gets talking with someone else exchanges greetings with him and they go off to spend the night together would again because of that physical and mental suffering vexation and extreme grief and sorrow arise in him The monks replied No Worldhonored One And why not Because that man no longer has a feeling of love and attachment for that woman If that woman as before gets talking with someone else exchanges greetings with him and they go off to spend the night together it is not the case that because of that physical and mental suffering vexation and extreme grief and sorrow will arise in him In the same way a monk has this thought According to ones actions according to ones deeds unwholesome states arise and wholesome states cease If I eliminate the suffering then the unwholesome states will cease and wholesome states will arise Now I would better eliminate my suffering Then he eliminates the suffering and once the suffering has been eliminated unwholesome states cease and wholesome states arise and he no longer needs to eliminate the suffering Because his original purpose has been achieved he need not again eliminate the suffering Then he has this further thought Whatever the cause of suffering that was to be eliminated I have eliminated it yet with regard to desire it is as before it is not eliminated Now I would better seek to eliminate desire  So he seeks to eliminate desire  In order to eliminate that desire he dwells alone in seclusion resorting to a secluded placeto the base of a tree to an empty and quiet place a mountain top a cave in the open air a heap of straw or he goes into a forest or to a cemetery Having resorted to a secluded placeto the base of a tree to an empty and quiet placehe spreads his sitting mat sits down crosslegged with upright body and upright intention and sets up mindfulness before him He abandons covetousness his mind is free from envy Seeing anothers wealth and lifestyle he does not give rise to thoughts of covetousness If only I could get that He purifies his mind of covetousness and similarly of hatred sloth and torpor restlessness and worry He abandons doubt and overcomes confusion without hesitation in regard to wholesome states he purifies his mind of doubt and confusion Having abandoned these five hindrances which are imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom having abandoned desire abandoned evil and unwholesome states   he dwells having attained the fourth absorption When he has attained concentration in this way his mind being purified without blemish free of vexations malleable well established having attained imperturbability he directs his mind to the realization of the higher knowledge of the destruction of the taints He knows as it really is this is suffering he knows this is the origin of suffering he knows this is the cessation of suffering he knows as it really is this is the path to the cessation of suffering Again he knows as it really is these are the taints he knows this is the origin of the taints he knows this is the cessation of the taints he knows as it really is this is the path to the cessation of the taints Knowing thus seeing thus his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of existence and from the taint of ignorance Being liberated he knows he is liberated He understands as it really is Birth is ended the holy life has been established what was to be done has been done there will not be another existence c The Tathāgata who has in this way rightly liberated the mind gains five kinds of praise according to the Dharma undisputed desirable and highly regarded What are the five If all the pleasure and pain that beings now experience is caused by deeds in the past then the Tathāgata have done sublime actions in the past and because of that the Tathāgata now experiences a noble happiness that is free of taints Quiescent and calm he has attained happiness and awakening This is the first praise gained by the Tathāgata Again if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused by the company they have kept then the Tathāgata kept good company in the past and because of that the Tathāgata now experiences a noble happiness free of taints Quiescent and calm he has attained happiness and awakening This is the second praise gained by the Tathāgata Again if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused by destiny then the Tathāgata had a good destiny in the past and because of that the Tathāgata now experiences a noble happiness free of taints Quiescent and calm he has attained happiness and awakening This is the third praise gained by the Tathāgata Again if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused by holding views then the Tathāgata  held good views in the past and because of that the Tathāgata now experiences a noble happiness free of taints Quiescent and calm he has attained happiness and awakening This is the fourth praise gained by the Tathāgata Again if all the pleasure and pain that beings experience is caused and created by a supreme god then the Tathāgata a good supreme god in the past and because of that the Tathāgata now experiences a noble happiness free of taints Quiescent and calm he has attained happiness and awakening This is the fifth praise gained by the Tathāgata Thus because of the Tathāgatas former good actions good company good destiny good view and the existence of a good supreme god the good supreme god by which the Tathāgata was created because of these the Tathāgata now experiences a noble happiness free a from taints is quiescent and calm having attained happiness and awakening For these reasons the Tathāgata now gains five kinds of praise There are five causes and conditions owing to which sorrow and suffering arise in the mind What are the five entanglement in sexual desire because of entanglement in sexual desire sorrow and suffering arise in the mind Similarly entanglement in hatred  sloth and torpor  restlessness and worry entanglement in doubt because of entanglement in doubt sorrow and suffering arise in the mind These are the five causes and conditions owing to which sorrow and suffering arise in the mind There are five causes and conditions owing to which sorrow and suffering disappear from the mind What are the five If one is entangled in sexual desire and because of entanglement in sexual desire sorrow and suffering have arisen in the mind then on abandoning entanglement in sexual desire the sorrow and suffering will cease Owing to entanglement in sexual desire sorrow and suffering have arisen in the mind but on attaining the goal in this lifetime there is freedom from vexation and affliction constantly present and unchanging as is known to the noble ones and seen by the noble ones In the same way if one is entangled in hatred  sloth and torpor  restlessness and worry  if one is entangled in doubt and because of entanglement in doubt sorrow and suffering have arisen in the mind then on abandoning entanglement in doubt the sorrow and suffering will cease Owing to entanglement in doubt sorrow and suffering have arisen in the mind but on attaining the goal in this lifetime there is freedom from vexation and affliction constantly present and unchanging as is known to the noble ones and seen by the noble ones These are the five causes and conditions owing to which sorrow and suffering disappear from the mind Again there is another attaining of the goal in this lifetime which is free from vexation and affliction constantly present and unchanging as is known to the noble ones and seen by the noble ones What is that other attaining of the goal in this lifetime which is free from vexation and affliction constantly present and unchanging as is known to the noble ones and seen by the noble ones It is the noble eightfold path  right view  right concentrationthese eight This is another attaining of the goal in this lifetime which is free from vexation and affliction constantly present and unchanging as is known to the noble ones and seen by the noble ones This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse to Pāṭaliya  bThus have I heard At one time the Buddha who was wandering among the Koliyans together with a great company of monks arrived at the village of Uttara and stayed in a rosewood grove north of Uttara At that time Pāṭaliya the village headman heard that the renunciant Gotama a son of the Sākya clan who had abandoned his clan and family and had gone forth to train in the path was wandering among the Koliyans together with a great company of monks and that he had arrived at the village of Uttara and was staying in a rosewood grove north of Uttara the renunciant Gotama had a great reputation which had spread in all the ten directions The renunciant Gotama is a Tathāgata free from attachment fully awakened accomplished in knowledge and conduct a Wellgone One a knower of the world an unsurpassed one a trainer of those to be tamed a teacher of gods and human beings known as the Buddha the Fortunate One In this world with its gods Māras Brahmās renunciants and brahmins from human beings to gods he has understanding and awakening by himself and dwells having personally realized it The Dharma he teaches is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing revealing a holy life endowed with purity If one visits such a Tathāgata who is free from attachment and fully awakened pays homage to him respectfully and serves him then one will quickly get good rewards  thought I should go to visit the renunciant Gotama and pay homage to him Having learned this Pāṭaliya the village headman left Uttara and went north toward the rosewood grove wishing to visit the Worldhonored One and pay homage to him From afar Pāṭaliya the village headman saw the Worldhonored One among the trees of the grove dignified and beautiful like the moon amidst the stars with radiant aura shining like a golden mountain endowed with handsome appearance and majestic dignity with sense faculties calm free of obstruction accomplished and disciplined with his mind calm and quiet Having seen the Buddha from afar Pāṭaliya the village headman approached the Buddha exchanged greetings sat down to one side and said to the Worldhonored One I have heard this The renunciant Gotama knows magic he is a magician Gotama those who say The renunciant Gotama knows magic he is a magician are they not misrepresenting the renunciant Gotama Do they speak what is true Do they speak what is Dharma Do they speak the Dharma according to the Dharma Do they not fall into error and incur censure according to the Dharma The Worldhonored One replied Headman those who say The renunciant Gotama knows magic he is a magician they are not misrepresenting the renunciant Gotama They speak what is true They speak what is Dharma They speak the Dharma according to the Dharma They do not fall into error or incur censure according to the Dharma Because headman I know the magic of others though I myself am not a magician Pāṭaliya said Although what those renunciants and brahmins were saying is true yet I did not believe them when they said The renunciant Gotama knows magic he is a magician  The Worldhonored One said Headman if one knows magic does one thereby become a magician Pāṭaliya replied Indeed Worldhonored One Indeed Wellgone One The Worldhonored One said Headman do not make a mistake and misrepresent me If you misrepresent me then you harm yourself you will be criticized you commit an offense and you will be condemned by the noble ones for having perpetrated a major fault Because the truth is not in accordance with what you say Headman have you heard that the Koliyans have soldiers c replied Yes I have heard that What do you think headman Why do the Koliyans employ soldiers replied To kill bandits Gotama For this reason the Koliyans employ soldiers What do you think headman Are the Koliyan soldiers virtuous or without virtue replied Gotama if in the world there are those who lack virtue the Koliyan soldiers are certainly among them The Koliyan soldiers break all the precepts and behave in evil ways asked further Headman you see it thus and know it thus and I do not question it suppose that someone else were to ask you Headman Pāṭaliya you know that the Koliyan soldiers break all the precepts and do only evil therefore headman Pāṭaliya you too break all the precepts and do only evil If someone were to speak like this would he be speaking the truth replied No Gotama And why The views of the Koliyan soldiers are different  their desires are different their aspirations are different  The Koliyan soldiers break all the precepts and do only evil but I keep all the precepts and do no evil asked further Headman you know that the Koliyan soldiers break all the precepts and do only evil but you do not for this reason become one who breaks the precepts and does only evil Why then should it not be the case that the Tathāgata knows magic but is not himself a magician How is that I know magic I know magicians I know the results of doing magic and I know the elimination of magic Headman I also know killing of living beings I know killers of living beings I know the results of killing living beings and I know the elimination of killing living beings Headman I know taking what is not given I know those who take what is not given I know the results of taking what is not given and I know the elimination of taking what is not given Headman I know speaking falsehood I know those who speak falsehood I know the results of speaking falsehood and I know the elimination of speaking falsehood Headman I know this and see this If someone says The renunciant Gotama knows magic he is a magician and if he does not give up saying that but makes known that state of mind that desire that aspiration that report that memory and that reflection then when his life ends he shall as quickly as one might bend or stretch out ones arm be reborn in hell On hearing this Pāṭaliya the village headman was greatly afraid trembling with his body hair standing on end He immediately got up from his seat paid homage at the feet with his head and kneeling down with his palms placed together  said to the Worldhonored One I repent Gotama I confess Wellgone One I was like a fool like an ignorant person like an unstable person like an unwholesome person And why I was wrong in saying that the renunciant Gotama is a magician May Gotama accept my repentance I have seen my fault and disclosed it Having repented I shall exercise restraint and not do it again a The Worldhonored One told him So it is headman You truly were like a fool ignorant unstable and unwholesome And why You were wrong in saying that the Tathāgata who is free from attachment and fully awakened is a magician However you have been able to repent You have seen your fault and disclosed it Exercising restraint you will not do it again In this way headman those who are able to repent who see their faults and disclose them and who exercise restraint so as not to do it again will grow in the noble Dharma and be free from fault Thereupon Pāṭaliya the village headman his palms placed together toward the Buddha said to the Worldhonored One Gotama there is one renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare If someone kills living beings they will get the entire result in this lifetime and because of that sorrow and suffering will arise If someone takes what is not given or speaks falsehood they will get the entire result in this lifetime and because of that sorrow and suffering will arise Renunciant Gotama what do you think  The Worldhonored One said Headman I shall now

have faith Gotama The Worldhonored One praised him saying Very good headman Very good Then Pāṭaliya the village headman rose from his seat arranged his clothes so as to bare one shoulder and placing his palms together towards the Buddha said to the Worldhonored One Marvelous What Gotama has said is wonderful with good analogies and good proof Gotama I built a highroofed hall in the village of Uttara provided it with seats and beds and set up water pots and big bright lamps If diligent renunciants or brahmins come to stay in this highroofed hall I provide what they need in accordance with my ability four teachers holding different and opposing views were gathered in the highroofed hall Among them was one teacher who held this view and made this proclamation There is no offering no sacrifice there are no incantations no wholesome or unwholesome actions no results of wholesome or unwholesome actions there is neither this world nor another world there are no father and mother there are no True Persons in the world who are headed for a supreme attainment who are well gone and well directed who have themselves known and realized this world and the other world who have themselves directly realized and accomplished it and dwell therein  The second teacher had right view Opposing the view and knowledge of the first teacher he held this view and made this proclamation There is offering there is sacrifice and there are incantations there are wholesome and unwholesome actions and results of wholesome and unwholesome actions there is this world and the other world there are father and mother there are True Persons in the world who are headed for a supreme attainment who are well gone and well directed who have themselves known and realized this world and the other world who have themselves directly realized and accomplished it and dwell therein The third teacher held this view and made this proclamation One who acts or instructs another to act one who destroys or instructs another to destroy one who tortures or instructs another to torture distress vexation sadness beating of breasts despair weeping and bewilderment one who kills living beings takes what is not given engages in sexual misconduct speaks falsehood drinks intoxicating liquor breaks through walls to open storehouses intrudes into others territory destroys villages and towns wipes out cities and countriesone who acts in these ways is not doing any evil Again if by using an iron wheel as sharp as a razor one were in a single day to cut into parts and kill all the living beings on this earth slicing them into pieces and turning them all into a single heap of flesh this does not amout to evil actions and the evil actions will not have results If one were to go along the southern bank of the Ganges killing destroying and torturing and to come back along the northern bank of the Ganges making offerings undertaking sacrifices and chanting incantations then there is no offense and no merit because of this there are no results of offense or merit because of this Making offerings taming  guarding  restraining  by esteeming benefiting generosity speaking pleasantly doing good and sharing profit one does not merit because of this there is no result of merit because of this a The fourth teacher had right view Opposing the understanding and view of the third teacher he held this view and made this proclamation One who acts or instructs another to act one who destroys or instructs another to destroy one who tortures or instructs another to torture distress vexation and sadness beating of breasts despair weeping and bewilderment one who kills living beings takes what is not given engages in sexual misconduct speaks falsehood drinks intoxicating liquor

wheel as sharp as a razor one were in a single day to cut into parts and kill all the living beings on this earth slicing them into pieces and turning them all into a single heap of flesh this does amount to evil actions and these evil actions will have results If one were to go along the southern bank of the Ganges killing destroying and torturing and to come back along the northern bank of the Ganges making offerings undertaking sacrifices and chanting incantations then there is offense or merit because of this there are results of offense or merit because of this Making offerings taming  guarding  restraining  by esteeming benefiting generosity speaking pleasantly doing good and sharing profit there is merit because of this there is result of merit because of this Gotama having heard this I have come to doubt Of these renunciants and brahmins who is speaking the truth and who is speaking falsehood The Worldhonored One told him Headman do not let doubt arise in you Why not Owing to doubt hesitation arises Headman you yourself do not have pure knowledge about whether there is a next life or no next life Also headman you do not have pure knowledge regarding which way of acting is evil and which way of acting is wholesome Headman there is a Dharma meditation  called abandoning Through this meditation you may attain right mindfulness you may attain onepointedness of mind In this way you may cut off your doubt in this lifetime and achieve progress Thereupon Pāṭaliya the village headman rose again from his seat arranged his clothes so as to bare one shoulder and placing his palms together towards the Buddha said to the Worldhonored One Gotama what is the Dharma meditation called abandoning through which I may attain right mindfulness and may attain onepointedness of mind and in that way may cut off my doubt in this lifetime and achieve progress The Worldhonored One told him Headman a learned noble disciple refrains from killing and abandons killing abandons taking

the village headman Pāṭaliya the village headman saw the Dharma attained the Dharma realized the bright and pure Dharma he cut off doubt and went beyond perplexity he became independent of other teachers he would never again follow others and he became free of hesitation Having been established in the attainment of the fruit he had attained fearlessness in the Dharma taught by the Worldhonored One He rose from his seat paid homage with his head at the feet of the Buddha and said Worldhonored one I now go for refuge to the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks May the Worldhonored One accept me as a lay follower From this day forth until life ends I go for refuge This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the village headman Pāṭaliya and the monks were delighted and remembered them well  Sāriputta   The Discourse on an Even Mind  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park At that time Venerable Sāriputta had gathered one night with an assembly of monks at the assembly hall and was explaining to them the distinction between internal fetters and external fetters Venerable friends there truly are two categories of people to be found in the world Which two There are those nonreturners who have internal fetters and who will not be reborn into this realm and there are those who are not nonreturners who have external fetters and who will be reborn into this realm What venerable friends are the nonreturners who have internal fetters and who will not be reborn into this realm Suppose there is someone who observes the training in the precepts without transgression or compromise without blemish or defect He practices in this way abundantly overcomes impediments and is praised by the worthy ones for being well cultivated and well endowed  Through having observed the training in the precepts without transgression or compromise without blemish or defect having practiced in this way abundantly having overcome impediments and having been praised by the worthy ones for being well cultivated and well endowed  he further trains in disenchantment regarding sensual desires in dispassion and in abandoning sensual desires Through having trained in disenchantment regarding sensual desires in dispassion and in abandoning sensual desires he attains a peaceful liberation of the mind aHaving attained it he delights in it and enjoys it constantly does not attain final knowledge in that lifetime With the breaking up of the body at death he passes beyond the gods that feed on gross food and is reborn among the mindmade gods Once reborn there he thinks Formerly when I was a human being I observed the training in the precepts without transgression or compromise without blemish or defect I practiced in this way abundantly and overcame impediments and I was praised by the worthy ones for being well cultivated and well endowed  Through having observed the training in the precepts without transgression or compromise without blemish or defect having practiced in this way abundantly and overcome impediments and having been praised by the worthy ones for being well cultivated and well endowed  I further trained in disenchantment regarding sensual desires in dispassion and in abandoning sensual desires Through having trained in disenchantment regarding sensual desires in dispassion and in abandoning sensual desires I attained a peaceful liberation of the mind Having attained it I delighted in it and enjoyed it constantly did not attain final knowledge in that same lifetime With the breaking up of the body at death I passed beyond the gods that feed on gross food and was reborn here among the mindmade gods Venerable friends there is another person who observes the training in the precepts without transgression or compromise without blemish or defect He practices in this way abundantly and overcomes impediments and is praised by the worthy ones for being well cultivated and well endowed  Through having observed the training in the precepts without transgression or compromise without blemish or defect having practiced in this way abundantly and overcome impediments and having been praised by the worthy ones for being well cultivated and well endowed  he further trains in the realm of form abandoning desire abandoning activities He trains in giving up and casting aside sensual desire  Through having trained in the realm of form abandoning desire abandoning activities having trained in giving up and casting aside sensual desire he attains a peaceful liberation of the mind Having attained it he delights in it and enjoys it constantly does not attain final knowledge in that lifetime With the breaking up of the body at death he passes beyond the gods that feed on gross food and is reborn among the mindmade gods Once reborn there he thinks Formerly when I was a human being I observed the training in the precepts without transgression or compromise without blemish or defect I practiced in this way abundantly and overcame impediments and was praised by the worthy ones for being well

gods feeding on gross food and was reborn here among the mindmade gods Such a person venerable friends is called a nonreturner who has internal fetters and who will not be reborn into this realm What venerable friends is meant by those who are not nonreturners who have external fetters and who will be reborn into this realm Suppose a person observes the training in the precepts guards the code of rules and skillfully controls his  comportment in accordance with proper conduct He trains in the precepts in this way seeing great danger in even the slightest transgression and being apprehensive of it Such a person venerable friends is called one who is not a nonreturner who has external fetters and who will still be reborn into this realm b Thereupon numerous gods of even mind of resplendent and majestic form visited the Buddha just before dawn After paying their respects to the Buddha they stood to one side and addressed him Worldhonored One this past night Venerable Sāriputta has gathered with an assembly of monks at the assembly hall He has explained to those monks the distinction between internal fetters and external fetters telling them Venerable friends there truly are two categories of people to be found in the world those who have internal fetters and those who have external fetters Worldhonored One the assembly is delighted  May the Worldhonored One out of compassion go to the assembly hall Then the Worldhonored One acceded to the request of the gods of even mind by remaining silent The gods of even mind understood that the Worldhonored One had consented by remaining silent paid homage at his feet and after circumambulating him three times vanished from the spot Not long after the gods of even mind had gone the Worldhonored One arrived before the gathering of monks at the assembly hall and sat on a prepared seat Once seated the Worldhonored One spoke in praise Very good Very good Sāriputta You are most excellent This past night you have gathered with an assembly of monks at this assembly hall and you have explained to the monks the distinction between internal fetters and external fetters  Venerable friends there truly are two categories of people to be found in the world those who have internal fetters and those who have external fetters Sāriputta numerous gods of even mind visited me this past night just before dawn After paying homage they stood to one side and addressed me Worldhonored One this past night Venerable Sāriputta  has assembled with a gathering of monks at the assembly hall He has explained to the monks the distinction between internal fetters and external fetters  Venerable friends there truly are two categories of people to be found in the world those who have internal fetters and those who have external fetters Worldhonored One we are delighted  May the Worldhonored One out of compassion join us in the assembly hall I acceded to the request of the gods of even mind by remaining silent The gods of even mind understood that I had consented by silent paid homage at my feet and after circumambulating me three times vanished from the spot Sāriputta those gods of even mind are able to stand together on the tip of an awlten twenty thirty forty fifty or sixty of them without obstructing one another Sāriputta it was not after being born into their heavenly realm that those gods of even mind cultivated a good mind extensively and greatly and thereby acquired the ability to stand together on the tip of an awlten twenty thirty forty fifty or sixty of themwithout obstructing one another Sāriputta it was while still in the human realm that those gods of even mind cultivated a good mind extensively and greatly and thereby acquired the ability to stand together on the tip of an awlten twenty thirty forty fifty or sixty of themwithout obstructing one another Therefore Sāriputta one should cultivate tranquilitytranquility of the sense faculties tranquility of the mind and tranquility in ones physical verbal and mental actionsall in accordance with the Worldhonored One and with wise companions in the holy life Sāriputta the erroneous adherents of other sects longlasting downfall and loss Because they do not get to hear such sublime teachings This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the monks were delighted and remembered them wellc   The Discourse on Perfecting the Precepts  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park At that time Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks If a monk is accomplished in virtue concentration and wisdom then it is certainly possible that he may in this life enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling If he does not attain final knowledge within this life then with the breaking up of the body at death he will pass beyond the gods that feed on gross food and be reborn among the mindmade gods Once he has been reborn there it is certainly possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling At that time Venerable Udāyin was also present in the assembly Venerable Udāyin responded Venerable Sāriputta if a monk is reborn among the mindmade gods it is certainly not possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling A second and a third time Venerable Sāriputta told the monks If a monk is accomplished in virtue concentration and wisdom then it is certainly possible that he may in this life enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling If he does not attain final knowledge within this life then with the breaking up of the body at death he will pass beyond the gods that feed on gross food and be reborn among the mindmade gods Once he is reborn there it is certainly possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling And a second and a third time Venerable Udāyin countered Venerable Sāriputta if a monk is reborn among the mindmade gods then it is certainly not possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling  Thereupon Venerable Sāriputta thought This monk has contradicted what I said three times now and not a single monk has commended what I said Perhaps I ought to approach the Worldhonored One Then Venerable Sāriputta approached the Buddha After paying homage he sat down to one side Not long after Venerable Sāriputta had left  Venerable Udāyin and the other monks also approached the Buddha After paying homage they sat down to one side In that situation Venerable Sāriputta again addressed the monks If a monk is accomplished in virtue concentration and wisdom then it is certainly possible that he may in this life enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling If he does not attain final knowledge within this life then with the breaking up of the body at death he will pass beyond the gods that feed on gross food and be reborn among the mindmade gods Once he is reborn there it is certainly possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling Venerable Udāyin countered Venerable Sāriputta if a monk is reborn among the mindmade gods then it is certainly not possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling A second and a third time Venerable Sāriputta told the monks If a monk is accomplished in virtue concentration and wisdom then it is certainly possible that he may in this life enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling If he does not attain final knowledge within this life then with the breaking up of the body at death he will pass beyond the gods that feed on gross food and be reborn among the mindmade gods Once he is reborn there it is certainly possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling And a second and a third time Venerable Udāyin countered Venerable Sāriputta if a monk is reborn among the mindmade gods a then it is certainly not possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling Then Venerable Sāriputta thought  in front of the Worldhonored One this monk has contradicted what I said three times now and not a single monk has commended what I said I had better remain silent Thereupon the Worldhonored One asked Udāyin would you say that the mindmade gods have form Venerable Udāyin replied Yes Worldhonored One The Worldhonored One directly rebuked Udāyin You are a fool blind without vision On what grounds do you comment on this advanced topic in the Dharma Thereupon Venerable Udāyin having been directly rebuked by the Buddha was sad and distressed He lowered his head in silence unable to reply and seemed immersed in thought After having directly rebuked Venerable Udāyin the Worldhonored One addressed Venerable nanda A most highly regarded and virtuous elder monk has been contradicted For what reason did you show disrespect by not intervening You too are a fool with no lovingkindness to turn your back on a most highly regarded and virtuous elder After having directly rebuked Venerable Udāyin and Venerable nanda the Worldhonored One addressed the monks If a monk is accomplished in virtue concentration and wisdom then it is certainly possible that he may in this life enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling If he does not attain final knowledge within this life then with the breaking up of the body at death he will pass beyond the gods that feed on gross food and be reborn among the mindmade gods Once he is reborn there it is certainly possible that he may enter and emerge from the concentration of the cessation of perception and feeling Having said this the Buddha entered his meditation hut to meditate in  silence At that time Venerable Baijing was in the assembly Venerable nanda spoke to Venerable Baijing I have been rebuked for something that another person did Venerable Baijing the Worldhonored One will certainly emerge from his meditation hut in the late afternoon He will sit on a prepared seat in front of the assembly of monks and discuss this matter May Venerable Baijing respond regarding this matter I am much embarrassed and ashamed in front of the Worldhonored One and our companions in the holy life Then in the late afternoon the Worldhonored One emerged from his meditation hut He sat on a prepared seat in front of the assembly of monks He asked Baijing for possessing how many qualities is a senior monk esteemed and revered by his companions in the holy life Venerable Baijing replied Worldhonored One a senior monk is esteemed and revered by his companions in the holy life if he possesses five qualities What are the five Worldhonored One a senior monk observes the training in the precepts guards the code of rules and skillfully controls his comportment in accordance with proper conduct He trains in the precepts in this way seeing great danger in even the slightest transgression and being apprehensive of it Worldhonored One such a morally restrained elder and highly regarded monk is esteemed and revered by his companions in the holy life Again Worldhonored One a senior monk studies widely and learns much retaining it and not forgetting it accumulating wide learning of what is called the Dharma which is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end which has meaning and expression is endowed with purity and reveals the holy life In this way he studies widely and learns much regarding all the teachings familiarizing himself with them even a thousand times mentally considering and contemplating them with knowledge vision and profound penetration Worldhonored One such a learned elder and highly regarded monk is esteemed and revered by his companions in the holy life bAgain Worldhonored One a senior monk attains

senior monk is esteemed and revered by his companions in the holy life Worldhonored One if a senior monk is accomplished in these five qualities he is esteemed and revered by his companions in the

Baijing replied Worldhonored One if a senior monk does not possess these five qualities there is no other reason that he should be esteemed and revered by his companions in the holy life Only for his advanced age hoary hair lost teeth deteriorating health hunched body unsteady step overweight body shortness of breath reliance on a walking cane shrinking flesh sagging skin wrinkles like pockmarks failing sense faculties and unsightly complexion might his companions in the holy life still esteem and revere him  The Worldhonored One said Indeed so If a senior monk does not possess these five qualities there is no other reason that he should be esteemed and revered by his companions in the holy life Only for his advanced age hoary hair lost teeth deteriorating health hunched back unsteady step overweight body shortness of breath reliance on a walking cane shrinking flesh sagging skin wrinkles like pockmarks failing sense faculties and unsightly complexion might his companions in the

night posing his questions in different words and phrases I would be able to answer in different words and phrases If the Worldhonored One were to question me on this matter for two three four even up to seven days and nights  posing his questions in different words and phrases I would be able to answer the Worldhonored One in different words and phrases On hearing Venerable Sāriputta speak in this way the monk Kaḷārakhattiya rose from his seat and right away approached the Buddha He said to the Worldhonored One Soon after the Worldhonored One returned to his hut Venerable Sāriputta made a weighty proclamation roared a lions roar saying Venerable friends earlier I had not considered  thus when the Worldhonored One suddenly asked those questions I thought Im afraid I wont be able to

the Buddhas words Venerable Sāriputta and the other monks were delighted and remembered them well b   The Discourse on the Lions Roar of Sāriputta  cThus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park At that time the Worldhonored One was accompanied by a great assembly of monks who were observing the rains retreat at Sāvatthī Venerable Sāriputta was also observing the rains retreat at Sāvatthī At the end of the threemonths rains retreat at Sāvatthī Venerable Sāriputta having mended his robes took his robes and bowl and approached the Buddha Having paid homage at feet he sat down to one side and addressed him Worldhonored One I have completed the rains retreat at Sāvatthī and now I wish to journey among the people The Worldhonored One replied Sāriputta go as you please so that you may deliver those who have not yet won deliverance liberate those who have not yet attained liberation and final nirvana those who have not yet achieved final nirvana Sāriputta go as you please Thereupon Venerable Sāriputta having heard what the Buddha said received and remembered it well rose from his seat paid homage at the Buddhas feet circumambulated him three times and returned to his quarters Having stored away his bedding and seat he put on his robe and took his bowl and set out to journey among the people Not long after the venerable Sāriputta had left a certain companion in the holy life  before the Buddha a breach of the precepts a contravention of the Dharma saying to the Worldhonored One Venerable Sāriputta slighted me today just before he set out to journey among the people Hearing this the Worldhonored One told one of the monks Go to Sāriputta and tell him The Worldhonored One calls you Not long after

him Not long after that monk had set out Venerable nanda went with keys in hand to all of the quarters He told all the monks he encountered It would be good venerable sirs if you would come to the assembly hall right away Venerable Sāriputta will soon roar a lions roar before the Buddha It may be that Venerable Sāriputta will make a profound proclamation about that which is most peaceful and sublime If he makes such a proclamation you venerable sirs and I having heard it should later recite and memorize it well Then on hearing what Venerable nanda said all the monks went to the assembly hall At that time the monk approached Venerable Sāriputta and said The Worldhonored One calls you Not long after you set out a certain companion in the holy life  before the Buddha a breach of the precepts a contravention of the Dharma saying Worldhonored One Venerable Sāriputta slighted me today just before he set out to journey among the people On hearing this Venerable Sāriputta rose from

idiot like confused like  unwholesome Why so Because I falsely slandered the monk Sāriputta my pure companion in the holy life Worldhonored One I now repent hoping that this will be accepted Having seen and acknowledged it I will not repeat it The Worldhonored One said So it is monk You have indeed like a fool like an idiot like confused like unwholesome Why so Because you falsely slandered the monk Sāriputta your pure companion in the holy life Yet you have been able to repent your transgression and having seen and acknowledged it you will not repeat it Those who are able to repent their transgression having seen it and acknowledged it and will not repeat it come in this way to growth in the noble teaching and discipline and will not regress a Then the Buddha told Venerable Sāriputta Accept that foolish mans expression of remorse quickly lest the head of this monk split into seven parts right away in front of you Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion accepted that monks expression of remorse This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words Venerable Sāriputta and the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse with Parables Water  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park At that time Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks Venerable friends I shall explain to you five methods for overcoming resentment Listen carefully and give close attention  Those monks listened to receive instruction Venerable Sāriputta said What are the five methods Venerable friends suppose there is someone whose bodily actions are not pure but whose verbal actions are pure A wise person who on seeing him is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself  Again venerable friends suppose there is someone whose verbal actions are impure but whose bodily actions are pure A wise person who on seeing him is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of it Again venerable friends suppose there is someone whose bodily and verbal actions are impure but whose mind is pure to a small extent A wise person who on seeing him is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of it Again venerable friends suppose there is someone whose bodily verbal and mental actions are all impure A wise person who on seeing him is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of it Again venerable friends suppose there is someone whose bodily verbal and mental actions are all pure A wise person who on seeing him is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of it Venerable friends if there is someone whose bodily actions are impure but whose verbal actions are pure how should a wise person who on seeing him is aroused to resentment rid himself  Venerable friends suppose there is a forestdwelling monk a wearer of rag robes who sees a discarded piece of cloth in a cesspool stained by excrement urine snot spittle and other impurities and on seeing it he holds it with his left hand and spreads it out with his right hand and wherever he sees portions that are not stained by excrement urine snot spittle or other impurities and that are without holes he tears them off and takes them  Similarly venerable friends if there is someone whose bodily actions are not pure but whose verbal actions are pure one should not pay attention to his impure bodily actions but pay attention only to his pure verbal actions This is how a wise person who on seeing  is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of   Venerable friends if there is someone whose verbal actions are impure but whose bodily actions are pure how should a wise person who on seeing him is aroused to resentment rid himself of it Venerable friends suppose that not far from a village there is a deep pool covered with water plants and suppose that a man comes along who is oppressed by extreme heat hunger thirst and exhaustion caused by a hot wind On arriving at the pool he takes off his clothes puts them on the bank and enters the pool pushing aside the water plants with both hands He enjoys a pleasant bath and rids himself of the oppression by heat hunger thirst and exhaustion Similarly venerable friends if there is someone whose verbal actions are not pure but whose bodily actions are pure one should not pay attention to his impure verbal actions but should pay attention only to his pure bodily actions This is how a wise person who on seeing  is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of  Venerable friends if there is someone whose bodily and verbal actions are both impure but whose mind is pure to a small extent how should a wise person who on seeing him is aroused to resentment rid himself of it This oxs hoof print at the crossroads contains a little water If I were to scoop it up with my hand or with a leaf the water would become muddied and I would not be able to rid myself of the oppression by heat hunger thirst and exhaustion Let me kneel down with hands and knees on the ground and suck up the water directly with my mouth He then kneels down with hands and knees on the ground and sucks up the water directly with his mouth and so is able to rid himself of the oppression by heat hunger thirst and exhaustion Similarly venerable friends if there is someone whose bodily and verbal actions are impure but whose mind is pure to a small extent one should not pay attention to his impure bodily and verbal actions b but should pay attention only to his mind which is pure to a small extent Venerable friends this is how a wise person who on seeing  is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of  Venerable friends if there is someone whose bodily verbal and mental actions are all impure how should a wise person who on seeing him is aroused to resentment rid himself of it Venerable friends suppose a person is on a long journey and having become ill on the way is suffering greatly and exhausted He is alone without companion the village behind him is far away and the village ahead has not yet been reached Suppose that a second person comes along and standing to one side looks at this first person who is on a long journey and having become ill on the way is suffering greatly and exhausted alone without companion the village behind him far away and the village ahead not yet reached And suppose that he helps to get through the wilderness and reach the village and there gives him excellent medicine and good sustaining food caring for him well In that case that persons illness would most certainly subside That is to say the second person is extremely compassionate toward the sick person having a heart full of lovingkindness Similarly venerable friends if there is a person whose bodily verbal and mental actions are all impure then a wise person on seeing him thinks This persons bodily verbal and mental actions are all impure let him not on the breaking up of the body at death go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell as a consequence of his impure bodily verbal and mental actions If this person encounters a good friend give up his impure bodily verbal and mental actions and cultivate pure bodily verbal and mental actions In that case through cultivating pure bodily verbal and mental actions this person will on the breaking up of the body at death go to a good realm of existence be reborn in a heavenly realm That is to say this person is extremely compassionate toward that person having a heart full of lovingkindness This is how a wise person who on seeing  is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of  Venerable friends c if there is a person whose bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions are all pure how should a wise person who on seeing him is aroused to resentment rid himself of it Venerable friends suppose that not far from a village there is a pool full to the brim with clear beautiful water its banks covered with verdant grass and surrounded by flowering trees and suppose that a man comes along who is oppressed by extreme heat hunger thirst and exhaustion caused by a hot wind On arriving at the pool he takes off his clothes puts them on the bank and enters the water He enjoys a pleasant bath and rids himself of the oppression by heat hunger thirst and exhaustion Similarly venerable friends if there is someone whose bodily verbal and mental actions are all pure then one should constantly pay attention to his pure bodily verbal and mental actions This is how a wise person who on seeing  is aroused to resentment ought to rid himself of  Hereby venerable friends I have explained the said

Sāvatthī also observing the rains retreat At that time a certain monk who after having completed the threemonth rains retreat at Rājagaha and having mended his robes put on his robe and took his bowl and left Rājagaha for Sāvatthī to stay in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park That monk approached Venerable Sāriputta and having paid homage at his feet sat down to one side Venerable Sāriputta asked

Dhānañjāni put your mind at ease Then the brahmin Dhānañjāni asked Sāriputta why enter the house like this and then refuse to eat Venerable Sāriputta replied Dhānañjāni you have not been making

support my parents look after my wife and children provide for my male and female servants pay taxes to the king perform rituals for the deities make offerings to my departed ancestors and give to renunciants and brahminsin order to live long and later be reborn in heaven and obtain pleasant karmic fruits Sāriputta all these affairs cannot be neglected being dictated by law Then Venerable

 and strong Are you comfortable and free from ailments Are you dwelling at ease and is your vigor as usual Then inform him The householder Anāthapiṇḍika pays homage at the Worldhonored Ones feet He inquires about your wellbeing  Worldhonored One are you healthy and strong Are you comfortable and free from ailments Are you dwelling at ease and is your vigor as usual After you have on my behalf made these inquiries of the Buddha go to Venerable Sāriputta Pay homage at his feet on my behalf and inquire about his wellbeing by asking Venerable one are you healthy and strong Are you comfortable and free from ailments Are you dwelling at ease and is your vigor as usual Then inform him The householder Anāthapiṇḍika pays homage at the feet of Venerable Sāriputta He inquires about the venerable ones wellbeing  Are you healthy and strong Are you comfortable and free from ailments Are you dwelling at ease and is your vigor as usual  Venerable Sāriputta the householder Anātha piṇḍika is gravely ill and in a critical condition The householder Anātha piṇḍika deeply wishes to see Venerable Sāriputta But in his deteriorating physical condition he is too weak to come and visit Venerable Sāriputta It would be good if Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion were to visit the householder Anāthapiṇḍika at his house Then having received the householder Anāthapiṇḍikas order the messenger approached the Buddha Having paid homage at his feet he sat down to one side and said Worldhonored One the householder Anāthapiṇḍika pays homage at your feet He inquires about your wellbeing Worldhonored One are you healthy and strong Are you comfortable and free from ailments Are you dwelling at ease and is your vigor as usual Then the Worldhonored One said to the messenger May the householder Anāthapiṇḍika find wellbeing and happiness May all gods human beings asuras celestial musicians demons and all other forms of life find wellbeing and happiness  The messenger heard what the Buddha said and remembered it well Then having paid homage at the Buddhas feet and circumambulated him three times he approached Venerable Sāriputta Having paid homage at his feet he sat down to one side and said Venerable Sāriputta the householder Anāthapiṇḍika pays homage at Venerable Sāriputtas feet He inquires about your wellbeing Venerable one are you healthy and strong Are you comfortable and free from ailments Are you dwelling at ease and is your vigor as usual Venerable Sāriputta the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is gravely ill and is in a critical condition The householder Anāthapiṇḍika deeply wishes

Anāthapiṇḍika at his house a Venerable Sāriputta consented by remaining silent Then understanding that Venerable Sāriputta had consented by remaining silent the messenger rose from his seat paid homage at feet circumambulated him three times and departed When the night was over at dawn Venerable Sāriputta put on his robe took his bowl and approached the householder Anāthapiṇḍikas house Seeing Venerable Sāriputta approaching in the distance the householder Anāthapiṇḍika struggled to raise himself from his bed Seeing the householder Anāthapiṇḍika struggling to raise himself from the bed Venerable Sāriputta stopped him saying Lie still householder Dont get up There is another bed here I shall sit on it Then having seated himself on the other bed Venerable Sāriputta asked How is your ailment now householder How much are you eating and drinking Are your painful feelings subsiding not increasing The householder replied My ailment is becoming critical I cannot eat or drink My painful

sitting position on the bed and praised Venerable Sāriputta Very good Very good Your teaching of the Dharma to this sick man was marvelous very special Venerable Sāriputta on hearing your Dharma teaching for a sick man my pain has been extinguished and happiness has been aroused Venerable Sāriputta my illness has now vanished and my condition has returned to normal Venerable Sāriputta once in the past being in Rājagaha for some business or other I stayed in the home of a householder there At that time that householder was preparing to provide a meal for the Buddha c and the community of monks on the following day When the night was fargone and dawn was approaching the householder called his children grandchildren servants and retainers saying Get up We must all prepare the meal Each received his or her instructions and together they set up the kitchen and began preparing all sorts of nourishing and delicious food and drinks The householder personally set up a raised seat  decorating it with countless adornments Venerable Sāriputta on seeing this I thought Is the householder preparing for a wedding Is it to be a reception for a new daughterinlaw Or has the king been invited Or some senior minister Or is it for a great ritual offering of food Venerable Sāriputta having pondered in this way I asked the householder Are you preparing for a wedding Is it to be a reception for a new daughterinlaw Or has the king been invited Or some senior minister Or is it for a great ritual offering of food The householder replied We are not preparing for a wedding It is not to be a reception for a new daughterinlaw Neither has the king been invited nor some senior minister But it is indeed for a great ritual offering of food We are providing a meal for the Buddha and the community of monks this coming day Venerable Sāriputta until then I had not heard the word Buddha When I heard it my bodily hair stood on end So I inquired Householder you spoke of the Buddha Who is it that is called the Buddha Then the householder replied Have you not heard There is a son of the Sakya clan who has relinquished his Sakyan family ties He shaved off his hair and beard donned yellow robe and out of faith gave up the household life and became a homeless one to train in the path He attained perfect supreme awakening hence he is called Buddha  I asked him further You also mentioned the community What is this community The householder again replied Members of various families and clans have shaved off their hair and beards donned the yellow robe and out of faith given up the household life and become  homeless ones to train in the Buddhas path These constitute his community It is this Buddha and his community that we have invited Venerable Sāriputta I again asked the householder Where is the Worldhonored One dwelling now I desire to go and visit him The householder replied The Worldhonored One is presently dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary You can go there if you wish Venerable Sāriputta I thought It will soon be daybreak Let me quickly go and see the Buddha Venerable Sāriputta my desire to go and see the Buddha being so pressing although it was still night I suddenly had a perception of daytime brightness So I set out from the householders home and went to the town gate At that time the town gate was guarded by two watchmen One of the watchmen stood guard during the first half of the night permitting people to enter without hindrance The other stood guard during the second half of the night permitting people to leave without hindrance Venerable Sāriputta I thought The night is not yet over the town gate is guarded by two watchmen One of the watchmen stands guard during the first half of the night permitting people to enter without hindrance The other stands guard during the second half of the night permitting people to leave without hindrance Venerable Sāriputta not long after I had passed out through the town gate the brightness suddenly vanished and everything was dark again Venerable Sāriputta at that time I became afraid and my bodily hair stood on end May no man or invisible being harm me At that moment a divine being at the city gate radiated forth a great radiance reaching from Rājagaha up to the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary came and addressed me Dont be afraid householder Dont be afraid householder Why not In a previous life I was a friend of yours named Honey Vessel We were very dear and close to each other in our youth a Householder in the past I had visited Venerable Mahā Moggallāna Having paid homage at his feet I sat to one side Venerable Mahā Moggallāna gave me a teaching He exhorted encouraged and delighted me and by countless skillful means explained the Dharma to me Having exhorted encouraged and delighted me he let me take the three refuges and the five precepts Householder for having taken the three refuges and kept the five precepts with the breaking up of the body at death I was reborn in the heaven of the four great kings and now reside at this town gate Go quickly householder Go quickly householder It is better to go than to stay here To urge me onward that divine being uttered the following verses Acquisition of a hundred horses ministers and women And of a hundred carts filled with gems Is not equal to onesixteenth  Of one step toward visiting the Buddha Even a hundred excellent white elephants With gold and silver saddles Are not equal to onesixteenth Of one step toward visiting the Buddha A hundred beautiful women Their bodies adorned with jewels and flowers Are not equal to onesixteenth Of one step toward visiting the Buddha b The supremely precious woman treasure Adored by the wheelturning monarch Is not equal to onesixteenth Of one step toward visiting the Buddha Having uttered these verses the divine being urged me further saying Go quickly householder Go quickly householder It is better to go than to stay here  Venerable Sāriputta I thought The Buddha is worthy of veneration and the Dharma and the community of monks are worthy of veneration Even a divine being wishes me to go and visit them Venerable Sāriputta aided by the radiance I reached the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary At that time the night being over toward dawn the Worldhonored One had emerged from his meditation hut and was practicing walking meditation in the open waiting for me Venerable Sāriputta in the distance I saw the Buddhas fine appearance outstandingly radiant like a resplendent moon amidst the stars dazzling like a golden mountain endowed with the features  majestic and imposing His senses were tranquil and without obstruction skillfully tamed and restrained his mind tranquil and still Seeing the Buddha I was overjoyed and approached him Having paid homage at his feet I followed the Buddha in walking meditation In accordance with the custom of householders I greeted him with this verse Has the Worldhonored One slept peacefully Having fallen asleep quickly Like a brahmin I have attained deliverance Untainted by desires Having relinquished all yearning I have attained peace With all fevers of the mind removed I have slept well and happily Then the Worldhonored One having reached the end of the walking path sat crosslegged on a prepared sitting mat Venerable Sāriputta I paid homage at his feet and sat to one side the Worldhonored One taught me the Dharma exhorting encouraging and delighting me employing countless skillful means to explain it He exhorted inspired and delighted me as he delivered the teaching of all the buddhas  First he taught the beautiful Dharma that uplifts those who hear it speaking on generosity on virtue on ways to rebirth in heavenly realms on repudiating desire as dangerous and on the round of rebirth as repugnant He praised desirelessness as a factor of the sublime path and as purity After expounding these teachings to me the Worldhonored One knew that my mind was joyous that it had become contented pliant patient uplifted concentrated free from doubt free from hindrances possessing the ability and strength to receive the true Dharma that is to say the cardinal principles of the teachings of all the Buddhas The Worldhonored One taught me about suffering its arising its cessation and the path  As I sat there Venerable Sāriputta I saw the four noble truths suffering its arising its cessation and the path Just as a white cloth easily absorbs dye so did I  As I sat there I saw the four noble truths suffering its arising its cessation and the path Venerable Sāriputta I saw the Dharma attained the Dharma awakened to the pure Dharma Doubt was eradicated confusion  was transcended I would venerate no other  never again follow others I was without uncertainty being established in realization of the fruit  In regard to the teachings of the Worldhonored One I attained freedom from vacillation Then I rose from my seat paid homage to the Buddha  c Worldhonored One henceforth I take refuge in the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks May the Worldhonored One accept me as a lay follower From today onward I take refuge for my whole life until I die Then Venerable Sāriputta I placed my palms together and said Worldhonored One allow me to invite you and an assembly of monks to spend the rains retreat at Sāvatthī Then the Buddha asked me What is your name How do the people of Sāvatthī address you I replied My name is Sudatta but because I regularly assist and give to the needy and the orphaned the people of Sāvatthī call me Anāthapiṇḍika   Then the Worldhonored One asked me further Are there dwellings  at Sāvatthī I replied There are no dwellings  at Sāvatthī Then the Worldhonored One said Know householder that if there were dwellings  monks would be able to visit and stay at  I then responded Indeed Worldhonored One I will have dwellings erected so that monks can visit and stay at Sāvatthī May the Worldhonored One appoint someone to assist me And the Worldhonored One appointed and sent  Venerable Sāriputta to assist me Then having heard what the Buddha said and kept it well in mind I rose from my seat paid homage to the Buddha and having circumambulated him three times departed Having completed what I had to do at Rājagaha I set out for Sāvatthī together with Venerable Sāriputta Without entering Sāvatthī or returning to my home we proceeded right away the lands outside the city a location that had good access that was not noisy in the daytime and was peaceful at night that was without mosquitoes gadflies flies and fleas and that was neither too cold nor too hot one could erect dwellings for the Buddha and his community Venerable Sāriputta at that time we saw that Prince Jetas Grove was the only that had good access that was not noisy in the daytime and was peaceful at night that was without mosquitoes gadflies flies and fleas and that was neither too cold nor too hot Having seen this I thought This is just the place where dwellings for the Buddha and his community can be erected Then Venerable Sāriputta I entered Sāvatthī Still without returning home I first approached Prince Jeta saying Prince will you sell me this grove The prince replied Know this elder I will not sell the grove A second and a third time I repeated my request Prince will you sell me this grove And a second and a third time the prince replied I will not sell the grove not even if you pay me millions and millions to cover the entire surface  aI replied I shall go and bring the gold Then Venerable Sāriputta the prince and I argued about whether or not he had set the price and finally we approached the chief magistrate in Sāvatthī to settle the matter The chief magistrate in Sāvatthī said to Prince Jeta Prince you have set the price Now accept the gold Then Venerable Sāriputta I returned to my home in Sāvatthī to fetch the cash Elephants horses and carts were employed to transport it Then the millions and millions of gold pieces were taken out to cover the ground  But a small portion of the ground was not covered Venerable Sāriputta I thought From which of my other treasuries one that is neither too large nor too small should I take so that the remaining portion can be covered Then Prince Jeta said to me Elder if you have regrets you can take back the payment and I shall keep the grove I said to the prince I certainly have no regrets I was merely thinking From which of my other treasuries one that is neither too large nor too small should I take so that the remaining portion can be covered Then Prince Jeta thought The Buddha must be most worthy of veneration and the Dharma and the community of monks must also be most worthy of veneration have moved this elder to make such a great offering to spend his wealth in such a way I would now rather construct an enclosure with a gate on this ground and offer it to the Buddha and his community Then Prince Jeta said to me Enough elder Dont bring any more gold to cover this piece of ground I shall construct an enclosure with a gate here and offer it to the Buddha and his community Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion I gave this piece of ground to Prince Jeta Venerable Sāriputta in that very summer I constructed sixteen large dwelling places and sixty storerooms Venerable Sāriputta assisted me during that time the Dharma talk that Venerable Sāriputta gave for this sick man was marvelous very special Having heard this  Dharma talk delivered for a sick man I am cured of that severe illness and am

After the meal he again brought the water container and then seated himself on a small seat to one side to listen to the Dharma Once Anāthapiṇḍika was seated Venerable Sāriputta expounded the Dharma to him exhorting encouraging and delighting him using countless skillful means to explain the Dharma Having exhorted inspired and delighted  rose from his seat and departed At that time the

the Great Forest of Vesālī At that time the monks had placed the almsbowls outside on the ground and the bowl of the Worldhonored One was among them Then a monkey came and made off with the Buddhas bowl The monks chided the monkey afraid that it would break the Buddhas bowl The Buddha told the monks Stop Dont chide it It will not break the bowl Then the monkey carried the Buddhas bowl away and went to a sāla tree It slowly climbed the tree Having reached the top of the sāla tree it took some honey and filled the bowl with it Coming slowly down from the tree it returned and approached the Buddha It then respectfully offered the bowl of honey to the Worldhonored One but the Worldhonored One did not accept it Then that monkey retreated to one side took a piece of stick and removed some insects  Having removed the insects the monkey again offered to the Buddha Again the Buddha did not accept it The monkey again retreated to one side added some water to the honey and returned to offer it to the Buddha again The Worldhonored One readily accepted it Seeing that the Buddha had accepted the bowl of honey the monkey was overjoyed Dancing and whirling around it departed That the Worldhonored One by accepting a bowl of honey made that monkey rejoice dance and whirl around before departingthis I remember as an extraordinary quality of the Worldhonored One  I have heard that at one time the Worldhonored One was staying in Vesālī at the Gabled Hall near Monkey Lake At that time the Worldhonored One was drying his sitting mat in the sun shaking and cleaning it Then a big untimely cloud came and covered the sky and was about to pour down rain but had to wait for the Worldhonored One Having finished drying shaking and cleaning his sitting mat and having put it aside in a certain place the Worldhonored One took a broom and went to the terrace of the house On seeing that the Worldhonored One had put away the sitting mat the big cloud began sending down torrential rain that flooded the highlands and lowlands That the Worldhonored One caused that big cloud to hold back its heavy rain that was going to flood the highlands and lowlands until it saw that the Worldhonored One had put away his sitting mat this I remember as an extraordinary quality of the Worldhonored One I have heard that at one time the Worldhonored One was living among the Vajjīs sitting under a royal sāla tree by the Hot Spring Grove At that time it being past noon the shadows of all the other trees had moved but the shadow of that royal sāla tree alone had remained still providing shade for the body of the Worldhonored One At that time the owner of the Rāma Garden was inspecting the grove He saw that it being past noon the shadows of all the other trees had moved but the shadow of the royal sāla tree alone had remained still providing shade for the body of the Worldhonored One Then he thought b The renunciant Gotama is most wonderful and most marvelous He has great supernormal power great and mighty virtue great merit great and mighty power Because it being past noon the shadows of all the other trees have moved but the shadow of the royal sāla tree alone has remained still providing shade for the body of the renunciant Gotama Worldhonored One that noon having passed the shadows of all the other trees had moved but the shadow of the royal sāla tree alone had  remained still providing shade for the body of the Worldhonored One this I remember as an extraordinary quality of the Worldhonored One I have heard that at one time the Worldhonored One was staying at the tumā Shrine At that time at dawn when the night was over the Worldhonored One put on his robes took his almsbowl and entered the village of tumā to beg for food Having finished begging for food  he put away his robes and bowl and washed his hands and feet Carrying a sitting mat on his shoulder he entered the shrine to meditate At that time there was a great thunderstorm with hail which killed four cows and two farmers During the funeral procession the crowds were making a great noise which was reverberating  Meanwhile the Worldhonored One had risen from his sitting meditation in the late afternoon and gone out of the shrine to practice walking meditation in the open At that time a man among the large crowd saw that the Worldhonored One had risen from his sitting meditation in the late afternoon and come out of the shrine to practice walking meditation in the open So he approached the Buddha and after paying homage to  feet followed him in walking meditation Seeing this man behind him the Buddha asked him Why is the crowd making a great noise which is reverberating  The man replied Worldhonored One today there was a great thunderstorm with hail which killed four cows and two farmers during the funeral procession the crowd is making a great noise which is reverberating  Worldhonored One did you not hear the sound of it then The Worldhonored One replied I heard no sound asked again Worldhonored One were you asleep then answered No again asked Worldhonored One at that time you were awake you did not hear that great sound c replied That is so Then the man thought Most wonderful Most remarkable Extremely calm is the abiding of the Tathāgata who is free from attachment and fully awakened did not hear such a loud noise he was awake That the Worldhonored One did not hear such a loud noise he was awake this I remember as an extraordinary quality of the Worldhonored One I have heard that once the Worldhonored Once was staying at Uruvela on the bank of the Nerañjarā River under an Indian fig tree by the river having just attained the path of buddhahood At that time heavy rain fell and lasted for seven days flooding the highlands and lowlands and everything was under water In the midst of that flood the Worldhonored One practiced walking meditation in the open and this caused dust to rise That the Worldhonored One practiced walking meditation

being  unaware of them nanda the Tathāgata is aware of thoughts  of perceptions as they arise remain and pass away being aware of them continuously without a moment of being unaware of them Therefore nanda remember furthermore this extraordinary quality of the Tathāgata This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the venerable nanda and the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse on the Attendant  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha At that time renowned highly regarded and virtuous senior monks and chief disciples such as Venerable Koṇḍañña Venerable Assaji Venerable Bha ddhiya the king of the Sakyas Venerable Mahānāma the Koliyan Venerable Vappa Venerable Yasa Venerable Puṇṇa Venerable Vimala Venerable Qiehepoti

Cunda Venerable Mahā Kaccāyana the venerable elder Binnoujiatuniao the venerable elder Yasa the issuer of tokens and other such renowned highly regarded and virtuous senior monks and chief disciples who were also staying at Rājagaha dwelling near the leaf hut of the Buddha At that time the Worldhonored One addressed the monks I am now old My body is running down and my life span is coming to an end I am in need of an attendant All of you consider this and recommend an attendant one who will look after my daily needs appropriately and who will receive my instructions without losing their meaning Thereupon Venerable Koṇḍañña rose from his seat arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder and placing his palms together toward the Buddha said Worldhonored One I wish to look after your daily needs appropriately and to receive your instructions without losing their meaning The Worldhonored One said aKoṇḍañña you are old yourself Your body is running down and your life span is coming to an end You need an attendant yourself Koṇḍañña you may return to your seat Thereupon Venerable Koṇḍañña paid respect at the Buddhas feet and returned to his seat In this way Venerable Assaji Venerable Bhaddhiya the king of the Sakyas Venerable Mahānāma  Venerable Vappa Venerable Yasa Venerable Puṇṇa Venerable Vimala Venerable Qiehepoti Venerable Xutuoye Venerable Sāriputta Venerable Anuruddha Venerable Nanda Venerable Kimbila Venerable Revata Venerable Mahā Mogga llāna Venerable Mahā Kassapa Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita Venerable Mahā Cunda Venerable Mahā Kaccāyana the venerable elder Binnoujiatuniao and the venerable elder Yasa the issuer of tokens rose from his seat arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder and placing his hands with palms together toward the Buddha said Worldhonored One I wish to look after your daily needs appropriately and to receive your instructions without losing their meaning The Worldhonored One said  Yasa you are old yourself Your body is running down and your life span is coming to an end You need an attendant yourself Yasa you may return to your seat b Thereupon the venerable Yasa paid respect at the Buddhas feet and returned to his seat At that time the venerable Mahā Moggallāna who was among the assembly thought Whom does the Worldhonored One wish to have as his attendant Which monk does he intend to choose to look after him appropriately and to receive his instructions without losing their meaning Let me enter concentration such that I survey the minds of the monks in the assembly Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna entered concentration such that he survey the minds of the monks in the assembly He then knew that  the Worldhonored One wished to have Venerable nanda as his attendant His intention was to choose nanda to look after his daily needs appropriately and receive his instructions without losing their meaning Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna came out of concentration and told the monks in the assembly Venerable friends did you know this The Worldhonored One wishes to have Venerable nanda as his attendant His intention is to choose nanda to look after his daily needs appropriately and receive his instructions without losing their meaning Venerable friends we should now together approach Venerable nanda and persuade him to become the Worldhonored Ones attendant Then the venerable Mahā Moggallāna together with the other monks approached Venerable nanda After exchanging courteous greetings they sat down to one side Then having sat down the venerable Mahā Moggallāna said Venerable nanda did you know this The Buddha wishes to have you as his attendant His intention is to choose you to look after his daily needs appropriately and receive his instructions without losing their meaning nanda it is as if there were not far from a village a gabled hall with a viewing tower and an open window facing toward the east the sunlight at dawn would shine on its western wall Similarly friend nanda the Worldhonored One wishes to have you as his attendant His intention is May nanda look after my daily needs appropriately and receive my instructions without losing their meaning Friend nanda may you now become the attendant of the Worldhonored One Venerable nanda replied Venerable Mahā Moggallāna I would not dare to become the attendant of the Worldhonored One Why is that Difficult indeed is it to attend on a buddha a Worldhonored One that is to say to be his attendant Venerable Mahā Moggallāna it is as if there were a great royal elephant full sixty years old proud powerful with tusks intact and body full of vigor difficult indeed is it to come close to him that is to say to be  his keeper It is similar Venerable Mahā Moggallāna with a Tathāgata free from attachment and fully awakened difficult indeed is it to come close to him that is to say to be his attendant Venerable Mahā Moggallāna this is why I would not become the attendant  Venerable Mahā Moggallāna replied c Friend nanda listen while I tell you a parable The wise on hearing a parable understand its implication Friend nanda it is like the flower of the cluster fig tree which appears in the world in due time Friend nanda the Tathāgata free from attachment and fully awakened has likewise appeared in the world in due time  friend nanda quickly become the attendant of the Worldhonored One and you Gotama  will acquire great fruit Venerable nanda replied Venerable Mahā Moggallāna if the Worldhonored One grants me three wishes I will become the Buddhas attendant What are the three I wish not to wear robes new or old that to the Buddha I wish not food that was prepared specially for the Buddha I wish not to see the Buddha at inappropriate times Venerable Mahā Moggallāna if the Worldhonored One grants me these three wishes I will become the Buddhas attendant Then having persuaded Venerable nanda to become the Buddhas attendant Venerable Mahā Moggallāna rose from his seat circumambulated Venerable nanda and returned approached the Buddha After paying respect with his head at the Buddhas feet and sitting down to one side he said Worldhonored One I have persuaded the venerable friend nanda to become the Buddhas attendant Worldhonored One the venerable friend nanda asks that the Buddha grant him three wishes What are the three he wishes not to wear robes new or old that to the Buddha he wishes not food that was  prepared specially for the Buddha he wishes not to see the Buddha at inappropriate times nanda said to me  Venerable Mahā Moggallāna if the Worldhonored One grants me these three wishes I will become the Buddhas attendant The Worldhonored One said Mahā Moggallāna the monk nanda is clever and wise He foresees that there might be criticism from companions in the holy life who might say The monk nanda attends on the Worldhonored One for the purpose of getting robes Mahā Moggallāna that the monk nanda is clever and wise and foresees that there might be criticism from companions in the holy life who might say The monk nanda attends on the Worldhonored One for the purpose of getting robes this is an extraordinary quality of the monk nanda Mahā

visit the Tathāgata and a when it is not the proper time for the many nonBuddhist renunciants and brahmins to visit the Tathāgata He knows whether one of the many nonBuddhist renunciants or brahmins is able to discuss with the Tathāgata or if one of the many nonBuddhist renunciants or brahmins is not able to discuss with the Tathāgata He knows which food if eaten savored and digested by the Tathāgata will bring him peace and wellbeing and he knows which food if eaten savored and digested by the Tathāgata will not bring him peace and wellbeing He knows which food if eaten savored and digested by the Tathāgata will cause him to teach the Dharma more eloquently and he knows which food if eaten savored and digested by the Tathāgata will not cause him to teach the Dharma more eloquently This is said to be an extraordinary quality of the monk nanda Mahā Moggallāna although the monk nanda does not possess the knowledge of others minds he knows well that the Buddha would rise from sitting in meditation in the late afternoon to teach people that such is the Tathāgatas practice for today or that such is the Tathāgatas dwelling in happiness here and now He speaks carefully

friends I have received eighty thousand teachings from the Tathāgata and since the beginning I have never had the thought I am receiving these teachings so that I can teach them to others Venerable friends I simply wished to discipline and calm myself in order to attain final nirvana That Venerable nanda make such a declaration this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable nanda Venerable nanda has also said Venerable friends it is most wonderful most remarkable that the four assemblies come to me to listen to the Dharma that for that reason I might become conceited that is

declaration this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable nanda Again at one time Venerable Sāriputta Venerable Mahā Moggallāna and Venerable nanda were staying on Mount Salaḷāgāra at Sāvatthī At that time Venerable Sāriputta asked  Friend nanda during the twentyfive years of your attending on the Worldhonored One do you remember desire ever arising in your mind Venerable nanda replied Venerable Sāriputta I am a disciple in higher training and have not abandoned desire Venerable Sāriputta again said Friend nanda I am not asking you if you are a disciple in higher training or one beyond training Rather I am asking you if you remember desire ever arising in your mind during the twentyfive years of your attending on the Worldhonored One c Venerable Sāriputta repeated the question three times Friend nanda during the twentyfive years of your attending on the Worldhonored One do you remember desire ever arising in your mind And three times the venerable nanda gave the same answer Venerable Sāriputta I am a disciple in higher training and have not abandoned desire Venerable Sāriputta again said Friend nanda I am not asking you if you are a disciple in higher

Moggallāna said Friend nanda answer the question right away Answer the question right away Do not trouble the most highly regarded elder  Then Venerable nanda replied Venerable Sāriputta from the beginning of the twentyfive years of my attending on the Worldhonored One I do not remember desire ever arising in my mind Why is that I always had shame and scruple when approaching the Buddha and my wise companions in the holy life That Venerable nanda make such a declaration this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable nanda Again at one time the Worldhonored One was staying on Mount Vulture Peak near Rājagaha At that time the Worldhonored One told nanda nanda when you lie down you should practice the lions way of lying down Venerable nanda responded Worldhonored One what is the way of lying down of the lion king of animals The Worldhonored One replied nanda the lion king of animals after searching for food during the day enters a cave to sleep When it wants to sleep it puts one leg on the other with tail stretched behind and lies down on its right side In the morning when the night is over it inspects its own body If the lion king of animals sees that its body is not straight then it is not happy If the lion king of animals sees that its body is straight then it is happy After rising from lying down it goes out of the cave and growls several times Having growled several times it inspects its own body again Having inspected its own body it looks around to the four directions Having looked around to the four directions it roars three times and then goes out to search for food Such is the way of lying down of the lion king of animals Then the venerable nanda said Worldhonored One if such is the way of lying down of the lion king of animals what is a monks way of lying down The Worldhonored One replied nanda when a monk is living in dependence on a village or town in the early morning when the night is over he puts on his robes takes  his almsbowl and then enters the village to beg for food with his body well protected his senses guarded and right mindfulness established Having finished begging for food in the village or town  he puts away his robes and bowl washes his hands and feet and then goes to a secluded place taking a sitting mat with him on his shoulder He walks or sits in meditation under a tree or in an empty hut purifying the

hut to sleep He folds his upper robe in four and places it on the bed and he folds his outer robe to make a pillow He lies down on his right side placing one leg on the other constantly maintaining clarity of perception right mindfulness and right attentiveness in his mind and continuously aware of the thought of getting up  In the last watch of the night he gets up to practice walking or sitting meditation to purify the mind from any hindrance This is how a monk lies down according to the way of the lion a Venerable nanda said Worldhonored One this is how a monk lies down according to the way of the lion Venerable nanda used to say Venerable friends from the time the Worldhonored One taught me the analogy of the lions way of lying down I have never slept on my left side That Venerable nanda make such a declaration this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable nanda Again at one time the Worldhonored One was staying in the sāla tree grove of the Kusināra Mallas called Upavattana At that time the Worldhonored One who was about to attain final nirvana said  nanda go to the place between the twin sāla trees and arrange a bed for the Tathāgata with the head facing north The Tathāgata will attain final nirvana during the middle watch of the night Having received the Tathāgatas instruction Venerable nanda went to the twin trees Between the twin trees arranged a bed for the Tathāgata with the head facing north Having arranged the bed returned to the Buddha paid respect with his head at the Buddhas feet stood to one side and said Worldhonored One I have arranged a bed for the Tathāgata between the twin trees with the head facing north May the Worldhonored One himself know the proper time Then the Worldhonored One bade Venerable nanda take him to between the twin sāla trees folded his upper robe in four spread it on the bed folded his outer robe to make a pillow and then lay down on his right side with one foot on the other In the last moments the Buddhas final nirvana Venerable nanda who had been attending on the Buddha with a fly whisk in hand was wiping away tears with his hand thinking Formerly assemblies of monks from all directions came wishing to see the Worldhonored One serve him and pay respect to him All of them could at any time see the Worldhonored One serve him and pay respect to him But when they hear that the Worldhonored One has attained final nirvana they will no longer come to see the Worldhonored One serve him and pay respect to him And I too will no longer be able to see the Buddha at any time to serve him and pay respect to him Then the Worldhonored One asked the monks Where is the monk nanda now The monks said Worldhonored One Venerable nanda who is attending on the Buddha with a fly whisk in hand is wiping away tears with his hand thinking Formerly assemblies of monks  from all directions came wishing to see the Worldhonored One serve him and pay respect to him All of them could at any time see the Worldhonored One serve him and pay respect to him But when they hear that the Worldhonored One has attained final nirvana they will no longer come to see the Worldhonored One serve him and pay respect to him And I too will no longer be able to see the Buddha at any time to serve him and pay respect to him Then the Worldhonored One said b nanda Do not weep Do not grieve Why is that nanda you have attended on me respectfully practicing lovingkindness in your bodily action speech and thoughts wholeheartedly from the beginning and you have ensured my happiness and comfort without measure without boundary without limit nanda as for Tathāgatas of the past free from attachment and fully awakened attendants they had none of them surpassed you nanda as for Tathāgatas of the future free from attachment and fully awakened attendants they will have none of them will surpass you nanda as for myself the Tathāgata of the present free from attachment and fully awakened attendants I have had none of them has surpassed you Why is that nanda are skillful in knowing the time and in rightly discriminating the time You know when it is the proper time to visit the Tathāgata and you know when it is not the proper time to visit the Tathāgata when it is the proper time for the assembly of monks or the assembly of nuns to visit the Tathāgata and when it is not the proper time for the assembly of monks or the assembly of nuns to visit the Tathāgata when it is the proper time for the assembly of laymen and laywomen to visit the Tathāgata and when it is not the proper time for the assembly of laymen and laywomen to visit the Tathāgata when it is the proper time for the many nonBuddhist renunciants and brahmins to visit the Tathāgata and when it is not the proper time for the many nonBuddhist renunciants and brahmins to visit the Tathāgata  You know whether one of the many nonBuddhist renunciants or brahmins is able to discuss with the Tathāgata or if one of the many nonBuddhist renunciants or brahmins is not able to discuss with the Tathāgata You know which food if eaten savored and digested by the Tathāgata will bring him peace and wellbeing and you know which food if eaten savored and digested by the Tathāgata will not bring him peace and wellbeing You know which food if eaten savored and digested by the Tathāgata will cause him to teach the Dharma more eloquently and you know which food if eaten savored and digested by the Tathāgata will not cause him to teach the Dharma more eloquently Moreover nanda although you do not possess the knowledge of others minds you know well that the Buddha would rise from sitting in meditation in the late afternoon to teach people that such is the Tathāgatas practice for today or that such is the Tathāgatas dwelling in happiness here and now You speak carefully according to what was said speaking the truth and not otherwise Then intending to make the venerable nanda happy the Worldhonored One told the monks A wheelturning monarch possesses four extraordinary qualities What are the four When an assembly of khattiyas goes to visit the wheelturning monarch then if he is silent they are delighted at the sight of him and if he speaks they are delighted to hear him When an assembly of brahmins  of householders  of renunciants goes to visit the wheelturning monarch then if he is silent they are delighted at the sight of him and if he speaks they are delighted to hear him The monk nanda likewise possesses four extraordinary qualities What are the four When an assembly of monks goes to visit nanda then if he is silent they are delighted at the mere sight of him and if he speaks they are delighted to hear  When an assembly of nuns  of laymen  of laywomen goes to visit nanda then if he is silent they are delighted at the mere sight of him and if he speaks they are delighted to hear  cMoreover when nanda teaches the Dharma to an assembly there are four extraordinary qualities  What are the four The monk nanda teaches the Dharma to an assembly of monks wholeheartedly not otherwise And the assembly of monks thinks May Venerable nanda continue to teach the Dharma May he not stop midway The assembly of monks never grows tired of his teaching the Dharma until the monk nanda becomes silent of his own accord He teaches the Dharma to an assembly of nuns  of laymen  of laywomen wholeheartedly not otherwise And they think May Venerable nanda continue to teach the Dharma May he not stop midway The assembly of laywomen never grows tired of his teaching the Dharma until Venerable nanda becomes silent of his own accord Again at one time not long after the Buddha had attained final nirvana Venerable nanda was dwelling among the Vajjīs in a village of the Vajjīs At that time Venerable nanda was teaching the Dharma surrounded by countless hundreds and thousands of people Venerable Vajjiputta was also among the assembly Venerable Vajjiputta thought to himself Is this venerable nanda a disciple in higher training and has not yet abandoned desire Let me enter concentration such that I examine the venerable nandas mind Then Venerable Vajjiputta entered concentration such that he examine the mind of Venerable nanda By this means Venerable Vajjiputta knew that Venerable nanda was still a disciple in higher training and had not yet abandoned desire Venerable Vajjiputta then rose from concentration and uttered a verse to Venerable nanda Mountains and forest calm the thoughts And make nirvana enter the mind  Gotama meditate without distraction Soon will realize the path of peace  Then Venerable nanda having received the instruction given by Venerable Vajjiputta left the crowd to live in solitude and to practice diligently without being distracted Having left the crowd to live in solitude and to practice diligently without being distracted he attained fully the summit of the holy life for the sake of which a clansman shaves off his hair and beard dons the yellow robe leaves home out of faith and goes forth to practice the path In this very life he personally attained understanding and awakening and dwelled having personally realized He knew as it really was Birth is ended the holy life has been established what was to be done has been done There will not be another existence Venerable nanda had come to know the Dharma   attained arahantship Venerable nanda said Venerable friends when I was sitting on the bed and was about to lie down just as my head was about to touch the pillow all the taints were eradicated and I attained liberation of the mind That Venerable nanda make such a declaration this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable nanda Venerable nanda also said Venerable friends I shall attain final nirvana sitting crosslegged Then Venerable nanda sat crosslegged and attained final nirvana That Venerable nanda sat crosslegged to attain final nirvana this is said to be an extraordinary quality of Venerable nanda This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse by Bakkula  Thus have I heard At one time not long after the final nirvana of the Buddha Venerable Bakkula was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels Sanctuary At that time one afternoon while wandering around a nonBuddhist practitioner who had been a good friend of Venerable Bakkula from the time before he had gone forth approached Venerable Bakkula exchanged greetings and sat down to one side aThe nonBuddhist practitioner said Friend Bakkula I would like to ask you a question Will you listen to it Venerable Bakkula replied Practitioner of another school ask what you wish After hearing it I will consider it The nonBuddhist practitioner asked Friend Bakkula how long have you been practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline Venerable Bakkula answered Practitioner of another school I have been practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline for eighty years already The nonBuddhist practitioner asked further Friend Bakkula during your eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline do you recall ever having had sexual intercourse Venerable Bakkula answered the nonBuddhist practitioner You should not ask such a question Instead ask a different question Friend Bakkula during your eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline do you recall ever having given rise to any thought of sexual desire This practitioner of another school is the question you should ask I now ask a different question friend Bakkula During your eighty years of practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline do you recall ever having given rise to any thought of sexual desire b At this because the nonBuddhist practitioner asked the question Venerable Bakkula said to the monks Venerable friends I have been practicing the path in this true teaching and discipline for eighty years but that for this reason conceit should arise  this is not the case That Venerable Bakkula make this declaration this is said to be an extraordinary quality of

Between the eight extraordinary qualities of my true teaching and discipline and the eight extraordinary qualities of the ocean of these two types of extraordinary qualities which is superior more excellent more wonderful which is supreme Pahārāda replied Worldhonored One the eight extraordinary qualities of the ocean are inferior to the eight extraordinary qualities of the Tathāgatas true teaching and discipline by a thousand or ten thousand times they cannot be compared likened measured or counted The eight extraordinary qualities of the Worldhonored Ones true teaching and discipline are superior more excellent more wonderful and supreme Worldhonored One I now take refuge in the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks May the Worldhonored One accept me as a lay follower From this day forth I take refuge until the end of my life This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words Pahā rāda the asura king together with the monks was delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse on Earthquakes  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying in the Vajjian country in a town named Bhūmi At that time there was a violent earthquake As the earth was quaking violently a gale began blowing in all four directions meteors appeared in all four directions and all the houses and walls collapsed and were destroyed utterly Then Venerable nanda saw that there was a violent earthquake and that as the earth was quaking violently a gale began blowing in all four directions meteors appeared in all four directions and all the houses and walls collapsed and were destroyed utterly Seeing this Venerable nanda was c terrified and his body hairs stood on end He then approached the Buddha and after paying respect with his head at the Buddhas feet stood to one side and said Worldhonored One just now the earth was quaking violently and as the earth was quaking violently a gale began blowing in all four directions meteors appeared in all four directions and all the houses and walls collapsed and were destroyed utterly Then the Worldhonored One spoke to Venerable nanda saying Indeed nanda Just now the earth was quaking violently Indeed nanda As the earth was quaking violently a gale began blowing in all four directions meteors appeared in all four directions and all the houses and walls collapsed and were destroyed utterly Then Venerable nanda asked Worldhonored One how many causes are there due to which the earth quakes violently and as the earth quakes violently a gale begins blowing in all four directions meteors appear in all four directions and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly The Worldhonored One replied nanda there are three causes due to which the earth quakes violently and as the earth quakes violently a gale begins blowing in all four directions meteors appear in all four directions and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly What are the three nanda this earth rests upon water the water rests upon wind and the wind depends upon space nanda there comes a time when a great wind begins blowing in the sky When the wind begins blowing the water becomes disturbed and when the water is disturbed the earth quakes This is the first cause due to which the earth quakes violently and as the earth quakes violently a gale begins blowing in all four directions meteors appear in all four directions and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly  Again nanda a monk who possesses great supernormal power great and mighty virtue great merit great and mighty power is able with the supernormal power of mastery over the mind to develop perception of earth as minute and perception of water as infinite On account of this this earth behaves according to his wish according to his will being disturbed again and again quaking again and again Not only a monk a god too who has selfmastery one who possesses great supernormal power great and mighty virtue great merit great and mighty power is able to develop perception of earth as minute and perception of water as infinite with his supernormal power of mastery over the mind On account of this this earth behaves according to his wish according to his will being disturbed again and again quaking again and again This is the second cause due to which the earth quakes violently and as the earth quakes violently a gale begins blowing in all four directions meteors appear in all four directions and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly Again nanda if a Tathāgata will be attaining final nirvana soon within three months for this reason the earth quakes violently and as the earth quakes violently a gale begins blowing in all four directions meteors appear in all four directions and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly This is the third cause due to which the earth quakes violently and as the earth quakes violently a gale begins blowing in all four directions meteors appear in all four directions and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly Hearing this Venerable nanda began to weep and shed tears Placing his palms together toward the Buddha he said Worldhonored One it is most wonderful most remarkable that the Tathāgata who is free from attachment fully awakened has accomplished meritorious deeds and acquired such extraordinary qualities Why is that the Tathāgata will enter final nirvana soon within three months at this time  the earth quakes a violently and as the earth quakes violently a gale begins to blow in all four directions meteors appear in all four directions and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly Then the Worldhonored One said to Venerable nanda Indeed nanda indeed It is most wonderful most remarkable that the Tathāgata who is free from attachment fully awakened has accomplished meritorious deeds and acquired such extraordinary qualities Why is that the Tathāgata will enter final nirvana soon within three months at this time  the earth quakes violently and as the earth quakes violently a gale begins to blow in all four directions meteors appear in all four directions and all houses and walls collapse and are destroyed utterly Furthermore nanda I have approached countless hundreds and thousands of khattiya assemblies sat and discussed with them and made them feel at ease Having sat down with them I take on an appearance that resembles their appearance a voice that sounds like their voices and comportment and etiquette that resemble their comportment and etiquette If they ask questions I respond to those questions Moreover I teach them the Dharma exhorting encouraging and delighting them Having taught them the Dharma using countless skillful means having exhorted encouraged and delighted them I then disappear from that place After I have disappeared they do not know who I was whether I was human or not human Similarly nanda it is most wonderful most remarkable that the Tathāgata who is free from attachment fully awakened has accomplished meritorious deeds and acquired such extraordinary qualities has done the same with assemblies of brahmins  assemblies of householders  assemblies of renunciants nanda I have approached countless hundreds and thousands of assemblies of the four celestial kings sat and discussed with them and made them feel at ease Having sat down with them I take on an appearance that resembles their appearance a voice that sounds like their voices and comportment  and etiquette that resemble their comportment and etiquette If they ask questions I respond to those questions Moreover I teach them the Dharma exhorting encouraging and delighting them Having taught them the Dharma using countless skillful means having exhorted encouraged and delighted them I then disappear from that place After I have disappeared they do not know who I was whether I was a god or not a god Similarly nanda it is most wonderful most remarkable that the Tathāgata who is free from attachment fully awakened has accomplished meritorious deeds and acquired such extraordinary qualities has done the same with the thirtythree gods  the Yama gods  the Tusita gods  the gods that delight in creation  the gods that delight in others creation  the gods that are the retinue of Brahmā  the gods that are the attendants and ministers of Brahmā  the gods of limited radiance  the gods of immeasurable radiance  the gods of streaming radiance  the gods of limited glory  the gods of immeasurable glory  the gods of refulgent glory  the unclouded gods  the gods of abundant merit  the gods of great reward  the gods of nonvexation  the gods of nonaffliction  the gods of good sight  the gods of good appearance nanda I have approached countless hundreds of thousands of assemblies of the gods of ultimate form sat and discussed with them and made them feel at ease Having sat down with them I take on an appearance that resembles their appearance a voice that sounds like their voices and comportment and etiquette that resemble their comportment and etiquette If they ask questions I respond to those questions Moreover I teach them the Dharma exhorting encouraging and delighting them Having taught them the Dharma using countless skillful means having exhorted encouraged and delighted them I then disappear from that place After I have disappeared they do not know who I was whether I was a god or not a god In this way nanda it is most wonderful most remarkable that the Tathāgata who is free from attachment fully awakened has accomplished meritorious deeds and acquired such extraordinary qualities bThis is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words Venerable nanda and the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse at Campā  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was living at Campā near the Gaggarā Lake At that time on the fifteenth day of the month the day for reciting the code of rules the Worldhonored One sat down on a seat prepared in front of the assembly of monks After sitting down the Worldhonored One entered concentration and through the knowledge of others minds he surveyed the minds of the assembly After surveying the minds of  the assembly he sat silently through the first watch of the night Then a certain monk got up from his seat arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder and placing his palms together toward the Buddha said Worldhonored One the first watch of the night has ended It has been a long time since the Buddha and the assembly of monks gathered and sat down here May the Worldhonored One recite the code of rules At that time the Worldhonored One remained silent and made no response Then the Worldhonored One continued to sit silently up to the middle watch of the night That monk again got up from his seat arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder and placing his palms together toward the Buddha said Worldhonored One the first watch of the night is over the middle watch of the night is coming to an end It has been a long time since the Buddha and the assembly of monks gathered and sat down here May the Worldhonored One recite the code of rules At that time the Worldhonored One again remained silent and made no response Then the Worldhonored One continued to sit silently up to the last watch of the night A third time that monk got up from his seat arranged his robe  so as to bare one shoulder and placing his palms together toward the Buddha said Worldhonored One the first watch of the night has already ended the middle watch of the night too has ended and the last watch of the night is about to end It is getting close to dawn soon the dawn will come It has been a very long time since the Buddha and the assembly of monks gathered and sat down here May the Worldhonored One recite the code of rules Then the Worldhonored One said to that monk Among this assembly there is one monk who is impure At that time Venerable Mahā Moggallāna was also among the assembly Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna had this thought In regard to which monk did the Worldhonored One say that among this assembly there is one monk who is impure Let me enter concentration such that through the knowledge of others minds I survey the minds of the assembly Venerable Mahā Moggallāna then entered concentration such that through the knowledge of others minds he survey the minds of the assembly Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna came to know the monk in regard to whom the Worldhonored One had said Among this assembly there is one monk who is impure Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna emerged from concentration went right in front of that monk pulled him by the arm opened the door and thrust him outside  You fool go far away do not stay here You are not allowed to gather again with the assembly of monks Henceforth you are no longer a monk Venerable Mahā Moggallāna then bolted the door and returned to where the Buddha was Paying respect with his head at the Buddhas feet he stood to one side and said The monk in regard to whom the Worldhonored One had said Among this assembly there is one monk who is impure has been expelled by me cWorldhonored One the first watch of the night has already ended the middle watch of the night too has ended and the last watch of the night is about to end It is getting close to dawn soon the dawn will come It has been a very long time since the Buddha and the assembly of monks gathered and sat down here May the Worldhonored One recite the code of rules The Worldhonored One spoke thus Mahā Moggallāna that foolish man committed a serious offense in troubling the Worldhonored One and the assembly of monks Mahā Moggallāna whoever is responsible for the Tathāgata reciting the code of rules in an assembly that is not pure his head shall split into seven pieces Therefore Mahā Moggallāna henceforth you may recite the code of rules  The Tathāgata will not recite the code of rules again Why is that Mahā Moggallāna just as from the bottom to the surface the ocean becomes gradually greater in circumference evenly and uniformly increasing up to the shore and just as its water is always full but never overflowing similarly Mahā Moggallāna my true teaching and discipline is gradually practiced gradually trained in gradually completed and gradually taught Mahā Moggallāna that my true

the Buddha was at Vesālī staying in the Great Forest At that time the householder Ugga who was waited on only by women went out of Vesālī followed by all his women and between Vesālī and the Great Forest enjoyed himself like a king with his concubines Then the householder Ugga having become very drunk on alcohol left the women and went into the Great Forest The householder Ugga very drunk on alcohol saw from afar the Worldhonored One among the trees of the forest dignified and beautiful like the moon amidst the stars with radiant aura shining like a golden mountain endowed with majestic appearance and lofty dignity with sense faculties calm free of obstruction accomplished and disciplined with his mind calm and quiet On seeing the Buddha the householder Ugga sobered up instantly and having sobered up he approached the Buddha Paying respect with his head at the Buddhas feet he sat down to one side Then the Worldhonored One taught him the Dharma exhorted encouraged and delighted him Having with countless skillful means taught the Dharma having exhorted encouraged and delighted him as all buddhas do when first teaching the true Dharma to delight their hearers he taught about generosity virtue rebirth in heaven the disadvantages of sensual desire and the defilement of birth and death and he extolled the excellence of dispassion and the purity of the constituents of the path Having taught him the Dharma in this way the Buddha knew that mind was delighted prepared pliant able to endure uplifted onepointed free of doubt free of hindrances capable and strong enough to

householder Ugga saw the four noble truths suffering its arising its cessation and the path  Just as a piece of white cloth is easily dyed so the householder Ugga instantly while seated  saw the four noble truths suffering its arising its cessation and the path   Then the householder Ugga having seen the Dharma having attained the Dharma awakened of his own accord to the pure Dharma cut off doubt and overcame uncertainty there was no other teacher he would no longer follow others Without hesitation he abided in the realization of the fruit In the teaching of the Worldhonored One he had attained fearlessness Then the householder Ugga rose from his seat made obeisance to the Buddha and said Worldhonored One I now take refuge in the Buddha the Dharma and the assembly of monks May the Worldhonored One accept me as a lay follower From this day forth I take refuge until the end of my life Worldhonored One from this day forth I follow the Worldhonored One lead a life of celibacy and

near Monkey Lake At that time the householder Ugga was performing a lavish almsgiving for those who had come from afar for those on a journey for the ill and for those who were looking after the ill He was regularly preparing porridge and meals for the monastery keepers regularly inviting groups of twenty from the community for food and offering food to the assembly of monks every five days Almsgiving on such a lavish scale is like a ship which while returning with a full load of cargo worth hundreds and thousands suddenly sinks and is lost An assembly of many highly regarded senior monks heard that the householder Ugga was performing such a lavish almsgiving for those who had come from afar for those on a journey for the ill and for those who were looking after the ill regularly

with compassion  with empathic joy  with equanimity free from fetters or resentment without ill will or quarrel he dwelled pervading the entire world boundless exalted immeasurable and well cultivatedb At that time the householder Hatthaka remained silent he did not speak and did not look or glance at the great heavenly king Vessavaṇa Why is that Out of respect for his concentration to guard his concentration Then the householder Hatthaka said to the monk Venerable sir at that time were there any laypeople present The monk replied No there were no laypeople present and asked What fault would there be if there were laypeople present The householder answered Venerable sir if there had been those who had no faith in what the Worldhonored One said they would for a long time derive no benefit from it be unable to accept it and would be reborn into an extremely bad realm of existence experiencing immeasurable suffering If there had been those who did have faith in what the Worldhonored One said on that account they might have come to esteem venerate and pay respect to me  venerable sir I do not desire that they should like that either Venerable sir please take your meal here For the householder Hatthakas sake the monk accepted the invitation by remaining silent Understanding that the monk had accepted his invitation by remaining silent the householder Hatthaka arose from his seat and personally prepared water for washing With his own hands he prepared assorted pure and tasty dishes to eat savor and digest making sure there was enough to eat After had finished eating put aside his bowl and washed his hands took a low seat and sat to one side to listen to the Dharma The monk taught the householder the Dharma exhorted encouraged and delighted him Having with countless skillful means taught him the Dharma having exhorted encouraged and delighted him arose from his seat and departed He approached the Buddha Paying respect with his head at  feet he sat down to one side and reported in detail the conversation he had had with the householder Hatthaka  Then the Worldhonored One told the monks For this reason I extolled the householder Hatthaka that he possesses seven extraordinary qualities Moreover you should know that the householder Hatthaka possesses an eighth extraordinary quality The householder Hatthaka seeks nothing and desires nothing This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the monks were delighted and remembered them well c   The Discourse on the Householder Hatthaka  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Aggāḷava near ḷavī in a rosewood grove At that time the Worldhonored One said to the monks The householder Hatthaka possesses eight marvelous and wonderful qualities What are they The householder Hatthaka has few desires he has faith a sense of shame scruples energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have few desires The householder Hatthaka has few desires himself he does not wish to let others know I have few desires  has faith  a sense of shame  scruples  energy  mindfulness  concentration  wisdom The householder Hatthaka has wisdom himself he does not wish to let others know I have wisdom On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to have few desires On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have faith The householder Hatthaka has firm and deep faith in the Tathāgata His faculty of faith is stable he will never follow other renunciants or brahmins or gods Māras Brahmās or any other beings in the world On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to have faith On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have a sense of shame The householder Hatthaka has at all times a sense of shame He approves of having a sense of shame and knows shame that evil unwholesome states being defiled and afflictive  lead to evil retribution and are the root cause for birth and death On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to have a sense of shame On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have scruples The householder Hatthaka has at all times scruples He approves of the scruples and knows scruples that evil unwholesome states being defiled and afflictive lead to evil retribution and are the root cause for birth and death On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to have scruples On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have energy The householder Hatthaka has energy at all times in discarding what is evil and unwholesome and in cultivating wholesome states He takes the initiative constantly and remains wholeheartedly and steadfastly established in the roots of wholesomeness without giving up his task On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to have energy On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to be mindful The householder Hatthaka internally contemplates the body as body  feeling  the mind  dhammas as dhammas On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to be mindful On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have concentration The householder Hatthaka separated from desires separated from evil and unwholesome states   dwells having attained the fourth absorption On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to have concentration On account of what is the householder Hatthaka said to have wisdom The householder Hatthaka develops comprehension and wisdom attains understanding concerning the rise and fall of phenomena attains noble penetrative knowledge and discriminative understanding concerning the true cessation of suffering On account of this the householder Hatthaka is said to have wisdom It is on account of this that the householder Hatthaka is said to have eight wonderful and marvelous qualities This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the monks were delighted and remembered them well a   The Discourse on What is the Purpose  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park At that time in the late afternoon Venerable nanda rose from sitting in meditation and went to the Buddha paid homage at his feet stood to one side and said Worldhonored One what is the purpose of keeping the precepts The Worldhonored One answered nanda keeping the precepts has the purpose of to be without regret nanda if one keeps the precepts one attains being without regret Again nanda asked Worldhonored One what is the purpose of being without regret The Worldhonored One answered nanda being without regret has the purpose of joy nanda if one is without regret one attains joy Again nanda asked Worldhonored One what is the purpose of joy The Worldhonored One answered nanda joy has the purpose of rapture nanda if one is joyful one attains rapture Again nanda asked Worldhonored One what is the purpose of rapture The Worldhonored One

purpose of concentration The Worldhonored One answered b nanda concentration has the purpose of seeing things as they really are knowing things as they really are nanda if one has concentration one attains to see and know things as they really are Again nanda asked Worldhonored One what is the purpose of seeing and knowing things as they really are The Worldhonored One answered nanda seeing and knowing things as they really are has the purpose of disenchantment nanda if one sees and knows things as they really are one attains disenchantment Again nanda asked Worldhonored One what is the purpose of disenchantment The Worldhonored One answered nanda disenchantment has the purpose of dispassion nanda if one is disenchanted one attains dispassion Again nanda asked Worldhonored One what is the purpose of dispassion The Worldhonored One answered nanda dispassion has the purpose of liberation nanda if one is dispassionate one attains liberation from all lust anger and ignorance nanda through keeping the precepts one has no regrets through having no regrets one attains joy through joy one attains rapture through rapture one attains tranquility through tranquility one attains happiness through happiness one attains concentration nanda through concentration the learned noble disciple sees and knows things as they really are through seeing and knowing things as they really are he attains disenchantment through disenchantment he attains dispassion  through dispassion he attains liberation Through liberation he knows he is liberated Birth has been ended the holy life has been established what was to be done has been done there will not be another existence Thus nanda one state is beneficial for another one state is the means for another and the precepts eventually lead to the highest goal that is to say to crossing over from this bank to the other bank This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words Venerable nanda and the other monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse on No Thought  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park At that time the Worldhonored One said nanda one who keeps the precepts need not think May I be free from regret nanda it is a law of nature that those who keep the precepts will be free from regret nanda one who is without regret need not think

precepts one has no regrets through having no regrets one attains joy through joy one attains rapture through rapture one attains tranquility through tranquility one attains happiness through happiness one attains concentration of the mind nanda through concentration of the mind the learned noble disciple sees and knows things as they really are through seeing and knowing things as they really are he attains disenchantment through disenchantment he attains dispassion through dispassion he attains liberation Through liberation he knows he is liberated Birth has been ended the holy life has been established what was to be done has been done there will not be another existence Thus nanda one state is beneficial for another one state is the means for another and the precepts eventually lead to the highest goal that is to say the crossing over from this bank to the other bank This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words Venerable nanda and the other monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse on Mindfulness  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park At that time the

Venerable Meghiya was his attendant Early one morning Venerable Meghiya put on his robe took his bowl and entered the village of Jatu to beg for food Having finished begging for food he went to the bank of the river Kimikāḷā where he saw a level spot called the Good Mango Grove The water of the Kimikāḷā was pleasant and agreeable from a clear spring and being of gentle flow not too cold and not too warm Seeing this Venerable Meghiya felt joy and thought This is a level spot called the Good Mango Grove Here the water of the Kimikāḷā is pleasant and agreeable from a clear spring and being of gentle flow not too cold and not too warm If a clansman wished to practice striving he should do it in such a place I too have something to strive for perhaps I should practice striving in this secluded place In the afternoon Venerable Meghiya having finished his meal and put away his robe and bowl washed his hands and feet and with his sitting mat on his shoulder approached the Buddha He paid homage at feet sat to one side and said Worldhonored One early this morning I put on my robe took my bowl and entered the village of Jatu to beg for food Having finished begging for food I went to the bank of the river Kimikāḷā where I found a level spot called Good Mango Grove The water of the Kimikāḷā there was pleasant and agreeable from a clear spring and being of gentle flow not too cold and not too warm Seeing this I felt joy and thought b This is a level spot called the Good Mango Grove Here the water of the Kimikāḷā is pleasant and agreeable from a clear spring and being of gentle flow not too cold and not too warm If a clansman wished to practice striving he should do it in such a place I too have something to strive for perhaps I should practice striving in this secluded place Worldhonored One I now wish to go to this secluded mango grove to practice striving  Then the Worldhonored One said Meghiya dont you know I am all by myself here with no attendant  Wait a little until some other monk comes along to serve as my attendant then you can go to that secluded mango grove to practice Three times the venerable Meghiya said Worldhonored One I now wish to go to that secluded mango grove to practice striving And three times the Worldhonored One responded Meghiya dont you know I am all by myself here with no attendant  Wait a little until some other monk comes along to serve as my attendant then you can go to that secluded mango grove to practice Then Meghiya said For the Worldhonored One there is nothing more to do nothing that has to be done nothing that has to be contemplated For me however there is still more to do there is more that has to be done there is more to contemplate Worldhonored One I will go to that secluded mango grove to practice striving The Worldhonored One said Meghiya since you wish to seek striving what else can I say Go Meghiya and do as you wish Venerable Meghiya having heard the Buddhas words accepted them well retained them well and repeated them well He paid homage at the Buddhas feet circumambulated him three times and left He went to the mango grove and having entered it spread out his sitting mat under a tree and sat crosslegged While Venerable Meghiya was sitting in the mango grove three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts arose in him thoughts of desire thoughts of hatred and thoughts of harming Because of this he recalled the Worldhonored One In the late afternoon he rose from sitting in meditation went to the Buddha paid homage at his feet and sat to one side He said  Worldhonored One I went to the mango grove and while I was sitting in that secluded place three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts arose in me thoughts of desire thoughts of hatred and thoughts of harming Because of that I recalled the Worldhonored One The Worldhonored One said Meghiya there are five supporting conditions that are conducive to maturing liberation of the mind that has not yet matured What are the five Meghiya a monk is himself a good friend and associates with good friends keeps the company of good friendsthis Meghiya is the first supporting condition conducive to maturing liberation of the mind that has not yet matured Again Meghiya a monk observes the training in the precepts guards  the code of rules and skillfully controls his comportment  proper conduct seeing great danger in even the slightest transgression and being apprehensive of it Keeping the precepts Meghiya is the second supporting condition conducive to maturing liberation of the mind that has not yet matured Again Meghiya a monk engages in talk about noble meaningful matters matters that cause the mind to become gentle cause it to be without hindrances namely talk about the precepts about concentration wisdom liberation the knowledge and vision that come with liberation talk about selfeffacement about not enjoying socializing about reducing desire about contentment abandoning dispassion extinction sitting in meditation and about dependent origination To obtain in this way the talk appropriate for renunciants fully easily without difficultythis Meghiya is the third supporting condition conducive to maturing liberation of the mind that has not yet matured Again Meghiya a monk makes relentless effort to abandon what is unwholesome and to cultivate all wholesome states He constantly arouses the singleminded and unwavering intention to cultivate wholesome roots without giving up his task This Meghiya is the fourth supporting condition conducive to maturing liberation of the mind that has not yet maturedc Again Meghiya a monk develops comprehension and wisdom attains understanding concerning the rise and fall of phenomena attains noble penetrative knowledge and discriminative understanding concerning the true cessation of suffering This Meghiya is the fifth supporting condition conducive to maturing liberation of the mind that has not yet matured Once endowed with these five supporting conditions should practice further in four ways What are the four ways He practices meditation on impurity in order to cut off desire He practices lovingkindness meditation in order to cut off hatred He practices mindfulness of breathing in order to cut off distracting thoughts He practices perception of impermanence in order to cut off the conceit I am Meghiya if a monk is himself a good friend

attachment and fully awakened His fame will spread and be known in all directions This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse on the Four Continents  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park At that time Venerable nanda who was sitting in meditation in a quiet place reflecting had this thought Very few people in the world are able to fulfill their intentions in regard to sensual pleasures and only few become disenchanted with sensual pleasures by the time they die It is very rare that people in the world are able to fulfill their intentions in regard to sensual pleasures or become disenchanted with sensual pleasures by the time they die Then in the evening Venerable nanda rose from sitting in meditation and approached the Buddha Having arrived there he made obeisance sat down to one side and said Worldhonored One Today sitting in meditation in a quiet place reflecting I had this thought Very few people in the world are able to fulfill their intentions in regard to sensual pleasures and only few become disenchanted b with sensual pleasures by the time they die It is very rare that people in the world are able to fulfill their intentions in regard to sensual pleasures or become disenchanted with sensual pleasures by the time they die The Buddha told nanda That is so That is so Very few people in the world are able to fulfill their intentions in regard to sensual pleasures and only few become disenchanted with sensual pleasures by the time they die It is very rare nanda that people in the world are able to fulfill their intentions in regard to sensual pleasures or become disenchanted with sensual pleasures by the time they die It is extremely rare nanda extremely rare indeed that people in the world are able to fulfill their intentions in regard to sensual pleasures or become disenchanted with sensual pleasures by the time they die On the contrary nanda many people in the world a great many are not able to fulfill their intentions in regard to sensual pleasures and do not become disenchanted with sensual pleasures by the time they die Why is that In the past nanda there was a king called Mandhātu a wheelturning monarch intelligent and wise equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world freely as he liked Being a righteous Dharma king he attained seven treasures Those seven treasures were the wheel treasure the elephant treasure the horse treasure the jewel treasure the woman treasure the steward treasure and the counselor treasurethese were the seven He had a thousand sons handsome brave fearless and able to overcome others He certainly ruled over the whole earth as far as the ocean without relying on blade or cudgel just by teaching the Dharma bringing peace and happiness Then nanda after a very long time King Mandhātu thought c I rule over Jambudīpa which is very wealthy and pleasant with many inhabitants I possess the seven treasures and a thousand sons I wish that it would rain treasures in the palace for seven days until they have accumulated up to my knees  nanda because King Mandhātu was endowed with great supernormal power great and mighty virtue great merit great and mighty power as soon as he had this wishful thought it rained treasures in the palace for seven days until they had accumulated up to his knees Then nanda after a very long time King Mandhātu thought I rule over Jambudīpa which is very wealthy and pleasant with many inhabitants I possess the seven treasures and have a thousand sons and it rained treasures in the palace for seven days until they had accumulated up to my knees I recall having heard from the ancients that there is a continent in the west called Godānī which is very wealthy and pleasant with many inhabitants I now wish to go and see the continent of Godānī Having gone there I will subdue it completely nanda because King Mandhātu was endowed with great supernormal power great and mighty virtue great merit great and mighty power as soon as he had this wishful thought by means of his supernormal power he traveled there through the air along with his fourfold army nanda King Mandhātu soon reached the continent of Godānī and remained there nanda King Mandhātu subdued the continent of Godānī completely and remained there for countless hundreds and thousands of years Then nanda after a very long time King Mandhātu again thought I rule over Jambudīpa which is very wealthy and pleasant with many inhabitants I possess the seven treasures and have a thousand sons and it rained treasures in the palace for seven days until they had accumulated up to my knees I also rule over the continent of Godānī I also recall having heard from the ancients that there is a continent in the east called Pubbavideha which is very wealthy and pleasant with many inhabitants I now wish to go and see the continent of Pubbavideha Having gone there I will subdue it completely  nanda because King Mandhātu was endowed with great supernormal power great and mighty virtue great merit great and mighty power as soon as he had this wishful thought by means of his supernormal power he traveled there through the air along with his fourfold army nanda King Mandhātu soon reached the continent of Pubba videha and remained there nanda King Mandhātu subdued the continent of Pubbavideha completely and remained there for countless hundreds and thousands of years Then nanda after a very long time King Mandhātu again thought a I rule over Jambudīpa which is very wealthy and pleasant with many inhabitants I possess the seven treasures and have a thousand sons and it rained treasures in the palace for seven days until they had accumulated up to my knees I also rule over the continent of Godānī and the continent of Pubbavideha I also recall having heard from the ancients that there is a continent in the north called Uttarakuru very wealthy and pleasant with many inhabitants who have no perception of self and no possessions I now wish to go and see the continent of Uttarakuru along with my retainers Having gone there I will subdue it completely nanda because King Mandhātu was endowed with great supernormal power great and mighty virtue great merit great and mighty power as soon as he had this wishful thought by means of his supernormal power he traveled there through the air along with his fourfold army nanda King Mandhātu saw from afar that the plains were white and said to his courtiers Do you see that the plains of Uttarakuru are white The courtiers answered Yes your majesty We see it The king said further Did you know that that is natural white rice which is the staple food of the people of Uttarakuru You too should eat this food  nanda King Mandhātu also saw from afar that on the continent of Uttarakuru there were various kinds of trees clean excellent decorative and of various colors which were surrounded by a fence He said to his courtiers Do you see that on the continent of Uttarakuru there are various kinds of trees clean excellent decorative and of various colors which are surrounded by a fence The courtiers answered Yes your majesty We see them The king said further Did you know that these trees produce clothes for the people of Uttarakuru The people of Uttarakuru take these clothes and wear them You too should take these clothes and wear them nanda King Mandhātu soon reached the continent of Uttarakuru and remained there nanda King Mandhātu subdued the continent of Uttarakuru completely and remained there for countless hundreds and thousands of years along with his retainers Then nanda after a very long time King Mandhātu again thought I rule over Jambudīpa which is very wealthy and pleasant with many inhabitants I possess the seven treasures and have a thousand sons and it rained treasures in the palace for seven days until they had accumulated up to my knees I also rule over the continent of Godānī the continent of Pubbavideha and the continent of Uttarakuru I also heard from the ancients that there is a heaven called the heaven of the thirtythree I now wish to go and see the heaven of the thirtythree nanda because King Mandhātu was endowed with great supernormal power great and mighty virtue great merit great and mighty power as soon as he had this wishful thought by means of his supernormal power he traveled through the air toward the sunlight along with his fourfold army nanda King Mandhātu saw from afar that in the heaven of the thirtythree on Sumeru king of mountains there was something b resembling a great cloud He said to his courtiers Do you see in the heaven of the thirtythree on Sumeru king of mountains something resembling a great cloud The courtiers answered Yes your majesty We see it The king said further Did you know that that is the coral tree of the thirtythree gods Under this tree the thirtythree gods endowed with the five kinds of sensual pleasures enjoy themselves during the four months of the summer nanda King Mandhātu also saw from afar that in the heaven of the thirtythree on Sumeru king of mountains near its southern side there was something resembling a great cloud He said to his courtiers Do you see in the heaven of the thirtythree on Sumeru king of mountains near its southern side something resembling a great cloud The courtiers answered Yes your majesty We see it The king said further Did you know that that is the Sudhamma Hall of the thirtythree gods In this Sudhamma Hall the thirtythree gods reflect on the Dharma and on its meaning for gods and human beings on the eighth day and the fourteenth fifteenth day  Then nanda King Mandhātu soon reached the heaven of the thirtythree Having reached the heaven of the thirtythree he entered the Sudhamma Hall There Sakka ruler of the gods gave King Mandhātu half of his throne to sit on King Mandhātu then sat on half of the throne of Sakka ruler of the gods Then  King Mandhātu and Sakka ruler of the gods were indistinguishable There was no difference between them in radiance complexion or form there was also no difference in movements mannerisms or clothing The only difference was in regard to the blinking of eyes  Then nanda after a very long time King Mandhātu again thought I rule over Jambudīpa which is very wealthy and pleasant with many inhabitants I possess the seven treasures and have a thousand sons and it rained treasures in the palace for seven days until they had accumulated up to my knees I also rule over the continent of Godānī the continent of Pubbavideha and the continent of Uttarakuru Also I have visited the meeting of the great assembly of the thirtythree gods I have entered the celestial Sudhamma Hall where Sakka ruler of the gods gave me half of his throne to sit on I was able to sit on half of the throne of Sakka ruler of the gods I and Sakka ruler of the gods were indistinguishable There was no difference between us in radiance complexion or form there was also no difference in movements mannerisms or clothing The only difference was in regard to the blinking of eyes I now want to oust Sakka ruler of the gods take over the other half of the throne and become king of gods and human beings freely as I like nanda as soon as King Mandhātu had this wishful thought before he knew it he had fallen back to Jambudīpa lost his supernormal powers and become seriously ill As King Mandhātu was dying his courtiers went to him and said Your majesty if brahmins householders and subjects come and ask us what King Mandhātu said as he was dying how your majesty should we answer these brahmins householders and subjects Then King Mandhātu told the courtiers If brahmins householders and subjects come and ask you what King Mandhātu said as he was dying you should answer like this  King Mandhātu obtained the continent of Jambudīpa his intentions were not fulfilled by the time he died c  King Mandhātu obtained the seven treasures his intentions were not fulfilled by this by the time he died he had a thousand sons his intentions were not fulfilled by this by the time he died for King Mandhātu treasures rained down for seven days his intentions were not fulfilled by this by the time he died King Mandhātu obtained the continent of Godānī his intentions were not fulfilled by this by the time he died King Mandhātu obtained the continent of Pubba videha his intentions were not fulfilled by this by the time he died King Mandhātu obtained the continent of Uttarakuru his intentions were not fulfilled by this by the time he died King Mandhātu visited the assembly of the gods his intentions were not fulfilled by this by the time he died King Mandhātu was endowed with the five kinds of sensual pleasures forms sounds smells flavors and tactile sensations his intentions were not fulfilled by this by the time he died If brahmins householders and subjects come and ask you what King Mandhātu said as he was dying you should answer like this Then the Worldhonored One uttered these verses rains wonderful treasures One who has desire will not be satisfied Desire is suffering devoid of pleasure This the wise should know Even if obtains a mass of gold As great as the Himalaya He will not be satisfied at all Thus the wise reflect gaining the five sublime heavenly sensual pleasures He does not delight in these five A disciple of the Fully Awakened One wishes for the destruction of craving and for nonattachment  Then the Worldhonored One said nanda do you think that King Mandhātu of ancient times was someone other  Do not think so You should know that he was me At that time nanda I wanted to benefit myself to benefit others to benefit many people I had compassion for the whole world and I sought prosperity benefit peace and happiness for gods and human beings The teaching I gave at that time did not lead to the ultimate was not the ultimate purity not the ultimate holy life not the ultimate completion of the holy life At that time I was not able to abandon birth old age disease death sorrow and distress and I was not able to attain liberation from all suffering nanda I have now appeared in this world as a Tathāgata free of attachment fully awakened perfect in knowledge and conduct a Wellgone One a knower of the world unsurpassable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and human beings a buddha a Fortunate One I now benefit myself benefit others benefit many people I have compassion for the whole world and I seek prosperity benefit peace and happiness for gods and human beings The teaching I now give leads to the ultimate is the ultimate purity the ultimate completion of the holy life I have now abandoned birth old age sickness death sorrow and distress I have now attained complete liberation from suffering This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words Venerable nanda and the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse with the Cow Dung Parable  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park At that time a monk who was sitting in meditation reflecting in a quiet place had this thought aIs there any form that is eternal and unchanging is entirely pleasant and exists forever Is there any feeling any perception any volitional formation any consciousness that is eternal and unchanging is entirely pleasant and exists forever Then in the evening that monk rose from sitting in meditation approached the Buddha made obeisance with his head  and sat down to one side He said Worldhonored One today I was sitting in meditation in a quiet place reflecting and I had this thought Is there any material form that is eternal and unchanging is entirely pleasant and exists forever Is there any feeling any perception any volitional formation any consciousness that is eternal and unchanging is entirely pleasant and exists forever The Buddha told the monk There is no material form that is eternal and unchanging is entirely pleasant and exists forever There is no feeling no perception no volitional formation no consciousness that is eternal and unchanging is entirely pleasant and exists forever b Then the Worldhonored One took up a little bit of cow dung with his fingernail and said Monk do you see the little bit of cow dung that I have taken up with my fingernail The monk said Yes Worldhonored One I see it The Buddha further told the monk  there is not even such a small amount of material form that is eternal and unchanging is entirely pleasant and exists forever  there is not even such a small amount of feeling of perception of volitional formations of consciousness that is eternal and unchanging is entirely pleasant and exists forever Why is that Monk I recall how in the distant past I practiced meritorious deeds for a long time Having practiced meritorious deeds for a long time I experienced pleasant results for a long time Monk  in the distant past I had practiced lovingkindness for seven years I did not come to this world for seven cosmic periods of emergence and destruction When the world went to destruction I was born into the heaven of radiance When the world emerged  I descended to take birth in a vacant Brahmā palace Among the Brahmās I was the Great Brahmā being the selfcreated heavenly king over other places for a thousand cosmic periods I was Sakka king of the gods for thirtysix cosmic periods and I was the khattiya king Mandhātu for countless cosmic periods Monk when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu I had eightyfour thousand great elephants equipped with fine chariot equipment decorated with various treasures with white pearls and jade the chief of which was the royal elephant Uposatha Monk when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu I had eightyfour thousand horses equipped with fine chariot equipment decorated with various treasures gold and silver entwined with jade the chief of which was the royal horse Valāhaka Monk when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu I had eightyfour thousand chariots decorated with four kinds of ornaments and various beautiful things such as the hides of lions tigers and leopards woven with decorations of varied colors and various decorations very fast chariots the chief of which was the chariot Vejayanta Monk when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu I had eightyfour thousand cities very large and pleasant with many inhabitants the chief of which was Kusāvatī Monk when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu I had eightyfour thousand multistoried buildings made of four kinds of precious material gold silver beryl and crystal the chief of which was the Su dhamma Hall Monk when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu I had eightyfour thousand thrones made of four kinds of precious materials gold silver beryl and crystal and upholstered with woolen textiles draped with brocades and fine silk fabric with lined and quilted coverlets and with cushions antelope hide at both ends  Monk when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu I had eightyfour thousand suits of clothing clothing of flax clothing of brocade clothing of silk clothing of cotton and clothing of antelope hide Monk when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu I had eightyfour thousand women each with a splendid clear bright fresh body of extraordinary beauty exceeding human  almost divine  dignified beauty that delighted those who saw it adorned with various treasures and necklaces of jade and pearl for dignified decoration pure khattiya women as well as countless women from other castes Monk when I was the khattiya king Mandhātu I had eightyfour thousand kinds of food served day and night constantly for me to eat when I wished Monk of those eightyfour thousand kinds of food there was one that was particularly delicious and fresh with numerous flavors which I often ate Monk of those eightyfour thousand women there was one khattiya woman the most dignified and beautiful who often waited on me Monk of those eightyfour thousand suits of clothes there was one suit of flax or brocade or silk or cotton or antelope hide that I often wore Monk of those eightyfour thousand thrones there was one throne of gold or silver or beryl or crystal upholstered with woolen textiles draped with brocade or fine silk fabric with lined and quilted coverlets and with cushions antelope hide at both ends on which I often sat Monk of those eightyfour thousand multistoried buildings there was one  gold or of silver or of beryl or of crystal called the Sudhamma Hall in which I often stayed Monk of those eightyfour thousand cities there was one very wealthy and pleasant with many inhabitants named Kusāvatī in which I often resided Monk of those eightyfour thousand chariots there was one decorated with various beautiful things such as the hide of lions tigers and leopards woven with designs of varied colors a chariot that was very fast named Vejayanta that I often rode in when visiting pleasure parks c Monk of those eightyfour thousand horses there was one with bluish body and crowlike head the royal horse named Valāhaka that I often rode when visiting pleasure parks Monk of those eightyfour thousand elephants there was one whose entire body was very white and whose seven parts were perfect the royal elephant named Uposatha that I often rode when visiting pleasure parks Monk I thought The fruit and result of what kinds of action have caused me to be endowed today with great supernormal power great and mighty virtue great merit great and mighty power Monk again I thought The fruits and results of three kinds of action cause me to be endowed today with great supernormal power great and mighty virtue great merit great and mighty power The first is charitable giving the second selfdiscipline and the third restraint All of that the whole of it ceased to be The supernormal power too was lost What do you think monk Is material form permanent or impermanent answered It is impermanent Worldhonored One asked further If it is impermanent is it suffering or not suffering answered It is suffering it changes Worldhonored One asked further If it is impermanent suffering and subject to change would a learned noble disciple take it as This I am this is mine or I belong to that answered No Worldhonored One asked further What do you think monk Are feeling perception volitional formations and consciousness permanent or impermanent answered They are impermanent Worldhonored One a  asked further If they are impermanent are they suffering or not suffering answered They are suffering since they change Worldhonored One asked further If they are impermanent suffering and subject to change would a learned noble disciple take them as This I am this is mine or I belong to that answered No Worldhonored One Therefore monk you should train like this Whatever there is of material form whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle good or bad near or farall that should be seen as it really is with wisdom thus all that I am not that is not mine I do not belong to that Whatever there is of feeling  of perception  of volitional formations  of consciousness whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle good or bad near or farall that should be seen as it really is with wisdom thus all that I am not that is not mine I do not belong to that If monk a learned noble disciple contemplates in this way he becomes disenchanted with material form he becomes disenchanted with feeling perception volitional formations and consciousness Being disenchanted he becomes dispassionate Having become dispassionate he is liberated Having been liberated he knows that he is liberated He knows as it really is Birth is ended the holy life has been established what was to be done has been done There will not be another existence Then that monk having heard what the Buddha said received it well and kept it  He rose from his seat paid respect with his head at the Buddhas feet circumambulated him three times and departed Having received the Buddhas instruction that monk lived alone in a secluded place and practiced diligently without negligence Having lived  alone in a secluded place and practiced diligently without negligencehe attained fully the summit of the holy life for the sake of which a clansman shaves off his hair and beard dons the yellow robe leaves home out of faith and goes forth to practice the path In that very life he personally attained understanding and awakening and dwelled having personally realized He knew as it really was Birth is ended the holy life has been established what was to be done has been done There will not be another existence Thus that monk having understood the Dharma  became an arahant This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse on King Bimbisāra Meeting the Buddha  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha who was staying in the country of Magadha with a large company of monksa thousand monks all free of attachment having attained the truth former mattedhair asceticswas approaching Rājagaha a city of Magadha Then the king of Magadha Bimbisāra heard that the Worldhonored One who was dwelling in the country of Magadha with a large company of monksa thousand monks all free of attachment having attained the truth former mattedhair asceticshad come to Rājagaha a city of Magadha Having heard that Bimbisāra king of Magadha assembled his fourfold army that is elephant troops cavalry chariot troops and infantry Having assembled his fourfold army he went to visit the Buddha accompanied by countless people one league in length Then the Worldhonored One seeing from afar that Bimbisāra king of Magadha was coming left the road and went to a wellestablished royal banyan tree placed his sitting mat beneath it and sat down crosslegged together with the company of monks Bimbisāra king of Magadha saw from afar the Worldhonored One among the trees of the forest dignified and beautiful like the moon amidst the stars with radiant aura shining like a golden mountain endowed with handsome appearance and lofty dignity with sense faculties calm free of b c obstruction accomplished and disciplined with his mind calm and quiet Seeing this  descended from his chariot Like any khattiya king who has been the sprinkling of water on his head who is the lord of his people and reigns over the entire land he was equipped with the five royal insignia first a sword second a parasol third a royal headdress fourth a fly whisk with bejeweled handle and fifth ornate sandals Having put aside all of these and left the fourfold army behind he approached the Buddha on foot Arriving there he made obeisance and three times announced his name Worldhonored One I am the king of Magadha Seniya Bimbisāra this three times Then the Worldhonored One said Great king indeed indeed you are Seniya Bimbisāra king of Magadha Then Seniya Bimbisāra king of Magadha having announced his name three times made obeisance to the Buddha and sat down to one side Some among the citizens of Magadha made obeisance at the Buddhas feet and then sat down to one side some exchanged greetings with the Buddha and then sat down to one side some saluted the Buddha with palms placed together and then sat down to one side and some having seen the Buddha from afar sat down silently At that time Venerable Uruvela Kassapa was sitting among the company  Venerable Uruvela Kassapa was well remembered by the citizens of Magadha being reckoned by them as a great and venerable teacher and a True Person free of attachment Then the citizens of Magadha thought Does the renunciant Gotama train in the holy life under Uruvela Kassapa or does Uruvela Kassapa train in the holy life under the renunciant Gotama At that time the Worldhonored One knowing what the citizens of Magadha were thinking recited a verse to Venerable Uruvela Kassapa Uruvela  what did you see That you stopped fire and came here Tell me Kassapa Why do you no longer the fire sacrifice  I worshiped fire out of desire For food and drink of various flavors the vision of the middle arose like this Therefore I no longer delighted in sacrifices Kassapa your mind did not delight In food and drink of various flavors Tell me Kassapa Why did you not delight in a dweller in the heavens seeing quiescence cessation And the unconditioned I do not desire existence Least of all the revered heavens Therefore I no longer perform the fire sacrifice The Worldhonored One is supreme The Worldhonored One has no wrong thought He has realized and awakened to all things I have accepted supreme Dharma Then the Worldhonored One said Kassapa you should now display supernormal powers in order to arouse faith and delight in the assembly Then Venerable Uruvela Kassapa performed a supernatural feat such that he disappeared from his seat and appeared in the east soaring through the air while displaying the four postures of which the first is walking the second standing the third sitting and the fourth is reclining Again he entered concentration on the fire  Once Venerable Uruvela Kassapa had entered concentration on the fire  there emerged from his body flames of various colors blue yellow red and white and amid them clear water When fire emerged from the lower part of his body water emerged from the upper part of his body when fire emerged from the upper part of his body water emerged from the lower part of his body a In the same way in the south  in the west  in the north soaring through the air while displaying the four postures of which the first is walking the second standing the third sitting and the fourth is reclining Again he entered concentration on the fire  Once Venerable Uruvela Kassapa had entered concentration on the fire  there emerged from his body flames of various colors blue yellow red and white and amid them clear water When fire emerged from the lower part of his body water emerged from the upper part of his body when fire emerged from the upper part of his body water emerged from the lower part of his body Then Venerable Uruvela Kassapa having completed his supernatural feat made obeisance to the Buddha and said Worldhonored One the Buddha is my master I am the disciple of the Buddha The Buddha has allencompassing knowledge I do not have allencompassing knowledge Then the Worldhonored One said So it is Kassapa so it is Kassapa I have allencompassing knowledge you do not have allencompassing knowledge At that time Venerable Uruvela Kassapa recited a verse about himself In the past when I was ignorant I sacrificed to fire in order to be liberated Though old I was like one born blind I had wrong and did not see the ultimate truth Now I see the superior path Taught by the supreme nāga The unconditioned final liberation from suffering When that is seen birth and death are ended Having witnessed this the citizens of Magadha thought The renunciant Gotama does not train in the holy life under Uruvela Kassapa Uruvela Kassapa trains in the holy life under the renunciant Gotama  The Worldhonored One knowing the thoughts of the citizens of Magadha then taught the Dharma to Seniya Bimbisāra king of Magadha exhorting encouraging and delighting him Having with countless skillful means taught him the Dharma having exhorted encouraged and delighted him as all buddhas do when first teaching the true Dharma to delight their hearers he taught him about generosity virtue rebirth in heaven the disadvantages of sensual desire and the defilement of birth and death extolling the excellence of dispassion and the purity of the constituents of the path The Worldhonored One gave the great king teachings The Buddha knew that mind was delighted prepared malleable able to endure uplifted onepointed free of doubt free of the hindrances the ability and power to receive the true Dharma in accordance with the essential teaching of all buddhas The Worldhonored One then taught him about suffering its arising its cessation and the path  Great king material form arises and ceases You should know the arising and ceasing of material form Great king feeling  perception  volitional formations  consciousness arises and ceases You should know the arising and ceasing of consciousness Great king just as when it rains heavily bubbles arise and cease on the water surface so great king is the arising and ceasing of material form You should know the arising and ceasing of material form Great king feeling  perception  volitional formations  consciousness arises and ceases You should know the arising and ceasing of consciousness Great king if a clansman knows the arising and ceasing of material form then he knows that there will not be a rearising of material form in the future Great king if a clansman knows the arising and ceasing of feeling  perception  volitional formations  consciousness then he knows that there will not be a rearising of consciousness in the future Great king if a clansman knows material form as it really is then he does not become attached to material form does not  speculate about material form does not become defiled material form does not dwell on material form and does not delight in material form as I am this Great king if a clansman knows feeling  perception  volitional formations  consciousness as it really is then he does not become attached to consciousness does not speculate about consciousness does not become defiled consciousness does not dwell on consciousness and does not delight in consciousness as I am this Great king if a clansman does not become attached to material form does not speculate about material form does not become defiled material form does not dwell on material form and does not delight in material form as I am this then he will no longer cling to material form in the future Great king if a clansman does not become attached to feeling  to perception  to volitional formations  to consciousness does not speculate about consciousness does not become defiled consciousness does not dwell on consciousness and does not delight in consciousness as I am this then he will no longer cling to consciousness in the future Great king such a clansman has become immeasurable inestimable unlimited He has attained stillness If he has become detached from these five aggregates he will not again cling to any aggregate b Then the citizens of Magadha thought If material form is impermanent if feeling  perception  volitional formations  consciousness is impermanent then who lives and who experiences suffering and happiness The Worldhonored One knowing the thoughts of the citizens of Magadha told the monks An ignorant worldling one who is not learned regards himself as I am a self and is attached to that self However there is no self there is nothing that belongs to a self is empty of a self and empty of anything that belongs to a self When phenomena arise they arise  when phenomena cease they cease All this is a combination of causes and conditions giving rise to suffering If the causes and conditions were not present then all suffering would cease It is because of the combination of causes and conditions that living beings continue and all phenomena arise The Tathāgata having seen all living beings continuously arising declares There is birth and there is death With the divine eye which is purified and surpasses human  I see beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly excellent or not excellent as they come and go between good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their deeds I see this as it really is If these living beings were ill behaved in body speech and mind if they reviled noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions wrong views then because of these causes and conditions at the breaking up of the body after death they will certainly go to a bad realm of existence being born in hell If these living beings were well behaved in body speech and mind if they did not revile noble ones held right views and undertook actions right views then because of these causes and conditions at the breaking up of the body after death they will certainly go to a good realm of existence to a heavenly realm Knowing that it is thus for them I do not say to them It is the self that can feel can talk that gives teachings that undertakes development that teaches development that experiences the fruits of good or evil actions here and there Herein some may think This does not match this cannot stand these processes take place in accordance with Dharma Because of this that arises if this cause is not present that does not arise Because this exists that exists if this ceases that ceases That is to say with ignorance as condition there are volitional formations  with birth as condition there are old age and death If ignorance ceases volitional formations cease if birth ceases old age and death cease Great king what do you think Is material form permanent or impermanent c answered It is impermanent Worldhonored One  asked again If it is impermanent is it suffering or not suffering answered It is suffering it changes Worldhonored One asked again If it is impermanent suffering and subject to change does a learned noble disciple take it as This I am this is mine I belong to that answered No Worldhonored One  Great king what do you think Is feeling  is perception  are volitional formations  is consciousness permanent or impermanent answered It is impermanent Worldhonored One asked again If it is impermanent is it suffering or not suffering answered It is suffering it changes Worldhonored One asked again If it is impermanent suffering and subject to change does a learned noble disciple take it as Whatever material form there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle good or bad far or near all that I am not all that is not mine and I do not belong to that You should wisely contemplate it and know it as it really is Great king Whatever feeling  perception  volitional formations  consciousness there is whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle good or bad far or near all that I am not all that is not mine and I do not belong to that You should wisely contemplate it and know it as it really is Great king if a learned noble disciple contemplates in this way then he becomes disenchanted with material form disenchanted with  feeling  with perception  with volitional formations  with consciousness Having become disenchanted he becomes dispassionate Having become dispassionate he attains liberation Having attained liberation he knows that he is liberated He knows as it really is Birth is ended the holy life has been established what was to be done has been done There will not be another existence As the Buddha delivered this teaching Seniya Bimbisāra king of Magadha became free of defilements and to all phenomena the Dharma eye arose  and eighty thousand gods and twelve thousand citizens of Magadha became free of defilements and to all phenomena the Dharma eye arose  Then Seniya Bimbisāra king of Magadha saw the Dharma attained the Dharma realized the perfectly pure Dharma he discarded doubt overcame perplexity he would take no other teacher would never again follow another he was without uncertainty Having attained the fruit of realization and attained unshakeability in the Dharma of the Worldhonored One rose from his seat made obeisance at the Buddhas feet and said Worldhonored One I now take refuge in the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks May the Worldhonored One please receive me as a lay follower from this day on until life ends I take refuge for my whole life This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words Seniya Bimbisāra king of Magadha eighty thousand gods twelve thousand citizens of Magadha and a thousand monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse at Vebhaḷiṅga  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying in the country of Kosala At that time the Worldhonored One was walking on a road together with a large company

attachment and fully awakened felt free he wished at our home Delighted he sat down crosslegged with calm and quiet mind and remained so for seven days His delight continued for fifteen days and his parents also experienced joy and happiness for seven days Again great king I recall that in the past I was spending the rains retreat in dependence on the town of Vebhaḷiṅga Great king at that time my newly built hut had not yet been roofed in The old potter hut of Nandipāla the potter had been newly roofed in Great king I told my attendant monks Go and demolish the the old potter hut of Nandipāla the potter and bring it to roof my hut Then the attendant monks following my instruction went to the home of Nandipāla the potter demolished the old potter hut bound it together and brought it to roof my hut The parents of Nandipāla the potter heard the of the old potter hut being demolished Hearing it they asked Who is demolishing the old potter hut of Nandipāla the potter The attendant monks answered Elders we are the attendant monks of the Tathāgata Kassapa free from attachment and fully awakened We are demolishing the old potter hut of Nandipāla the potter binding it together and taking it in order to roof the hut of the Tathāgata Kassapa free from attachment and fully awakened The parents of Nandipāla the potter said Venerable ones take away whatever you wish without limitation Later when Nandipāla the potter returned home and discovered that the  the old potter hut had been demolished he asked his parents Who has demolished of my old potter hut His parents answered Good son today the attendant monks of the Tathāgata Kassapa free from attachment and fully awakened c demolished  the old potter hut bound it together and took it away to roof the hut of the Tathāgata Kassapa free from attachment and fully awakened Hearing this Nandipāla the potter thought It is an excellent benefit a great merit for us that the Tathāgata Kassapa free from attachment and fully awakened felt free he wished at our home Delighted he sat down crosslegged with calm and quiet mind and remained so for seven days His joy and happiness continued for fifteen days and his parents also experienced joy and happiness for seven days Great king the old potter hut of Nandipāla the potter was not affected by rain for the entire four months of that rainy season Why was that Because it was covered by the mighty power of a Buddha Great king Nandipāla the potter was able to bear it did not dislike it and had no grief or distress in his heart  The Tathāgata Kassapa free from attachment and fully awakened felt free he wished at our home You great king could not bear it and did dislike it and you had great grief and distress in your heart  The Tathāgata Kassapa free from attachment and fully awakened together with the company of monks does not accept my invitation to spend the rains retreat here in Benares Then the Tathāgata Kassapa free from attachment and fully awakened taught the Dharma to King Kiki exhorting encouraging and delighting him Having with countless skillful means taught him the Dharma having exhorted encouraged and delighted him rose from his seat and departed Then not long after the Tathāgata Kassapa free from attachment and fully awakened had left King Kiki told his attendants Fill five hundred chariots with white rice and food of various flavors similar to what a king eats take them to the home of Nandipāla the potter and tell him Nandipāla King Kiki sends these five hundred chariots of white rice and food of various flavors similar to what a king eats to be offered to you You should accept them now out of compassion  Then the attendants having received these instructions of the king filled five hundred chariots with white rice and food of various flavors similar to what a king eats took them to the home of Nandipāla the potter and told him Nandipāla King Kiki sends these five hundred chariots of white rice and food of various flavors similar to what a king eats to be offered to you You should accept them now out of compassion Then Nandipāla the potter politely declined and did not accept  telling the attendants Noble friends in King Kikis household and country there are many great affairs which require vast expense Knowing this I do not accept  a The Buddha said to nanda What do you think Do you think that the young brahmin Uttara was someone other  Do not think so You should know that he was me At that time nanda I wanted to benefit myself to benefit others to benefit many people I had compassion for the whole world and I sought prosperity benefit peace and happiness for gods and human beings In the teaching taught at that time I did not reach the ultimate the ultimate purity the ultimate holy life the ultimate completion of the holy life At that time I was not able to abandon birth old age disease death sorrow and distress and I was not able to attain liberation from all suffering nanda I have now appeared in this world as a Tathāgata free of attachment fully awakened perfect in knowledge and conduct a Wellgone One a knower of the world unsurpassable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and human beings a Buddha a Fortunate One I now benefit myself benefit others benefit many people I have compassion for the whole world and I seek prosperity benefit peace and happiness for gods and human beings The teaching I now give leads to the ultimate is the ultimate purity the ultimate completion of the holy life I have now abandoned birth  old age sickness death sorrow and distress I have now attained complete liberation from suffering This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the venerable nanda and the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse on the Divine Messengers  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park At that time the Worldhonored One addressed the monks With the divine eye which is purified and surpasses human  I see beings as they die and as they are reborn handsome or ugly excellent or not excellent as they come and go between good or bad realms of existence in accordance

causes and conditions at the breaking up of the body after death they certainly are reborn in a bad realm of existence in hell If these beings were well conducted in body speech and mind did not revile noble ones held right views and performed actions right views then because of these causes and conditions at the breaking up of the body after death they certainly are reborn in a good realm of

unfilial to his parents did not respect renunciants and brahmins did not behave honestly did not do meritorious acts and was not afraid of the results that evil deeds bring in the next life then

the wardens of hell The wardens of hell take hold of him and put him into the great hell with four gates recited a verse It has four columns and four gates Its twelve sides are surrounded by Walls made of iron Above it is covered with an iron  Inside the hell the floor is of iron Iron all ablaze with flames and fire It is immeasurable leagues in depth Reaching to the bottom of the earth extremely harsh unbearable The light of its fire is hard to look at Seeing it ones body hairs stand on end Out of fear and terror of this great suffering  reborn in hell Descends head over heels reviled noble ones Who are disciplined well purified a time after a very long period when for the sake of those beings the eastern gate of the great hell with four gates opens After the eastern gate has opened those beings rush towards it seeking a safe place a refuge countless hundreds and thousands of beings have gathered there the eastern gate of the hell closes again on its own The  inside experience extreme suffering weeping and wailing lying on the ground in utter despair yet they are unable to die until their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted Again a very

of beings have gathered there the northern gate of the hell closes again on its own The inside experience extreme suffering weeping and wailing lying on the ground in utter despair yet they are unable to die until their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted Again after a very long period those beings emerge from the great hell with four gates After in the great hell With four gates they appear in the hell with a high peak which is burning with fire within not smoke or flames They are forced to walk on it to walk to and fro and round and round The skin flesh and blood of their two feet disappears when they put their feet down but it reappears and becomes as before once they lift their feet up They are punished in this way for countless hundreds and thousands of years enduring extreme pain yet they are unable to die until their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted Again after a very long period those beings emerge from the great hell with a high peak After in the great hell with a high peak they appear in the great hell of excrement which is filled with excrement countless thousands of feet deep Those beings all fall into it Inside the great hell of excrement there appear numerous worms called lingqulai with white body black head and a needlelike mouth These worms gnaw into the feet of those beings and devour them Having devoured the feet they gnaw into and devour the calf bones Having devoured the calf bones they gnaw into and devour the thigh bones Having devoured the thigh bones they gnaw into and devour the hip bones Having devoured the hipbones they gnaw into and devour the back bonesa Having devoured the back bones they gnaw into and devour the shoulder bones the neck bones and the skull Having devoured the skull they eat the brain Those beings are tormented in this way for countless hundreds and thousands of years enduring extreme pain yet they are unable to die until their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted Again after a very long period those beings emerge from the great hell of excrement After in the great hell of excrement they appear in the great hell of the ironleaved forest Having seen it those beings have an impression of coolness and they think Let us go there quickly to cool down Those beings go toward  seeking a safe place a refuge Then the countless hundreds and thousands of beings that have gathered enter the great hell of the ironleaved forest In the great hell of the ironleaved Forest a great hot wind blows from the four directions After the blowing of the hot wind the iron leaves fall When the iron leaves fall they cut the hands the feet or the hands and feet they cut the ears the nose or the ears and nose as well as other limbs have their bodies cut and smeared with blood for countless hundreds and thousands of years enduring extreme pain yet they are unable to die until their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted Again in the great hell of the ironleaved forest there appear giant dogs with very long fangs They bite those beings tearing off their skin from foot to head and eating it or tearing off their skin from

swallow them split the skull with their beak and take out the brain and eat it Those beings are tormented in this way for countless hundreds and thousands of b years enduring extreme pain yet they are unable to die until their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted Again after a very long period those beings emerge from the great hell of the ironleaved forest After  in the great hell of the ironleaved forest they appear in the great hell of the iron swordtree forest Those great iron swordtrees are one league high and have thorns some six feet long Those beings are made to climb up and down them When they climb up the trees the thorns turn downward When they climb down the trees the thorns turn upward The thorns of the swordtrees pierce those beings piercing their hands their feet or their hands and feet piercing their ears their nose or their ears and nose as well as the other limbs have their bodies pierced and smeared with blood for countless hundreds and thousands of years enduring extreme pain yet they are unable to die until their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted Again after a very long period those beings emerge from the great hell of the iron swordtree forest After in the great hell of the iron swordtree forest they appear by the caustic river which has very high banks surrounded everywhere by thorns The caustic water is boiling and very dark Seeing this those beings have the impression that this is cool water  There will be cool water Having this impression they think Let us go there bathe in it and drink as we please to quickly cool down and be at ease Those beings competing with one another run toward  and enter it seeking a pleasant place a refuge Then the countless hundreds and thousands of beings that have gathered there fall into the caustic river Having fallen into the caustic river they are swept downstream or swept upstream or swept downstream and upstream As those beings are swept downstream swept upstream or swept downstream and upstream their skin is cooked and peels off their flesh is cooked and peels off their skin and flesh are cooked and peel off only the skeleton remains On both banks of the caustic river there are wardens of hell holding swords big clubs  and iron hooks in their hands When those beings want to climb up on to the bank the wardens of hell push them back again Again on both banks of the caustic river there are wardens of hell holding hooks and nets in their hands With the hooks they pull those beings out of the caustic river and put them on the ground of redhot iron burning glowing and all ablaze They lift those beings up and then throw them on the ground  roll them the ground and ask them Where do you come from Those beings answer We do not know where we come from but we are now suffering from great hunger Those wardens of hell then put those beings on a bed of redhot iron which is burning glowing and all ablaze forcing them to sit on it They open their mouths with redhot iron pincers and put redhot iron balls burning brightly and all ablaze into their mouths Those redhot iron balls burn the lips Having burned the lips they burn the tongue Having burned the tongue they burn the palate Having burned the palate they burn the throat Having burned the throat they burn the heart Having burned the heart they burn the large intestine Having burned the large intestine they burn the small intestine Having burned the small intestine they burn the stomach Having burned the stomach they come out from the lower part of the body Those are tormented in this way for countless hundreds and thousands of years enduring extreme pain yet they are unable to die until their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted Again the wardens of hell ask those beings Where do you want to go Those beings answer We do not know where we want to go but we are suffering from great thirst The wardens of hell then put those beings on

heart Having burned the heart it burns the large intestine Having c burned the large intestine it burns the small intestine Having burned the small intestine it burns the stomach Having burned the stomach it comes out from the lower part of the body The are tormented in this way for countless hundreds and thousands of years enduring extreme pain yet they are unable to die until their evil and unwholesome actions have been completely exhausted If those beings in hell have not completely exhausted their evil and unwholesome actions have not exhausted all of it have not exhausted it without any remainder then those beings again fall into the caustic river are again up and down the in the great hell of the iron swordtree forest have to again enter the great hell of the ironleaved forest fall again into the great hell of excrement are again made to walk to and fro in the great hell with a high peak and again have to enter the great hell with four gates If those beings in hell have completely exhausted their evil and unwholesome actions exhausted all of it exhausted it without any remainder then some of those beings proceed to the beasts some fall into the hungry ghosts and some are reborn in a heavenly realm If a being was formerly a human who was unfilial to his parents who had no respect for renunciants and brahmins behaved dishonestly did no meritorious acts and was not afraid of the results that evil deeds bring in the next lifethen such a being experiences such undesirable inconceivably unpleasant and painful results as in those hells If a being was formerly a human who was filial to his parents who had respect for renunciants and brahmins behaved honestly did meritorious acts and was afraid of the results that evil deeds bring in the next lifethen such a being experiences such desirable conceivably pleasant and happy results as in a heavenly palace in the sky In the past King Yama made the following aspiration in his pleasure park when this life ends may I be reborn in the human realm If there are very wealthy and prosperous clans with immeasurable wealth and possessing in abundance all kinds of livestock a property feudatories and manorsthat is a great clan of khattiya householders a great clan of brahmin householders or a great clan of merchant householders or any other such very wealthy and prosperous clan with immeasurable wealth and possessing in abundance all kinds of livestock property feudatories and manorsmay I be reborn in such a family Having been born there may I develop my faculty of understanding and may I gain pure confidence in the true Dharma and discipline taught by a Tathāgata Having gained pure confidence may I shave off hair and beard don the robes of a monk leave the household life out of faith and go forth to practice the path as a clansman who shaves off his hair and beard dons the robes of a monk leaves home out of faith and goes forth to practice the path  to establish the unsurpassable holy life in that very life personally attain understanding and awakening and dwell having personally realized it knowing as it really is Birth is ended the holy life has been established what was to be done has been done There will not be another existence In the past King Yama had made this aspiration in his pleasure park and he recited these verses He is reckoned as hindered by harmful desires Reprimanded by the divine messengers A truly superior person Will not be negligent again the welltaught wonderful noble Dharma Seeing clinging causes him to be fearful And to aspire to the extinction of birth and old age free of clinging extinguished it without remainder That is the end of birth and old age That attains the happiness of peace  Attains cessation in this lifetime Transcending all that is fearful And crossing over this worldly stream b This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse with the Raven Parable  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary At that time the Worldhonored One addressed the monks In the past when a wheelturning monarch wanted to test his jeweltreasure he assembled his fourfold army that is elephant troops cavalry chariot troops and infantry The fourfold army having been assembled in the dark of night at midnight a tall banner was raised the jewel was placed on top of it and it was taken out to the pleasure park The brilliance of the jewel illuminated the fourfold army and its light extended over an area measuring half a league in direction At that time there was a brahmin who had this thought I would like to go and see the wheelturning monarch together with his fourfold army and look at the beryl jewel Then that brahmin thought again For the time being never mind about visiting the wheelturning monarch with his fourfold army and looking at the beryl jewel I would rather go into the forest So the brahmin approached the forest Having arrived there he entered and went to the foot of a tree Not long after he had sat down an otter came by Seeing it the brahmin asked Welcome otter where are you coming from and where do you want to go answered Brahmin in earlier times this pond was fed to the brim by a clear spring had many lotus roots and flowers and was full of fish and turtles I formerly in dependence on it but now it has dried up Brahmin you should know that I want to leave it to live in a large river I want to leave now I am afraid of people  Then having had this exchange with the brahmin the otter left The brahmin sitting there as before Again there came a jiumu bird Seeing it the brahmin asked Welcome jiumu bird where are you coming from and where do you want to go answered Brahmin in earlier times this pond was fed to the brim by a clear spring had many lotus roots and flowers and was full of fish and turtles I formerly in dependence on it but now it has dried up Brahmin you should know that I want to leave it to nest in a place where dead cattle are collected and to live in dependence on it  or dead donkeys  or to nest in a place where dead human beings are collected and to live in dependence on it I want to leave now I am afraid of people Having had this exchange with the brahmin the jiumu bird left The brahmin sitting there as before Again there came a vulture Seeing it the brahmin asked Welcome vulture where are you coming from and where do you want to go answered Brahmin I am going from one large grave to another large grave places for harmed and killed I now want to feed on the flesh of dead elephants dead horses dead cattle and dead human beings I want to leave now I am afraid of people Then having had this exchange with the brahmin the vulture left The brahmin sitting there as before Again there came a bird that feeds on vomit Seeing it the brahmin asked Welcome bird that feeds on vomit where are you coming from and where do you want to go answered Brahmin did you see the vulture just now I eat its vomit I want to leave now I am afraid of people Having had this exchange with the brahmin the bird that feeds on vomit left The brahmin sitting there as before Again there came a jackal Having seen it the brahmin asked Welcome jackal where are you coming from and where do you want to go c answered Brahmin I am going from one deep ravine to another deep ravine from one dense jungle to another dense jungle and from one secluded place to another secluded place I now want to feed on the flesh of dead elephants dead horses dead cattle and dead human beings I want to leave now I am afraid of people Then having had this exchange with the brahmin the jackal left The brahmin sitting there as before Again there came a raven Seeing it the brahmin asked Welcome raven where are you coming from and where do you want to go answered Brahmin you crazy person why do you ask me Where are you coming from and where do you want to go Then having reprimanded the brahmin to his face the raven left Having seen it the brahmin asked Welcome ape where are you coming from and where do you want to go answered Brahmin I am going from one garden to another garden from one pleasure park to another pleasure park from one forest to another forest to drink at clear springs and eat good fruits I want to leave now I am not afraid of people Having had this exchange with the brahmin the ape left The Buddha told the monks a I have delivered these parables and want to understand their meaning You should know that this teaching has a meaning What is the meaning of the parable I delivered Then having had this exchange with the brahmin the otter left Suppose there is a monk who lives in dependence on a village or town At dawn this monk puts on his robes takes his bowl and enters the village to beg for food without protecting himself without guarding his sense faculties without establishing right mindfulness He nevertheless teaches the Dharma as taught by the Buddha or by one of disciples Because of this he obtains the benefit of clothing and bedding food and drink bed and mattress and medicine He is  supplied with all to live Having obtained these benefits he becomes attached to them seduced by them not seeing the danger in them unable to relinquish them using them as he wishes That monk practices bad conduct develops unwholesome states goes to extremes and gives rise to harm and decay He is not living the holy life yet claims holy life He is not a renunciant yet claims a renunciant seeing the otter the brahmin asked Welcome otter where are you coming from and where do you want to go answered Brahmin in earlier times this pond was fed to the brim by a clear spring had many lotus roots and flowers and was full of fish and turtles I formerly in dependence on it but now it has dried up Brahmin you should know that I want to leave it to live in a large river I now want to leave I am afraid of people The monk I spoke of is just like that is immersed in evil unwholesome and defiled states that are the origin of future existence and have vexation and suffering as their fruit being the

ask Venerable friend where are you dwelling Then he answers Venerable friends I am dwelling in dependence on suchandsuch a poor village or town Hearing this the monks think This venerable one

tastes and have tastes to be savored by their mouths who beg and demand again and again Hearing this those monks think This venerable one practices what is difficult to practice Why is that This

parable I delivered  Then having had this exchange with the brahmin the ape left Suppose there is a monk who lives in dependence on a village or town At dawn this monk puts on his robes takes his bowl and enters the village to beg for food with his body protected with his sense faculties guarded and with right mindfulness established Having returned from begging for food in the village or town and having finished his meal put away his robe and bowl and washed his hands and feet in the afternoon he puts his sitting mat on his shoulder and goes to a secluded place to the root of a tree or to an empty hut He arranges his sitting mat and sits down crosslegged keeping his body straight with right intention with mindfulness not scattered eliminates covetousness and has no avarice in his mind On seeing anothers wealth and means of livelihood he does not give rise to covetousness  I wish I could get  he purifies his mind of covetousness Likewise  hatred  sloth and torpor  restlessness and worry  eliminates doubt and transcends perplexity in regard to wholesome states he purifies his mind of doubt Having cut off these five hindrances the imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom having abandoned desires and evil and unwholesome states   he dwells having attained the fourth absorption When he has attained concentration in this way his mind being purified without blemish free of vexation malleable well established having attained imperturbability he directs his mind to the realization of the higher knowledge of the destruction of the taints He then knows as it really is This is suffering He knows as it really is This is the arising of suffering This is the cessation of suffering This is the path the cessation of suffering He knows as it really is These are the taints This is the arising of the taints This is the cessation of the taints This is the path the cessation of the taints He knows it like this Seeing it like this his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of existence and from the taint of ignorance  Being liberated he knows that he is liberated and he knows as it really is Birth is ended the holy life has been established what was to be done has been done There will not be another existence It is as  seeing the ape the brahmin asked Welcome ape where are you coming from and where do you want to go answered Brahmin I am going from one garden to another garden from one pleasure park to another pleasure park from one forest to another forest to drink at clear springs and eat good fruits I now want to leave I am not afraid of people The monk I spoke of is just like that Therefore monks do not act like that otter do not act like that jiumu  do not act like that vulture do not act like that bird that feeds on vomit do not act like that jackal do not act like that raven should act like that ape Why is that In this world a True Person without attachment is like that ape c This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse on Origins  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Benares in the Deer Park the Place of Seers At that time the monks were seated together in the assembly hall after the midday meal on account of some small matter and had the following discussion Venerable friends what do you say Which is better for a lay followerthat a monk who keeps the precepts of the sublime Dharma and is endowed with imposing deportment should enter his house to receive food or that he material benefits a hundred a thousand or ten thousand times each day A certain monk said Venerable friends what is the use of material benefits a hundred a thousand or ten thousand times Only this is important namely that a monk who keeps the precepts of the sublime Dharma and is endowed  with imposing deportment should enter his house to receive food not that  material benefits a hundred a thousand or ten thousand times each day At that time Venerable Anuruddha was seated among the assembly Then the Venerable Anuruddha addressed the monks Venerable friends what is the use of material benefits a hundred a thousand or ten thousand times or more than that Only this is important namely that a monk who keeps the precepts of the sublime Dharma and is endowed with imposing deportment should enter his house to receive food not  material benefits a hundred a thousand or ten thousand times a day Why is that I recall how in the distant past I was a poor man in this country of Benares I relied on gleaning to earn my living At that time the country of Benares was afflicted by drought early frost and locusts so did not ripen The people suffered from famine and almsfood was difficult to obtain At that time there was a paccekabuddha named Upariṭṭha who was living in dependence on Benares Then when the night was over at dawn the paccekabuddha Upariṭṭha put on his robes took his bowl and went into Benares to beg for food At that time in the morning I was going out of Benares to glean Venerable friends as I was going out I saw the paccekabuddha Upariṭṭha coming in Then the pacceka buddha Upariṭṭha having come in carrying an empty bowl went out with the bowl empty as before Venerable friends at that time I was returning to Benares from gleaning and saw the paccekabuddha Upariṭṭha going out again Seeing me he thought As I was coming in at dawn I saw this person going out now as I am going out I see this person again coming in This person may not yet have had his meal Let me now follow this person Then the paccekabuddha followed me like a shadow following a form Venerable friends when I had got back home with my gleanings I put down what I had gathered and turning around I saw that the a paccekabuddha Upariṭṭha had been following me like a shadow following a form Seeing him I thought As I was going out at dawn I saw this seer entering the city to beg for food Now this seer may not yet have obtained any food Let me forgo my own meal and give it to this seer Thinking this I gave my meal to the paccekabuddha saying Seer you should know that this food is my portion May you accept it out of compassion Then the paccekabuddha replied to me saying Householder you should know that this year is afflicted by drought early frost and locusts the five crops do not ripen The people are suffering from famine and almsfood is difficult to obtain Put half of into my bowl and eat the other half yourself so that can both survive That would be better I said further Seer you should know that in my home I have a pot and a stove firewood grains and rice moreover I have no restrictions as to when I may eat and drink Seer out of compassion for me accept the whole meal So the paccekabuddha accepted the whole meal out of compassion Venerable friends because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food I was reborn in a heavenly realm seven times becoming king of the gods and I was reborn as a human being seven times becoming the king of human beings Venerable friends because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food I was reborn in Sakya clans that were very wealthy and prosperous possessing in abundance all kinds of livestock feudatories and manors limitless wealth and endowed with valuable treasures Venerable friends because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food I gave up kingship worth hundreds thousands millions of gold coins not to mention various other possessions and went forth  to practice the path Venerable friends because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food I was regarded and treated with admiration by kings ministers brahmins householders and all the citizens and was regarded with respect by the four assemblies of monks nuns male lay followers and female lay followers Venerable friends because of the merit of giving him a bowlful of food I was constantly invited by people to accept food and drink clothing and bedding woolen blankets carpets beds and mattresses shawls medicine and all  living and I never failed to receive invitations Had I known at that time that that renunciant was a True Person free of attachment then the merit I gained would have been multiplied again I would have received a great reward the most excellent of benefits its bright splendor boundless and vast Then the Venerable Anuruddha a True Person free of attachment who had attained right liberation uttered this verse  I recall how in the past I was poor Relying entirely on gleaning to earn a living Already short of food I offered it to the renunciant Upariṭṭha of utmost virtue Because of this I was reborn in the Sakya clan Given the name Anuruddha Knowing well how to sing and dance I made merry and constantly delighted  I got to see the Worldhonored One Fully awakened  like ambrosia When I saw him confidence and joy arose in me And I gave up the household life to train in the path I attained the recollection of past lives Knowing my former births I was born among the thirtythree gods Dwelling there for seven times bI was seven times here in addition to the seven times there I had experienced fourteen times In the human realm and in the heavens Without ever descending into a bad realm I now know the death and rebirth Of beings their destinations as they depart and are reborn I know mind of others right or wrong And the five kinds of enjoyment of the noble ones attained the fivefold absorption constantly quieting and silencing the mind Having attained quiescence rightly abiding I have gained the purified divine eye What is considered training in the path Secluded having given up the household life I now have obtained its benefit And entered the sphere of the Buddha I take no delight in death Nor do I wish for rebirth When the time comes when it is appropriate With right mindfulness and attentiveness established In the Bamboo Grove at Vesālī My life will end Beneath the bamboos of the grove nirvana without remainder c At that time the Worldhonored One was sitting in meditation and with the divine ear which is purified and surpasses human  he heard the monks sitting together in the assembly hall after the midday meal discussing this topic Having heard it in the late afternoon the Worldhonored One rose from sitting in meditation went to the assembly hall and sat on a seat arranged before the assembly of monks He asked the monks On account of what matter are you assembled in the assembly hall today  Then the monks answered Worldhonored One we are assembled in the assembly hall today because Venerable Anuruddha was teaching the Dharma in relation to events of the past Then the Worldhonored One told the monks Would you like to hear the Tathāgata teach the Dharma in relation to an event of the future The monks answered Worldhonored One now is the right occasion Wellgone One now is the right occasion If the Worldhonored One would teach the monks the Dharma in relation to an event of the future the monks hearing it will receive and remember it well The Worldhonored One said Listen carefully monks Listen carefully and pay proper attention and I will explain it to you in full Then the monks listened in order to receive instruction The Worldhonored One said Monks in the distant future the human life span will be eighty thousand years When the human life span is eighty thousand years Jambudīpa will be very wealthy and pleasant with many inhabitants villages and cities will be as close as a single cocks flight Monks when the human life span is eighty thousand years women will get married at the age of five hundred Monks when the human life span is eighty thousand years there will be only such problems as cold or heat  defecate and urinate desires eat and drink and old age There will be no other afflictions Monks when the human life span is eighty thousand years there will be a king called Saṅkha a wheelturning monarch intelligent and wise equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world freely as he likes Being a righteous Dharma king he will attain seven treasures Those seven treasures are the wheel treasure the elephant treasure the horse treasure the jewel treasure the woman treasure the steward treasure and the counselor treasurethese are the seven He will have a thousand sons of handsome appearance brave fearless and able to overcome others He will a certainly rule over the whole earth as far as the ocean without relying on blade and cudgel just by teaching the Dharma bringing peace and happiness He will have a great golden banner gloriously decorated with various precious things a thousand feet in height when raised and sixteen feet in circumference He will have it set up and after it has been set up beneath it he will make offerings of food and drink clothes and bedding vehicles flower garlands scattered flowers perfume dwellings mattresses woolen blankets shawls servants and lamps offering these to renunciants and brahmins those in poverty those without kin and beggars from far away Having made these offerings he will then shave off his hair and beard don the yellow robe leave the household life out of faith and go forth to practice the path clansmen who shave off their hair and beards don the yellow robe leave the household life out of faith and go forth to practice the path until the unsurpassable holy life has been established He will in that lifetime personally understanding and awakening and dwell having personally realized it He will know as it really is Birth is ended the holy life has been established what was to be done has been done There will not be another existence At that time Venerable Ajita was seated among the assembly Then Venerable Ajita rose from his seat arranged his robe so as to bare one shoulder placed his palms together toward the Buddha and said Worldhonored One in the distant future when the human life span is eighty thousand years may I become a king called Saṅkha a wheelturning monarch intelligent and wise equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world freely as I like Being a righteous Dharma king I will attain seven treasures Those seven treasures are the wheel treasure the elephant treasure the horse treasure the jewel treasure the woman treasure the steward treasure and the counselor treasure these are the

having personally realized it I will understand as it really is Birth is ended the holy life has been established what was to be done has been done There will not be another existence Then the Worldhonored One reprimanded Venerable Ajita You foolish man accepting to die one more time and then trying to end it Why is that Because you have the thought Worldhonored One in the distant future

and hinder and confuse them Then Māra the Bad approached the Buddha Having arrived there he recited a verse to the Buddha One will certainly attain The most wonderful appearance Wearing flower

said Having heard the Buddhas words Venerable Sāriputta and the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse on the Wheelturning Monarch  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying among the khattiya community of Mātulā staying in a mango grove on the bank of a river At that time the Worldhonored One told the monks Monks you should be shining with the light of the Dharma and take the Dharma as your refuge Do not be like any other light or take refuge b in other teachings Monks if you yourselves shine with the light of the Dharma and take the Dharma as your refuge rather than being like other lights and taking refuge in other teachings then you can strive in the training obtain benefit and acquire immeasurable merit Why is that Monks in the past there was a king named Daḷhanemi who was a wheelturning monarch intelligent and wise equipped with a fourfold army to reign over the entire world freely as he liked Being a righteous Dharma king he possessed seven treasures and had acquired four kinds of success What were the seven treasures that he possessed and the four kinds of success that he had acquired   These are the seven treasures that he possessed and the four kinds of success that he had acquired In the latter days of King Daḷhanemis reign the divine wheel treasure suddenly slipped from its original position Someone noticed this and reported it to King Daḷhanemi May your majesty know that the divine wheel treasure has slipped from its original position On hearing this King Daḷhanemi said  c Crown prince my divine wheel treasure has slipped from its original position Crown prince I heard from the ancients that if a wheelturning monarchs divine wheel treasure slips from its original position that king certainly has not long to live his life will not last much longer Crown prince I have enjoyed human pleasures Now I shall seek divine pleasures Crown prince I wish to shave off my hair and beard don the yellow robe leave home out of faith and go forth to practice the path Crown prince I now entrust to you the four continents of the world You should rule by the Dharma not by what is against the Dharma Let the country be free of evil actions and of people of impure behavior Later on crown prince if you notice that the divine wheel treasure has slipped from its original position you should in turn entrust the countrys affairs to your crown prince and instruct him properly Having entrusted the country to your crown prince you too should shave off your hair and beard don the yellow robe leave home out of faith and go forth to practice the path  Having thus entrusted the country to the crown prince and instructed him properly King Daḷhanemi shaved off his hair and beard donned the yellow robe left home out of faith and went forth to practice the path Then seven days after King Daḷhanemi had gone forth to practice the path the divine wheel treasure vanished The divine wheel treasure being lost the duly anointed khattiya king was greatly grieved sad and unhappy Then the duly anointed khattiya king approached his father the royal sage Daḷhanemi Having arrived he said May your majesty know that seven days after your majesty had gone forth to practice the path the divine wheel treasure vanished The father the royal sage Daḷhanemi told his son the duly anointed khattiya king Do not grieve over the loss of the divine wheel treasure Why is that You do not inherit this divine wheel from your father The duly anointed khattiya king addressed his father again Your majesty what should I do now The father the royal sage Daḷhanemi told his son You should follow the transmitted Dharma If you follow the transmitted Dharma then on the fifteenth day of the month the time for reciting the code of rules after you have bathed and ascended to the main hall the divine wheel treasure will come from the east with a thousand spokes complete in every aspect pure and natural not manmade flamelike in color bright and shining The duly anointed khattiya king addressed his father again Your majesty what is the transmitted Dharma that you want me to follow so that through my having followed it on the fifteenth day  the time for reciting the code of rules after I have bathed and ascended to the main hall the divine wheel treasure will come from the east with a thousand spokes complete in every aspect pure and natural not manmade flamelike in color bright and shining The father the royal sage Daḷhanemi told his son further You should contemplate the Dharma according to the Dharma and practice the Dharma according to the Dharma aYou should hold a Dharma feast for the sake of your crown prince queen concubines maids subjects renunciants brahmins and including insects on the eighth day and the fourteenth and fifteenth days of each month practicing charity providing those in need the renunciants and brahmins those in poverty those without kin and beggars from far away with food and drink clothes and bedding vehicles flower garlands scattered flowers perfume dwellings mattresses woolen blankets shawls servants and lamps If there are in your country renunciants and brahmins who are highly regarded and renowned for their virtue you should approach them at an appropriate time consult them on the Dharma and receive their teachings Venerable sirs what are wholesome states What are unwholesome states What are faults What is merit What is excellence What is not excellence What is black What is white From where do black and white states arise What are the benefits  in this life What are the benefits in future lives What actions bring good rather than bad retribution Having heard  from them you should act in accordance with what they say If there are poor people in your country you should give away property to help them This your majesty is called the transmitted Dharma which you should practice well Having practiced it well then on the fifteenth day  the time for reciting the code of rules after you have bathed and ascended to the main hall the divine wheel treasure will certainly come from the east with a thousand spokes complete in every aspect pure and natural not manmade flamelike in color bright and shining Afterward the duly anointed khattiya king contemplated the Dharma according to the Dharma and practiced the Dharma according to the Dharma He

appropriate time Later on the fifteenth day of the month the time for reciting the code of rules after the duly anointed khattiya king had bathed and ascended to the main hall there came from the eastern direction the divine wheel treasure with a thousand spokes complete in every aspect pure and natural not manmade flamelike in color bright and shining He too became a wheelturning monarch he too possessed the seven treasures and acquired the four kinds of success What are the seven treasures that he possessed and the four kinds of success that he acquired    In the latter days of that wheelturning monarchs reign the divine wheel treasure suddenly slipped from its original position Someone noticed that and reported it to the wheelturning monarch May your majesty know that the divine wheel treasure has slipped from its original position Hearing this the wheelturning monarch said  Crown prince my divine wheel treasure has slipped from its original position Crown prince I heard from my father Daḷhanemi b the royal sage that when a wheelturning monarchs divine wheel treasure slips from its original position that king certainly has not long to live his life will not last much longer Crown prince I have enjoyed human pleasures Now I shall seek divine pleasures Crown prince I wish to shave off my hair and beard don the yellow robe leave home out of faith and go forth to practice the path Crown prince I now entrust to you the four continents of the world You should rule by the Dharma not by what is against the Dharma Let the country be free of evil actions and of people of impure behavior Later on crown prince if you find that the divine wheel treasure has slipped from its original position you should in turn entrust the countrys affairs to your crown prince and instruct him properly Having entrusted the country to your crown prince you too should shave off your hair and beard don the yellow robe leave home out of faith and go forth to practice the path Having thus entrusted the country to the crown prince and instructed him properly the wheelturning monarch shaved off his hair and beard donned the yellow robe left home out of faith and went forth to practice the path Then seven days after the wheelturning monarch had gone forth to practice the path the divine wheel treasure vanished The divine wheel treasure being lost the duly anointed khattiya king was not grieved but was attached to sensual pleasures insatiably avaricious bound by desires touched by desires and dominated by desires He did not see the danger and did not know an escape  so he ruled the country according to his own ideas Because he ruled the country according to his own ideas the country declined and no longer prospered In the past as long as a wheelturning monarch followed the transmitted Dharma the people of the country prospered and did not decline duly anointed khattiya king however ruled the country according to his own ideas Because he ruled the country according to his own ideas the country declined and no longer prospered Then the brahmin teachers of the country traveling around within the national borders saw the people of the country declining rather than prospering so they thoughtc The duly anointed khattiya king rules the country according to his own ideas Because he rules the country according to his own ideas the people of the country are declining rather than prospering In the past as long as a wheelturning monarch followed the transmitted Dharma the people of the country prospered and did not decline This duly anointed khattiya king however rules the country according to his own ideas Because he rules the country according to his own ideas the people of the country are declining rather than prospering Then the brahmin teachers of the country went together to the duly anointed khattiya king and said May your majesty know that he rules the country according to his own ideas Because he rules the country according to his own ideas the people of the country are declining rather than prospering In the past as long as a wheelturning monarch followed the transmitted Dharma the people of the country prospered and did not decline Now however your majesty rules the country according to his own ideas Because he rules the country according to his own ideas the people of the country are declining rather than prospering Hearing this the duly anointed khattiya king said Brahmins what should I do The brahmin teachers of the country replied Your majesty in the country there are people who are intelligent and wise knowledgeable and calculating In the country there are senior ministers and retainers who have learned the scriptures and understand them who recite and preserve the transmitted Dharma such as we your retainers May your majesty practice the transmitted Dharma When you have practiced the transmitted Dharma then on the fifteenth day  the time for reciting the code of rules after you have bathed and ascended to the main hall the divine wheel treasure will certainly come from the east with a thousand spokes complete in every aspect pure and natural not manmade flamelike in color bright and shining  The duly anointed khattiya king asked further Brahmins what is the transmitted Dharma that you want me to follow so that through my having followed it on the fifteenth day  the time for reciting the code of rules after I have bathed and ascended to the main hall the divine wheel treasure will come from the east with a thousand spokes complete in every aspect pure and natural not manmade flamelike in color bright and shining Your majesty should contemplate the Dharma according to the Dharma and practice the Dharma according to the Dharma You should hold a Dharma feast for the sake of your crown prince queen concubines maids subjects renunciants brahmins and including insects on the eighth day and the fourteenth and fifteenth days of each month practicing charity providing those in need the renunciants and brahmins  those in poverty those without kin and beggars from far away with food and drink clothes and bedding vehicles flower garlands scattered flowers perfume dwellings mattresses woolen blankets shawls servants and lamps If there are in your country renunciants and brahmins who are highly regarded and renowned for their virtue you should approach them at an appropriate time consult them on the Dharma and receive their teachings a Venerable sirs what are wholesome states What are unwholesome states What are faults What is merit What is excellence What is not excellence What is black What is white From where do black and white states arise What are the benefits  in this life What are the benefits in future lives What actions bring good rather than bad retribution Having heard from them you should act in accordance with what they say  If there are poor people in your country you should give away property to help them Your majesty this is called the transmitted Dharma which you should practice well Having practiced it well then on the fifteenth day  the time for reciting the code of rules after you have bathed and ascended to the main hall the divine wheel treasure will certainly come from the east with a thousand spokes complete in every aspect pure and natural not manmade flamelike in color bright and shining Afterward the duly anointed khattiya king contemplated the Dharma according to the Dharma and practiced the Dharma according to the Dharma He held a Dharma feast for the sake of his crown prince queen concubines maids subjects renunciants brahmins and including insects on the eighth day and the fourteenth and fifteenth days  practicing charity providing those in need the renunciants and brahmins  those in poverty those without kin and beggars from far away with food and drink clothes and bedding vehicles flower garlands scattered flowers perfume dwellings mattresses woolen blankets shawls servants and lamps If there were in his country renunciants and brahmins who were highly regarded and renowned for their virtue he personally approached them at an appropriate time consulted them on the Dharma and received their teachings Venerable sirs what are wholesome states What are unwholesome states What are faults What is merit What is excellence What is not excellence What is black What is white From where do black and white states arise What are the benefits in this life What are the benefits in future lives What actions bring good rather than bad retribution Having heard from them he acted in accordance with what they had said However there were poor people in the country and he did not give away property to help them Because those who were poor and had no property did not get help people became poorer Because of  poverty someone stole anothers property Because he had stolen the owner arrested and bound him and brought him before the duly anointed khattiya king saying Your majesty this man stole my property May your majesty punish him The duly anointed khattiya king asked that man Is it true that you stole That man replied Your majesty I did steal And why Because of poverty your majesty Without stealing I would have nothing to live on Then the duly anointed khattiya king gave the thief some property and told him Go home and never do it again Then the people of the country heard that the duly anointed khattiya king was giving away property to citizens who stole Because of this people thought We too should steal others property Thereupon the people of the country vied with one another to steal others property So because those people who were poor and had no property did not get help they became poorer and because of poverty theft became rife Owing to the growth of theft peoples life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened Monks as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened whereas a father would live for eighty thousand years his son would live for forty thousand years Monks when peoples life span was forty thousand years someone stole anothers property The owner arrested and bound  and brought him before the duly anointed khattiya king saying Your majesty this man stole my property May your majesty punish him The duly anointed khattiya king asked that man Is it true that you stole That man replied I did steal your majesty And why Because of poverty Without stealing I would have nothing to live on Hearing this the duly anointed khattiya king thought b If I give away property to all those in my country who steal others property that will exhaust the countrys treasury for nothing and will cause theft to become rife Now let me rather employ a sharp  sword If someone in my country steals I will have him arrested seated beneath a tall signpost and beheaded So then the duly anointed khattiya king ordered that a sharp sword should be employed He ordered that anyone in the country who stole should be arrested seated beneath a tall signpost and beheaded The people of the country heard that the duly anointed khattiya king had ordered that a sharp sword should be employed and that anyone in the country who stole should forthwith be arrested seated beneath a tall signpost and beheaded Let us rather follow his example and employ a sharp sword using it for robbery If when committing robbery we catch the owner we will behead him Thereupon those people followed example and employed sharp swords using them for robbing catching the owners and beheading them Because those who were poor and had no property did not get help people became poorer Because of poverty theft became rife Owing to the increase in theft killing with swords increased Owing to the increase in killing with swords peoples life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened Monks as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened whereas a father lived for forty thousand years his son lived for twenty thousand years Monks when peoples life span was twenty thousand years someone stole anothers property The owner arrested and bound  and brought him before the duly anointed khattiya king saying Your majesty this man stole my property May your majesty punish him The duly anointed khattiya king asked that man Is it true that you stole Then the thief thought If the duly anointed khattiya king knew the facts he would have me bound and whipped or have me cast out or exiled or have my money and property confiscated or have various painful punishments inflicted on me impaling me or beheading me Let me rather deceive the duly anointed khattiya king with false speech cThinking thus he said Your majesty I did not steal Because those who were poor and had no property did not get help people became poorer Because of poverty theft became rife Owing to the increase of theft killing with swords increased Owing to the increase in killing with swords false speech and divisive speech increased Owing to the increase in false speech and divisive speech peoples life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened Monks as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened whereas a father would live for twenty thousand years his son would live for ten thousand years Monks when peoples life span was ten thousand years some were virtuous and others were not virtuous Those who were not virtuous being envious of those who were virtuous committed adultery with the wives  Because those who were poor and had no property did not get help people became poorer Because of poverty theft became rife Owing to the increase in theft killing with swords increased Owing to the increase in killing with swords false speech and divisive speech increased Owing to the increase in false speech and divisive speech envy and sexual misconduct increased Owing to the increase in envy and sexual misconduct those peoples life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened Monks as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened whereas a father would live for ten thousand years his son would live for five thousand years Monks when peoples life span was five thousand years three kinds of behavior increased unlawful desires disagreeable covetousness and wrong teachings Owing to the increase of these three kinds of behavior peoples life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened Monks as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened whereas a father would live for five thousand years his son would live for two thousand five hundred years Monks when peoples life span was two thousand five hundred years another three conditions increased divisive speech harsh speech and frivolous speech Owing to the increase of these three conditions those peoples life span decreased and their physical a appearance worsened Monks as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened whereas a father would live for two thousand five hundred years his son would live for one thousand years Monks when peoples life span was one thousand years one condition increased namely wrong view Owing to the increase in one condition those peoples life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened Monks as their life span decreased and their physical appearance worsened whereas a father would live for one thousand years his son would live for five hundred years Monks when peoples life span was five hundred years those people were not filial to their parents throughout their lives and could not respect renunciants and brahmins They did not serve them obediently did not perform meritorious actions and did not see that retribution for faults comes in future lives Because they were not filial to their parents throughout their lives and could not respect renunciants and brahmins did not serve them obediently did not perform meritorious actions and did not see that retribution for faults comes in future lives consequently monks whereas a father would live for five hundred years his son would live for either two hundred and fifty years or two hundred years Nowadays monks someone who enjoys longevity may live one hundred years or not much more The Buddha said further Monks in the distant future peoples life span will be ten years Monks when peoples life span is ten years girls will get married as soon as they reach the age of five months Monks when peoples life span is ten years a kind of grain called barnyard millet will become the preferred food just as white rice is the preferred food at

honey sugarcane sugarwill all disappear  Monks when peoples life span is ten years those who follow the ten unwholesome courses of action will be respected by others Just as those who follow the ten wholesome courses of action are respected by others today so monks when peoples life span is ten years those who follow the ten unwholesome courses of action will be respected by others Monks when peoples life span is ten years there will be no such word as wholesome let alone people who follow the ten wholesome courses of action Monks when peoples life span is ten years someone called the Punisher will travel around going everywhere from house to house inflicting punishment Monks when peoples life span is ten years mothers will have strong thoughts of cruelty toward their children Children will also have strong thoughts of cruelty toward their mothers Fathers children brothers sisters and relatives will gradually turn against one another and have thoughts of cruelty toward one another Monks just as a hunter has strong thoughts of cruelty on seeing a deer so when peoples life span is ten years mothers will have strong thoughts of cruelty toward their children Children will also have strong thoughts of cruelty toward their mothers Fathers children brothers sisters and relatives will gradually turn against one another and have thoughts of cruelty toward one another Monks when peoples life span is ten years there will be a massacre by sword lasting seven days if one grasps a piece of grass it will be transformed into a sword and if one grasps a piece of firewood it will also be transformed into a sword and people will use these swords to kill one another At the end of the sevenday sword massacre they will stop During that period there will also be some people who give rise to shame and scruples who detest and dislike hostility During the sevenday sword massacre these will go into the mountains or into the wilderness and hide in secret places At the end of the seven days they will come out of the secret places in the mountains or the wilderness and on meeting one another again will give rise to a mind of kindness and compassion and have strong thoughts of mutual affectionb It is just as when a loving mothers only son returns home safely from afar after a long absence and on seeing each other again they rejoice and give rise to a mind of kindness and compassion with strong thoughts of mutual affection In the same way at the end of the seven days those people will come out of the secret places in the mountains or in the wilderness and on meeting one another again will give rise to a mind of kindness and compassion with strong thoughts of mutual affection Having met together they will say Friends now we see each other  now we have attained

Monks I do not see any power so hard to subdue as the power of Māra the monk who has ended the taints can subdue it by the power of his unsurpassed noble wisdom This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse to Pāyāsi  Thus have I heard Together with a large company of monks he approached Setavyā and stayed to the north of the village in a rosewood grove At that time in Setavyā there was a king named Pāyāsi who was extremely rich possessing limitless wealth and countless livestock and property endowed with various feudatories and manors The manors springs ponds grass and trees in Setavyā all belonged to the king having been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala Then the brahmins and householders in Setavyā heard this A renunciant named Kumāra Kassapa is dwelling in the country of Kosala together with a large company of monks he has arrived in Setavyā and is staying to the north of the village in the Rosewood Grove The renunciant Kumāra Kassapa has a great reputation is well known in all the ten directions Kumāra Kassapa has unhindered eloquence and what he says is subtle He is a learned arahant Those who visit this arahant pay respect to him and serve him respectfully quickly gain good benefits Let us go and see the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa the people of Setavyā walking in groups brahmins with brahmins householders with householders went together out of Setavyā toward the north heading for the Rosewood Grove ab At that time King Pāyāsi who was in his main hall saw in the distance the people of Setavyā walking in groups brahmins with brahmins householders with householders going together out of Setavyā toward the north heading for the Rosewood Grove Seeing this King Pāyāsi said to an attendant Why are the people of Setavyā walking in groups brahmins with brahmins householders with householders going together out of Setavyā today toward the north heading for the Rosewood Grove The attendant said Your majesty those brahmins and householders in Setavyā have heard this A renunciant named Kumāra Kassapa is dwelling in the country of Kosala together with a large company of monks he has arrived in Setavyā and is staying to the north of the village in the Rosewood Grove Your majesty the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa has a great reputation being well known widely in the ten directions Kumāra Kassapa has unhindered eloquence and what he says is subtle He is a learned arahant If one sees this arahant pays respect to him and serves him respectfully one will quickly gain good benefits Let us go and see the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa For this reason your majesty the people of Setavyā walking in groups brahmins with brahmins householders with householders are going together out of Setavyā toward the north heading for the Rosewood Grove Hearing this King Pāyāsi told the attendant Go to the brahmins and householders of Setavyā and tell them King Pāyāsi tells the brahmins and householders of Setavyā Please wait friends Let me go with you to see the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa You are foolish Do not be deceived by him  there are future lives beings are reborn I hold this view this tenet There are no future lives beings are not reborn Following the kings instructions the attendant approached the brahmins and householders of Setavyā and said to them King Pāyāsi tells the brahmins and householders of Setavyā Please wait friends Let me go with you to see the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa You are foolish Do not be deceived by him there are future lives that beings are reborn I hold this view this tenet There are no future lives beings are not reborn Having heard this message the brahmins and householders of Setavyā replied to the attendant We shall wait as commanded The attendant returned and reported I have delivered your command The brahmins and householders of Setavyā await your majesty May your majesty know the right time Then King Pāyāsi commanded a charioteer Prepare a chariot immediately I wish to go now Following the kings instruction the charioteer immediately prepared a chariot and returned to tell the king The chariot is ready It is at your majestys disposal Then King Pāyāsi boarded the chariot and departed Approaching the brahmins and householders of Setavyā he went with them to the Rosewood Grove Then on seeing in the distance the venerable Kumāra Kassapa among the trees in the grove King Pāyāsi alighted from the chariot and proceeded on foot toward the venerable Kumāra Kassapa After having exchanged greetings with Venerable Kumāra Kassapa he sat down to one side and asked Kassapa I now want to ask a question Would you listen Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi ask what you will Having heard it I will consider it So King Pāyāsi asked c Kassapa I hold this view this tenet There are no future lives beings are not reborn Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa what do you think  Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi I will now question you king Please reply as you see fit What do you think king The present sun and moon are they in this life or future lives Pāyāsi replied Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says still I hold this view this tenet There are no future lives beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi have you another counter argument beyond this Pāyāsi replied Yes Kassapa I have another counterargument Kassapa some of my relatives were critically ill so I went to their place Having arrived there I said You should know that I hold this view this tenet There are no future lives beings are not reborn  relatives some renunciants and brahmins hold this view this tenet There are future lives beings are reborn I have always disbelieved what they say They say further If men or women perform evil deeds if they are indolent idle negligent jealous stingy greedy closefisted not virtuous and strongly attached to property then owing to these causes and conditions at the breaking up of the body after death they will certainly go to a bad realm of existence and be reborn in hell suppose that what those renunciants and brahmins say is true You my relatives have performed evil deeds you have been indolent idle negligent jealous stingy greedy closefisted not virtuous and strongly attached to property If at the breaking up of the body after death you do have to go to a bad realm of existence and are reborn in hell then come back and tell me Pāyāsi in hell the torments are thus and thus If that happens then I will see it in the present  They heard what I said they received my instructions yet none of them has come to tell me Pāyāsi in hell the torments are thus and thus For this reason Kassapa I think There are no future lives beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi I will question you again Please reply as you see fit Suppose the kings men arrest a criminal and bring him before the king saying Your majesty this man has committed a crime The king should punish him The king tells them Take him away Bind his hands behind him and set him on a donkey Beat a broken drum that makes a sound like a donkeys braying Having announced the sentence widely lead him out through the southern gate seat him beneath a tall signpost and behead him Following his instructions the kings men bind the criminals hands behind him and set him on a donkey They beat a broken drum that makes a sound like a donkeys braying Having announced the sentence widely they lead him out through the southern gate seat him beneath a tall signpost and are about to behead him This man on the point of death says to the executioner Please wait a while I wish to see my parents wife and children my male and female servants and messengers Let me go temporarily What do you think king Would the executioner release the criminal and let him go temporarily Pāyāsi replied No Kassapa Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi such is also the case with your relatives who had performed evil deeds who had been indolent idle negligent jealous stingy greedy closefisted not virtuous and strongly attached to property and who owing to these causes and conditions at the breaking up of the body after death certainly went to a bad realm of existence and were reborn in hell aWhen the wardens of hell caught them and tortured them they told the wardens of hell Wardens of hell please wait a while and stop torturing me I wish to go temporarily and visit King Pāyāsi to tell him In hell the torments are thus and thus so that he can see it in the present What do you think king Would the wardens of hell release your relatives and let them come temporarily Pāyāsi replied No Kassapa Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi you should contemplate future lives in this way since you cannot see them with your physical eyes Pāyāsi if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire inclines toward abandoning desire if he cuts off and abandons hatred inclines towards abandoning hatred if he cuts off and abandons delusion inclines towards abandoning delusionthen with the purified divine eye which surpasses human  he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly excellent or not excellent as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their deeds He sees this as it really is King Pāyāsi again said Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says I still hold this view this tenet There are no future lives beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi have you another counter argument beyond this Pāyāsi replied Yes Kassapa I have another counterargument Kassapa some of my relatives were critically ill so I went to their place Having arrived there I said You should know that I hold this view this tenet There are no future lives beings are not reborn relatives some renunciants and brahmins hold this view this tenet There are future b lives beings are reborn I have always disbelieved what they say They say further If men or women perform good deeds if they are energetic diligent not negligent not jealous not stingy not greedy openhanded virtuous if they generously renounce and give it to orphans and the poor always enjoy practicing charity and are not attached to propertythen owing to these causes and conditions at the breaking up of the body after death they will certainly ascend to a good realm of existence and be reborn in a heavenly realm Let us suppose that what those renunciants and brahmins say is true You my relatives have performed good deeds you are energetic diligent not negligent not jealous not stingy or greedy openhanded virtuous you have generously renounced and given it to orphans and the poor you have always enjoyed practicing charity and you are not attached to property If at the breaking up of the body after death you do ascend to a good realm of existence and are reborn in heaven then come back and tell me Pāyāsi in heaven the pleasures are thus and thus If that happens I will see it in the present They heard what I said they received my instructions yet none of them has ever come to tell me Pāyāsi in heaven the pleasures are thus and thus For this reason Kassapa I think There are no future lives beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi listen while I tell you a parable The wise on hearing a parable understand its implication Suppose Pāyāsi that outside a village or a town there is a cesspit full of feces so deep that a man could be submerged in it up to his head A man has fallen into this cesspit and sunk to the bottom Suppose that another man pitying him seeking his prosperity benefit peace and happiness pulls him gently from the cesspit wipes him down with a slice of bamboo brushes him with leaves and bathes him with warm water  Later on after has been cleaned and bathed perfume is applied to his body He ascends to the main hall and is entertained with the pleasures of the five senses What do you think king Would that man enjoy recalling that cesspit delight in praising it and wish to revisit it Pāyāsi replied No Kassapa If someone else were to recall that cesspit  delight in praising it and wish to revisit it then he would not love this person How much less would he himself recall that cesspit delight in praising it and wish to see it again This is not possible Pāyāsi if your relatives performed good deeds if they were energetic diligent not negligent not jealous not stingy or greedy openhanded virtuous if they generously renounced and gave it to orphans and the poor always enjoyed practicing charity and were not attached to propertythen owing to these causes and conditions at the breaking up of the body after death they certainly ascended to a good realm of existence were reborn in a heavenly realm Having been reborn in heaven they would entertain themselves with the heavenly pleasures of the five senses What do you think king Would those gods in heaven give up the heavenly pleasures of the five senses and recalling the pleasures of the five senses in this human realm delight in praising them and wish to revisit them c Pāyāsi replied No Kassapa Why is that The pleasures of the five senses of this human realm are putrid unclean utterly abhorrent unattractive undesirable coarse and impure Kassapa compared with the pleasures of the five senses in this human realm heavenly sensual pleasures are the utmost the supreme the best the most wonderful and excellent It cannot be that a god in heaven would give up the heavenly pleasures of the five senses recall the pleasures of the five senses in this human realm delight in praising them and wish to see them again  Pāyāsi you should contemplate future lives in this way since you cannot see them with your physical eyes Pāyāsi if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire inclines toward abandoning desire if he cuts off and abandons hatred inclines toward abandoning hatred if he cuts off and abandons delusion inclines toward abandoning delusionthen with the purified divine eye which surpasses human  he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly excellent or not excellent as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their deeds He sees this as it really is King Pāyāsi again said Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says I still hold this view this tenet There are no future lives beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi have you another counterargument beyond this Pāyāsi replied Yes Kassapa I have another counterargument Kassapa some of my relatives were critically ill so I went to their place Having arrived there I said You should know that I hold this view this tenet There are no future lives beings are not reborn  relatives some renunciants and brahmins hold this view this tenet There are future lives beings are reborn I have always disbelieved what they say they say further If men or women perform good deeds if they are energetic diligent not negligent not jealous not stingy not greedy openhanded virtuous if they generously renounce and give it to orphans and the poor always enjoy practicing charity and are not attached to propertythen owing to these causes and conditions at the breaking up of the body after death they will certainly ascend to a good realm of existence and be reborn in a heavenly realm  Let us suppose that what those renunciants and brahmins say is true You my relatives have performed good deeds you are energetic diligent not negligent not jealous not stingy or greedy openhanded virtuous you have generously renounced and given it to orphans and the poor you have always enjoyed practicing charity and you are not attached to property If at the breaking up of the body after death you do go to a good realm of existence and are reborn in heaven then come back and tell me Pāyāsi in heaven the pleasures are thus and thus In heaven you might think thus What shall I gain by going back in King Pāyāsis household there is much wealth I will give to you a They heard what I said they received my instructions yet none of them has ever come to tell me Pāyāsi in heaven the pleasures are thus and thus For this reason Kassapa I think There are no future lives beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi the life span in heaven is long while the life span in the human realm is short What is a hundred years for human beings is one day and night for the thirtythree gods Thirty such days and nights make a month twelve such months make a year and a thousand such years are the heavenly life span of the thirtythree gods What do you think king If your relatives performed good deeds if they were energetic diligent not negligent not jealous not stingy not greedy openhanded virtuous if they generously renounced and gave it to orphans and the poor always enjoyed practicing charity and were not attached to propertythen owing to these causes and conditions at the breaking up of the body after death they certainly ascended to a good realm of existence were reborn in a heavenly realm Having been reborn in heaven they might think We should first entertain ourselves with the heavenly pleasures of the five senses for one day and night or entertain ourselves with  the heavenly pleasures of the five senses for two three four or even six or seven days After that we shall go to tell King Pāyāsi that the pleasures in heaven are thus and thus What do you think king Would you be still alive  Pāyāsi asked Kassapa who has come back from his afterlife to tell you Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa the life span in heaven is long while the life span in the human realm is short What is a hundred years for human beings is one day and night for the thirtythree gods Thirty such days and nights make a month twelve such months make a year and a thousand such years are the heavenly life span of the thirtythree gods Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi listen while I tell you a parable The wise on hearing a parable understand its implication Suppose Pāyāsi that a blind man were to say this There are no black or white objects nor is there seeing of black or white objects There are no long or short objects nor is there seeing of long or short objects There are no near or far objects nor is there seeing of near or far objects There are no rough or smooth objects nor is there seeing of rough or smooth objects There are no objects because from the beginning I have never seen or known them the blind man spoke like this would it be true Pāyāsi replied No Kassapa Why is that Kassapa there are black and white objects and also there is seeing of black and white objects There are long and short objects and also there is seeing of long and short objects There are near and far objects and also there is seeing of near and far objects There are rough and smooth objects and also there is seeing of rough and smooth objects If the blind man were to say There are no objects b because from the beginning I have never seen or known them then what he said would not be true Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said King Pāyāsi you are also like a blind man if you say Kassapa who has come back from his afterlife to tell you Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa the life span in heaven is long while the life span in the human realm is short What is a hundred years for human beings is one day and night for the thirtythree gods Thirty such days and nights make a month twelve such months make a year and a thousand such years are the heavenly life span of the thirtythree gods King Pāyāsi said Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa you certainly must not and should not speak so Why is that Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa you go so far as to compare me to a blind man Kassapa assuming it was known to me or known to my relatives who performed good deeds who were energetic diligent not negligent not jealous not stingy not greedy openhanded virtuous who generously renounced  and gave it to orphans and the poor always enjoyed practicing charity and were not attached to property that owing to these causes and conditions at the breaking up of the body after death they certainly would ascend to a good realm of existence and be reborn in heaventhen Kassapa I would now practice charity perform meritorious actions observe the uposatha and the precepts and then commit suicide by using a knife or taking poison or throwing into a hole or a well or hanging myself Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa you should not go so far as to compare me to that blind man Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi listen while I tell you another parable The wise on hearing a parable understand its implication  Suppose Pāyāsi that a brahmin has a young wife who has just become pregnant and that he already has a son by his former wife and then in the midst of this that brahmin suddenly dies After his death the former wifes son says to his stepmother Stepmother you should know that all the property of this household should now belong to me I see no one else anymore who should share in it The stepmother replies I am pregnant now If I give birth to a boy you should share with him If I give birth to a girl all the property belongs to you The former wifes son says to his stepmother a second and a third time All the property of this household should now belong to me I see no one else anymore who should share in it And the stepmother also replies a second and a third time I am pregnant now If I give birth to a boy you should share with him If I give birth to a girl all the property belongs to you Then the stepmother being foolish ignorant of poor understanding lacking wisdom desiring to protect her life on the contrary harms herself She enters an inner room takes a sharp knife and cuts open her belly to see whether it is a boy or a girl Being foolish ignorant of poor understanding lacking wisdom desiring to protect her life she on the contrary harms herself and the child in her belly It should be known that Pāyāsi is likewise foolish ignorant of poor understanding lacking wisdom in that desiring to protect his life he on the contrary thinks like this Kassapa if it were known to me or known to my relatives who performed good deeds who were energetic diligent not negligent not jealous not stingy not greedy openhanded virtuous who generously renounced and gave it to orphans and the poor always enjoyed practicing charity and were not attached to property that owing to these causes and conditions at the breaking up of the body after death they certainly would ascend to a good realm of existence and be reborn in heaventhen Kassapa I would now practice charity perform meritorious actions observe c the uposatha and the precepts and then commit suicide by using a knife or taking poison or throwing into a hole or a well or hanging myself Renunciant Kumāra Kassapa you should not go so far as to compare me to that blind man Pāyāsi if an energetic man lives long he will acquire great merit If he acquires great merit he will be reborn in heaven and enjoy longevity Pāyāsi you should contemplate future lives thus cannot see them with your physical eyes Pāyāsi if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire inclines toward abandoning desire if he cuts off and abandons hatred inclines toward abandoning hatred if he cuts off and abandons delusion inclines toward abandoning delusionthen with the purified divine eye which surpasses human  he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly excellent or not excellent as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their deeds He sees this as it really is King Pāyāsi again said Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says I still hold this view this tenet There are no future lives beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi have you another counterargument beyond this Pāyāsi replied Yes Kassapa I have another counterargument Kassapa some of my relatives were critically ill I went to their place to visit and greet them and they also visited and greeted me When they died I visited and greeted them again but they did not visit and greet me again so I also do not visit and greet them Kassapa for this reason I think Beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi listen while I tell you another parable The wise on hearing a parable understand its implicationa Suppose Pāyāsi there is a skilled conchblower He goes to a place where nobody has ever heard the sound of a conch He mounts a high hill on a dark night and with all his might he blows the conch Because the people there have never heard the sound of a conch on hearing it they think What is this sound that is so wonderful very extraordinary truly delightful pleasant to the ear and gladdening to the heart Then that crowd together approaches the skilled conchblower Having arrived they ask What is this sound that is so wonderful very extraordinary truly delightful pleasant to the ear and gladdening to the heart The skilled conchblower puts the conch down on the ground and tells the crowd Sirs you should know that it is the sound of this conch Thereupon the people kick the conch saying Make a sound conch Make a sound conch But it is silent producing no sound The skilled conchblower thinks Now these people are foolish ignorant poor in understanding lacking wisdom Why so They seek to get sound from a senseless object Then the skilled conchblower takes the conch washes it with water raises it to his mouth and blows it with all his might Hearing it the people in the crowd think The conch is marvelous Why so Because by means of hands water and the blowing of wind from the mouth it produces a fine sound that pervades the four directions In the same way Pāyāsi if a man is still alive he can talk with and greet others when he is dead he can no longer talk with or greet others Pāyāsi you should contemplate the rebirth of beings thus cannot see it with your physical eyes Pāyāsi if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire inclines toward abandoning desire if he cuts off and abandons hatred inclines toward abandoning  hatred if he cuts off and abandons delusion inclines toward abandoning delusionthen with the purified divine eye which surpasses human  he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly excellent or not excellent as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their deeds He sees this as it really is King Pāyāsi again said Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says I still hold this view this tenet Beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi have you another counterargument beyond this Pāyāsi replied Yes Kassapa I have another counterargument Kassapa my officers arrested a criminal and brought him before me Having arrived they said Your majesty this man has committed a crime May your majesty punish him I told them b Take this criminal away and weigh him on the scales alive After having weighed him alive put him down on the ground and strangle him with a rope Having killed him weigh him again I want to know when this man is light soft and has a lustrous appearance when he is dead or when he is alive Following my instructions they took this criminal away and weighed him on the scales alive Having done so they put him down on the ground and strangled him with a rope Having killed him they weighed him again When the criminal was alive he was very light and soft with lustrous appearance When dead his skin became thick and he became heavy stiff not soft and lost his lustrous appearance For this reason Kassapa I think Beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi listen while I tell you another parable The wise on hearing a parable understand its implication Suppose Pāyāsi that an iron ball or an iron ploughshare has been heated by fire all day At that time it is very light and soft with  a lustrous appearance once the fire is extinguished it gradually cools down becomes solid thick and heavy and becomes stiff not soft and loses its lustrous appearance In the same way Pāyāsi if a man is alive his body is very light and soft with lustrous appearance once he is dead he becomes thick heavy stiff not soft and loses his lustrous appearance Pāyāsi you should contemplate the rebirth of beings thus cannot see it with your physical eyes Pāyāsi if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire inclines toward abandoning desire if he cuts off and abandons hatred inclines toward abandoning hatred if he cuts off and abandons delusion inclines toward abandoning delusionthen with the purified divine eye which surpasses human  he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly excellent or not excellent as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their deeds He sees this as it really is King Pāyāsi again said Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says I still hold this view this tenet Beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi have you another counterargument beyond this Pāyāsi replied Yes Kassapa I have another counterargument Kassapa my officers arrested a criminal and brought him before me Having arrived they said Your majesty this man has committed a crime May your majesty punish him I told them Take this criminal and put him head downward into an iron cauldron or a copper cauldron Seal its mouth and light a fire underneath it Having lit the fire watch to see being enters or leaves comes or goes or moves around Following my instructions they took this criminal away and put him head downward into an iron cauldron or a copper cauldron They sealed its mouth and lit a fire underneath it Having lit the fire they watched to see being entered or left came or went or moved around c Kassapa by such means I saw no rebirth of any being For this reason Kassapa I think Beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi I will question you now Please reply as you see fit What do you think Do you recall that while taking the noontide rest on your bed eaten excellent delicious food you saw in a dream pleasure parks bathing pools groves flowers fruits clear springs and long streams and saw yourself taking recreation there moving around coming and going to your hearts content Pāyāsi replied Yes I do recall so Kassapa asked further While you were taking the noontide rest on your bed eaten excellent delicious food were any attendants present He replied Yes Kassapa asked further While you were taking the noontide rest on your bed eaten excellent delicious food at that time did the attendants to left and right see you entering or leaving moving around or coming and going Pāyāsi replied How could even the most remarkable individual see this let alone the attendants to left and right Pāyāsi you should contemplate the rebirth of beings thus cannot see it with your physical eyes Pāyāsi if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire inclines toward abandoning desire if he cuts off and abandons hatred inclines toward abandoning hatred if he cuts off and abandons delusion inclines toward abandoning delusionthen with the purified divine eye which surpasses human  he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly excellent or not excellent as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their deeds He sees this as it really is  King Pāyāsi again said Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says I still hold this view this tenet Beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi have you another counterargument beyond this Pāyāsi replied Yes Kassapa I have another counterargument Kassapa my officers arrested a criminal and brought him before me Having arrived they said Your majesty this man has committed a crime May your majesty punish him I told them Take this criminal away Peel off his skin and tear off his flesh Cut off his sinews and break his bones to the marrow Search for the being to be reborn Following my instructions they took this criminal away peeled off his skin tore off his flesh cut off his sinews and broke his bones to the marrow searching for the being to be reborn Kassapa I used such means to search for the being to be reborn but in the end I could not see any being to be reborn For this reason Kassapa I think Beings are not reborn Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi listen while I tell you another parable The wise on hearing a parable understand its implication Suppose Pāyāsi that a fireworshiping mattedhair brahmin is living near a road Some merchants stay the night at a place not far away from him Then when the night has passed and dawn has broken the merchants set out hastily forgetfully leaving behind a small child Then the fireworshiping mattedhair brahmin having risen early looks around the place where the merchants stayed and sees the small child left alone without an owner Seeing it he thinks This small child has nobody to depend on He will definitely die unless I support him So he carries the small child away returns to his own place and rears him The small child grows up endowed with all his faculties Then the fireworshiping mattedhair brahmin has some small matter for which he has to go among the people The fireworshiping mattedhair brahmin therefore instructs the boy aI have some small matter for which I have to go among the people for a while You must feed the fire and be careful not to let it go out If it should go out use these firesticks to make fire Then having instructed him well the fireworshiping mattedhair brahmin goes among the people Later on the boy goes out to play and the fire goes out When he returns he tries to make fire He takes the firesticks and hits them on the ground saying Come out fire Come out fire But no fire comes out He exerts more effort hitting it on a stone Come out fire Come out fire But still no fire comes out As no fire comes out he breaks the firesticks into ten and even a hundred pieces throws them away and sits down on the ground anxiously saying I cannot get fire What should I do Then the fireworshiping mattedhair brahmin having finished what he had to do among the people returns to his own place Having arrived he asks Boy did you look after the fire without playing and not let it go out The boy said Venerable sir I went out to play and the fire went out When I returned I tried to make fire I took the firesticks and hit them on the ground saying Come out fire Come out fire But no fire came out I exerted more effort hitting them on a stone Come out fire Come out fire But still no fire came out As no fire came out I broke the firesticks into ten and even a hundred pieces threw them away and sat down on the ground Venerable sir I tried like this but could not get fire What should I have done Then the fireworshiping mattedhair brahmin thinks This boy is foolish ignorant poor in understanding and lacking wisdom Why so How else could one implore the nonintelligent firesticks to render fire b The fireworshiping mattedhair brahmin then takes dry sticks to use as the upper and lower firesticks places them on the ground and by  rubbing causes fire to come out which gradually become flames He tells the boy Boy this is how one should make fire One should not be like you foolish ignorant poor in understanding lacking wisdom and try to implore the nonintelligent firesticks to render fire Pāyāsi it should be known that you are likewise foolish ignorant poor in understanding and lacking wisdom searching in dead flesh and even in marrow for a being to be reborn Pāyāsi you should contemplate the rebirth of beings thus cannot see it with your physical eyes Pāyāsi if a renunciant or a brahmin cuts off and abandons desire inclines toward abandoning desire if he cuts off and abandons hatred inclines toward abandoning hatred if he cuts off and abandons delusion inclines toward abandoning delusionthen with the purified divine eye which surpasses human  he sees beings as they die and are reborn handsome or ugly excellent or not excellent as they depart and return to good or bad realms of existence in accordance with their deeds He sees this as it really is King Pāyāsi again said Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says I still hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion I am utterly unable to let go of it Why is that If other people in other countries heard of this they would say King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time but he has been refuted defeated and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa For this reason Kassapa I hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion I am utterly unable to let go of it Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi listen while I tell you a parable The wise on hearing a parable understand its implication Suppose Pāyāsi two friends leave home to make a living On  their way they first see a large amount of hemp without an owner On seeing it one of the men tells his companion You should know that there is a large amount of hemp here without an owner Let us take it make up a heavy load for each of us and carry it back home as our source of livelihood So they carry off their heavy load Further on they see a large amount of cotton thread and cotton clothes without an owner Further on again they see a large amount of silver without an owner On seeing it one of them lays down his load of hemp takes the silver and loads himself up with it Still further on they see a large amount of gold without an owner Then the man loaded with silver tells the one loaded with hemp Now you should know that there is a great amount of gold here without an owner You discard your hemp and I will discard my silver I want you and me to take this gold and carry a heavy load of it home as our source of livelihood The man loaded with hemp tells the one loaded with silver c My load of hemp is fine It is well packed and tied up and I have carried it a long way I cannot let go of it You know what is fit for you The one with the hemp tells the one with the silver You have damaged my load My load of hemp is well tied up and I have carried it a long way I want to carry this hemp back home myself I will never let go of it You know what is fit for you Dont worry about me Then the man with the load of silver discards it loads himself up heavily with gold and heads back home As this man loaded with gold approaches his home his father and mother seeing him in the distance coming back with a load of gold exclaim  Welcome good son Come quickly good son Thanks to this gold you will make a good living support your father and mother and sustain your wife children your male and female servants and messengers Furthermore you can make offerings to renunciants and brahmins make merit and uplift  good fruits and good results being reborn in heaven and enjoying longevity the man loaded with hemp returns to his home his father and mother seeing him in the distance coming back with a load of hemp reprove him saying Here you come criminal Here you come man without virtue With this hemp you will not make a living or support your father and mother or sustain your wife children male and female servants and messengers Neither can you make offerings to renunciants and brahmins make merit and uplift  good fruits and good results or be reborn in heaven and enjoy longevity Pāyāsi you should know that such is also the case with you If you hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion and do not let go of it you will be subject to immeasurable misfortune and be abhorred by many people King Pāyāsi again said Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says I still hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion I am utterly unable to let go of it Why is that If other people in other countries heard of this they would say King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time but he has been refuted defeated and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa For this reason Kassapa I hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion I am utterly unable to let go of it Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi listen while I tell you another parable The wise on hearing a parable understand its implication  Suppose Pāyāsi some merchants and a crowd of associates with a thousand carts are traveling on a road of scarce provisions The crowd has two leaders They think How can we get out of this trouble They think further This crowd should be divided into two groups of five hundred carts each So those merchants divide into two groups of five hundred carts each Then one leader of the merchants leads five hundred carts along the road of scarce provisions That merchant leader often goes ahead  He sees a man coming from a side road with his clothes all wet with dark body yellow head and two deep red eyes wearing a garland of hibiscus flowers and driving a donkey cart whose two wheels are splashed with mud On seeing him the merchant leader asks Has it been raining on the road of scarce provisions Is there new water firewood and grass  That man replies a There has been a great deal of rain on the road of scarce provisions There is plenty of new water firewood and grass Friend throw away the water firewood and grass that you already have so as not to tire your vehicles You will find new water good firewood and grass before long Hearing this the merchant leader returns to the merchants and says As I was going ahead I saw a man coming from a side road with his clothes all wet with dark body yellow head and two deep red eyes wearing a garland of hibiscus flowers and driving a donkey cart whose two wheels were splashed with mud I asked him Has it been raining on the road of scarce provisions Is there new water firewood and grass  He replied to me saying There has been a great deal of rain on the road of scarce provisions Friend throw away the water firewood and grass that you already have so as not to tire your vehicles You will find new water good firewood and grass before long Merchants let us throw away the water firewood and grass  that we already have We will find new water firewood and grass before long Let us not tire our vehicles So those merchants throw away the water firewood and grass that they already have After one days journey they find no new water firewood or grass After two days  three days  even after seven days of travel they still find no new water firewood or grass After seven days have passed they are killed by maneating ghosts The second merchant leader thinks The first merchant leader has crossed over the danger By what means can we now overcome the hardships Having thought thus the second merchant leader proceeds along the road of scarce provisions together with the five hundred carts The second merchant leader goes ahead by himself He sees a man coming from a side road with his clothes all wet with dark body yellow head and two deep red eyes wearing a garland of hibiscus flowers and driving a donkey chart whose two wheels are splashed with mud On seeing him the second merchant leader asks Has it been raining on the road of scarce provisions Are there new water firewood and grass  That man replies There has been a great deal of rain on the road of scarce provisions There is plenty of new water firewood and grass Friend throw away the water firewood and grass that you already have so as not to tire your vehicles You will find new water good firewood and grass before long Hearing this the second merchant leader returns to the merchants and says While I was going ahead I saw a man coming from a side road with his clothes all wet with a dark body yellow head and two deep red eyes wearing a garland of hibiscus flowers and driving a donkey cart whose two wheels were splashed with mud I asked him Has it been raining on the road  of scarce provisions Are there new water firewood and grass  b He replied There has been a great deal of rain on the road of scarce provisions Friend throw away the water firewood and grass that you already have so as not to tire your vehicles You will find new water good firewood and grass before long merchants we cannot throw away the water firewood or grass that we already have We should throw them away only if we find new water firewood and grass they do not throw away the water firewood and grass that they already have After one days journey they find no new water firewood or grass After two days  three days  even after seven days of travel they still find no new water firewood or grass While going ahead the second merchant leader finds that the first merchant leader and his merchants have been killed by maneating ghosts Seeing this the second merchant leader tells the merchants You see The first merchant leader was foolish ignorant poor in understanding and lacking wisdom He himself has been killed and all his people too have been killed Merchants if you would like to take the belongings of the first group of merchants do so at will Pāyāsi you should know that such is also the case with you If you hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion and do not let go of it you will be subject to immeasurable misfortune and also be abhorred by many people just like the first merchant leader and his merchants King Pāyāsi said again Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says I still hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion I am utterly unable to let go of it Why is that If other people in other countries heard of this they would say King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time but he has been refuted defeated and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa For this reason Kassapa I hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion I am utterly unable to let go of it  Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi listen while I tell you another parable The wise on hearing a parable understand its implication Suppose Pāyāsi that two men wanted to gamble with grains  The first player furtively eats the grains  The second player thinks I am playing against this man but he has cheated me many times furtively eating the grains once twice three times again and again Seeing this he tells his companion Now I want to rest Let us resume the game later Thereupon the second player leaves that place and smears the grains with poison Having smeared them he returns and tells his companion Come and the game with me So he comes and they play together Again the first player furtively eats the grains once twice three times again and again Having eaten the grains his eyes become vacant he foams at the mouth and is almost dying Then the second player utters this verse to the first player These grains are smeared with poison You ate them greedily without noticing You cheated me with the grains That was bound to make you suffer Pāyāsi you should know that such is also the case with you If you hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion and do not let go of it you will be subject to immeasurable misfortune and be abhorred by many people just as the player who cheated the other out of grains brought disaster on himself King Pāyāsi again said Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says I still hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion I am utterly unable to let go of it Why is that If other people in other countries heard of this they would say King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time but he has been refuted defeated and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa cTherefore Kassapa I hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion I am utterly unable to let go of it Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi listen while I tell you another parable The wise on hearing a parable understand its implication Suppose Pāyāsi a pig farmer while walking along a road sees a large amount of dry dung without an owner He thinks This dung can feed many pigs Let me take it load myself up and leave So he takes it and leaves On the way he encounters heavy rain The dung dissolving and oozing fouls his body but he keeps on carrying it along never discarding it Consequently he experiences immeasurable misfortune and is abhorred by many people You should know Pāyāsi that such is also the case with you If you hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion and do not let go of it you will experience immeasurable misfortune and be abhorred by many people just like that pig farmer King Pāyāsi again said Despite what the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa says I still hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion I am utterly unable to let go of it Why is that If other people in other countries heard of this they would say King Pāyāsi held his view for a long time but he has been refuted defeated and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa Therefore Kassapa I hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion I am utterly unable to let go of it a Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi listen while I tell you one last parable It will be good if you understand it If not I will not teach you the Dharma any more Suppose Pāyāsi a large pig the king of five hundred pigs while walking along a dangerous road encounters a tiger on the way On seeing the tiger the pig thinks  If I fight with this tiger he will definitely kill me If I run away in fear my kinsmen will slight me By what means can I get out of this trouble Having thought thus he tells the tiger If you want to fight I can fight with you If not then let me pass Hearing this the tiger tells the pig I allow you to fight with me I will not let you pass The pig says further Tiger wait a little while I put on the armor of my grandfathers time and then I will return to fight Hearing this the tiger thinks He is no match for me let alone in the armor of his grandfathers time So he tells the pig Do as you like Then the pig returns to his own cesspit and rolls around in feces smearing his body with it up to the eyes Then he goes to the tiger and says If you want to fight I can fight with you If not let me pass On seeing the pig the tiger thinks I never even eat food that has worms in it in order to protect my teeth so I certainly wont get close to this foul pig Thinking thus the tiger tells the pig I will let you pass rather than fight with you Having passed the pig utters a verse to the tiger Tiger you have four feet I too have four feet Come and fight with me What do you fear that you walk away Then on hearing this the tiger also utters a verse in response to the pig Your bristles stand up like a dense forest You lowest among animals Go away pig Quickly The stench of feces is unbearable Then the pig boasting utters another verse the two countries of Magadha and Aṅga Will hear that I fought with you Come and battle with me What do you fear that you walk awayb Hearing this the tiger uttered another verse With all the bristles on your body fouled Your stench chokes me pig If you want to fight for victory I now concede you victory Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi such is also the case with you If you hold on to this view out of desire aversion fear and delusion and do not let go of it you will be subject to immeasurable misfortune and be abhorred by many people just as the tiger conceded victory to the pig Having heard this King Pāyāsi said When the venerable one told the first parable about the sun and the moon I understood it on hearing it and joyfully received it with respect However I wanted to get further excellent and wise teachings from the venerable Kumāra Kassapa and for this reason I asked you again and again I now go for refuge to the venerable Kumāra Kassapa Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi you should not go to me for refuge I go to the Buddha for refuge You too should go to him for refuge King Pāyāsi said Venerable sir I now go for refuge to the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks May the venerable Kumāra Kassapa accept me on behalf of the Buddha as a lay follower From this day forth I take refuge until the end of my life Venerable Kumāra Kassapa from this day forth I will practice charity and make merit Venerable Kumāra Kassapa asked Pāyāsi you want to practice charity and make merit but how many people will you give to And how long will it last King Pāyāsi said I will give to a hundred people or even a thousand people for one day two days or even seven days Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said  King if you practice charity and make merit by giving to a hundred people or even a thousand people for one day two days or even seven days then renunciants and brahmins in the various directions will all hear that King Pāyāsi held on to his view for a long time but has been refuted defeated and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa Hearing this people in the various directions will all come from afar But if within those seven days some do not get to eat the food that the king gives in faith then the king will make no merit and will not get to experience longlasting happiness Suppose King Pāyāsi seeds that are neither broken nor spoiled neither split nor damaged not harmed by wind sun or water and that have been stored away safely since the autumn and suppose that a householder thoroughly ploughs a fertile field Having thoroughly prepared the land he sows the seeds at the appropriate time but there is no timely rain or other supply of water What do you think Pāyāsi Would those seeds germinate and grow He replied They would not Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi such is also the case with you if you practice charity to produce merit by giving to a hundred people or even a thousand people for one day two days or even seven days Renunciants and brahmins in the various directions will all hear that King Pāyāsi held on to his view for a long time but has been refuted defeated and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa Hearing this people in the various directions will all come from afar But if within those seven days some do not get to eat the almsfood that the king gives in faith then the king will make no merit and will not get to experience longlasting happiness King Pāyāsi asked further Venerable sir what should I do Venerable Kumāra Kassapa replied Pāyāsi you should practice charity and make merit by providing almsfood constantly If King Pāyāsi you practice charity and make merit c by supplying almsfood constantly then renunciants and brahmins in the various directions will all hear that King Pāyāsi held on to his view for a long time but has been refuted defeated and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa Hearing this people in the various directions will all come from afar and will be able to receive the almsfood that the king gives in faith Then the king will make merit and experience longlasting happiness Suppose King Pāyāsi seeds that are neither broken nor spoiled neither split nor damaged not harmed by wind sun or water and that were stored away safely in the autumn and suppose that a householder thoroughly ploughs a fertile field Having thoroughly prepared the land he sows the seeds at the appropriate time and there is timely rain or some other supply of water What do you think Pāyāsi Would those seeds germinate and grow He replied They would Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Pāyāsi such is also the case with you If you practice charity and make merit by providing almsfood constantly then renunciants and brahmins in the various directions will all hear that King Pāyāsi held on to his view for a long time but has been refuted defeated and made to abandon it by the renunciant Kumāra Kassapa Hearing this people in the various directions will all come from afar and all of them will be able to receive the almsfood that the king gives in faith Then the king will make merit and experience longlasting happiness a Thereupon King Pāyāsi said Venerable sir from now on I will practice charity and make merit by providing almsfood constantly Then with innumerable skillful means Venerable Kumāra Kassapa taught the Dharma to King Pāyāsi and to the brahmins and householders of Setavyā exhorting encouraging and delighting them Having with innumerable skillful means taught them the Dharma having exhorted encouraged and delighted them he remained silent Then after Venerable Kumāra Kassapa had taught the Dharma to King Pāyāsi and the brahmins and householders of Setavyā exhorting encouraging  and delighting them they got up from their seats paid homage to Venerable Kumāra Kassapa circumambulated him three times and departed Although King Pāyāsi practiced charity and made merit very bad coarse and inferior bean gruel and vegetables and only one piece of ginger He also gave coarse and inferior robes The kitchen supervisor at that time was named Uttara While practicing charity to produce merit on behalf of King Pāyāsi he asked some elder monks to make this aspiration If this charity brings retribution for merit let King Pāyāsi not experience it either in this life or the next King Pāyāsi heard that Uttara while practicing charity and making merit always asked some elder monks to make this aspiration If this charity brings retribution for merit let King Pāyāsi not experience it either in this life or the next Having heard this he sent for him and asked Uttara is it true that while practicing charity to make merit on my behalf you ask elder monks to make this aspiration If this charity brings retribution for merit let King Pāyāsi not experience it either in this life or the next Uttara replied Yes your majesty Why is that Although your majesty practices charity and makes merit very bad coarse and inferior bean gruel vegetables and only one piece of ginger Your majesty such food cannot even be touched by hands much less eaten your majesty gives coarse and inferior robes Your majesty such robes cannot even be stepped on with ones feet much less worn I respect your majesty rather than what is given Therefore your majesty I do not wish your majesty to experience the retribution for such inferior alms On hearing this King Pāyāsi said Uttara from now on you should provide food such as I eat and give robes such as I wear So from then on Uttara provided food such as the king ate and gave robes such as the king wore Then because of his supervising the practice of charity for King Pāyāsi Uttara was reborn at the breaking up of the body after death among the four divine kings King Pāyāsi for his practice of charity without sincerity was b reborn at the breaking up of the body after death in the empty palace of the Acacia Grove Venerable Gavampati often wandered near the empty palace of the Acacia Grove Venerable Gavampati saw King Pāyāsi in the distance and asked Who are you King Pāyāsi replied Venerable Gavampati have you ever heard that in the continent of Jambudīpa there was a king of Setavyā named Pāyāsi Venerable Gavampati replied I have heard that in the continent of Jambudīpa there was a king of Setavyā named Pāyāsi King Pāyāsi said Venerable Gavampati I was he originally named Pāyāsi Venerable Gavampati asked further King Pāyāsi held to this view this tenet There are no future lives beings are not reborn For what reason was he reborn here in the little empty palace of the Acacia Grove dependent on the four divine kings King Pāyāsi said Venerable Gavampati I did indeed hold this view but I had been refuted defeated and made to abandon it by the venerable renunciant Kumāra Kassapa If Venerable Gavampati you return to the continent of Jambudīpa please tell the people in the continent of Jambudīpa that when practicing charity to make merit they should give with sincerity give with their own hands give having gone there themselves give with steadfast faith give with understanding of deeds and the results of deeds So that they may not experience the results of charity in the manner of King Pāyāsi of Setavyā King Pāyāsi was a practitioner of charity but because he gave without sincerity he was reborn in the little empty palace of the Acacia Grove dependent on the four divine kings Then Venerable Gavampati consented by remaining silent Thereafter on his occasional descents to the continent of Jambudīpa Venerable Gavampati told people all over the continent of Jambudīpa Give with sincerity give with your own hands give having gone there yourselves give with steadfast faith give with understanding of deeds  and the results of deeds So that you may not experience the results of charity in the manner of King Pāyāsi of Setavyā King Pāyāsi was a practitioner of charity but because he gave without sincerity he was reborn in the little empty palace of the Acacia Grove dependent on the four divine kings This is what Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said Having heard what Venerable Kumāra Kassapa said King Pāyāsi the brahmins and householders of Setavyā and the monks were delighted and remembered it well It is considered with deference that when Lord Sakyamuni came to this Land o f Endurance the Eightfold Noble Path was first propagated and the Triple Gem was revealed to refute the books of all heretical schools hence the prevalence of the Buddhas teach ings The Vaipulya doctrine of the Ekayana and the Ten Stages of the Perfect Sect are known as the Great Dharma for the exposition o f the ultimate truth The parables of the magic city and the wearing of defiled clothes as well as the utilization of the cart drawn by a goat or the cart pulled by a deer are known as lesser learning as they are explanations of expedient gists As regards the practice of meditation the observance of the disciplinary rules and the employment of the art of incantation they are but myriad ways leading to the one goal of dispelling illusion and benefitting living beings Therefore the wise and holy ones of the successive dynasties admired and treasured them The Sutra spoken at eight assemblies is the fundamental text as it is the root o f the teachings while the Law that was taught in the three rotations of the Wheel of the Dharma is the branch as it signifies the offshoot As regards the rain of four kinds of divine flowers the earth quaking in six ways and the king untying the jewel from his topknot and exposing the hidden pearl in his garment they are metaphors for the refutation of the hypothesis of Three Vehicles by the One Buddha Vehicle and the absorption of the branches and offshoots into the root It is mentioned in the Fufazangzhuan Record of the causes of transmitting the Dharma Pitaka that the holy Ananda could memorize and recite all the Dharma Pitaka of the Tathagata as fluently as water pouring out from one vessel into another This was the teaching taught by Sakyamuni the Honored One to different audiences in accordance with circumstances on opportune occasions in the course of fortynine years of his preaching activities But when the Ajitavati River dried up and the scene of the grove of sala trees became gloomy the profound gist and abstruse theory almost came to extinction At the time when the fivelayer coffin was closed and wrapped in a thousand pieces of cotton cloth ready for crema tion our late Senior Brother Kagyapa lamenting over the loss of the Eye of Men and Celestials which left nobody behind to save living beings summoned the saintly monks to collect the subtle sayings  With the discourses of the upadesa as a basis they analyzed the theories of emptiness and substantiality They distinguished the views of annihilation and permanence to show the causes of cultivation and to elucidate the fruits of realization so as to provide an example for the people of the time and to serve as standard instruction for the future so that those who turned to them for advice might adhere to their teaching When Wang Zun and Qin Jing were sent as envoys tracing the light of the sun to seek the teachings of the Buddha KasyapaMatafiga and Dharmaranya came at their invitation to translate the scriptures and worked even in the moonlight Thereafter the guests who had shaved their heads and had sincere hearts spread their good reputation abroad and texts in the foreign tendrillike script engraved on palm leaves were elaborately trans lated in the Middle Land But thinkers might mistake the nature and aspects of the most abstruse and most spiritual theories and debaters might confuse the right and wrong of the subtle mysteries Moreover as we were further and further away from the Holy Buddha and as those o f his teachings that were brought in were mostly incomplete different carriages proceeded in com petition on different ways and each went separately on its own path When the Master was bom a bow was hung to signify the birth o f a son and the chamber was regarded as a symbol of response to the emptiness of life When he had grown up in the years of bumper harvests his heart corresponded with the sincerity of wonderful virtue He found that there was no ferry to go out o f the sea of desire but that a house was in the land of enlightenment for the spirit to dwell in Thus he cut off his hair changed his dress and fixed his faith upon the theory of the twofold voidness He travelled to other districts and mountains by boat and horse going a thou sand li He often regretted that the books obtained and used by ancient sages contained miswritten words that led to erroneous interpretations and that previous scholars heard and taught dubious points that gave rise to confusion in understanding I venture to say that under a tree where music has been performed there must be echoes of the bell and chime stone and in the five regions of India the meanings of the ancient texts must be preserved So the Master made such a firm resolve that he forgot his meals and crossed dangerous regions as fearlessly as if he were walking on level ground He defied a myriad of deaths to cross the Pamirs and the Ganges and for the sake of one word he travelled to the Amravana Garden At the Monkey Pond on Grdhrakuta Mountain he visited the holy sites and saw the won derful views At the Deer Park of the Hermits he sought for remnant texts among motheaten books Living through spring and autumn seasons of cold and hot weather he spent seven teen years in travelling through or hearing about one hundred thirty countries There he publicized the great exploits of our Emperor which shocked the powerful and influential persons of those countries He lowered the high carriages of the heretics and pulled down the big banners of those who studied with him under the same teacher Famous kings bowed their heads to him and superior friends associated with him He was the only person whose edification and morality will last through the ages When he had an interview with the Son of Heaven the latter inquired with solicitude about his journey and ordered by decree that the department concerned have the texts translated into Chinese Everybody showed respect and homage to him and it is hard to describe the events in detail As for the nobility of his lineal ascendants and clansmen his renunciation of his kinsmen to enter the religious life his travels far and near which were praised by the people in China and abroad his manifestation of repose to return to eternity and the extinction of the funeral flames with the exhaustion of the pyre things o f this kind are to be found in this biography This biography originally in five fascicles was composed by Huili a monk formerly residing at Guoxi Monastery in the region o f Wei With the secular surname of Zhao Huili was a descendant of Gongliu o f the region o f Bing and the son of Yi Personal Chronicler to the Emperor and Assistant Judicial Inspector of the Sui dynasty He was learned in Confucian and Buddhist lore and was good at writing compositions In debating his eloquence was as fluent as a piece of floating cloud and his thoughts overflowed like the gushing of a spring He was moreover frank in words and solemn in appearance never dreading any pressure or force He would go through fire and water dauntlessly to achieve his objects He saw the learning and practice of the Tripitaka Master and looked at his appearance and manners The more he tried to penetrate them the more unexpectedly firm they seemed to be and the more he looked up to them the higher above him they seemed to be Thus the events in the Masters life were written down to be bequeathed to posterity for a long time to come But when the manuscript was completed the author feared that some of the virtuous points might have been overlooked and so he had it stored in an underground chamber Later when he was seriously ill and his breath hung around the last moment counted by the bell and clepsydra he ordered his disciples to dig it up from the chamber but he died when the manuscript was about to be taken out I was then asked to compose a preface to it and was encouraged to put it in proper order Realizing how incompetent I am I declined the request Then I was told that the business of the Buddha Dharma should not be left to be done by a layman and that I should not insistently refuse to perform what was a task of virtue I yielded with a sense of shame and after considering the matter for a long time I spread out paper and took up my writing brush while shedding tears of worry and uneasiness Then I mixed the original text with supplementary annotations extending it into a work of ten fascicles as if I were putting dogs and goats among tigers and leopards and mingling shards and pebbles with jade and jasper I hope readers of posterity will not sneer at me The fifteenth day of the third month in the fourth year of Chuigong Beginning from His Birth at Goushi and Ending with His Arrival at Gaochang in the West The Master a native of Chenliu was named Xuanzang with the family name of Chen He was a descendant of Zhonggong who served as a magistrate of Taiqui Prefecture during the Han dynasty His great grandfather Qin was the Governor of Shangdang during the Later Wei dynasty His grandfather Kang a man of distinguished learning served in the court of Qi as a Professor of the National Academy living upon the revenue of Zhounan Thus his descendants made their home there and were also regarded as natives of Goushi His father Hui brilliant and spotless by nature with an elegant character mastered the classics at an early age With a tall figureeight feethe had handsome features perfect eyebrows and bright eyes He used to dress himself in a loose garment with a broad belt in the manner of a Confucian scholar Being compared by the people o f his time to Guo Youdao he was of a calm and simple nature and took no interest in official promotion Moreover as the political situation of the Sui dynasty was on the decline he devoted himself to the study of the ancient classics He was repeatedly offered the honorary post of xiaolian by the regional and prefectural authorities and was also summoned by the Emperor to take up the position of judicial inspector but he declined to accept either appointment on the excuse of ill health He had four sons of whom the Master was the youngest From his childhood the Master showed magnanimity of nature and outstanding brilliance Once when he was a child of eight his father who was sitting at a small table was teaching him orally from the Book o f Filial Piety When he came to the passage relating how Zengzi stood up respectfully from the mat on which he was sitting the Master got up and straightened his dress Being asked why he replied Since Zengzi stood to listen to the lectures of his teacher why should I sit comfortably while receiving instructions from my father His father was greatly pleased with the reply and had no doubt that his son would make great achievements in his life When he invited his clansmen and told them about th is incident they complimented him saying He is a filial son indeed This was an instance of the Masters precocity Afterward the Master was well versed in the classics loved ancient things and honored the sages He never read any book that was vulgar or improper and he never followed customs not prac tised by the saints and wise men He kept apart from other children and never set foot at the gate of the market place Even should there be a din of bells and drums in the street or a performance of singing and dancing watched by a crowd o f men and women in the lane he would not go out to behold it Since his youth he knew how to serve his parents with a cheerful counte nance in a mild and pure as well as honest and scrupulous manner His second elder brother Changjie a monk who lived in the Pure Land Monastery in the Eastern Capital observed that the Master was competent to receive instruction in the Dharma and brought him to his monastery to learn the scriptures He stood beside the gate of the government house when the envoy Zheng Shanguo who was the Lord of Justice a man able to discern other peoples talents saw him and found in him an unusual person He asked the lad To whose family do you belong The Master told him of his family He said to his official colleagues It is easy for one to complete ones studies in the scriptures but it is difficult for us to find a person of noble quality If we allow this lad to enter monastic life he will surely become a great man in the religion of Buddhism even though you and I gentlemen may not witness him soaring high in the clouds and sprinkling down Sweet Dew  Besides we must not neglect this scion of a distin guished family Considering what happened the words of Lord Zheng proved true Having become a monk the Master stayed with his elder brother At the time a reverend teacher Sengjing was preaching the Mahaparinirvana Sutra in the monastery The Master holding the scripture in his hands memorized what he had heard in the lectures so absorbedly that he even forgot to eat and sleep He also studied the Mahayanasamparigraha Sastra under the instruction of the reverend teacher Yan with even greater interest He could remember almost the whole text at the first reading and after the second reading he memorized the work without missing anything Astonished by his extraordinary talent the people invited him to mount the pulpit to repeat what the teacher had preached He gave a detailed exposition with full analysis in complete concordance with the gist of the teachers sermon He was then aged thirteen Afterward the House of Sui lost power and the country fell into a state of great turmoil The imperial capital became a nest of despots like Jie the Tyrant and brigands like Zhe the Bandit and the region between the Yellow River and the Luo River turned into a cavern for evil men as brutal as jackals and wolves Civilization collapsed and the Buddhist community dispersed White skele tons were scattered at crossroads and the region was depopulated no smoke came out of cooking stoves Even the tumult caused by the rebellions o f Wang Mang and Dong Zhuo and the catastrophic invasions of Liu Yuan and She Le did not surpass this in slaughter and devastation Although he was still a youth the Master realized the desir ability of adapting oneself to circumstances and he said to his elder brother Although this is the district of our parents there is no reason since it is in such a tumultuous condition why we should stay here and wait for death I have heard that the Emperor of Tang with the multitude of Jinyang under his command has occupied Changan and all the people of the country are flocking to him as if they were going to their parents I wish to go there with you to seek shelter His elder brother consented and they went to Changan in the first year of Wude  At that time as the foundation of the dynasty had just been laid and the war was still going on the urgent matter of the moment was the military art o f the strategists Sim Wu and Wu Qi It was no time for carrying on either Confucian or Buddhist activities Therefore to the Masters deep regret no preaching meeting was held in the capital Formerly Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty had constructed four monasteries in the Eastern Capital and invited wellknown monks of the country to live in them All those who were called in were men specializing in one or another particular subject of learning Therefore there had been an army of learned Buddhist scholars of whom Sengjing Zhituo Daoji and Baoxian were at the head During the last years of the Sui dynasty when the country was in chaos their support was cut off Most of them moved to the regions of Mian and Shu where a large number of Buddhist scholars assembled So the Master said to his elder brother As there is no more Dharma activity here we should not waste our time We should go to the region o f Shu to pursue our studies His elder brother consented and they again travelled through the Ziwu Valley and arrived at Hanchuan where they met with the two reverend teachers Kong and Jing both of whom were men of great virtue among the Buddhists Staying there for over a month they studied under the two teachers every day and then proceeded together to Chengdu At that time the whole empire was suffering from starva tion and disorder except the region of Shu where the people lived in peaceful abundance Therefore large numbers of monks came from all quarters of the empire to live there There were often several hundred people attending the preaching meetings The Masters intelligence and talent surpassed them all and his name became known in the regions of Wu Shu Jing and Chu The people respected and admired him for his learning and personality just in the same way as the ancient people had esteemed Li Ying and Guo Tai Consequently the Masters elder brother lived in the Konghui Monastery at Chengdu He was also a man of sturdy build with refined manners similar to those of his father He was fond of both Buddhist and worldly lore and had lectured on the Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Mahayanasamparigraha Sastra and the Abhidharmasamuccaya Sastra He was learned in the Shangshu and its Expositions and was especially erudite in the works of Laozi and Zhuangzi winning the estimation of the people of Shu His ability in writ ing his eloquence in discussion his magnanimity in manners and his capacity to edify people were not inferior to those of his younger brother But in loftiness of mind without defilement by impurities in researches into the metaphysical aspects o f the cosmos in ambition to clarify the universe with a mind to continue the tasks o f the saints to rectify collapsed principles and suppress evil customs in dauntless spirit in adverse circumstances and in sense o f selfrespect even in the presence of the Emperorin all these matters the elder brother did not show superiority over the younger one But both brothers led lives of purity in accordance with the monastic rules and had such good reputations that even the two brothers o f Lushan did not surpass them When the Master reached the age of twenty in the fifth year of Wude  he received full ordination at Chengdu where he spent the summer retreat and studied the Vinaya rules He learned the rules laid down in the five classifications and seven groups of the Vinaya by studying them only once Having completed his studies of all the scriptures and commentaries that could be found in the region of Yi he desired to go to the capital to make further studies of specialized subjects and to clear up the doubts that had embar rassed his mind But as this was prohibited by regulations his elder brother detained him and he could not fulfill his wishes Later he secretly sailed down the Three Gorges in company with some merchants and ran away along the Yanzi River until he reached Tianhuang Monastery at Jingzhou There the monks and laity having heard of his fame long ago asked him to preach sermons for them since he had favored them with his presence From summer to winter the Master lectured on the Mahayanasamparigraha Sastra and the Abhidharmasamuccaya Sastra each three times At that time the Prince of Hanyang a man of great virtue closely related to the imperial family was governor of that region He was very pleased to hear that the Master had arrived and paid homage to him in person On the first day of the preaching meeting when the title of the text was expounded the Prince went at the head of his group of officials learned monks and laymen to the assembly to observe the function Those who acquired a deeper understanding were moved to tears and the Prince also eulogized him in the highest terms After the conclusion of his preaching activities he travelled northward in search of erudite scholars of virtue On his way he reached Xiangzhou where he visited the reverend teacher Huixiu and inquired of him about the dubious points he had found in the texts Then he went to Zhaozhou and visited the reverend teacher Daoshen from whom he learned about the Satyasiddhi Sastra Then he entered Changan and stayed at the Great Enlightenment Monastery where he learned about the Abhidharmakosa Sastra from the reverend teacher Daoyue He grasped the essential mean ings o f all these texts by studying them only once and could memorize whatever had passed his eyes an ability unsurpassed even by senior scholars of deep learning He studied with such profundity that he could comprehend subtle meanings and reveal what was hidden in the texts when others failed to reach it Although the Master had gained achieve ments in the regions of Wu and Shu he continued after his arrival at Changan to pursue learning under their instruction but very soon he exhausted their store of knowledge Both the two teachers highly praised the Master and said to him You are indeed an outstanding person in the religion of Buddhism We regret to say that we are getting old and may not be able to witness your success After that his fellow students had a different opinion of him and his fame spread throughout the capital Having visited various teachers and learned their theories the Master scrutinized their teachings and found that each of them specialized in some particular sect When compared with the holy scriptures they showed differences either vaguely or manifestly so that he was at a loss to decide which of the theories he should follow Thus he resolved to travel to the West to clear his doubts and to bring back the Saptadasabhumi Sastra which is now known as the Yogacarabhumi Sastra to resolve the doubts o f all He also said Since Faxian and Zhiyan prominent figures of former times could travel to seek the Dharma for the benefit of all living beings why should there be nobody to follow in their foot steps so that the line of noble tasks should be discontinued The others withdrew from the attempt the Master alone did not give up his aspiration In preparation for the journey to be undertaken by himself alone and in view of the dangers on the road to the West he tested his resolution by inflicting upon himself various pains known in the world to temper his willpower He endured them all without flinching Then he entered a pagoda to say prayers and to make up his mind invoking all the saints to protect him with their divine influence so that he might go and return without encountering any obstacle When the Master was bom his mother had had a dream in which she saw him dressed in white going toward the West She said You are my son Where do you wish to go The Master replied I am going to seek the Dharma This was indeed a presage of his journey to the West In the eighth month in the autumn of the third year of Zhenguan  when the Master was about to start on his journey he prayed again for a good omen In the night he dreamed that he saw Mount Sumeru most beautifully made o f the four precious sub stances standing in the middle o f the great sea He desired to climb up the mountain but the billows were turbulent and there was neither boat nor raft in sight He was not daunted at all but decided to go into the sea Suddenly he saw stone lotus flowers emerging out of the waves below his feet When he turned back to look at the flowers they disappeared as soon as he lifted his feet In a moment he reached the foot of the mountain which was so precipitous that it was impossible for him to climb up While he was trying to ascend the mountain by leaping a strong whirlwind came and carried him up to the top of the mountain After that he started on his journey when he was twentysix years of age There was then a monk named Xiaoda from Qinzhou who had been studying the Mahaparinirvana Sutra in the capital and was about to return home after the completion of his learning So the Master travelled with him to Qinzhou where he stayed for one night and met a fellow traveller from Lanzhou with whom he journeyed to Lanzhou After spending one night there he met a man from Liangzhou who was sending back horses for official use and so he went there with that man He stayed there for more than one month and at the request of the local monks and laymen he expounded the Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Mahayanasamparigraha Sastra and the Mahaprajhaparamita Sutra Liangzhou the capital city of the Hexi region was a linking place with the western tribes and the various countries located to the east of the Pamirs Merchants came and went from there without intermission On the days when the Master was preaching many of them came to offer him gems and jewels with worship and praise After returning to their own countries they extolled the virtues of the Master in the presence of their rulers saying that he was coming to the West with the intention of seeking the Dharma in the Brahmanic countries So it was that the people of various cities in the Western Region made preparations in happy anticipa tion of his arrival On the day when the preaching meeting was concluded abun dant precious alma of gold and silver coins and a large number of horses o f good breed were offered to the Master but he accepted only half of the gifts for his own religious purpose and shared the rest with various monasteries At that time as the regime was newly established and the boundaries of the country were limited common people were prohibited from going to the regions of the western tribes Li Daliang the governor o f Liangzhou enforced the prohibition very rigorously under strict imperial decree It was reported to him that a certain monk from Changan intended to go to the coun tries in the West for an unknown purpose Out of fear the gov ernor questioned the Master about his intentions The Master told him that he intended to travel westward to search for the Dharma On hearing this the governor ordered him to return to the capital There was then a reverend teacher Huiwei a leader of the Buddhists in the region o f Hexi who was a man o f brilliant intelligence and great wisdom He respected the Master for his eloquence in preaching and deeply sympathized with him when he heard about his ambition of going to seek the Dharma He secretly sent two of his disciples Huilin and Daozheng to escort the Master furtively to the West Thus he dared not go out openly but hid himself in the daytime and travelled by night until he reached Guazhou where the prefectural governor Dugu Da was very pleased to hear the news of his arrival and treated him with good hospitality The Master inquired about the westbound route and was told that over fifty li to the north was the Hulu River which was broad at the lower reaches and narrow at its upper part As the current was rapid and the water deep it was impossible to ferry across Situated at its upper part was the Yumen Pass which was the only way for travellers to follow as it was the key to the West region Beyond the pass in the northwest were five watchtowers set apart at a distance of one hundred li from each other with garrisons stationed in them and there was neither water nor grass in between Beyond the five watchtowers was the Mohoyan Desert in the territory o f the country o f Yiwu On hearing this the Master was worried and disturbed and the horse he rode died at this juncture Not knowing what to do he brooded over the situ ation in silence for more than a month Before he could continue his journey a warrant of arrest arrived from Liangzhou stating that a monk by the name of Xuanzang was trying to enter the regions of the western tribes and that all prefects and magistrates through whose domain he might pass should take every precaution for his arrest Li Chang the prefect who was a pious Buddhist suspected that the Master was the wanted man He secretly showed him the warrant and asked him Is the reverend teacher not the man mentioned in it The Master hesitated and did not reply Li Chang said You must tell me the truth On hearing it Li Chang highly praised him as a man trying to achieve an unusual thing and said If you are truly trying to do what you have said I shall destroy this document So saying he tore the warrant to pieces in the presence of the Master but still he advised him You should leave here as soon as possible Now the Master worried all the more O f the two junior monks Daozheng had already gone to Dunhuang and only Huilin remained with him Knowing that he could not stand the hardships of the long journey ahead the Master dismissed him and let him go home He bought a horse but the trouble was that he had nobody to be his guide Before the image of Maitreya Bodhisattva of the monastery in which he was staying he prayed for a man who might guide him through the pass That night a monk of the Hu tribe named Dharma of that monastery dreamed that the Master was sitting on a lotus flower going west But he said to Dharma A dream is but a fancy and is not worth mentioning He again entered the shrine hall to pray Before long a man of the Hu tribe came to pay homage to the image of the Buddha He worshipped the Master by circumambulating him two or three times Being asked his name the man said that he was named Pantuo with the surname of Shi He begged for the conferment of the Precepts and was given the Five Precepts Greatly delighted the Hu man went away and returned in a moment with cakes and fruits Seeing that the man was intelligent and strong with a reverential manner the Master told him about his intention of taking the journey The Hu man consented to send him across the five watchtowers and this greatly pleased the Master He bought some clothes and a horse for the man and made an appointment with him On the following day when the sun was about to set the Master went to a bushland where he waited for the man Before long he arrived together with an old man o f the Hu tribe riding on an aged lean horse of reddish color At this sight the Master felt displeased But the young man said This old man knows the route to the West perfectly well He has travelled to and from Yiwu for more than thirty times I have brought him along in the hope that he might give you some counsel Then the old Hu man said The road to the West is perilous and the Sha River is an obstacle on the long way There are demons and hot wind Whoever encoun ters them cannot be spared from death Even if you travel together with a large group o f companions you might go astray or be lost How can you reverend teacher try to go all alone I ask you to consider the matter carefully and not gamble with your life The Master replied I started on my journey to the West for the purpose of seeking the Great Dharma I shall not return to the East before I reach the Brahmanic countries I shall not regret it even if I die on the way The old man said If you insist on going you had better ride my horse This horse of mine has travelled to Yiwu fifteen times It is sound and knows the way well Yours is too young to travel such a long distance Then the Master recalled that when he was about to start on his journey to the West from Changan there was a sorcerer named He Hongda whose witchcraft and divination were usually effec tive The sorcerer said You will be able to go and it seems that you will be riding on an aged lean horse of a reddish color equipped with a varnished saddle with a piece of iron at the front On seeing that the Hu mans horse was lean and reddish in color and that the varnished saddle had a piece of iron the Master deemed it appropriate to take it and so he changed his horse for that of the old Hu man who was quite pleased and went away after due salutation After having packed his outfit the Master started on the journey with the young Hu man At about the third watch they reached the river and saw the Yumen Pass at a distance They went up the stream for about ten li from the pass and came to a place where the banks of the river were over ten feet apart beside which there was a wood of tamarisks The Hu man cut some branches and built a bridge on which he spread grass and paved it with sand Then they drove their horses across The Master was glad to have crossed the river and he unsaddled his horse to take rest at a place more than fifty paces from the Hu man They spread their quilts on the ground to sleep After a little while the Hu man got up unsheathed his knife and slowly advanced toward the Master but he retreated at a distance of about ten paces Not knowing what he had in his mind and suspecting that he might have an evil intent the Master got up and recited scriptures and repeated the name o f Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva whereupon the Hu man lay down and slept When it was nearly daybreak the Master wakened the man to fetch some water for a wash At the moment when they were about to continue the journey after having taken breakfast the Hu man said Your disciple considers that the journey ahead is long and dangerous with neither water nor grass on the way As water can be obtained only at the five towers we have to reach them at night to steal water and pass along But once discovered we shall be dead men So it is safer to turn back But the Master was determined not to go back and so the Hu man proceeded with reluctance He took out his sword and drew his bow ordering the Master to go before him but the Master refused to precede him When they had gone a few li the man stopped and said Tour disciple cannot go any more I have a big family to support and moreover I dare not trespass against the law The Master knew his mind and let him go back The Hu man said You will certainly not be able to reach your destination What shall I do if you are arrested and I am involved in the matter The Master replied Even if I am cut to pieces I will never implicate you in my affair He then took a solemn oath and the man was satisfied The Master presented him with a horse out of gratitude for his service and they parted After that the Master travelled alone in the desert proceed ing slowly along the trail marked by skeletons and horse dung Shortly afterward he suddenly saw an army of several hundred men scattered all over the desert moving forward or halting for a while They were dressed in furs or coarse cloth and their camels and horses as well as banners flags and spears kept on changing their shapes every moment They were quite clear at a distance but gradually disappeared as they approached At first sight the Master thought them to be bandits but as they faded away when they came nearer he realized that they were bogies and demons He heard a voice in the air saying Have no fear After travelling a distance of more than eighty li he came in sight of the first watchtower Fearing that he might be seen by the watchmen he hid himself in a sandy ditch and remained there until nightfall Then he came to the west of the tower where he saw water He went down to have a drink and washed his hands and when he was about to refill his water bag an arrow whizzed through the air and nearly hit his knee A moment later another arrow was shot Realizing that he had been seen he said aloud I am a monk from the capital Seeing that he was really a monk they brought him in to see the captain Wang Xiang who ordered a lamp to be lit so he could see the Master He said He is not a monk from our region of Hexi It seems that he really comes from the capital Then he inquired of the Master what the purpose of his travel was The Master said in reply Did not the captain hear the people of Liangzhou say that a monk named Xuanzang intended to go to the Brahmanic countries to seek the Dharma The captain answered I heard that the teacher Xuanzang has returned to the East How is it that you have come here The Master took from his horse the petition he had written to the Emperor in which his name was written and showed it to the cap tain The captain believed him but still said The road to the West is long and perilous and you could never reach your destination But as I am a native o f Dunhuang I wish to send you back to that place There there is a reverend teacher named Zhangjiao who esteems wise and virtuous people I am sure he will be delighted to meet you Please go to his place The Master said in reply My native place is Luoyang and I have admired the Dharma since my youth I have studied under all the learned teachers of the two capitals and the talented monks in the regions of Wu and Shu and have mastered all their knowl edge In explaining and discussing Buddhist teachings I had the honor to be ranked among contemporary teachers If I were inter ested in g ain in g personal benefit and reputation those places would not be inferior to your Dunhuang But it was because I regretted that the Buddhist scriptures were incomplete and that the doctrines were ambiguous that I made a vow to go to the West to seek the bequeathed Dharma at the risk of my life without fearing the hardships and dangers of the journey Now you do not encourage me but advise me to go back Can that be a cause for us to free ourselves from worldly sufferings and realize nirvana If you have to detain me I am prepared to bear whatever punish ment you may mete out to me You must be tired now and should take rest until tomorrow I shall send you off and show you the way personally A bamboo mat was then spread to accommodate the Master for the night At dawn when the Master had taken his meal Wang Xiang ordered his men to fill his water bag provided him with wheat cakes and escorted him for a distance o f more than ten li He said to the Master By this route you may go straight to the fourth watchtower The man in charge there by the name of Wang Bolong is a man with a kind heart and a relative of mine When you reach there you may say that I sent you He took leave of the Master after paying homage to him with tears in his eyes After making his departure the Master came to the fourth watchtower by nightfall Fearing that he might be detained there he intended to get some water and pass along silently But before he could get down to fetch water an arrow flew near him So he made an announcement as before and went hurriedly to the tower from which some men came down and took him in In reply to the inquiries of the officer in charge of the tower the Master said I am on my way to India and Captain Wang Xiang of the first watchtower has sent me to come by this way Being pleased to hear this the officer lodged the Master for the night He presented to the Master a large water bag with some wheat as fodder for his horse saying You need not go to the fifth watchtower The man there is an imprudent fellow and he might give you trouble About a hundred li from here there is Wild Horse Spring where you can replenish your water bag Beyond this place was the Moheyan Desert which stretched more than eight hundred li This was what the ancients called the desert river where there was no bird flying above nor any beast roaming below neither was there any water or grass Now the Master had only his lonely shadow travelling with him and all he could do was repeat the name of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva and recite the Prajnaparamitahrdaya Sutra Formerly when the Mas ter was in the region of Shu he once saw a sick man suffering from a foul skin ulcer and dressed in rags With a feeling of pity he took the man to his monastery and gave him money to purchase clothes and food Being ashamed of himself the sick man taught the Master this sutra which he often recited After having travelled for more than a hundred li he lost his way and could not find Wild Horse Spring When he took down his water bag to have a drink it was so heavy that it slipped from his hands and the water that was to sustain him during his journey of a thousand li was spilled all at once He lost his way in the winding path and did not know which direction to proceed So he wished to return eastward to the fourth watchtower When he had gone about ten li he said to himself I vowed not to turn back even one step to the East before I reached India Why am I going back now I would rather die on my way to the West than return to the East and live Then he reined back his horse and proceeded toward the northwest whilst repeating the name of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva He looked around and saw nothing but the vast desert where there was not a man or even a bird to be seen In the night the evil spirits and demons sparkled as brightly as stars in the sky During the daytime surprising gales blew the sand up high and it fell down like a shower Although he encountered such circumstances he had no fear in his mind The trouble was the lack of water he was so thirsty that he could proceed no more For four nights and five days he had not a drop of water to moisten his throat and his mouth and stomach became dried up Being at the brink of death he could no longer move forward He lay down on the sand and repeated the name of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva and did not give up the repetition even in such a desperate situation He prayed to the Bodhisattva saying I am undertaking this journey not for the purpose of gaining wealth nor for winning reputation It was simply to acquire the supreme Right Dharma that I have come here I sincerely pray that the Bodhisattva will have mercy upon all living beings and save those who are in distress I am now in distress indeed Cannot you hear my prayers When he prayed in this manner his mind was concentrated without distraction At midnight on the fifth day a cool breeze suddenly came and made him feel as chilly as if he were taking a bath in cold water He was able to open his eyes and his horse also found its feet Being refreshed by the cool air he fell asleep for a while and dreamed that he saw a giant deity several tens of feet tall holding a spear and a flag in his hands The deity said to him Why are you sleeping here instead of forging ahead The Master was startled and awakened from his sleep and then he proceeded on his journey Having gone for about ten li his horse suddenly changed its course and would not turn back though he pulled hard at the reins A few li further on he caught sight o f a stretch of pasture several mou wide and dismounted to graze his horse When he had gone ten paces beyond the pasture and was about to turn back he came to a pond of clean and sweet water He went down to drink and thus his life was preserved and both he and his horse were invigorated One conjectures that this pasture and the water pond had not been there before but were produced out o f compassion by the Bodhisattva His sincerity of mind commu nicated with the divinities This was one of many such instances He rested for one day at the pasture and the pond and after refilling his water bag and gathering some grass he continued his journey on the following day Travelling for two more days he came out of the desert and reached the country of Yiwu The hardships he experienced were numerous and cannot be related in full detail Upon his arrival in Yiwu he stayed in a monastery in which lived three monks of Han descent The senior one was so excited that he forgot to dress himself properly and came out barefooted to receive the Master whom he embraced while crying piteously without restraint He said I never expected to have this oppor tunity to see a countryman again The Master also shed tears of sympathy for him The monks and the king of the Hu tribe came to pay their respects and the king invited him to his residence and entertained him with all kinds of offerings An envoy had been sent previously to Yiwu by Qu Wentai the king o f Gaochang On that day he was to go back and had the chance to meet the Master On his return the envoy reported this to the king Upon hearing this news the king immediately dis patched an envoy to request that the king of Yiwu send the Master to him At the same time he selected several tens of his best horses and appointed a high ranking minister provided with a herd of camels to set up rest houses along the way for the reception of the Master After about ten days the envoy arrived and conveyed the kings invitation with salutation and much sincerity Originally the Master had planned to go by way of the Khan Stupa But now that he was invited by the king of Gaochang and could not decline the invitation he travelled across the South Desert After spending six days on the way he reached the city of Paili in the domain of Gaochang As the sun had already set the Master wished to halt for the night The officials of the city and the envoy said The royal city is near Please proceed ahead The Master changed good horses several times on the way leaving behind the reddish horse which he had ridden before to be sent to him later At midnight he arrived at the royal city The gatekeeper reported it to the king who ordered him to open the gate and the Master entered the city The king and his attendants with candles in their hands and walking in a line came out of the palace to receive the Master and ushered him to sit behind a precious curtain in a storeyed pavilion in the inner court The king worshipped him and asked him about his journey in a very cordial manner saying Since I your disciple heard the name of the Master I have been so happy that I have forgotten to sleep and take food Computing the distance of the way I guessed that you would arrive tonight and so my wife and I did not sleep but waited for your arrival while we recited scrip tures In a moment the royal consort and several tens of her attending maids came to pay homage to the Master When it was nearly daybreak he felt tired after so much talking and wished to retire Then the king returned to his palace leaving some eunuches behind to attend the Master Early next morning before the Master had arisen the king and the queen together with those below them in rank came to the door of his chamber to pay their respects to him The king said Con sidering that the way through the desert is hard to travel I deem it a great wonder that you could have come all alone He praised the Master with tears of emotion and could not restrain himself When the Master had taken his breakfast the king personally led him to a monastery situated by the side of the palace and appointed eunuches to serve him In that monas tery there was a reverend teacher Tuan who had studied at Changan and understood well all aspects of the Dharma The king esteemed him and invited him to come to see the Master and he came out in a moment The king also ordered the royal teacher who was over eighty years old to live with the Master in order to persuade him to stay and give up his westward journey But the Master did not consent After staying there for more than ten days the Master wished to take his leave The king said I have asked the royal teacher to extend my invitation What do you think of it The Master said in reply It is really a great favor from the king that I have been asked to remain here But in consideration of my intention of taking the journey I must not do that The king said I have travelled to the Great Country with the late king and have visited together with the Emperor of the Sui dynasty both the east and the west capitals as well as the regions of Yan Dai Fen and Jin I will order all the people of my country to be your disciples and receive your instructions Though we may not have many monks here they still amount to several thousand I will ask them to hold the scriptures and be your audience I sincerely pray that you will consider and accept my humble suggestion and give up the idea of travelling to the West The Master declined the invitation saying How can a man poor in virtue such as I be worthy to accept the kings kind hospitality That was why I decided to travel to the West at the risk of my life in order to seek the teachings that I have not heard before so that not only will the Sweet Dew of the Vaipulya scrip tures have been sprinkled at Kapilavastu but also the sublime truth of discrimination may be known in the eastern country The aspiration of Sadapralapa inquiring after the Way and the wish of Sudhana looking for friends should be strengthened day after day and must not be abandoned halfway I hope Your Majesty will recall your words and not bother about my personal welfare The king said As I your disciple have a great adoration for the Master I will decidedly invite you to stay here so that I may make offerings to you Even if the Pamir Range could be moved my mind would not be changed Please believe in my sincerity and do not doubt my earnestness To this the Master responded It needs no repeated explana tion to understand Your Majestys deep kindness But as I have come here on my way to the West to seek the Dharma I must not stop halfway before I have found it That is why I respectfully decline your kind offer and I hope that Your Majesty will have sympathy with me Moreover it was due to the superior blessed ness that Your Majesty had cultivated in previous lives that you became a lord of men upon whom not only your subjects but also the religion of Buddhism rely for support Is it appropriate for you to be a hindrance to its propagation The king said I dare not obstruct the propagation of Buddhism It is only because we have no teacher in our country to guide us that I wish to keep you here to enlighten the deluded and the ignorant The Master would not consent to stay in spite of the kings entreaties Thus the king changed his countenance and rolled up his sleeves while shouting Your disciple has other ways to deal with the Master How can you go by yourself Either you must stay or I shall send you back to your country Please consider the matter well I think it is better for you to comply with my wish The Master said in reply I have come on my way to seek the Great Dharma and now I encounter an obstacle Even so the king did not allow him to go but increased the amount of offerings presented to him Every day at mealtime the king held a tray of food with both hands to serve the Master Having been detained against his own wish the Master refused to take any food in the hope that the king would change his mind He sat erect and did not drink even a drop of water for three days On the fourth day the king found that his breath had become very feeble and feeling deeply ashamed of himself and afraid the king worshipped him and apologized saying I will allow you to go to the West Please take food immediately Fearing that the kings words were untrue the Master asked him to take an oath with his finger pointing at the sun The king said If you wish me to do that we had better strengthen our relationship before the image of the Buddha So they went together to the temple to worship the Buddha and in the presence of the Queen Mother Zhang the king acknowledged the Master to be his brother and said to him I will let you go to seek the Dharma But on your return journey you must come to stay in this country for three years to receive my offerings When you become a Buddha in the future let me be your patron and supporter just as the two kings Prasenajit and Bimbisara were to the Buddha The Master was still pressed to stay for another month to preach on the Prajnaparamita Sutra o f the Benevolent King The Master consented to this request to the great delight of the Queen Mother who wished to be always related with the Master so that they could help one another in all future lives This was an instance of his firmness of resolution Two days later the king pitched a special big tent large enough to accommodate three hundred persons for the Master to preach in The Queen Mother and those below her in rank including the king the royal teacher and the ministers sat on different seats to listen to the sermon At each time of preaching the king holding a thurible in hand ushered the Master to the tent When the Master was ascending the pulpit the king knelt down to serve as a stool for him to step up to the high seat and this he did every day After the conclusion of the preaching the king gave permission for the ordination of four sramaneras to serve the Master as his attendants Thirty suits of religious garments were made and as the climate in the lands of the West was mostly cold some face covers gloves boots and stockings were also prepared One hun dred taels of gold thirty thousand silver coins and five hundred rolls of silk and satin were provided for the Master as funds to last him twenty years on his journey to and from the West Thirty horses and twentyfive carriers were allotted to him Huanxm the palace attendant and royal secretary was ordered to escort him to the yamen of Shehu Khan The king also wrote twentyfour letters to Kucha etc twentyfour countries and to each letter was attached one roll of fine silk as a sign of credence Five hundred rolls of silk and two cartloads of fruits and edibles were presented to Shehu Khan with a letter in which the king said The Master who is my younger brother wishes to seek the Dharma in the Brahmanic countries May the Khan treat him with kindness as he would treat me I would also request that you issue orders to the countries in the West to send the Master out of their domains from stage to stage by corvee horses Upon seeing that the king sent him the sramaneras and provided him with credentials and rolls of silk the Master felt thankful for the rich farewell gifts and wrote a letter to the king to express his gratitude I Xuanzang have heard that one has to depend upon a boat with oars to cross deep and farstretching rivers and seas Just in the same way one has to depend on the holy teach ings to guide one out of the doubts that puzzle the minds of living beings Therefore the Tathagata was born into this world of impurity with a mind of great compassion like a mothers love of her only son and he illuminated this world of darkness with the Sun of Wisdom of the Three Clear Insights The clouds of compassion covered the top of the sky and the rain of the Dharma moistened the Three Thou sand Worlds His bequeathed teachings have been spread to the East for more than six hundred years KasyapaMatahga and Sanghavarman glorified the Dharma in the regions of Wu and Luo while Dharmaraksa and Kumarajiva embellished it in the districts of Qin and Liang upholding the mystic teachings and helping to maintain superior deeds But as the transla tors came from distant lands their interpretations differed and as the time of the Buddha has gone far his doctrines have been misinterpreted Thus the unique teaching that he left at the twin sala trees has been divided into the two views of substantial ego and substantial dharma and the unequalled doctrine o f the Mahayana has been split into the Southern and Northern Schools Dissensions and dis putes have lasted for several hundred years and doubts have prevailed in the whole country without anybody to provide a solution By the lucky causes of my previous lives I have been able to enter the Order at an early age and have studied under various teachers for nearly twenty years Although I knew that one could not examine the sky through a small tube or measure the sea with a calabash shell I still could not abandon my humble idea Thus I made preparations and started on my journey and with the passage of time on my way I gradually reached Yiwu Being endowed with the pure harmony of Heaven and earth and gifted with the good spirit of the cosmos Your Majesty reigns in prosperity and rules over his subjects as if they were his sons You follow the manners of the Great Country in the East and observe the customs of the hundred tribes in the West The lands of Loulan and Yuezhi and the countries of Cheshi and Langwang are all under the influence of your deep kindness and great virtue Moreover you esteem sages and love scholars and you like what is good and treat people with benevolence For those who come from afar you show sympathy and consideration and ex tend a hospitable reception Since my arrival you have favored me with deep kindness and granted me the honor of expounding the Dharma You have also condescended to be related to me as a brother and promoted the sentiment of fraternity You have provided me with letters of introduction written in warm and enthusiastic terms to more than twenty states in the Western Region requesting them to send me out of their domains stage by stage Considering that I shall have to travel alone on my way to the West through snowy roads in cold climates you have issued an explicit order for the ordination of four sramaneras to be my attendants and companions and provided me with more than fifty articles such as religious robes cotton hats fur blankets and boots and stockings as well as rolls of silk and satin and gold and silver money for my travelling expenses enough to sustain me for twenty years on my outward and homebound journeys The outflow of the Jiao River is comparable to the amount of your kindness and the mountains of the Pamir Range are not weightier than the favors you have shown me If I may with your permission realize my wishes to whom shall I owe my achievement To no one but the kings favor After returning home I sh all translate the texts to spread what was not known before so as to clear the intricacies o f wrong views and to refute the misinterpretations o f heretical theories as well as to supplement the unknown part of the Buddhas teachings and to set a compass for entering the Gate of Truth As the way that lies ahead is far I cannot afford to stay here any longer I shall take leave of you tomorrow and th is makes me feel all the more sorrowful With m a n y th a n k s engraved on my memory I am writing this letter to express my deep gratitude The king said in reply Since you have consented to be my brother whatever we have in the country is our common property There is no cause for you to thank me On the day of departure the king and the monks together with the ministers and people all came out of the capital to send the Master off to the western suburbs of the city The king embraced him and cried piteously while the monks and lay people were all sorrowful and the voices bidding farewell resounded in the sub urbs The king ordered his queen and the people to go back while he accompanied by the monks each riding on a horse escorted the Master for several tens of li before he returned to the city The kings and nobles of the countries through which the Master passed all honored him in the same manner From here proceeding westward he crossed the towns of Wuban and Dujin and entered the country of Agni which was wrongly called Wuqi in olden times Beginning with the Country of Agni and Ending with the Country of Kanykubja Proceeding westward from here the Master reached the Teachers Spring in the country of Agni The spring was on a sandy rock by the south side of the road which was several tens of feet high and water flowed out halfway up the rock It was said by tradition that once several hundred merchants ran out of water on the way and were quite exhausted when they reached here and did not know what to do In the group there was a monk who had no travelling money but lived on alms given by the merchants The merchants discussed the situation and said As this monk serves the Buddha we offered a lm s to him so he could travel a long distance without carrying any sustenance with him Now we are in a desperate situation though he has shown no worry Let us go and tell him about it The monk said If you wish to get water each of you should worship the Buddha take the Three Refuges and observe the Five Precepts I shall then climb up the rock to get water for you As the merchants were in distress they all followed the monks advice When they had accepted the Precepts the monk said to them When I have climbed up the rock you should call out Teacher bring down water for us And tell me whatever amount of water you wish to have A few moments later when he had gone up the merchants did as he had told them and water flowed down profusely in an instant All the merchants were delighted and grateful but the teacher did not come down They went up to see and found that he was dead All of them old and young lamented sorrowfully and cremated the remains according to the custom of the Western Region At the spot where he had sat they piled up bricks and stones to make a stupa which was still there and the water was also still flowing sometimes in big quantities and sometimes less profusely according to the number o f travellers that passed by When there was no wayfarer it dwin dled to a mere dripping The Master and his companions spent the night beside the spring On the following day they resumed the journey and crossed the Silver Mountain which was very tall and wide and rich in silver mines This was the place where silver for making coins used in the western countries was produced On the west side of the mountain they encountered a group of bandits but when they had given them some valuables the bandits went away Then they proceeded to the place where the royal city was situated and spent one night on the bank of a river At that time several tens of Hu merchants who were fellow travellers being eager to do business before others secretly continued the journey at midnight After having gone about ten li they met robbers who killed them all not a single one escaped the disaster When the Master and his com panions came to the spot they saw the corpses of the merchants and saw that all their property was gone They were deeply grieved and sighed sorrowfully They proceeded gradually and saw the royal capital in the distance The king o f Agni and his ministers came to receive them and invited them to the city so as to make offerings to them But as his country had previously been invaded and harassed by Gaochang he bore a grudge against that country and refused to provide horses for the Master The Master spent one night there and passed on Proceeding forward he crossed two big rivers and walking several hundred li through a plain toward the West he crossed the boundary of the country of Kucha in old times wrongly called Qiuci When he was approaching the royal capital the king and his ministers as well as the virtuous monk Moksagupta and others came to receive him Besides them several thousand monks pitched tents outside the eastern gate of the city under which portable images of the Buddha were installed and the monks stayed there performing music On the arrival of the Master the m o n k s rose and greeted him and then they returned to their seats One monk held a tray of fresh flowers and handed it to the Master who received it and scattered the flowers in front of the image of the Buddha Having worshipped the image he sat down beside Moksagupta After he had taken his seat flowers were offered to h im and then he was entertained with grape juice At the first monastery he received flowers and fruit juice and he was treated in the same manner at the other monasteries one by one until sunset when the monks began to disperse There were several tens of people from Gaochang who had become monks in Kucha and lived in a separate monastery in the southeast part of the city As the Master came from their home country they invited him to spend the first night in their monas tery and he accepted their invitation while the king and the monks returned to their respective places On the following day the king invited the Master to the palace and offered him various kinds o f food among which were the three kinds of clean meat These the Master refused to take After the meal he went to Ascarya Monastery in the northwest of the city which was the residence of Moksagupta Moksagupta was a man of learning with elegance and intelligence respected as the teacher of the people of that country He had travelled in India and studied there for more than twenty years Although he had learned various scriptures he was most conversant with the Sabdhavidya The king and the people venerated him and regarded him as a unique person Upon the arrival of the Master Moksagupta merely treated him with the rites of hospitality due to a guest and did not take him to be a man knowing the Dharma He said to the Master We have in this country the Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Sastra the Abhidharmakosa Sastra and the Vibhasa Sastra which are good enough for you to study You need not bother to suffer the hardships of travel ling to the West In reply the Master inquired Do you have the Yogacarabhumi Sastra in this country Moksagupta said Why do you ask about that heretical book which no true Buddhist would care to learn At first the Master had deeply venerated him but upon hear ing these words he despised him as dust saying W e already have in our county the Vibhasa Sastra and the Abhidharmakosa Sastra but I found to my disappointment that the theories contained in them were superficial and the sayings shallow being not ultimate teachings That is why I have come with the intention of learning the Mahayana Yogacarabhumi Sastra As this sastra was com posed by Maitreya a Bodhisattva in his final incarnation how can you say that it is a heretical work Are you not afraid of falling into the bottomless hell That monk said You do not understand the Vibhasa Sastra and the other works How can you say that they are not profound The Master said in retort Does the teacher understand those works I understand all of them was the reply When he was unable to give adequate answers to further questions put to him his face changed color and he said You may ask me about other passages Another passage was then put to him but he was also unable to give a correct explanation He said This passage is not found in the sastra  At that moment the kings uncle Jnanacandra who had become a monk and was well versed in the scriptures and commentaries was sitting with them Being extremely ashamed of himself Moksagupta said Due to my senility I have forgotten it He was also asked about the other works but he could not give good explanations of them either As the snowy path through the Ice Mountains was not yet open the Master could not proceed on his journey and stayed in this country for more than sixty days Besides sightseeing he often went to have a chat with Moksagupta who would no longer sit in his chair when he saw the Master coming but would stand up or go away to shun him He said privately to his people It is not easy to answer the queries raised by this Chinese monk If he goes to India perhaps no young man in that country could surpass him This showed how he respected and praised the Master On the day of departure the king provided him with carriers and packhorses and together with the monks and lay people he came out of the capital city to see the Master off Proceeding westward from here for two days the Master met some two thousand Turkish bandits riding on horses They were trying to divide the spoils pillaged from wayfarers As they could not share the loot equally they fought among themselves and dispersed Again proceeding for six hundred li and crossing a small desert he reached the country of Baluka known as Gumo in olden times where he spent one night Again proceeding northwest for three hundred li and crossing a desert he reached the Ice Moun tains at the northern part of the Pamir Range The mountains were dangerously steep and so tall that they seemed to touch the sky Since the creation of the world they had been covered with ice and snow which had accumulated and turned into icicles and never melted in spring or summer Cold mist mingled extensively with the clouds and when one looked up one could see only a vast whiteness without limit Ice peaks a hundred feet high or tens of feet in breadth broke down and lay across the road rendering the rugged mountain path difficult to climb Moreover as the blasts sent the snowflakes flying one would tremble in the flurry though one had put on double shoes and heavy fur coats At the time of sleeping or eating there was no dry place to stop One could only hang the pot to cook food and sleep on the ice After seven days he came out of the mountainous region Three or four men out of every ten fellow travellers died o f hunger and cold and the bulls and horses suffered even more When he had come out of the mountainous region he reached a lake of pure water which was called the Hot Sea because the water in contrast with the Ice Mountains did not freeze hence the name but the water was not necessarily warm The lake was fourteen hundred or fifteen hundred li in circumference long from east to west and narrow from south to north a vast expanse of water with waves several tens of feet high without the agitation of a big wind Proceeding along the lake toward the northwest for over five hundred li he reached the city of Suyab at a time when the Turkish Yehu Khan was conducting a hunting expedition with a large troop of soldiers and horses The khan was dressed in a green silk robe with his hair exposed and wearing a turban of white silk about ten feet long that wrapped his forehead and hung behind his back More than two hundred attendant officials all with plaited hair and dressed in brocade robes surrounded him All his soldiers wore furs felt or fine woolen clothes carried spears and large army banners or held bows in their hands So many were his cavalry of packhorses that they stretched out of sight The khan was pleased to meet the Master and said I am going away for a short time and will return in two or three days After three days the khan returned and received the Master The khan stayed in a big tent decorated with dazzling golden flowers All the attendant officials dressed in magnificent brocade garments sat on mats in two long rows in front of the khan to attend upon him while armed guards stood at his back The sight was quite dignified and pompous though he was merely a lord living in a felt tent When the Master was about thirty paces away from the tent the khan came out to worship and receive him and after having exchanged greetings they entered the tent to take seats Being fire worshippers the Turks did not use wooden beds as wood contained the element of fire Out of respect they would not sit on wooden beds but simply sat on double mats spread on the ground They prepared a folding chair with an iron frame and a cushion on it for the Master to sit on In a moment an envoy from the court of Han and a messenger of Gaochang were ushered in They presented their credentials and other authenticating objects and the khan personally viewed them with much pleasure He asked the messengers to take seats and ordered wine to be served and music performed The khan drank with his ministers and the messengers while grape juice was separately prepared and offered to the Master The music of the alien tribes tinkled and clanged in symphony and although the melodies were foreign and lacked refinement they were quite amusing to the ear and delightful to the mind A moment later food was served consisting of cooked fish lamb veal and the like piled in front of them For the Master pure food was separately prepared including pancakes rice butter milk sugar honey grapes and other viands After the meal grape juice was offered and the Master was then asked to preach the Dharma Thus he taught them the Ten Good Deeds and to be kind to living beings as well as the paramitas  which are the Way leading to emancipation The khan bowed down and delightedly accepted the teachings with faith When the Master had stayed there a few days the khan urged him to remain in his country saying The teacher need not go to the country of Indica  where the climate is mostly hot The weather there in the tenth month is about the same as in the fifth month here in this country Judging from your appear ance I fear that you would melt in the hot temperatures The people there are dark in color and have no manners and it is not worthwhile for you to see them The Master said in reply My intention in going there is to visit the holy sites and acquire the Dharma with a mind of adoration Thus the khan issued an order to find among his army men someone who could speak the Han language and the dialects of different countries The khan also presented the Master with a suit of religious robes made of red damask silk and fifty bolts o f fine silk and together with his ministers he went more than ten li to see the Master off From here proceeding westward for more than four hundred li the Master reached Bingyul meaning Thousand Springs The place was several hundred li in circumference with m any lakes and ponds and abundant trees of rare species The dense forests made the place cool and moist it was the summer resort of the khan From Bingyul going westward for one hundred fifty li he reached the city of Taras Then going southwest for two hundred li he came to the city of White Water two hundred li further to the southwest to the city of Gongyu and fifty more li to the south to the country o f Nujkend Another two hundred li toward the west he came to the country of Shash  which bordered on the Yaxartes in the west Another thousand li or so to the west he reached the country of Sutrsna which bordered on the Yaxartes in the east This river had its source in the northern plateau o f the Pamir Range and flowed toward the northwest Proceeding northwest he entered a great desert where there was neither water nor grass and he pushed on past the skeletons that marked the way After travelling for more than five hundred li he reached the country of Samarkand  where the king and the people did not believe in Buddhism but worshipped fire as their path There were two monasteries but no monks lived in them If a guest monk came to take lodging in them the Hu people would drive him out with fire and would not allow him to stay When the Master first arrived the king received him with arrogance After staying for one night the Master told the king about the law of cause and effect among human and heavenly beings and about the blessedness and advantages of worshipping the Buddha and praising his merits Being delighted the king asked to observe the Precepts and treated the Master with hospi tality and respect When the two attendant sramaneras went to the monasteries to worship the Buddha they were driven out with fire by the Hu people The sramaneras returned and informed the king about it Upon hearing this the king ordered the arrest of the people who had attempted to burn them After the culprits were arrested the king ordered that their hands be cut off in an assem bly of his people The Master who always desired to admonish others to do good could not bear to see them mutilated and rescued them The king then had them heavily flogged and driven out of the capital Since then all the people high and low reverentially believed in Buddhism and a great meeting was held to ordain some men to be monks and live in the monasteries In this manner the Master reformed the wicked and enlightened the ignorant wherever he went Going further west for more than three hundred li he reached the country of Kusanika going further west for more than two hundred li he reached the country of Kharghan known as the Eastern An Country going further west for four hundred li he reached the country of Bukhara known as the Middle An Coun try going further west for over one hundred li he reached the country of Vadi  going further west for five hundred li he reached the country of Horismika which bordered on the Oxus in the east going further southwest for more than three hundred li he reached the country of Kusana  and going southwest for another two hundred li he entered a mountainous region The path among the mountains was long and dangerous passable by only one person and there was neither water nor grass Going among the moun tains for more than three hundred li he entered the Iron Gate of which the peaks were narrow and precipitous and the rocks rich in iron ore A door was made upon the rocks and on the door leaves were suspended many iron bells hence its name This was a frontier fortress of the Turks Going out o f the Iron Gate he reached the country of Tukhara wrongly called Tuhuoluo in olden times Proceeding from here for several hundred li he crossed the Oxus and reached the country of Ghur which was the residence of the Tardu Shad  the eldest son of Yehu Khan and the husband of the younger sister of the king of Gaochang The king of Gaochang had sent him a letter but when the Master arrived the Khatun who was the princess of Gaochang was dead and the Tardu Shad was ill Upon hearing that the Master had arrived from Gaochang from whence he had already received a letter he could not refrain from sobbing with the male and female members of his family He granted an interview to the Master and said to him This disciples eyes are opened upon seeing the teacher I wish you would stay here and take rest for some time When I am recovered I will personally escort you to the Brahmanic countries At the same time an Indian monk arrived and cured him gradually by reciting incantations The Khatun whom the Shad married later was a young woman and she poisoned her husband at the instigation of the son of a former queen Since the Shad was dead and the son o f the Princess of Gaochang was under age the Tagin prince who was the son of the former queen usurped the position of the Shad and married his stepmother Because of the funeral services the Master sojourned there for more than a month In that country there was a monk named Dharmasamgha who had studied in India and was regarded as a teacher of the Dharma by the people west of the Pamir Range None of the m o n k s of Kashgar and Khotan were competent to discuss the Dharma with him Wishing to know the profundity of his knowledge the Master sent a man to ask him how many scriptures and commentaries he could understand Upon hearing this question the monks disci ples were enraged but he said with a smile I understand every thing and you may ask me any question as you wish Knowing that he had not learned about Mahayana Buddhism the Master queried him about a few points concerning the Hinayana Vibhs Sstra but the monk was not well versed in that treatise Thus he apologized and admitted his incompetence in learning and all his disciples felt abashed Since then he was pleased each time he met the Master and praised him in all places saying that he was inferior to the Master in learning When the new Shad had been installed the Master asked him to provide a guide and corve horses as he wished to proceed southward to the Brahmanic countries The Shad said In your disciples domain there is the country of Balkh bordering on the Oxus in the north People say that it is the city of Small Rjagrha where there are many holy sites I wish the Master would visit that place for some time and then take horses to go southward There were then several tens of monks coming from Balkh to express condolence on the death of the late Shad as well as to offer congratulations upon the installation of his son When the Master met them he told them his intention They said You may come straight with us There is a good road If you come here again you would go a roundabout way to no purpose The Master accepted their advice and after taking leave of the Shad he took horses and went away with the monks When the Master arrived there he saw that the city was prominent and the suburbs spacious with rich and fertile fields It was indeed a superb land There were a hundred monasteries with some three thousand monks all of whom studied Hinayana Buddhism Outside the city to the southwest was the Navasamghrma  which was very beautifully deco rated In the Buddha hall of the monastery there was a bathing jug used by the Buddha more than one dou in capacity There was also a Buddha tooth one inch long and eight or nine fen in breadth of a yellowish white color and it often issued an auspicious light There was also a broom made of kusa grass that had been used by the Buddha It was over three feet long and about seven inches round and its handle was adorned with various kinds of gems These three objects were always exhibited on festival days for the monks and laity to see and worship Those who had a sincere mind might cause them to issue a divine light To the north of the monastery there stood a stupa more than two hundred feet high To the southwest of the monastery there was a hermitage built many years ago Those who lived there to practise the Way and attain the four fruitions never ceased from generation to genera tion After their nirvanas stupas were built in memory of them and the foundations of the stupas several hundred in number touched one another Going northwest from the great city for fifty li the Master reached the city of Trapusa and forty li to the north of this city was the city o f Bhallika in which there were two stupas thirty feet in height Formerly when the Buddha had just attained enlighten ment he received parched flour and honey from two Elders who were the first to hear about the Five Precepts and the Ten Good Deeds As they requested something for them to worship the Tathagata gave them some of his hair and nail parings for them to build stupas around and he also told them how to construct stupas The two Elders brought the relics back to their own coun tries and built these caityas Over seventy li to the west of the city was a stupa more than twenty feet high which was built at the time of Kasyapa Buddha in the past In the Navasamgharama there lived a Hinayana Tripitaka teacher named Prajnakara  Upon hear ing that Balkh had an abundance of holy sites he had come here to pay homage to them Young and brilliant he was an intelligent and welllearned man He studied well the scriptures of the Nine Sections and thoroughly mastered the Four Agamas On hear ing that the Master had come from a distant land to seek the Dharma he was delighted to meet him Thus the Master inquired of him about the dubious points he had found in the Abhidharmakosa Sastra the Vibhasa Sastra and some other works and the answers were very accurate and proficient So the Master stayed there for more than one month to study the Vibhasa Sastra with him In this monastery there were also two other Hinayana Tripitaka teachers Dharmapriya and Dharmakara  who were highly respected by the people of that country On seeing the Masters brilliant and elegant manners they held him in great esteem To the southwest of Balkh were the countries of Zumathan and Guzganan When the kings of these countries heard that the Master had come from a distant land both of them dispatched illustrious ministers to invite him to their countries to receive offerings but he declined to go Then the envoys came again and again so that he could not but accept the invitation The kings were overjoyed and offered him gold gems food and drink But he returned without accepting anything Going south from Balkh the Master entered the country of Gaz together with the Dharma teacher Prajnakara and they entered the Great Snow Mountains in the southeast After travel ling for more than six hundred li they came out of the territory of Tukhara and entered the country of Bamlyan which was two thousand li from east to west and was situated in the Snow Mountains The path was rough and dangerous much more so than in the Ice Mountains and the desert The frozen clouds and flying snowflakes never cleared up for a moment and in the worst places the flat path was only a few score feet in length Thus when Song Yu had said that the way to the West was so difficult that one had to pass over ice piled up high one layer upon another and pass through flying flakes of snow for a thousand li this was the place he was referring to Who would travel in this place at the risk of losing ones body which one had inherited from ones parents if it were not for acquiring the supreme Right Dharma for the benefit of all living beings Formerly when Wang Zun climbed up the Ninewinding Slope he claimed to be a loyal minister of the royal house of Han Now as the Master set foot in the Snow Mountains for the purpose of acquiring the scriptures he might well be called a true son of the Tathagata Going gradually on the Master reached the capital of Bamiyan where there were more than ten monasteries with several thou sand monks who were followers o f the Hinayana Lokottaravada school The king of Bamiyan came out to receive him invited him to his palace and entertained him for several days before he left the palace There were two learned monks Aryadasa meaning Holy Servant and Aryasena of the Mahasamghika school who were well versed in the theories o f the Dharmalaksana sect When they saw the Master they were amazed to know that there was such a monk as the Master in a country so far away as China They guided him with much hospitality so that he could see and worship all places To the northeast of the royal city at the foot of a hill there was a standing rock statue one hundred fifty feet in height To the east of the statue there was a monastery and east of the monastery there was a standing bronze image of Sakyamuni Buddha a hundred feet tall Inside the monastery there was a recumbent image of the Buddha a thousand feet in length in the posture of entering nirvana All these images were magnificently adorned From here going southeast for over two hundred li he crossed the Great Snow Mountain and reached a small river where there was a monastery in which there were preserved a Buddhas tooth a tooth of a Pratyekabuddha who lived at the beginning of the present kalpa five inches long and less than four inches wide a tooth of a Golden Wheel King three inches long and two inches wide an iron alms bowl used by Sanakavasa wrongly given as Sanavasa in old times with a capacity of eight or nine sheng and his samghati robe of a deep red color For five hundred lives this person always wore this robe whether he was in the intermediate state or in the corporal form of existence and he was always born with it Later it became the kasaya robe of which the story is related in detail in another work After travelling for fifteen days the Master came out of Bamiyan Encountering a snowstorm for two days he lost his way and came to a small sandy ridge where he met a hunter who showed him the way Thus he crossed the Black Mountain and reached the domain o f Kapisa This countiy was more than four thousand li in circum ference with the Snow Mountains at its back in the north The king was of the ksatriya caste and was a resourceful and influential person ruling over more than ten countries When the Master was approaching the capital the king and the monks came out of the city to welcome him There were more than a hundred monasteries and the monks vied with one another in inviting him to stay with them There was a Hinayana monastery with the name of Salaka According to tradition it was built at the time when a prince of the Chinese Emperor was staying here as a hostage The monks of this monastery said Our monastery was built by a son of the Chinese Emperor and now as you have come from that country you should first come and stay in our monastery Because of their deep hospitality and because his companion the Dharma teacher Prajnakara a Hinayana monk did not wish to live in a Mahayana monastery the Master accepted the invitation and stayed in their monastery When the hostage prince built this monastery he buried a large amount of valuables under the feet of the South Devaraja at the eastern gate of the Buddha courtyard as a fund reserved to defray the cost of repairing the monastery in the future Out of gratitude the monks painted portraits of the hostage prince every where on the walls of the monastery and they also preached and recited the scriptures for his benefit at the inception and conclu sion of each rainy season This had been done generation after generation without cease until the present time Recently an evil king who was covetous and cruel intended to seize the treasures of the monks but when he ordered his men to dig at the feet of the deity the earth quaked severely The figure of a parrot on the top of the deity flapped its wings and screamed in alarm when it saw the men digging in the ground The king and his soldiers lost consciousness and fell to the ground and at last they retreated in fear As the wheel signs of the stupa in the monastery were dilapi dated the monks wished to take out the valuables to pay for the reconstruction of the stupa The earth quaked again with roars and none dared to approach the hidden treasure When the Master arrived the monks assembled and told him about this event that had occurred before The Master went with them to the place of the deity and prayed to him with the burning o f incense saying When the hostage prince reserved this treasure he meant to spend it for performing meritorious deeds It is now the right time to open it and put it to use I hope you will realize our sincerity of intention and relax just a bit the virtue of your might and dignity If I can obtain your permission I shall personally see to the treasure and open it and find out the exact amount to be handed over to the authorities to repair the stupa properly and nothing will be wasted When they had dug the ground to the depth of seven or eight feet they found a big bronze vessel containing several hundred catties of gold and tens of bright pearls Then the Master spent the summer retreat in this monastery The king neglected the arts but he believed in Mahayana Buddhism with respect and took delight in attending preaching and recitation functions So he invited the Master and the Tripitaka teacher Prajnakara to hold a Dharma gathering in a Mahayana monastery There were a Mahayana Tripitaka Master named Manojnaghosa  a monk of the Sarvastivada school named Aryavarman  and a monk of the Mahlsasaka school named Gunabhadra meaning Virtuous Sage all leading figures in that monastery Although they were well versed in the theories of one or another school each of them had his strong point in only one school The Master alone understood all the different theories perfectly and could answer in accordance with the teachings of different schools whatever questions were put to him to the satisfaction of them all and winning their admiration The gathering dispersed after lasting five days Greatly delighted the king sepa rately offered five bolts of pure brocade to the Master and various gifts to the other monks After spending the summer retreat at the Salaka Monastery the Dharma teacher Prajnakara being invited again by the king of Tukhara returned to that country and the Master parted company with him Proceeding eastward for more than six hundred li and after crossing a black range he entered the territory of northern India and reached the country of Lampaka which was more than a thousand li in circumference and had ten monasteries all the monks of which studied Mahayana Buddhism After staying there for three days he went south to a small range on which there was a stupa Once the Buddha walked from the south to this place and stood there In memory of the event people of later times con structed this stupa with a mind of respect All the lands to the north of this place were known as mleccha meaning frontier lands When the Tathagata wished to go about teaching the people he used to come and go by air and would not walk on the ground If he walked the earth would quake and tremble Going from here southward for more than twenty li he came down from the range and crossed a river after which he reached the country of Nagarahara  At a distance of two li to the southeast of the capital city there was a stupa over three hundred feet high built by King Asoka This was the place where the Sakya Bodhisattva met Dipamkara Buddha in the second asamkhyeya kalpa and spread his deerskin garment as well as his hair over the muddy earth to receive a prediction from that Buddha Although it had passed through the Kalpa of Destruc tion this spot had continued to exist and heavenly beings often scattered flowers as offerings to it When the Master came to this place he worshipped and circum ambulated it An old monk beside him told him the story of the construction of this stupa The Master inquired of him saying Since it was in the second asamkhyeya kalpa that the Bodhisattva spread his hair over the ground innumerable kalpas had passed between the second and the third circles In each kalpa the world has been constructed and destroyed many times as in the period o f conflagration when even Mount Sumeru was reduced to ashes How could this spot alone have been preserved intact The monk said in reply When the world was destroyed this spot was also destroyed but when the world was reconstructed the spot also reappeared at its original place where it was before just like Mount Sumeru which exists again after it has been destroyed As this is a holy place why should it not have the potency to emerge again From this comparison we may not bother ourselves with doubt This was a wellspoken reply More than ten li further to the southwest was a stupa that marked a place where the Buddha had bought flowers Again going further to the southeast and crossing a sandy ridge for more than ten li the Master reached the city of the Buddhas parietal bone In the city there was a storeyed pavilion and on the second storey there was a small stupa made of the seven precious substances in which the Tathagatas parietal bone was preserved The circum ference of the bone was twelve inches It was of a yellowish white color with distinct hair pores and was stored in a precious casket If anyone wished to forecast his fortune he could grind some incense into powder wrap it in a piece of white silk and press it on the bone to make an impression from which to foresee whether it was auspicious or inauspicious The Master obtained an impres sion like the Bodhi tree O f the two sramaneras whom he had brought along with him the older got an impression resembling a Buddha image while the younger got one like a lotus flower The Brahman in charge of the bone was delighted and he said to the Master while snapping his fingers and scattering flowers toward him You have gotten a very rare impression which indicates that you will have the opportunity to realize Bodhi There was another stupa containing a piece of a skull bone in the shape of a lotus leaf Here was also a Buddhas eye relic as large as an apple with a brilliant light that shone out of the casket Here too was the Buddhas samghati robe made of the finest felt There was also preserved the Buddhas religious staff with pewter rings of which the handle was made of sandalwood The Master paid homage to all these objects with sad memories and reverence and then offered fifty golden coins and one thousand silver coins together with four gorgeous pennants two pieces of brocade and two suits of religious robes After scattering various kinds of flowers he took his leave and went out Then he heard that at a distance of more than twenty li to the southwest of the city of Dlpamkara there was a cave that was once the residence of the Dragon King Gopala whom the Tathagata subdued thus leaving his shadow in the cave The Master wished to worship the shadow but the road was deserted blocked and infested with robbers Moreover in the last two or three years people who went there could not see the shadow in most cases and so very few people visited the place When the Master desired to worship the shadow the envoys who escorted him from Kapisa advised him not to go as they wanted to return home quickly and did not wish to linger too long The Master said to them The shadow of the Tathagatas true body is seen once in countless kalpas Now as I have come to this place why should I not go to worship it You may proceed slowly and I will go and come back soon Thus he went alone to the city of Dlpamkara and entered a monastery to ask the way and find someone to be his guide Then he saw a child who said The manor of the monastery is nearby I will send you there So he went with the lad to the manor where he spent the night and found an old man who knew the place and went there with him as his guide After going a few li they met five robbers who came to them with knives in hand The Master took off his hat and showed them his religious attire The robbers said Where does the teacher wish to go The Master said in reply I wish to worship the Buddhas shadow The robbers said Did you not hear that there were robbers here The Master said Robbers are also human beings Upon arriving at the cave which was on the eastern precipice o f a stony brook with an opening facing the west he peeped into it but could see nothing as it was completely dark inside The old man said You should go straight in After walking for about fifty paces you will touch the eastern wall Then gaze due east The shadow is there The Master entered the cave and having walked about fifty paces actually touched the eastern wall He stood there as he was told and worshipped with sincerity But he did not see any thing after having made more than a hundred prostrations on the ground He blamed himself for his own spiritual obstacles that prevented him from seeing the shadow and wept with regret and repentance Then he recited with a sincere mind the stanzas in praise of the Buddha in the Srimaladevisimhanada Sutra and other scriptures As he recited the stanzas he made prostrations over a hundred times Then he saw a bright light the size of an alms bowl appear on the eastern wall but it disappeared in an instant With a mixed feeling of grief and joy he worshipped again and saw a light as large as a tray but it also faded out soon This increased his faith and adoration and he vowed that he would not leave the cave if he did not see the shadow of the Worldhonored One When he had prostrated himself again more than two hundred times the whole cave became brightly illumined and the Tathagatas shadow was clearly seen on the wall just like a golden mountain becoming visible when the clouds and mist disperse Its wonderful features were lustrous with a divine and brilliant appearance He was so delighted to have seen the shadow that his happiness was beyond comparison Both the Buddhas body and his robe were of a reddish yellow color The figure was perfectly clear above the knees but below the lotus seat it was a little blurred It was complete with the shadows of all the Bodhisattvas and holy monks who stood at the left and right sides of his knees and behind his back Having seen this shadow the Master asked the six men who were outside the entrance to bring in a fire to light incense But when the fire was brought in the Buddhas shadow disappeared all of a sudden He hastily asked them to put out the fire and prayed again and then the shadow reappeared Among the six men five saw the shadow and one did not see anything at all It was distinctly visible for about half a meals time When they had paid homage chanted praise offered incense and scattered flowers the light faded away and then they took their leave and came out of the cave The Brahman who led the way was happy He proclaimed that this was something that never occurred before saying If it were not for the teachers sincerity and great will power this could not have happened Outside the cave there were many more holy sites as is related in other works They returned together and all five of the robbers destroyed their weapons and received the Precepts before they went away The Master then rejoined his companions and going southeast for more than five hundred li among mountains he reached the country of Gandhara in olden times wrongly called Jiantuowei in the domain of northern India This country bordered on the Indus in the east and its capital was called Purusapura In this country there were many sages and holy persons and the sastra writers of ancient times such as Narayanadeva Asanga Bodhisattva Vasubandhu Bodhisattva Dharmatrata Manoratha and the Venerable Parsva were all born in this country To the northeast o f the royal city there was a precious terrace for keeping the Buddhas alms bowl which had been shifted to various countries and was then kept in the country of Varanasi Eight or nine li to the southeast of the city there was apippala tree more than a hundred feet tall The four past Buddhas had sat under it and there were now images of these four Tathagatas All of the  Buddhas of the future will also sit under it By the side of the tree there was a stupa constructed by King Kaniska four hundred feet in height of which the base was one and onehalf li in circumference and one hundred fifty feet high On the top of the stupa were Diamond Wheels in twentyfive layers and inside it one hu of the Tathagatas relic bones was preserved About a hundred paces to the southwest of the great stupa there was a white stone statue eighteen feet in height standing facing north It had manifested many divine and auspicious signs and people often saw it circumambulating the great stupa at night Over a hundred li to the northeast of the monastery built by King Kaniska the Master crossed a great river and reached the city of Puskalavati In the east of the city there was a stupa built by King Asoka this was the place where the four past Buddhas had preached the Dharma In a monastery four or five li to the north of the city there was another stupa more than two hundred feet high also erected by King Aioka this was the place where Sakyamuni Buddha performed almsgiving with a happy mind when he was practising the Way of a Bodhisattva in the past He was bom as the king of this country a thousand times and at this place he gave away his eyes as alms in a thousand lives There were many such holy sites and the Master visited and worshipped them all He distributed all the gold silver satin silk and garments presented to him by the king of Gaochang to the great stupas and large monasteries that he visited as offerings to express his devotion before he left From here he went to the city of Udakhanda Travelling for more than six hundred li over mountains and rivers to the north of the city he entered the country of Udyana m e an in g garden for it was a garden of King Asoka in olden times formerly it was wrongly called Wuchang On both banks of the Subhavastu River there were formerly fourteen hundred monasteries with eighteen thousand monks but now the monasteries were in desolation and the number of monks had decreased The king mostly lived in the city of Mangala which was rich and wellpopulated Four or five li to the east of the city there was a great stupa that showed many miraculous signs and was the place where the Buddha as Ksanti Rsi in one of his previous lives was dismembered by King Kali meaning Combat formerly known as Geli by mistake At a place two hundred fifty li to the northeast of the city the Master entered a great mountain and reached the Apalala Dragon Spring which was the source o f the Swat River which flowed toward the southwest It was a cold place and it froze in the spring and summer seasons In the evenings the snow began to fall and the flakes were of varied colors dancing in the air like different kinds of flowers More than thirty li to the southwest of the Dragon Spring on a huge rock on the northern bank of the river there was a Buddhas footprint that varied in size according to the good fortune and volition o f the person who measured it It was left by the Buddha before going away in former times when he came here to subdue the Apalala dragon More than thirty li down the river was the washing stone of the Tathagata and the stripes of his robe were still visible impressed on the rock Going south from the city for more than four hundred li the Master reached Hidda Mountain which was the place where the Tathagata in one of his former lives jumped down to give up his body to repay the kindness of a yaksa from whom he had learned half agatha formerly known as ji this being an abbreviation of the Sanskrit word or jituo a mispronunciation of the Sanskrit of which the correct reading is li to the west of the city of Mangala he crossed a big river and reached the Rohitaka Stupa which was more than a hundred feet high and constructed by King Asoka More than thirty li to the northeast of the city he came to the Adbhuta meaning Marvel lous stone stupa which was thirty feet high Once the Buddha preached the Dharma at this place to men and heavenly beings and after the Buddha had gone away this stupa emerged spon taneously To the west of the stupa the Master crossed a big river After going for three or four li he reached a vihara in which there was an image of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva wellknown for its miraculous manifestations avalokita and isvara meaning observe and supreme being Formerly it was wrongly translated as Light World Voice Observing the Voice of the World or Observing World Voice Supreme Being The Master heard the people say that from the northeast of the city one might climb a mountain and cross a gully go up the Indus River by a dangerous path climb up a rope chain walk over a suspension bridge and proceed for about a thousand li to reach the valley of Darada which was the old capital of Udyana Beside a big monastery in the valley there was a wooden statue of Maitreya Bodhisattva painted a golden color and more than a hundred feet tall It was made by the Arhat Madhyantika erroneously trans literated Motiandi in old times By his supernatural power he sent a craftsman up to the Tusita Heaven formerly known as Dushuaituo by mistake to observe with his own eyes the fine features of the Bodhisattva and he went up and down three times before he completed the task From the city of Udakhanda the Master crossed the Indus to the south The river was three or four li wide and the water was very clear and flowed rapidly Many venomous dragons and evil animals dwelt in it Anyone crossing the river with Indian precious gems rare flowers or relic bones would often have his boat over turned About twelve or thirteen li to the north of the city there was a stupa built by K in g Aoka it often issued a divine light This was the place where the Tathagata in previous lives as a great king with the name of Candraprabha  sacrificed his head one thou sand times in order to acquire Buddhahood when he was practis ing the Bodhisattva path Beside the stupa there was a monastery in which Kumaralata  a teacher of the Sautrantika school composed various sastras The Master heard that more than seven hundred li from here to the southeast was the country of Simhapura  Again crossing the Indus River at the northern frontier of Taksasila and going southeast for more than two hundred li he crossed the Great Rocky Pass This was the place where Prince Mahasattva had formerly sacrificed his body to feed a starving tigress and her seven cubs As the ground had been stained by the Princes blood it was still of a deep red color and the plants there were also deep red From here again going southeast for over five hundred li among mountains he reached the country of Urasa Again climbing dangerous defiles toward the southeast and crossing an iron bridge he travelled for more than a thousand li and reached the country of Kasmira wrongly called Jibin in olden times Its capital city was beside a big river on the west with a hundred monasteries and some five thousand monks There were four stupas high and splendid built by King Asoka and each containing over a sheng of the Tathagatas relic bones When the Master first entered its territory he came to Rocky Pass which was the western gate of the country and the king sent his maternal uncle to welcome him with carriages and horses After entering Rocky Pass the Master worshipped in various monasteries he had passed by and reached a temple named Huskara where he spent the night During that night all the monks of the monastery had a dream in which a divine being told them This guest monk coming from Mahaclna wishes to study the scriptures in India to visit and worship the holy sites and to learn from teachers what he has not heard before Since he has come for the sake of the Dharma countless good deities are following him and they are all here now You should recite and study the scrip tures with diligence so as to win his praise and respect Why are you so indolent and indulging in sleeping The monks were startled on hearing this admonition in the dream They walked up and down sat in meditation or recited the scriptures until dawn Then they came to tell the story to the Master and treated him with greater reverence The king his ministers and the monks in the capital city came to the house of benefaction to welcome the Master The king was attended by more than a thousand body guards holding banners and canopies that filled the road burning incense and scattering flowers all over the way After offering him a large quantity of flowers with his own hands he invited the Master to ride on a great elephant and proceed together with him to the capital After arriving in the capital the Master lodged at the Jayendra Monastery which was built by the kings maternal uncle On the following day he was invited to the palace to receive offerings and a score of virtuous monks Samghaklrti and others were also invited After the meal the king requested that the Master preach the Dharma and invited him to carry on a discussion on certain dubious questions The king was highly pleased to observe the event Knowing that the Master had come from a distant land to acquire knowledge and that there was no written book for him to study the king ordered twenty copyists to transcribe scriptures and commentaries for his use and also gave him five persons to be his servants The Dharma teacher Samghaklrti being a person of lofty character observed the disciplinary rules in a strict and pure manner He was a deep thinker well versed in the Dharma in a comprehensive way Possessing brilliant talents and outstanding intelligence he inherently loved virtuous scholars As the Master was a distinguished guest he received him with so much delight that he opened his eyes wide and raised his eyebrows high The Master also wholeheartedly studied under him day and night without feeling tired and asked him to expound and teach him the various sdstras The venerable teacher was then nearly seventy and was feeble in physical strength But as he was glad to have met an intelligent person he exerted himself to the utmost to teach him by lecturing on the Abhidharmakosa Sastra before noon the Nyayanusara Sastra in the afternoon and the Hetuvidya Sastra and the Sabdavidya Sastra after the first part of the night Thus all the scholars in the locality assembled to attend the lectures The Master comprehended whatever was spoken by the teacher with out missing anything He studied the subtle teachings with appre ciation and thoroughly mastered the mysteries The venerable teacher was pleased with him and praised him appreciatively to the utmost saying to the people This Chinese monk possesses such great and substantial wisdom that none among this congre gation could exceed him With his intelligence and virtue he could have been a worthy successor to Vasubandhu and his brother the pity is that he was bom in a distant land and could not come in contact early with the bequeathed teachings of the saints and sages Among the congregation there were two Mahayana scholar monks named Visuddhasimha and Jinabandhu  two Sarvastivada scholarmonks named Sugatamitra and Vasumitra  and two Mahasamghika scholarmonks named Suiyadeva and Jinatrata mean ing Victorious Protector When they saw that the Master was praised by their great teacher they felt so bad about it that they tried to interrogate him with difficult questions But the Master gave them perspicuous replies fluently and without hesitation and then the scholars felt ashamed and were convinced of his erudition This country was formerly the lake of a dragon In the fiftieth year after the Buddhas nirvana Anandas disciple Arhat Madhyantika converted the dragon king and asked him to relinquish his lake to construct five hundred monasteries in which various saints and sages were invited to five upon the offerings of the dragon Later in the four hundredth year after the Buddhas nirvana King Kaniska of the country of Gandhara invited at the request of the Venerable Parsva various holy monks who were thoroughly versed in the Tripitaka of the inner learning and learned in the Five Sciences of the outer knowledge They came to  persons and including the Venerable Vasumitra there were altogether five hundred holy monks to recite and collect the Tripitaka At first Agni to Kanyakubja they composed the Upadesa Sastra formerly erroneously known as the Youbotishe in  stanzas for the exposition of the Sutra Pitaka  then the Vinayavibhasa Sastra in  stanzas for the exposi tion of the Vinaya Pitaka formerly erroneously known as the Pinaye and thirdly the Abhidharmavibhasa Sastra in  stanzas for the exposition of the Abhidharma Pitaka or erro neously known as the Apitan a total number of  stanzas in  syllables The king made red copper plates to incise these treatises on and kept them in stone cases which were sealed up and stored in a great stupa specially constructed for the pur pose he also ordered yaksas to safeguard them Thus the Master stayed in this country for two years to study various scriptures and commentaries and to worship the holy sites before he took his departure Going southwest for seven hundred li and wading across a ravine he reached the country of Parnotsa and going further southeast for more than four hundred li he reached the country of Rajapura  After going southeast from here for more than seven hundred li descending the moun tains and crossing a river he reached the country of Takka in the domain of northern India From Lampaka to this land as the lay people lived in frontier and desolate countries their costume and language were somewhat different from those in India and their manners were vulgar and uncouth After leaving the country of Rajapura and traveling for three days he crossed the Candrabhaga River and reached the city of Jayapura where he lodged at a heretical monastery outside the western gate of the city in which there were at the moment over twenty disciples Two days later he entered the city of Sakala where there was a monastery with more than a hundred monks Formerly Vasubandhu Bodhisattva composed the Paramarthasatya Sastra in this monastery Beside it there was a stupa two hundred feet high that marked the place where the four past Buddhas had preached the Dharma The footprints of their walk ing up and down were still there From here he came out of the city of Narasimha and reached a big palasa wood in the east where he encountered a band of about fifty brigands When they had stolen all the clothes and money of the Master and his companions they brandished their knives and drove them to a dry pond by the southern side of the road intending to slaughter them all In the pond there were many thorny bushes and creepers and through the bushes the sramanera whom the Master had brought along with him saw a water drain at the southern bank of the pond large enough for one man to pass through He secretly told the Master and the two of them slipped away through it They ran rapidly toward the south east for two or three li and met a Brahman who was tilling the land When they told him that they had been robbed by brigands he was astounded to hear about it After unbridling his bull and b anding it over to the Master he blew a conch and beat a drum to sound an alarm toward the village More than eighty men armed with weapons hurriedly rushed to the scene of the robbery On seeing the group of people the thugs escaped and vanished into the wood The Master then went back to the pond and released the captives from their bonds Having distributed his clothes to them he went with them to the village to spend the night Everybody wept piteously except the Master who alone smiled without any feeling of grief His fellow travellers asked him All our clothes and travelling money have been stolen and all that we have in our possession is our lives As we are now in the most wretched and difficult condition we cannot but feel sorrowful when we think of what happened in the wood How is it that you do not share our feeling of misery but smile and are in a happy mood The Master said in reply W hat is most precious in existence is life Since we still have our lives what else should we worry about The greatest treasure between Heaven and earth is life As we still possess our lives we did not lose the Great Treasure There is no need to grieve over such trifling matters as clothes and travelling money Thus his companions were convinced of the truth On the following day he reached the eastern part of the country o f Takka and arrived at a big city In a large mango grove to the west o f the city and by the northern side of the road there lived a Brahman seven hundred years old who looked like a man about the age of thirty with a stalwart build and a clear mind of deep discernment He was well versed in the Madhyamika Sdstra the Sata Sdstra and other treatises as well as in the Vedas and other books He had two attendants both of whom were over a hundred years old When he saw the Master he received him with great pleasure Upon hearing that the Master had been robbed the old teacher sent one of his attendants to ask the Buddhist followers in the city to prepare food for the Master In the city there were several thousand families of whom only a few were Buddhists the great majority being heretical followers When the Master was in Kasmira his fame had already spread far and he was known to various countries The messenger went throughout the city and announced The Chinese monk has arrived and he has been robbed of all his garments at a nearby place It befits you all to know that this is the right time to do good deeds Under the influence of the Masters power of blessedness the heretics reformed their minds Upon hearing the announcement more than three hundred prominent people each bringing a piece of motley felt together with food and drinks came to offer them to the Master They piled up the gifts before him and knelt down to worship and extend greetings to him The Master blessed them and preached the doctrine of retribution and causality asking them to cherish the mind of the Way to give up heretical ideas and to return to the Right Path The Master stayed there for one month to study the Sutrasata Sastra and the Satasastravaipulya with him This person was a disciple of Nagaijuna and had received in person his teachers tradition of which his expositions were clear and lucid Going eastward from here for more than five hundred li he reached the country of Cinabhukti and repaired to Tosasana Mon astery where lived a virtuous monk named Vinitaprabha mean ing Light of Subjugation he being a prince of northern India Going southeast from the great city for more than fifty li he reached Tamasavana Monastery in which lived more than three hundred monks who studied the teachings o f the Sarvastivada school The one thousand Buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa will all come here to preach the Dharma to gather ings of men and heavenly beings In the three hundredth year after the nirvana of Sakyamuni Tathagata the sastra master Katyayana composed the Abhidharmajhanaprasthana Sastra at this place Going northeast from here for one hundred forty or one hun dred fifty li the Master reached the country of Jalamdhara in the domain of northern India In this country he went to Nagaradhana Monastery where lived the virtuous monk Candravarman  who was well versed in the Tripitaka Thus the Master stayed there for four months to study the Vibhasaprakaranapada Sastra From here he climbed over steep mountains and proceeded northeast for more than seven hundred li to reach the country of Kuluta  From Kuluta going southward for more than seven hundred li he climbed over a mountain and crossed a river to reach the country of Satadru in the domain of northern India From here proceeding southwest for more than eight hundred li he reached the country of Pariyatra  From here going eastward for more than five hundred li he reached the country of Mathura in the domain of Central India The relic stupas of the holy disciples of Sakya Tathagata such as Sariputra in former times wrongly given as Shelizi or Shelifu and Maudgalaputra wrongly given as Mujianlian in former times were still in existence there The Abhidharma monks made offer ings to Sariputra those who practised meditation to Maudgala putra the sutrareciters to Purnamaitrayanlputra the monks who studied the Vinaya to Upali the bhiksunis to Ananda those who had not received full ordination to Rahula and the Mahayana students to various Bodhisattvas Five or six li to the east of the city the Master came to a monastery built on a hill by the Venerable Upagupta meaning Near Protection in which were preserved the hair and nail relics On the rock to the north of the monastery there was a cave more than twenty feet high and over thirty feet wide filled with small tallies four inches long When the Venerable Upagupta was preach ing the Dharma if a married couple became enlightened and both of them attained Arhatship he would put in one tally but if only one of the couple or people of separate families had attained Arhatship he would not count it From here going northeast for more than five hundred li he reached the country of Sthanegvara in the domain of Central India Going again to the east for more than four hundred li he reached the country of Srughna  which bordered on the Ganges in the east with big mountains at its back in the north and the Jumna River flowing through the middle of its territory Again going east from the river for more than eight hundred li he reached the source of the Ganges which was three or four li wide flow in g toward the southeast and it was more than ten li broad at the place where it entered the sea The water was sweet and refreshing and fine sand drifted down the river In popular books it was called the water of happiness If one bathed in it one would be absolved of ones sins if one sipped its water or rinsed ones mouth with it one would be saved from calamities and if one were drowned in it one would be reborn in the heavens to enjoy happiness Thus ignorant men and women often flocked to the riverside But this was all the sayings of the heretics without any reality Afterward Deva Bodhisattva showed them the right truth and then they totally relinquished their practices In this country there lived a virtuous monk named Jayagupta who was well versed in the Tripitaka So the Master stayed there during the winter and half of the following spring season to listen to his lectures on the Sautrantikavibhasa Sastra until the course was concluded Crossing the river to the eastern bank he reached the country of Matipura the king of which was of the sudra caste There were more than ten monasteries with over eight hundred monks who studied the Hinayana teachings of the Sarvastivada school Four or five li to the south of the big city there was a small monastery with more than fifty monks Formerly the sastra master Gunaprabha composed in this monastery the Tattvasatya Sastra and over a hundred other treatises This sastra master a native of the country of Parvata originally studied Mahayana teachings but later degraded himself to learn Hinayana doctrines At that time Arhat Devasena often went up to the Tusita Heaven Gunaprabha wishing to see Maitreya to solve all the dubious and ambiguous points he had in his mind asked Devasena to bring him up by divine power to the heavenly palace When he saw Maitreya he just bowed slightly down without paying homage to him in the proper way and he said As I am an ordained monk while Maitreya is living as a layman in Heaven it is improper for me to worship him He went up to Heaven three times but never worshipped the Bodhisattva once Owing to his arrogance and selfconceit his doubts were not cleared Three or four li to the south of Gunaprabhas monastery was another monastery with more than two hundred monks of the Hinayana school This was the place where the sastra master Samghabhadra passed away This sastra master a native of Kasmira was an erudite and highly talented person well versed in the Vibhasa Sastra of the Sarvastivada school At that time Vasubandhu Bodhisattva who was also a man of great wisdom and good learn ing had formerly composed the Abhidharmakosa Sastra in refuta tion of the theories held by the Vibhasa teachers The tenets expounded in this work were so abstruse and the style of writing so florid that none of the students of the Western Region did not praise it with admiration and even the spirits and deities also discussed and studied it When Samghabhadra had read the trea tise he felt indignant over it and after twelve years of profound thinking he composed the Kosakaraka Sastra in twentyfive thou sand stanzas with eight hundred thousand syllables After having composed this treatise he intended to settle his disputes with Vasubandhu face to face but he died before he could carry out his intention Later when Vasubandhu read the treatise he praised the work saying that it was a book of comprehensive under standing and that its author was no less intelligent than any of the other Vibhasa teachers He also remarked that as it coincided with his own views it should be given the title of Nyayanusara Sastra thus it was so named After the death of Samghabhadra a stupa was built in a mango grove it was still in existence Beside the grove there was another stupa built on the spot where the sastra master Vimalamitra passed away This sastra master was a native of the country of Kasmira who having become a monk in the Sarvastivada school travelled in the five parts of India and thoroughly mastered the Tripitaka On his way back to his home land he came to the stupa of Samghabhadra and felt sorry that he should have died before his writings were popularized So he vowed to compose more treatises to refute Mahayana teachings and efface Vasubandhus name so that the tenets of the sastra master Samghabhadra might be handed down from generation to generation far into the future When he had just uttered these words he became demented and five tongues grew out of his mouth with blood bleeding all over his body He realized that this pain was caused by his evil views and so he wrote a letter of penitence to admonish his friends never to slander Mahayana teachings After having said so he expired At the place of his death the earth sank into a pit In that country there was a virtuous monk named Mitrasena who was then ninety years old He was a disciple of the sastra master Gunaprabha and was well versed in the Tripitaka The Master stayed there for half a spring and a summer to study with him the Tattvasandesa Sastra ie the Tattvasatya Sastra in twentyfive thousand stanzas composed by Gunaprabha the Anujnanaprasthana Sastra and other treatises of the Sarvastivada school Again going from here northward for more than three hundred li he reached the country of Brahmapura  Going further southeast for more than four hundred li he reached the country of Ahicchattra  Again going southward for more than two hundred li he crossed the Ganges and turned southwest to the country of Vilasana in the domain o f Central India Again going eastward for more than two hundred li he reached the country of Kapitha in the domain of Central India More than twenty li to the east of the city there was a large monastery in its courtyard there were three stairways made of precious substances standing in a row from south to north facing the east and sloping down to the west This was the place where the Buddha descended to Jambudvipa when he returned from the Trayastrimsa Heaven after having preached the Dharma to Mahamaya The stairway in the middle was made of gold the left one of crystal and the right one o f white silver The Tathagata started from the Hall of the Good Dharma and walked slowly down the middle stairway with many heavenly beings following him while Mahabrahma holding a white chowry walked down the silver stairway on the right and Indra holding a pre cious canopy came down by the crystal stairway on the left At that time hundreds and thousands of celestial beings and great Bodhisattvas came down with the Buddha A few hundred years before the stairways had still been there but now they had collapsed and were no more in existence In memory of the stairways a king at a later time built imitations of the original ones out of brick and stone to the height of more than seventy feet and adorned them with various precious substances On the top of the stairways there was a vihara in which was enshrined a stone image of the Buddha with statues of Indra and Brahma on its left and right after the original fashion presenting a lively scene Beside the stairways there was a stone column seventy feet high erected by King Asoka Beside the column was a stone platform more than fifty paces long and seven feet high which was the place where the Buddha had walked up and down in olden times From here going northwest for two hundred li reached the country of Kanyakubja meaning the City of Hunch backed Maidens in Central India which was four thousand li in circumference Bordering on the Ganges in the west the capital city was more than twenty li in length and five or six li in width There were more than a hundred monasteries with over ten thou sand monks who studied both Mahayana and Hinayana teachings The king who was of the vaisya caste was named Harsavardhana  His father was named Prabhakaravardhana  and his elder brother Rajyavardhana  Harsavardhana was a benign ruler and won the praise and acclaim of his people At that time King Sasanka of the country of Karnasuvarna in eastern India hated him for his clever strategies and considering him a dangerous neighbor had him killed through trickery The chief minister Vani meaning Eloquent Speech and his colleagues lamented the loss o f their lord and enthroned the kings younger brother Siladitya meaning Morality Sun to succeed in the royal lineage The new king had a heroic appearance with outstanding intelligence and being a farsighted man was skilled in strategy As his virtue moved Heaven and earth and his righteousness influenced men and divine beings he was able to avenge his elder brother and put India under his control Wherever his prestige reached and his moral influence functioned the people submitted to his rule of virtue Deeds of blessedness were performed and a royal decree was issued to the effect that within the domain no slaughter of animals was allowed and all subjects were universally prohibited from eating meat Monasteries were constructed at all holy places every year gifts were offered to all monks for twentyone days and the Unlimited Congregation was held once every five years Whatever was stored in the royal treasure house was given away as alms In consideration of his deeds might well be compared with Sudana In the northwest of the city there was a stupa more than two hundred feet high and six or seven li away to the southeast and on the southern bank of the Ganges there was another stupa also more than two hundred feet high Both were constructed by Ring Asoka at places where the Buddha had formerly preached the Dharma The Master entered this country stayed at the Bhadra Vihara for three months and completed his studies of Buddhadasas Vibhasa Sastra and Suryavarmans Vibhasa Sastra under the tutelage of the Tripitaka Master Viryasena Beginning with the Country of Ayodhya and Ending with the Country of Iranaparvata From here the Master proceeded southeast for more than six hundred li and crossed the Ganges to the south to reach the country of Ayodhya  There were over a hundred monasteries with several thousand monks who studied both Mahayana and Hinayana teachings In the great city there was an old monastery that was the place where Vasubandhu meaning World Kinsman formerly incorrectly transliterated Posoupandou and mistranslated Celestial Kinsman Bodhisattva composed Mahayana and Hinayana treatises and lectured the monks Four or five li to the northwest of the city on the bank of the Ganges there was a big stupa more than two hundred feet high and constructed by King Asoka at the place where the Buddha once preached the Dharma for three months Beside the stupa was the place where the four past Buddhas had walked up and down Five or six li to the southwest of the city there was an old monastery that was the place where Asanga Bodhisattva had preached the Dharma At night the Bodhisattva ascended to the Tusita Heaven to hear the Yogacarabhumi Sastra the Mahayanasutralamkara Sastra and the Madhyantavibhaga Sastra at the place of Maitreya Bodhi sattva In the daytime he came down from the Heaven to preach the Dharma for the monks Asanga also named No Attachment was a native of Gandhara He appeared in the world one thousand years after the nirvana of the Buddha and became a monk in the Mahlsasaka school but later believed in Mahayana teachings His younger brother Vasubandhu became a monk in the Sarvastivada school but also believed in Mahayana teachings afterward Both brothers were men endowed with a genius for understanding the holy teachings and possessed a talent for writing They composed a large number of treatises for the exposition of Mahayana theories and were great masters of Buddhism in India Such works as the Mahayanasamparigraha Sastra the Prakaranaryavaca Sastra the Abhidharmasamudaya Prakarana Sastra the Vijnaptimatratasiddhi Sastra and the Abhidharmakosa Sastra were prod ucts of their pens After having paid homage to the sacred sites in the country of Ayodhya the Master sailed down the Ganges eastward with more than eighty persons in the same boat intending to go to the country of Hayamukha When they had sailed for about a hundred li they came to a place where there were dense and exuberant woods of asoka trees on both banks of the river and from the woods on each side of the river more than ten boatloads of pirates suddenly emerged at the same time and rowed against the current toward them The people in the boat were terrified and in confu sion several men jumped into the river The pirates compelled the boat to sail to the bank and ordered the people to take off their clothes in order to search for gems and jewels Being worshippers o f the goddess Durga the pirates used to find a handsome man of good quality in each autumn season to be killed as a sacrifice to the deity so they could pray for happiness and blessedness Upon seeing that the Master was grand and handsome in appearance with proper bodily form they looked at each other with pleased expressions and said among themselves The season for us to make a sacrifice to the deity is drawing near to the end but we could not find a suitable man Isnt it auspicious for us to kill him as a sacrifice The Master said in reply I would not dare begrudge this filthy and ugly body o f mine as a sacrifice to the deity But I have come from a far distance with the intention of worshipping the Bodhi tree and the Buddhas image at Grdhrakuta Mountain as well as seeking scriptures of the Dharma If you donors kill me while my intention has not been fulfilled it will I am afraid be inauspicious for you All the people in the boat begged for mercy on behalf of the Master Some o f them even volunteered to substitute for him but the pirates would not consent The ringleader sent his men to fetch water and clear the ground in the flowery wood to prepare an altar and plaster it with clay He ordered two men with their scimitars unsheathed to lead the Master to the altar and they were ready to kill him by wielding their weapons The Master showed no expres sion of fear and all the pirates were amazed at this With a feeling that he would not be spared the Master said to the pirates Please grant me a little time and do not press me too hard so that I may die happily and with an easy mind The Master then concentrated his mind on the Tusita Palace and meditated on Maitreya Bodhisattva with the desire to be bom in that place pay homage and make offerings to the Bodhisattva and receive the Yogacarabhumi Sastra from him Then he worshipped the Buddhas of the ten quarters and sat in meditation concentrating his mind on Maitreya Bodhi sattva without any distracting thoughts While he was in contem plation he seemed to have ascended Mount Sumeru and transcended the first the second and the third heavens and to have seen Maitreya Bodhisattva at the Wonderful and Precious Terrace in the Tusita Palace surrounded by a multitude of heavenly beings At that moment the Master was so overjoyed both physically and mentally that he became unaware that he was on the sacrificial altar and also forgot about the pirates All his fellow travellers wailed and wept aloud In a moment a gale of black wind rose from the four quarters breaking down the trees and blowing sand high into the air Waves roe in the river and the boats were overturned The pirates being greatly fright ened inquired of the travellers Where does this sramana come from and what is his name They replied He is the monk from China seeking the Dharma If you gentlemen kill him you will commit a deadly sin In view of the windstorm we know that the deity has been enraged It befits you to make a quick repentance The pirates were fearful and begged for pardon with remorse one after another When the pirates touched him with their hands he opened his eyes and said to them Is it time now The pirates said We dare not harm the teacher May you accept our repentance The Master accepted their worship and apology and told them that such evil deeds as killing theft and worshipping improper deities would cause one to suffer pains in the Avici Hell in the future W hy should you sow the seeds of suffering for an unlimited long time just for the sake of a corporeal body which lasts only for a short time like lightning or morning dew The pirates prostrated themselves and apologized saying Our thoughts were erroneous and upsidedown If we did not meet the teacher whose blessedness and virtue moved the mysterious gods how could we have heard such inspiring instructions From today onward we shall stop practising this career May the teacher be our witness Then they admonished one another collected their weapons and threw them all into the river They returned the clothes and money they had seized in pillage to the original owners After they had received the Five Precepts the windstorm ceased Being delighted the pirates worshipped the Master and went away The fellow travellers praised the Master with amazement in an unusual manner All the people far and near who heard about it remarked that it was an extraordinary occurrence If it were not for his sincerity in seeking the Dharma how could this miraculous incident have happened From here going eastward for more than three hundred li the Master crossed the Ganges and reached the country of Ayamukha in the north  From here going southeast for more than seven hundred li he crossed the Ganges to the south and north o f the Jumna River he reached the country of Prayaga in Central India In a wood of campaka flowers to the southwest o f the city there was a stupa built by King Asoka at the spot where the Buddha had formerly subdued heretics A monastery beside the stupa was the place where Deva Bodhisattva composed the Vaipulyasata Sastra to defeat Hinayana followers and heretics in argument West of the confluence of the two rivers to the east of the big city there was a tableland fourteen or fifteen li in circuit which was flat and regular in shape being the place where the kings and noblemen used to distribute alms philanthropically since ancient times hence it was named the Great Place for Almsgiving The present King Siladitya continued this practice and he distributed all the wealth he had accumulated in five years as offerings to the Triple Gem and as alms to all poor and lonely people without exception for seventyfive days From here going southwest the Master entered a big forest in which he met with many fierce animals and wild elephants After covering more than five hundred li he reached the country of Kausambi formerly erroneously known as Jushanmi in Central India There were over ten monasteries with more than three hundred monks Within the old palace in the city there was a big vihara more than sixty feet high enshrining a Buddha image carved out of sandalwood with a stone canopy suspended over it It was made by King Udayana meaning Issuing Affection for merly inaccurately known as Youtianwang When the Tathagata was preaching the Dharma to his mother in the Trayastrimsa Heaven during the summer season the king longing to see the Buddha asked Maudgalyayana to bring a skillful craftsman up to the Heaven to observe the Buddhas features and demeanor After returning to earth he carved a statue of the Buddha out of red sandalwood It was this statue that went to welcome the Worldhonored One when he came down from the Heaven In the south of the city there was an old house that was the old residence of the Elder Ghosila formerly incorrectly known as Qushiluo Not far to the south of the city there was an old monastery that had been the garden o f the Elder in which there was a stupa more than two hundred feet high and built by King Asoka Again the storeyed pavilion in the southeast was the place where Vasubandhu composed the Vijnanamatrata Sastra Further to the east the ruins of a house in a mango grove marked the place where Asahga Bodhisattva composed the Prakaranaryavaca Sastra From here going eastward for more than five hundred li the Master reached the country of Visaka where there were more than twenty monasteries with some three thousand monks followers of the Sammitxya school of Hinayana Buddhism Toward the south east on the left side of the road there was a big monastery where the Arhat Devasarman composed the Vijnanakayapada Sastra in which he advocated the theory of Nonego Meanwhile the Arhat Gopa wrote the Treatise on the Essential Realities o f the Holy Teaching to affirm the existence of the ego and these different views of the Dharma caused serious controversies It was also the place where Dharmapala Bodhisattva confuted in argument one hundred Hinayana sastra masters in seven days Beside it was a place where the Tathagata had preached the Dharma for six years There was a tree more than seventy feet high Once in the past when the Buddha had cleansed his teeth with a twig he threw away the used twig which took root in the ground and grew into a tree that had flourished until that time Heretics often came to cut the tree but as soon as it had been cut it grew up again and thrived as before From here going northeast for more than five hundred li the Master reached the country of SravastI formerly erroneously known as Shewei which was over six thousand li in circumference with several hundred monasteries and several thousand monks all of whom were adherents of Sammitlya school During the Buddhas lifetime this was the capital of King Prasenajit meaning Victorious Army and formerly inaccurately known as Bosini In the city were the foundations of the royal palace and not far away to the east a stupa was built on the old foundations of the great preaching hall constructed by King Prasenajit for the Buddha There was another stupa built to mark the vihara of the Buddhas aunt Bhiksuni Prajapati meaning Mistress of Creatures formerly inaccurately known as Bosheboti Further to the east a stupa was built as the old residence of Sudatta meaning WellGiven errone ously known as Xuda in olden times Beside the old residence was a stupa built at the place where Angulimala formerly erroneously k n own as Yangjuemoluo abandoned his evil behavior Five or six li to the south of the city was the Jetavana Wood  which was the garden of Anathapindika Formerly it had been a monastery but it was now in ruins On the left and right sides of the eastern gate there were two stone pillars seventy feet high erected by King Asoka All the buildings were dilapidated except one brick room with a golden image of the Buddha in it Formerly when the Buddha ascended to Heaven to preach the Dharma to his mother King Prasenajit longed to see him and when he heard that King Udayana had a statue of the Buddha carved out of sandalwood he also made such an image Not far behind the monastery was the place where a heretical Brahman slew a woman to calumniate the Buddha Over a hundred paces to the east of the monastery was a big and deep pit which was the place where Devadatta attempted to poison the Buddha and fell into hell alive In the south there was another big pit which was the place where Bhiksu Kokalika slandered the Buddha and fell into hell alive More than eight hundred paces to the south of this pit was the place where the Brahmin woman Cinca slandered the Buddha and fell into hell alive These three pits were so deep that their bottoms were invisible Over seventy paces to the east of the monastery there was a vihara that was tall and big and in it there was a statue of the Buddha seated facing the east This was the place where the Tathagata had once debated with some heretics Further to the east was a deva temple which was the same in proportions as the vihara When the sunlight shifted the shadow of the deva temple never reached the vihara but the shadow of the vihara always overcast the deva temple Three or four li further to the east there was a stupa built at the place where Sariputra had debated with some heretics More than sixty li to the northwest of the big city there was an old city which was the city of Kasyapa Buddhas father at the time in the Bhadrakalpa when the life span of human beings was twenty thousand years In the south of the city was the place where the Buddha saw his father for the first time after he had attained enlightenment In the north of the city was a stupa containing the relics of the whole body o f Kasyapa Buddha Both stupas were erected by King Asoka From here proceeding southeast for more than eight hundred li the Master reached the country of Kapilavastu formerly known as the country of Jiapiluowei The circumference of the country was more than four thousand li and that of the capital city more than ten li Both the country and its capital were deserted and in mins The palace city was fifteen li in circumference and being con structed with bricks it was very firm and strong Inside it were the old foundations of King Suddhodanas main palace hall on which a temple was built with a statue of the king enshrined in it Further to the north were the old foundations of the royal bedchamber of Lady Maya on which a temple was built with a statue of the lady kept in it Beside it was a temple built at the place where the spirit of Sakya Bodhisattva entered his mothers womb In this temple an image of the Bodhisattva being bom in the world was enshrined According to the tradition o f the Sthavira school the spirit of the Bodhisattva entered his mothers womb on the night of the thir tieth day of the month of Uttarasadha corresponding to the fifteenth day of the fifth month of our calendar while other schools held that it was on the twentythird day of that month corresponding to the eighth day of the fifth month of   calendar In the northwest was a stupa built at the place where the Rsi Asita read the physi ognomy of the Prince On the left and right sides o f the city were the places where the Prince competed with other Sakya youths in physical strength where he went over the city wall on a horse and where he returned to the palace abhorring the world and wishing to abandon it after having seen an old man a sick person a corpse and a sramana at the four gates of the city Travelling eastward from here through a wild forest for more than five hundred li the Master reached the country of Ramagrama  which was sparsely inhabited To the east of the old city there was a brick stupa more than fifty feet high After the nirvana of the Tathagata the then king of this country obtained a share of the relics and when he returned home he built this stupa for the preservation of the relics It often issued a bright light Beside the stupa was a dragons pond The dragon frequently took the form of a human being to circum ambulate the stupa and wild elephants always came with flowers to offer to it Not far from the stupa there was a monastery with a sramanera as its abbot According to a legend once a bhiksu invited some of his fellow monks to come here from a far distance to worship the stupa They saw that wild elephants placed flowers in front of the stupa removed the weeds with their tusks and sprayed water with their trunks At this sight the monks were quite moved One of them gave up the major rules observed by a fully ordained bhiksu and volunteered to stay there as a novice to serve at the place He said to the other monks The elephants are animals and yet they know to pay respect to the stupa by offering flowers to it and by spraying water and sweeping the ground clean I am a human being and have renounced my home to become a monk under the Buddha How could I not engage myself to serve at this place when I see with my own eyes that it is in such a desolate and neglected condition Thus he took leave of the other monks and stayed behind He built a house dredged the pond planted flowers and grew fruits through the cold and hot seasons without feeling tired When the people of the neighboring countries heard about this they donated money and valuables for the con struction of a monastery through collective effort and also invited the sramanera to be the abbot and take charge of the monasterys affairs In a big forest to the east of the Sramanera Monastery the Master travelled for more than a hundred li There was a stupa built by King Asoka at the place where the Prince after having come out of the city doffed his precious robe took off his royal crown untied the pearl from his topknot and handed them all to Chandaka to be taken back home A stupa was also built to mark the place where the Prince had cut off his hair Coming out of the forest the Master reached the country of Kusinagara which was in an extremely deserted and isolated condition At the northeast comer of the city was a stupa built by King Asoka to mark the old house of Cunda formerly inaccurately known as Chuntuo where a well was dug at a time when offerings were prepared for the Buddha The water was still clear and fresh Three or four li to the northwest of the city the Master crossed the Ajitavati River meaning the Invincible River formerly incor rectly known as the Alibati River Not far from the river he came to the Sala Grove where the trees were similar to oak with greenish bark and very glossy white leaves Four pairs of trees of the same height grew at the place where the Tathagata entered nirvana In a large brick temple there was an image of the Tathagata in the posture of entering nirvana lying with its head toward the north Beside it was a great stupa more than two hundred feet high built by King Asoka He also erected a stone pillar to record the event o f the Buddhas nirvana but no date was inscribed on it It was said by tradition that the Buddha lived for eighty years and entered nirvana on the fifteenth day of the second half of the month Vaisakha corresponding to the fifteenth day of the second month of our calendar But the Sarvastivada school said that the Buddha entered nirvana in the second half of the month Karttika corresponding to the eighth day of the ninth month of our calendar Since the time of the nirvana some said it had been twelve hundred years or thirteen hundred years or fifteen hun dred years Others said that it had been over nine hundred but less than a thousand years Other stupas were also built to mark the places where the Tathagata sitting in a golden coffin preached the Dharma to his mother where he stretched his arm to ask Ananda a question where he showed his feet to Kasyapa where his remains were cremated with fragrant wood and where eight kings shared his relics Going on from here through a big forest for more than five hundred li the Master reached the country of Varanasi the circum ference of which was more than four thousand li Its capital bordering on the Ganges in the west was more than ten li long and five or six li wide with more than thirty monasteries and over two thousand monks who were adherents of the Hinayana Sarvastivada school After crossing the river at Varanasi and proceeding north east for more than ten li he reached the monastery at the Deer Park The lofty terraces and pavilions connected by long corridors on four sides were so tall that they touched the clouds There were fifteen hundred monks who were followers o f the Hinayana Sammitiya school Inside the large enclosure there was a temple more than a hundred feet high with stone steps and brick niches arranged in about a hundred tiers each containing a golden image of the Buddha carved in intaglio In the chamber there was a lifesize bronze statue of the Buddha turning the Wheel of the Dharma To the southeast of the temple was a stone stupa more than a hundred feet high built by King Asoka In front of the stupa there was a stone pillar more than seventy feet high erected at the place where the Buddha first turned the Wheel of the Dharma Beside it was the place where Maitreya meaning the Compassion ate One formerly inexactly known as Mile Bodhisattva received his prediction Further to the west was a stupa that marked the place where the Buddha as Prabhapala Bodhisattva in a previous life at the time during the Bhadrakalpa when the life span of human beings was twenty thousand years received his prediction from Kasyapa Buddha To the south of the place where Sakyamuni Buddha received his prediction was a place where the four past Buddhas had walked up and down Being more than fifty paces long and seven feet in height it was built by laying greenish slabs upon which were images of the four Buddhas walking To the west of the monastery was the bathing pool of the Tathagata and there was also a pond in which he washed his alms bowl and another one for washing his robes All these ponds were guarded by divine dragons and nobody contaminated them Beside the ponds was a stupa built at the spot where the Buddha as a sixtusked white elephant while he was practising the deeds of a Bodhisattva gave his tusks as alms to a hunter There was also the place where he as a bird fixed the order of seniority of a monkey and a white elephant under a banyan tree in order to teach the people to observe proprieties There were also the places where he was once a deer king and where he converted the five disciples Kaundinya and the others From here going down the Ganges eastward for more than three hundred li the Master reached the country of Yuddhapati from whence he proceeded northeast to cross the Ganges After travel ling for one hundred forty or one hundred fifty li he reached the country of Vaisall  which was more than five thousand li in circumference The capital city was in ruins and its old foundations were sixty or seventy li in circumference with very few inhabitants Five or six li to the north west of the palace city was a monastery beside which was a stupa to mark the place where the Buddha had preached the Vimalakirtinirdesa Sutra Three or four li further to the northeast there was a stupa built at the old site of Vimalaklrtis residence that still manifested many miraculous signs Not far from there was a chamber built by piling up stones in which Vimalaklrti pretended to be ill and preached the Dharma Beside it were the old residence o f Ratnakara and that of the woman Amrapali Three or four li further to the north was a stupa that marked the place where the Buddha followed by heavenly beings and men had halted while he was on his way to Kusinagara to enter parinirvana Further to the west was the place where the Buddha looked at Vaisall for the last time Further to the south were Amrapalis garden which she offered to the Buddha and the place where the Buddha consented to enter nirvana at the suggestion of the King of Maras From the southern part of Vaisall the Master travelled for more than a hundred li to the Ganges and reached the city of Svetapura where he obtained a copy of the Bodhisattvapitaka Sutra Once again he crossed the Ganges went south and reached the country of Magadha  which was more than five thousand li in circumference It was the custom of this country to advocate learning and respect men of virtue and ability There were more than fifty monasteries with over ten thousand monks most of whom studied Mahayana teach ings On the southern side of the river was the old city with a circumference of more than seventy li Although it was deserted and dilapidated the crenellations on the city wall were still intact Formerly when human life was innumerable years long this city was called Kusumapura meaning the Palace City of Fragrant Flowers because the royal palace had abundant flowers After ward when human life was a few thousand years long the name was changed to the country of Pataliputra formerly incorrectly known as Xilianfuyi being adopted from the name of the patali tree In the one hundredth year after the Buddhas nirvana King Asoka meaning the King without Sorrow formerly inaccurately known as Ayuwang a great grandson of King Bimbisara meaning Stone Shadow moved his capital from Rajagrha to this city There had been several hundred monasteries out of which only two or three survived To the north of the old palace and bordering on the Ganges was a small town in which lived more than a thousand families To the north of the palace was a stone pillar several tens of feet high erected at the place where King Asoka had built a hell The Master sojourned in the small town for seven days going around to pay homage to the holy sites A stupa standing to the south of the hell was one of the eightyfour thou sand stupas constructed by the king with human labor In this one was preserved one sheng of the Tathagatas relic bones which often issued a divine light On the slab were two footprints of the Buddha one foot eight inches long and six inches wide On both soles there were the signs of the Thousandspoked Wheel and the tips of the ten toes had the lineations of a swastika and the shapes of vases fishes and other things all clearly discemable When the Tathagata was going to enter nirvana he left Vaisali and came to this place Standing on a big square rock on the southern bank of the river he looked at Ananda and said to him These are my footprints left here while I have a last look at the Diamond Seat and at Rajagrha To the north of the temple there was a stone pillar more th an thirty feet high on which was recorded that King Asoka had thrice presented Jambudvipa as alms to the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha and thrice redeemed it with precious gems and jewels To the southeast of the old city were the old foundations o f the Kukkutarama  on which there was a monastery built by King Asoka It was the place where he invited a thousand monks and offered them the four requisites needed by a monk The Master spent seven days there to worship all these holy sites Again proceeding southwest for six or seven yojanas the Mas ter reached Teladhaka Monastery in which lived several tens of Tripitaka Masters Upon hearing that the Master had arrived all of them came out to welcome and take him into the monastery From here travelling southward for more than a hundred li he came to the Bodhi tree The enclosure of the tree was built of brick It was very high and strong long from east to west and slightly narrower from south to north The main gate faced the Nairanjana River in the east the southern gate connected with a large flower pond the west side bordered on a precipitous slope and the north ern gate joined with a big monastery Inside the enclosure the holy sites were connected together They were temples and stupas built by kings ministers and wealthy Elders in memory of the Buddha In the middle was the Diamond Seat which was created at the beginning o f the Bhadrakalpa together with the world It was in the center of the Three Thousand Great Chiliocosm and stretched from the surface of the earth down to the Diamond Wheel at the bottom of it It was made of diamond and its circumference was more than a hundred paces It was called the Diamond Seat to indicate that it was strong and indestructible but was able to destroy all other things If it were not located at this spot the earth would quake without cease and if there were no seat made of diamond there would be no suitable place for the Buddha to manifest the Diamond Samadhi In order to subdue Mara and attain enlightenment he had to stay at this place If he had stayed elsewhere the earth would have been overturned Therefore all one thousand Buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa will come here to achieve Buddhahood When the world tilted and quaked this place alone remained still During the last one or two hundred years the people being less blessed could not see the Diamond Seat when they went to the Bodhi tree After the nirvana of the Buddha the kings of various countries set up two images of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva sitting facing the east to mark the southern and northern limits It was said by tradition that when these images of the Bodhisattva sank and disappeared the Buddha Dharma would come to its end The Bodhisattva on the southern side had then sunken down up to its chest The Bodhi tree was a pippala tree When the Buddha was living in the world it was several hundred feet tall but as it had been cut down repeatedly by evil kings it was now about fifty feet high Because the Buddha had sat under it and achieved Supreme Perfect Enlightenment it was known as the Bodhi tree The trunk o f the tree was yellowish white in color and the branches and leaves were green and sleek never withering in the autumn and winter seasons But on the day of the Tathagatas nirvana the leaves would all fall suddenly and after one night new buds would burgeon as before On this day each year the kings o f different countries and their ministers always assembled under the tree to sprinkle and wash it with milk After having lit lamps and scat tered flowers they collected the withered leaves and went away Upon his arrival there the Master worshipped the Bodhi tree and the image of the Buddha attaining enlightenment made by Maitreya Bodhisattva After having looked at the image with deep sincerity he prostrated himself before it and deplored sadly saying with selfreproach I do not know where I was bom in the course of transmigration at the time when the Buddha attained enlighten ment I could only come here at this time the end of the Image Period It makes me think that my karmic hindrances must have been very heavy While he was saying so his eyes brimmed with sorrowful tears As that was the time when the monks dismissed the summer retreat several thousand people forgathered from far and near Those who saw the Master were choked by sobs in sympathy with him For one yojana around the place was full of holy sites and the Master stayed there for eight or nine days to worship them all On the tenth day the Sangha of Nalanda Monastery dis patched four virtuous monks to welcome the Master and he went with them After going for about seven yojanas they reached the manor of the monastery which was the village in which the Vener able Maudgalyayana was born Shortly after they had taken their meal at the manor more than two hundred monks and over a thousand lay supporters holding banners canopies flowers and incense came to greet the Master They praised him all around and ushered him into Nalanda Monastery Upon his arrival all the monks assembled When the Master had met them all a special seat was prepared for him to sit beside the abbot Then all the other monks also took their seats When they had sat down the Director of Duties was asked to strike a bell to make an announcement that the Master was to reside in the monastery with permission to use in common with all the other monks all the religious utensils and implements possessed by the Sangha Then a group of twenty monks neither too old nor too young who were well versed in the scriptures and disciplinary rules with neat appearance and good deportment were assigned to bring the Master to see the Right Dharma Store ie the Venerable Sllabhadra Out of respect for him the monks did not use his name but called him the Right Dharma Store So the Master went with the monks to have an audience with the teacher and upon seeing him the Master respected him as his personal tutor with uttermost veneration In accordance with local rites he crawled on his knees and elbows kissed the teachers feet and prostrated himself to pay homage to him When the greetings and compliments were over the Dharma Store ordered a large number of seats to be prepared and invited the Master and the other monks to sit down After they had taken their seats he asked the Master where he had come from In reply the Master said I came from China with the wish to study the Yogacarabhumi Sastra under the instruction of the teacher Upon hearing these words the teacher shed tears and called for his disciple Buddhabhadra  who was the Dharma Stores nephew over seventy years old well versed in the scriptures and commentaries and eloquent in discus sion The Dharma Store said to him You may tell the monks here how I suffered from illness three years ago On hearing this Buddhabhadra wept and wiped his tears while relating the event that had happened before saying The upadhyaya used to suffer from gout Each time he had an attack of it his hands and feet were convulsed as painfully as if they were burned by fire or pricked by a knife His illness was sometimes better and sometimes worse for more than twenty years Three years ago the pain was aggravated to such an extent that he became disgusted with his body and wished to put an end to his life by starvation One night he saw in a dream three celestial beings One was golden yellow another one purplish blue and the third one silvery white in color All of them had regular features and were dressed in light and brilliant garments They came and asked the upadhyaya Do you intend to get rid of this body of yours It is said in the scriptures that the corporeal body is a cause of suffering but it is not said that one should discard ones body with a feeling of abhorrence You were once a king in a past life and caused much trouble to the people so you incurred your present retribution It befits you to meditate on your past misdeeds and repent with sincerity Bear the pain with patience preach the scriptures and commentaries diligently and then it will disappear by itself Even if you do away with your body you can never terminate your suffering Having heard this admonition the upadhyaya worshipped the divine beings The golden one pointing at the blue one said to the upadhyaya Do you recognize him He is Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva He also pointed at the silvery one and said This is Maitreya Bodhisattva The upadhyaya immediately worshipped Maitreya Bodhisattva and inquired of him Silabhadra has always wished to be reborn in your respectable palace but I do not know whether I can realize my wish In reply the Bodhisattva said If you widely spread the Right Dharma you will be able to be reborn there Then the golden figure introduced himself saying I am Manjusri Bodhisattva As we saw that you intended to relinquish your body without any beneficial result we have come to advise you not to do so You should act according to my words to propagate the Right Dharma and preach the Yogacarabhumi Sastra and other texts to all those who have not yet heard about them Your body will then gradually regain peace and health and you need not worry about it A Chinese monk who takes delight in under standing the Great Dharma will come to study under you Since then the upadhyaya has been cured of his painful disease All the monks who had heard about this account remarked with praise that it was an unusual event Having personally heard this account the Master could not refrain from feeling both excited and happy He again worshipped the teacher with gratitude saying If it is just as you have said I shall study with the utmost effort May the teacher be compas sionate and accept me as his pupil to receive his instructions The Dharma Store asked again How many years have you spent on the way Three years was the reply Since the time coincided with the dream the teacher expressing the fraternity of a tutor with a pupil gave the Master various advice and counsels to his delight After the conversation the Master took his leave He was lodged on the fourth storey of the house of Buddhabhadra in the courtyard o f King Baladitya When the seven days entertainment was over he was again lodged in the main chamber to the north of the house of Dharmapala Bodhisattva with an increase in provi sions He was provided daily with one hundred twenty betel leaves twenty areca nuts twenty nutmegs one tael of bomeol incense and one sheng of mahasali rice A grain of this rice was bigger than a black bean and when it was cooked it had a fragrance and delicious taste that no other kind of rice possessed This kind of nonglutinous rice was produced only in Magadha and was not found elsewhere As it was supplied only to kings and learned monks of virtue it was called rice supplied to great persons He was also given a monthly supply of three sheng of oil and as regards butter and milk he took as much as he needed every day He had a servant and a Brahman to serve him and was exempted from monastic duties and when he went out he had an elephant to carry him Among the ten thousand host and guest monks of Nalanda Monastery only ten persons including the Master enjoyed such provisions Wherever the Master travelled he was always treated in such a courteous manner Nalanda Monastery means the monastery of Insatiability in Almsgiving It was said by old tradition that to the south of the monastery there had been a pond in a mango grove in which lived a dragon named Nalanda As the monastery was built beside the pond it was named so It was also said that when the Tathagata was practising the Bodhisattva path in one of his former lives he was a great king and founded his capital at this place As he had pity on the poor and the lonely he often gave alms to them and in memory of his beneficence the people called the place Insatiability in Almsgiving This place was originally a garden of the Elder Amra Five hundred merchants purchased it with ten koti of golden coins and offered it to the Buddha who preached the Dharma at this place for three months Most of the merchants attained sainthood After the Buddhas nirvana Sakraditya  a former king of this country built this monastery in respectful memory of the Buddha After the demise of the king his son King Buddhagupta  repeated his great deed and built another monastery to the south His son King Tathagata also built a monastery to the east His son Baladitya  built another monastery to the northeast Afterward when he saw a holy monk coming from China to receive his offerings he was so pleased that he abdicated and became a monk himself His son Vajra mea n in g Diamond succeeded to the Throne and also built a monastery to the north Later a king o f Central India built another monastery beside it Thus six kings built as many monasteries one after the other and an enclosure was made with bricks to merge them all into one monastery with one common entrance There were separate courtyards divided into eight depart ments The temples stood high in the mist and the shrines hovered over the rosy clouds Breeze and fog rose from the doors and windows and the sun and moon shone alternately at the eaves of the buildings Moreover brooks of clear water meandered through the compounds with blue lotuses and water lilies growing in them The flowers of sandalwood trees glowed inside the enclosure and outside it there was a dense mango grove In India there were thousands o f monasteries but this was the most magnificent and sublime of them all Ten thousand monks always lived there both hosts and guests They studied Mahayana teachings and the doctrines of the eighteen schools as well as worldly books such as the Vedas They also learned about works on logic grammar medicine and divination Those who could understand twenty scriptures and commentaries amounted to over a thousand persons More than five hundred persons had mastered thirty works while ten persons including the Master were experts on fifty works The Venerable Silabhadra was the only person who had thoroughly mastered all the texts and being a scholar of advanced age and unusual virtue he was a great teacher of all the monks Lectures were given at more than studied diligently without wasting a single moment As all the monks who lived there were men of virtue the atmosphere in the monastery was naturally solemn and dignified For more than seven hundred years since its establishment none of the monks had committed any offence Out of respect for them the king gave more than a hundred villages for their sustenance Each village had two hundred families who daily provided several hundred shi of polished nonglutinous rice butter and milk Thus the students could enjoy sufficient supplies of the four requisites without the trouble of going to beg for them It was because of this effort of their supporters that the scholars could gain achieve ments in learning Having been properly lodged in Nalanda Monastery the Master repaired to the city of Rajagrha to see and worship the holy sites The old city of Rajagrha called the city of Kusagrapura  was located at the center of Magadha and most of the ancient kings lived in it As the place produced good fragrant cogon grass it was named after it It was surrounded on all sides by high and precipitous hills with a footpath leading to the west and a main gate in the north It was long from east to west and narrow from south to north its circum ference being more than one hundred fifty li Within it was a smaller city the foundations of which were more than thirty li in circumference Sandalwood trees throve in groves everywhere with calyxes sprouting and flowers blooming in all four seasons without intermission and the leaves were golden in color To the north outside the palace city there was a stupa built at the place where Devadatta and Ajatasatru released an intoxicated elephant named Dhanapala in an attempt to injure the Buddha To the northeast of this place was another stupa marking the spot where Sariputra attained sainthood after hearing the Dharma from the bhiksu Asvajit Not far away to the north there was a large and deep pitfall which was the place where Srigupta mean ing Superior Secret being instigated by the evil advice o f some heretics attempted to harm the Buddha with a fire pit and poi soned rice To the northeast of the big pitfall a stupa was built at a bend of the hillcity which was the place where Jivaka formerly inaccurately known as Qipo the great physician constructed a preaching hall for the Buddha Beside the stupa the old residence of Jivaka was still there Travelling northeast from the palace city for fourteen or fifteen li the Master reached Grdhrakuta Mountain meaning Vulture Peak or Vulture Terrace formerly inaccurately known as Qidujueshan This mountain was connected with the range of mountains in the north and stood out specially high in the shape of a vulture or a tall terrace hence the name There were streams of clear water with rocks of strange shapes and the trees in the wood were dense and luxuriant When the Tathagata was living in the world he spent most of his time on this mountain preaching on the Saddharmapundarika Sutra the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra and a large number of other sutras Going from the northern gate of the hill city for about one li he reached the Karanda Bamboo Grove where there was still a brick chamber in which the Tathagata had lived many times in the old days and laid down the disciplinary rules The owner of the grove was named Karanda and he had formerly offered it to some heretics But when he saw the Buddha and heard the profound Dharma he regretted that he did not offer it to the Tathagata When the Goddess of Earth came to know his mind she worked disastrous and uncanny phenomena to frighten the heretics in order to drive them out of the grove Then the goddess told the owner Elder if you wish to offer your grove to the Buddha you may quickly go there now The heretics moved out indignantly while the Elder was happy After having constructed a vihara in the grove he went personally to invite the Buddha who accepted his invitation To the east of the Bamboo Grove there was another stupa built by King Ajatasatru meaning Enemy before Birth formerly known incorrectly as Asheshi After the nirvana of the Tathagata various kings shared his relic bones King Ajatasatru obtained his portion which he brought back home and built this stupa for its enshrine ment When King Asoka desired to construct many stupas at different places he opened this stupa and took out the relics leaving only a small portion in it which now often emitted a light At a distance of five or six li to the southwest of the Bamboo Grove there was another bamboo wood by the side of a hill in which was a large rock chamber This was the place where the Venerable Mahakasyapa and    great arhats assembled to collect the Tripitaka after the nirvana of the Tathagata At the time of the assemblage innumerable holy monks gathered together and Kasyapa said to them Those among the assembly who know themselves to possess the three knowledges and the six super natural powers and who comprehend the whole Dharma Pitaka of the Tathagata without error and misunderstanding may stay here w h ile the rest may go anywhere they please Thus    persons were selected As Ananda was still at the stage of learning Kasyapa said to him As you are not completely free from passions you should not defile this pure assembly Being ashamed of himself Ananda went away After practising the Way earnestly for one night he cut off the bondage of the Three Worlds and attained Arhatship Then he came back and knocked at the door Kasyapa asked him Have you cut off bondage completely Yes was the reply Kasyapa said again If you have completely cut off bondage you need not trouble me to open the door for you you should be able to enter at will And so Ananda entered the chamber through a crack in the door and worshipped at the monks feet Kasyapa holding his hands said to him It was because I wished you to clear away all your passions and realize sainthood that I compelled you to go out You should understand this and bear no grudge against me Ananda said If I bear a grudge against anybody how can I be said to have completely cut off bondage After saying so he worshipped Kasyapa and took his seat This occurred on the fifteenth day of the month at the beginning of the summer retreat Kasyapa said to Ananda The Tathagata used to praise you among the monks saying that you were the most learned dis ciple and grasped all of the Dharma Now you may ascend the pulpit and recite the Sutra Pitaka namely all the scriptures for the assembly o f monks At this order Ananda rose to his feet After worshipping toward the hill where the Buddha had entered nirvana he ascended the pulpit and recited the scriptures while the monks recorded what he was reciting After the recital of the scriptures Upali was told to recite the Vinaya Pitaka namely all the disciplinary rules When this recital was over Kasyapa him self recited the Abhidharma Pitaka namely all the commentaries and expositions of the scriptures During the three months of summer retreat the Tnpitaka was collected and inscribed on palm leaves for widespread circulation The holy monks said among themselves Our collection of the Tripitaka is an act to repay the kindness of the Buddha and it is due to his spiritual power that we have listened to it today As Mahakasyapa was the Elder o f the assembly of monks they were named the school of Elders At a distance of twenty li west of this place there was a stupa built by King Asoka at the place where the Mahasamghika school had held their assembly Several thousand persons including monks who were still in the stages of learning and arhats who had nothing more to learn gathered together at this place when they were not permitted to take part in the congregation held by Mahakasyapa They said among themselves When the Tathagata was alive we all studied under one teacher But can we not also collect the Dharma Pitaka to requite the Buddha for his kindness Thus they also collected the Sutra Pitaka the Vinaya Pitaka the Abhidharma Pitaka the Miscellaneous Pitaka and the Dharani Pitaka for a total number of five collections Going further northeast for three or four li the Master reached the city of Rajagrha  The outer wall of the city had broken down but the inner wall more than twenty li in circumference still remained high with a gate on each side Formerly when King Bimbisara was living in his palace at Kusagrapura it was densely populated and the houses of the inhabi tants were built closely together As they suffered frequently from fire disasters a strict law was enforced that whoever carelessly caused a fire should be sent to live in the Cold Forest which was a dire place where the people of that country disposed of corpses Shortly afterward a fire broke out in the palace The king said I am the king of the people If I violate the law or do not observe it I will be in no position to punish my subjects Ordering the Crown Prince to stay behind the king moved to live in the Cold Forest Upon hearing that King Bimbisara was living in the wilds the king of Vaisali intended to dispatch his troops to attack him Scouts got news of it and reported to King Bimbisara who then built a city at the place As it had been the abode of the king it was named the City of the Kings House and this was the New City Afterward when King Ajatasatru succeeded to the Throne he made it the capital until King Asoka shifted the capital to Pataliputra the city was then given to the Brahmans Now there were no other inhabi tants in the city except more than a thousand families of Brahmans In the southwest comer of the palace city there was a stupa built at the site of the old residence of the Elder Jyotiska meaning Luminary formerly inaccurately known as Shutiqie Beside it was the place where Rahula was converted To the northwest of Nalanda Monastery there was a large temple more than three hundred feet high built by King Baladitya It was magnificent and very beautiful and the Buddhas image in it looked the same as the one at the Bodhi tree To the northeast of the temple was a stupa built at a place where the Tathagata had once preached the Dharma for seven days Further to the north west were places where the four past Buddhas had sat To the south was the bronze temple built by King Siladitya but the construction was unfinished Otherwise it would have been more than a hundred feet in height according to a careful study of its design More than two hundred paces to the east of the city was a bronze standing image of the Buddha more than eighty feet high which could be housed only in a multilayer pavilion six storeys tall built by King Purnavarman in olden times A few li toward the east was a stupa built at the place where King Bimbisara together with hundreds and thousands of his people welcomed and greeted the Buddha when he came here on his way to Rajagrha after he had just achieved the Way Again travelling eastward for more than thirty li the Master reached Indrasailaguha Mountain In front of the monastery on the east peak of the mountain there was a stupa named Hamsa  Formerly in accordance with the gradual teaching of the Hinayana school the three kinds of pure meat were eaten in this monastery Once it was in short supply and unobtain able When the supervisor was at a loss what to do he saw a flock of wild geese flying in the air He looked up and said jokingly Today the monks are running short of food The Mahasattva should know that this is the right time to make a sacrifice When he had just said so the leading goose in the flight flew back deplumed itself high in the clouds and dropped to the ground On seeing this the monk was both ashamed and fright ened and he told the incident to all the other monks who were astonished upon hearing it and sighed with sorrow All of them shed tears of regret over the matter They said among themselves This is a Bodhisattva Who are we to venture to eat his flesh The Tathagata taught us to prevent evils in a gradual way But we grasped what he taught us at the inceptive stage as his ultimate teaching It is because we stick to ignorance without trying to correct it that we have caused this disaster From now onward we should follow the Mahayana teaching and never eat the three kinds of pure meat again Thereupon they built a stupa for the burial of the dead goose with an inscription relating its good intentions so that its good name might be transmitted to posterity for ever All these holy sites the Master visited and worshipped all around It was not until returning to Nalanda Monastery that the Master asked the Dharma teacher Sllabhadra to expound the Yogacarabhumi Sastra Several thousand men attended the lectures to gether with him After a moment when the subject of the work had just been explained a Brahman was heard wailing and also laugh ing and talking outside the monastery Being asked why he said in reply I am from eastern India Once I made a vow before the image of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva at Potalaka Mountain that I would become a king The Bodhisattva appeared in person before me and reproached me saying Do not make such a vow Later on a certain day of such and such a month in the year so and so the Dharma teacher Sllabhadra of Nalanda Monastery will expound the Yogacarabhumi Sastra for a Chinese monk You should go to attend the lectures As you will be able to see the Buddha after hearing the Dharma what is the use of becoming a king Now I see that a Chinese monk has come and the teacher is preaching for him just as I was told before That is why I feel both excited and exhila rated Thus the Dharma teacher Sllabhadra allowed him to stay and attend the lectures After fifteen months when the lectures were concluded someone was dispatched to send the Brahman to see Ring Siladitya who bestowed on him a fief of three villages In this monastery the Master listened to the exposition of the Yogacarabhumi Sastra three times to that of the Nyayanusara Sastra the Prakaranaryavaca Sastra andthe Abhidharmasamuday a Prakarana one time each to that of the Hetuvidya Sastra the Sabdavidya Sastra the Samuccayapramana Sastra etc two times each as well as to that of the Madhyamika Sastra and the Sata Sastra three times each As regards the Abhidharmakosa Sastra the Vibhasa Sastra the Jnanaprasthanasatpadabhidharma etc which he had already studied in Kasmira and other countries he merely read through them and clarified some dubious points he had found in them He also studied at the same time some Brahmanic books The Indian Sanskrit book that he studied was entitled Analytical Exposition o f Grammar of which the origin and author were unknown At the beginning of each kalpa Brahma transmitted it to the heavenly beings and as it was transmitted by Brahma it was called the Brahmanic Book Being a very voluminous work it consisted of one million stanzas and it was the work formerly translated as the Pijialuolun But it was mispronounced and the correct name is Vyakarana meaning Analytical Exposition o f Grammar It was so called because it gives a full grammatical analysis of words by which all dharmas are explained Formerly at the beginning of the Kalpa of Formation Brahma first taught it in one million stanzas Later at the beginning of the Kalpa of Existence Indra abridged it to a hundred thousand stanzas Still later the Rsi Panini a Brahman of the city of Salatura in the country of Gandhara of northern India again condensed it to eight thousand stanzas and this was the version prevalent in India then Recently a Brahman of southern India again shortened it to twentyfive hundred stanzas for the king of South India but this version though very popular in frontier and uncultivated countries was never studied by the erudite scholars of India All these were fundamental texts dealing with the sounds and words of the Western Region An auxiliary work that was lucid and helpful was the Concise Analytical Exposition o f Grammar in a thousand stanzas There was another book in three hundred stanzas dealing with the vowels Of the two books that dealt with the consonants one was named the Manthaka in three thousand stanzas and one was named the Unadi in twentyfive hundred stanzas They differentiated vowels and consonants The Astadhatu Sastra in eight hundred stanzas briefly dealt with the combining of vowels and consonants One is the paradigm of the tinanta with eighteen verbal inflections and the second is the paradigm of the subanta with twentyfour nominal inflections The tinanta paradigm is used for writing elegant and graceful compositions but seldom for ordinary writings while the twentyfour inflections are used for all styles of writing The eighteen inflections of the tinanta paradigm comprise two groups namely theparasmai and the atmane Each group has nine inflections constituting a total of eighteen Of the first nine inflec tions three are for the subject of a statement three are for transitive verbs and three are for intransitive verbs The three terminations of each of the three groups indicate the three numbers Thus it is said that each of the three groups has three terminations In the parasmai voice we may make a statement in either the positive or the negative manner For the nine verb forms of the atmane voice we just add the suffix vyati to the above nine terminations otherwise they are the same as the above endings Those who were proficient in these rules could write excellent compositions without ambiguity and express themselves in an extremely elegant style The twentyfour noun forms of the subanta voice are made up of eight principal cases each of which has three numbers namely the singular the dual and the plural Thus there are altogether twentyfour forms And each of the twentyfour forms has three genders namely the masculine the feminine and the neuter the first is the nominative which indicates the subject the second is the accusative which indicates what is acted upon the third is the instrumental which denotes the doer and the instrument by which something is done the fourth is the dative which indicates for whom a thing is done the fifth is the ablative which denotes the cause of a thing the sixth is the genitive which shows to whom a thing belongs the seventh is the locative which shows the location in which a thing is done and the eighth is the vocative which implies addressing or calling a thing From these few examples the other declensions may be under stood It would be difficult to make a full statement of the endings of all the words The Master was thoroughly versed in this lan guage and could talk with the people o f that country in a scholarly manner with great elegance Thus he made profound studies of the teachings of various schools and studied Sanskrit books for five years From here the Master continued his journey to the country of Iranaparvata On the way he reached Kapotaka Monastery Two or three li to the south of this monastery there was an isolated hill the peaks of which were lofty and precipitous with gloomy and desolate woods The water in the streams and ponds was clean and lucid and the bright flowers were sweet and fragrant Since it was a place of beautiful scenery there were quite a number of temples with many kinds of wonderful and miraculous manifestations In the central temple there was an image of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva carved in sandalwood which possessed spiritual power and was specially honored by the people There were always tens of people fasting for seven days or a fortnight and praying for the fulfillment of their wishes Those who were most pious in their minds might behold the Bodhisattva emerging from the sandal wood image as a stately figure with a majestic light shining brightly to comfort them and grant them their wishes Such a spiritual vision had been witnessed time and again by the people and thus more and more devotees turned to him in adoration Fearing that the visitors might defile the holy image the templekeepers had made wooden railings around the statue at a distance of about seven paces from it Those who came to worship the image did so outside the railings and were not allowed to go near it The incense and flowers that they offered were flung to the image from a distance When the flowers rested on the hands or b ung upon the arms of the Bodhisattvas statue it was considered a good omen to augur that ones wishes could be fulfilled With the desire to say prayers the Master purchased different kinds of flowers and strung them into garlands which he brought to the image After having paid homage and said praises with a sincere mind to the Bodhisattva he knelt before the image and made three wishes saying First may the flowers fall on your hands if I can return home safely without any trouble after I have completed my studies here Second may a garland hang upon your arm if I can be reborn as I wish in the Tusita Palace to serve Maitreya Bodhisattva through the merit and wisdom that I have cultivated Thirdly as it is expounded in the holy teachings that some sentient beings possess no Buddha nature I am in doubt as to whether I possess it or not May a garland hang on your neck if I am endowed with the Buddha nature and can become a Buddha through spiritual cultivation After saying so he scattered the flowers from a distance All of them fell in the places he had prayed for Since he was satisfied about his wishes his happiness knew no bounds On seeing this event the other worshippers and the templekeepers snapped their fingers and kissed his feet in delight saying that it was an unprecedented thing They wished that when the Master became a Buddha in the future he would remember this occurrence on that day and save them first From here the Master proceeded gradually and reached the country of Iranaparvata There were ten monasteries with more than four thousand monks most of whom studied the Hinayana teachings o f the Sarvastivada school Recently the king of a neigh boring kingdom had deposed the monarch of this country pre sented the capital city to the monks and also constructed two monasteries there with a thousand monks living in each of them There were two teachers of great virtue both of whom were well versed in the teachings of the Sarvastivada school One was named Tathagatagupta and the other Ksantisimha  The Master stayed there for one year to study the Vibhasa Sastra the Nyayanusara Sastra and other texts with them To the south of the capital city there was a stupa built at a place where the Buddha had formerly preached the Dharma to heavenly and human beings for three months Beside it were traces left by the four past Buddhas The country bordered on the Ganges in the west In the south it reached the Small Isolated Hill where the Buddha had formerly spent three months during the summer retreat and subdued the yaksa Vakula On a big rock below the peak at the southeast of the hill there was a trace of where the Buddha had sat It was more than one inch deep in the rock five feet two inches long and four feet one inch wide There was also a trace where the Buddha had placed his kundika a bathing pot formerly incorrectly transliterated junchi It was over one inch thick with decorative designs of eightpetalled flowers On the south border of the country there was a desolate forest in which were many elephants strong and enormous in size Beginning with the Country of Camp a and Ending with the Invitation of the King of Kamarupa Going eastward from here along the southern bank of the Ganges for more than three hundred li the Master reached the country of Campa  There were ten monas teries with more than two hundred monks who studied the Hinayana teachings The city wall several tens of feet high was built with bricks Its foundation and moat were deep and wide render ing the city very sublime and impregnable Formerly at the begin ning o f the kalpa all the people lived in caves Afterward a celestial maiden came down to the human world and while she was bathing in the Ganges the water spirit touched her body Thus she gave birth to four sons who divided and ruled over Jambudvipa as kings They demarcated the boundaries and built villages and towns and this place was the capital of one of her sons Several tens of yojanas away from the southern boundary of this country there was a big mountain with a forest of dense and exuberant trees stretching for more than two hundred li in which there were numerous wild elephants several hundred in a herd That was why the two countries of Iranaparvata and Campa had the largest number of elephant troops Elephant catchers were often ordered to catch and tame elephants in this forest for the purposes of riding and replenishing the need of the state It was also infested with jackals rhinoceros and black leopards nobody dared to travel in it It was said by tradition that before the Buddha was bom  once a cowherd who was tending several hundred cows drove the cattle into this forest One of the cows went away from the herd by itself and repeatedly disappeared to an unknown place In the evenings when the cattle were to go back it returned to the herd with a brilliant and pleasant luster and lowed in such an unusual man ner that all the other cows feared it and none dared to be in front o f it This happened for many days Feeling strange about it the cowherd secretly watched the cow In a moment the cow went away as usual and he followed it to see what would happen When he saw that the cow entered an aperture in the rocks he also followed it in After walking for four or five li he suddenly came to a bright place with trees and beautiful flowers and many strange blossoms and fruits so replendent to the eye that they were not found in the ordinary world He saw that the cow grazed at a place where the color of the grass and its fragrance and gloss were also not to be seen in the human world The man saw that the fruits were golden in color sweet and big in size He plucked one but dared not eat it though he longed to taste it After a while the cow came out and the cowherd followed it to return But when he reached the aper ture in the rocks and had not yet come out of it an evil demon snatched the fruit away not allowing him to take it out The cowherd inquired of a great physician about this matter and told him the shape of the fruit The physician said that he must not be so careless as to eat it but should try to bring one out The next day he again entered the place with the cow and picked one fruit which he kept in his bosom with the intention of bringing it back When the demon again tried to snatch it away the man hid the fruit inside his mouth but the demon gripped his throat so he swallowed the fruit Once it was in his stomach his body swelled to such a big size that he could not get out of the aperture though his head stuck out of it thus he could not return home When the people o f his family came in search of him they were surprised to see that he had been deformed Being still able to speak he told them what had happened The people of his family went back and employed many strong men trying to pull him out o f the aperture but they failed to move him When the king heard about this matter he came to see it for himself Fearing that it might cause future trouble he ordered men to dig him out but they also failed to move him In the long run that man was gradually lapidified but still retained the shape of a man Afterward another king knowing that this was the transformation by a fruit of immortality said to his attending minister Since that man was transformed by the effect of the drug his body itself must have become that drug too Although it looks like a rock the body has eventually become a divine object Send a man to cut a few pieces of it with a hammer and a chisel and bring them to me Under the orders of the king the minister went to the place with a workman who chopped with maximum effort at the rock for fully ten days but could not get a single piece o f the stone Travelling eastward from here for more than four hundred li the Master reached the country of Kajunghira in the domain of Central India to seek and worship holy sites There were six or seven monasteries with more than three hundred monks From here he crossed the Ganges to the east and after going for more than six hundred li he reached the country of Pundravardhana in the domain of southern India to seek and worship holy sites There were more than twenty monasteries with over three thousand monks who studied both Mahayana and Hinayana teachings More than twenty li to the west of the city was Vasibha Monastery with lofty and magnificent terraces and pavilions in which lived seven hundred monks Beside it was a stupa built by King Asoka at a place where the Buddha had once preached the Dharma for three months It often issued a brilliant light There were also traces left by the four past Buddhas when they walked up and down Stand ing nearby was a temple enshrining an image of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva that answered without fail all prayers of those who pleaded earnestly From here travelling southeast for more than nine hundred li the Master reached the country of Karnasuvarna in the domain of eastern India There were more than ten monasteries with over three hundred monks who studied the teaching of the Hinayana Sammitlya school In three other monasteries milk and yoghurt were not eaten this was a tradition handed down by Devadatta Beside the big city was Raktamrttika Monas tery built by the king of this country when a sramana of southern India visited this country at the time when Buddhism was not known here and subdued a heretic who wore a metal sheet over his stomach by refuting his erroneous views Beside it was a stupa built by King Asoka at a place where the Buddha had once preached the Dharma for seven days Going out from here to the southeast the Master reached the country of Samatata  which bor dered on the great sea There were more than thirty monasteries with over two thousand monks who studied the doctrines of the Sthavira school The heretical followers who worshipped in deva temples were also numerous Not far from the city was a stupa built by King Asoka at a place where the Buddha had once preached the Dharma for men and heavenly beings for seven days Not far from here was another monastery in which there was a Buddha image made of blue jade It was eight feet tall with a fine and dignified appear ance It often had a natural fragrance the aroma of which per vaded the whole courtyard and its multicolored light always lit up the sky All those who witnessed the sight or heard about it would deeply cherish the mind o f the Way In the valley to the northeast by the seaside was the country of Sriksetra Further to the southeast by the gulf was the country o f Kamalarika Further east was the country of Dvarapati Still further east was the country of Isanapura All these six countries were located far beyond high mountains and deep seas Though the Master did not go into these lands he was able to obtain information about their customs and habits Going westward from the country of Samatata for more than nine hundred li the Master reached the country of Tamralipti in the domain of eastern India which was located near a bay of the sea There were more than ten monasteries with over a thousand monks Beside the city was a stupa more than two hundred feet high built by King Asoka Close to it were traces left by the four past Buddhas when they walked up and down At that time the Master heard that in the sea there was the country of Simhala and that there were people there well versed in the Tripitaka of the Sthavira school and people knowing the Yogacarabhumi Sastra well Going by sea one had to sail for seven hundred yojanas to reach there Before he started the voyage he met a monk from southern India who advised him You need not take the sea route to go to the Kingdom of Lions as the problems of adverse wind yaksas and tempests often occur in the sea You may go from the southeast cape of southern India and reach that country after a voyage of only three days Although you will have to climb mountains and cross rivers it will be safer for you and by the way you may visit the holy sites in Udra and other countries The Master then proceeded southwest to the country of Udra  There were more than a hundred monasteries with over ten thousand monks who studied the Dharma of Mahayana teachings There were also heretics who worshipped in deva temples and the wrong and right believers lived together More than ten stupas all built by King Asoka often manifested miraculous signs By the great sea in the southeast o f the country was the city of Caritra  a port where sea going merchants and travellers from distant lands came and went away or took rest The distance to the country of Simhala in the south was more than twenty thousand li On a calm and cloudless night one might see at a distance the gleam of the gems and pearls on the stupa of the Buddhas tooth relic in that country shining as brightly as stars in the sky Going southwest from here through a big forest for over twelve hundred li the Master reached the country of Korigoda in the domain o f eastern India Going further southwest from here through a big desolate forest for fourteen hundred or fifteen hundred li he reached the country of Kalinga  There were more than ten monasteries with over five hundred monks who studied the Dharma of the Sthavira school Formerly this coun try was very densely populated But once the people offended a rsi possessing the five supernatural powers who out o f anger and resentment killed all the people old and young by malignant incantation Afterward people from other places gradually migrated to this country but it was still not fully inhabited Going northwest from here for more than eighteen hundred li the Master reached the country of South Kosala in the domain of Central India The king who was a ksatriya by caste esteemed Buddhism with deference and loved the arts and learning There were a hundred monasteries with ten thousand monks Heretics who worshipped in deva temples were also numerous and of varying types Not far to the south of the city there was an old monastery beside which was a stupa built by King Asoka Formerly the Tathagata once subdued heretics at this place with his super natural powers and later Nagarjuna Bodhisattva stayed in this monastery By that time the king was named Satavaha meaning Correctguiding He venerated Nagarjuna and provided him with rich sustenance At that time Deva Bodhisattva came from the country of Simhala and sought to hold a debate with Nagarjuna He approached the door and asked for admittance and the doorkeeper announced the guest Having already heard about the name of the visitor Nagarjuna filled a bowl with water and asked a disciple to show it to the guest On seeing the water Deva silently dropped a needle into it and the disciple brought the bowl back to his teacher Nagarjuna was greatly delighted to see it and he said The bowl filled with water signifies the fullness of my virtue He indicated by dropping the needle into the bowl that he could fathom the depth of my learning Such is the person with whom I could discuss the mysterious Way and to whom I may transmit the Lamp of Learning Then he asked the guest to be ushered in When they had taken their seats they talked and had a discussion with each other to their mutual delight as happy as fish put into water Nagarjuna said As I am getting old and feeble it will depend upon you to make the Sun of Wisdom shine brightly Deva stood up and worshipped at Nagaijunas feet saying Stupid as I am I venture to say that I shall follow your kind instructions In that country there was a Brahman who was well versed in Hetuvidya and the Master stayed there for more than a month to study the Samuccayapramana Sastra with him Going southeast from a big forest in the south of this country for more than nine hundred li the Master reached the country of Andhra  Beside the city there was a large monastery constructed magnificently with a beautiful and solemn appearance In front of it was a stone stupa several hundred feet high built by the Arhat Acara  More than twenty li to the southwest of the arhats monastery was an isolated hill on which was a stone stupa This was the place where Dignaga Bodhisattva composed the Hetuvidya Sastra Going southward from here for more than a thousand li the Master reached the country of Dhanakataka in the domain of southern India On a hill to the east of the city was Purvasaila Monastery and on a hill to the west of the city was Avarasaila Monastery built by a former king of this country for the Buddha The construction of these monasteries had all the specifications and structural styles of great mansions and possessed all the elegance and beauties of woods and springs Deities protected these monasteries and saints and sages lived in them Within a thousand years after the Buddhas nirvana there a thousand ordinary monks often came to spend the summer retreat together in these monasteries After the conclusion of the retreat they all attained Arhatship and went away by flying through the air After the lapse of a thousand years both saintly and ordinary monks lived together in them but during the last one hundred years or so the deities of the hills changed their tempera ment and molested and disturbed wayfarers Thus the people were fearful of them and none dared go there So the monasteries were now left empty and desolate having become deserted no monks lived in them Not far to the south of the city there was a big rocky hill which was the place where the Sastrin Bhavaviveka meaning Clear Distinction went into the Asuras palace to wait for Maitreya Bodhisattva to become a Buddha so as to solve his doubts In this country the Master met two monks One was named Subhuti and the other Surya Both of them were conversant with the Tripitaka of the Mahasamghika school He stayed there for several months to study the Mulabhidharma Sastra and other treatises with them and they also learned various Mahayana sastras from him Going westward from here for more than a thousand li the Master reached the country of Colya in the domain of southern India To the southeast o f the city there was a stupa built by King Asoka at a place where the Buddha had formerly displayed great supernatural powers to subdue heretics and preached the Dharma for the salvation of men and heavenly beings To the west of the city was an old monastery which was the place where Deva Bodhisattva had a discussion with the Arhat Uttara meaning Upper of this monastery After the seventh round of disputation the arhat was unable to say anything in retort So he secretly went by supernatural power to the Tusita Palace to ask for advice from Maitreya Bodhisattva who gave him a solution and told him That Deva has long been cultivating his merits and he will achieve the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood in the Bhadrakalpa You must not underestimate him After coming back the arhat solved the question that had been put to him Deva said This is the theory of Maitreya Bodhisattva and the solution was not found through your own wisdom Being convinced and feeling ashamed the arhat stood up and wor shipped Deva with an apology From here going south through a big forest for fifteen or sixteen hundred li the Master reached the country Dravida in the domain of southern India The capital of this country was Kancipura which was the birthplace of Dharmapala meaning DharmaProtector Bodhisattva The Bodhisattva was the son of a minister of this country and was a brilliant and intelligent person since his youth When he had come of age the king admiring his talents wished to marry the princess to him But as the Bodhisattva had been practising celibacy for a long time he had no mind for carnal desire Being greatly annoyed with worry on the night of his wedding he prayed for protection before an image of the Buddha wishing to free himself from the trouble Moved by his sincerity a great king of the deities carried him out and sent him into the Buddha hall of a monastery on a hill several hundred li away from the capital When the monks came and saw him they took him to be a thief Then the Bodhisattva gave them an account of his troublesome situation Those who heard about it were amazed and sympathetic and respected him for his high aim So he renounced his home and became a monk Afterward he devoted himself to the study of the Right Dharma and was able to understand the theories of various schools Thus he became a skilled writer He composed the SabcLavidyasamyukta Sastra in twentyfive thousand stanzas and also wrote several tens of books in exposition of the Satasastravaipulya the Vijuaptimatratasiddhi Sastra and the Hetuvidya Sastra all of which were popular works that were widely read As regards his rich virtues and high talents they are related in a separate biography The city of Kanclpura was a seaport of southern India from there one could reach the country of Simhala after three days voyage Before the Master started the voyage the king of that country died and the country suffered from famine and distur bance The learned monks named Bodhimeghesvara meaning Lord of the Cloud of Enlightenment and Abhayadamstra mean ing Fearless Tooth together with more than three hundred other monks fled to India and arrived at Kanclpura Having met the monks the Master asked them As I have heard that the learned monks of your country are conversant with the Tripitaka of the Sthavira school and well versed in the Yogdcarabhumi Sastra I am desirous of going there to pursue my studies Why have you teachers come to this place They said in reply Our king has passed away and the people are suffering from famine so we have nobody to depend upon We have heard that Jambudvipa is a rich and happy land of peace and security being the birthplace of the Buddha and having many holy sites That is why we have come here If Your Reverence has any doubtful points you may inquire of us just as you please The Master then quoted some important passages of the Yogacarabhumi Sastra to seek their elucidation but they could not exceed the scope of the expla nation given by Silabhadra The Master heard that at a distance of more than three thousand li from the boundary of this country was the country of Malakuta  It was located by the seaside and was extremely rich in unusual precious things To the east o f the city was a stupa built by King Asoka at the place where the Buddha once preached the Dharma and displayed great super natural powers for the salvation of numerous people By the sea side in the south of the country there was Malaya Mountain with its precipitous peaks and deep valleys in which there were white sandal trees and serpent sandal trees The latter resembled the former but their wood was cool by nature and so serpents mostly attached to them until the winter when they went into hiberna tion By their presence the serpent sandals were differentiated from the white sandals There were also fragrant karpura trees of which the trunk was like a pine but the leaves were different and the flowers and fruits were also not the same When the wood was sappy it had no fragrance but after it had been cut down and dried a scented substance like mica with the color of ice and snow was produced from the grain o f the wood This is what we call camphor The Master also heard that by the side of the sea in the northeast there was a city from which by travelling southeast for more than three thousand li one could reach the country of Simhala  The circum ference of this country was more than seven thousand li and its capital city was over forty li in circumference It was thickly inhabited and had plenty of cereal products The people were darkcomplected and of mean stature with an impetuous and irascible temperament Such was the general condition of that country Being an island o f gems this country produced many rare and precious things Once in southern India a girl was sent in marriage to a neighboring country and on the way she encountered a king of lions The people who escorted her fled away in fear leaving the girl alone in her carriage The lion came saw the girl and carried her far and deep into the mountains where he gathered fruits and caught fowls for her subsistence Through the passage of time she gave birth to a son and a daughter who were though human in shape cruel and brutal in nature When the son had grown up he inquired of his mother What sort of creature am I with an animal as a father and a human being as a mother So his mother told him the events that had occurred in the past The son said Since human beings and animals are different creatures why do you not go away but stick to this place His mother said It is not that I have no mind to go but that I have no means of escape The son then followed his father the lion climbing up moun tains and crossing over valleys in order observe his route One day when his father had gone far away he brought his mother and sister down to a village and proceeded to the home country of his mother to visit the family of his maternal uncle When they found that the family had no more offspring they took up their lodgings in a village When the king of lions returned he found that his wife and children were gone Being violently enraged he came out of the mountains entered the villages with roars and killed many of the villagers both men and women The people reported the case to the king who commanded his four divisions of troops and specially conscripted warriors to surround and shoot the lion On seeing them the lion roared with such vehemence that both the men and their horses tumbled to the ground and none dared to approach the animal After many days they could not succeed in their attack and so the king posted a public notice announcing that a reward of one koti of golden coins would be paid to anyone who could kill the lion The lions son said to his mother As we are in such unbearable hunger and cold I wish to answer the kings call What do you think of it His mother said No you must not do that Although he is an animal he is still your father If you committed patricide how could you be called a human being But the son said If I do not kill him he will never go away and he will probably come to this village in pursuit of us Once the king comes to know about it we also shall die and not be spared It is because o f us that the lion has become furious How can we give trouble to many people just for the sake of one life On seeing his son the lion became gentle and was glad and had no harmful intention His son then cut his throat and split his abdomen In spite of the pain the lion suffered the affliction motionless and died with kind feelings and deep affection for his son The king was pleased to hear about the event and inquired about it with amazement How did you do it At first the son refused to tell the truth but under the pressure of interrogation he related the whole story The king said Alas Nobody except the offspring of an animal could have such an inhuman mind But as I have promised a reward I will not go back on my word Two ships laden with big quantities of gold and provisions were put to drift aimlessly on the sea The ship of the son sailed to this Island of Gems Seeing that it was rich in rare valuables he settled down on the island Afterward some merchants came here with their families to procure gems He killed the merchants but kept their women by whom he had offspring Over many generations the population gradually multiplied and then they established a monarchical state As their distant progenitor had conquered a lion they named their country the Lion Country Meanwhile the daughters ship sailed to the west of Parasi where she was caught by a demon She gave birth to a group of daughters and founded what we now call the West Great Womens Country It was also said that Simhala was the name of a merchants son who being a man of quick wits escaped from the danger of raksasis  Later when he had become a king he came to this Island of Gems and slew all the raksasis He built up the capital of this country which was then called after his name This legend is found in the Record o f the Western Regions Formerly Buddhism was not known in this country One hun dred years after the nirvana of the Tathagata King Anokas younger brother Mahendra relinquished his desire and passion and achieved the fourth state of sainthood of a sramana He could come and go by air and visited this country to reveal and advocate the Buddha Dharma and display his supernatural powers The people of the country had faith in him admired him and built monasteries They were solemn in appearance observed the Vinaya rules strictly without ambiguity and admonished one another not to be idle Beside the kings palace was the Buddha Tooth Temple which was several hundred feet high and decorated with various valuable objects On the temple was erected an ornamental post with a big padmaraga ruby set on its spire which shone brilliantly in the air and could be seen at a distance of ten thousand li on a calm and cloudless night By the side of this temple there was another shrine also decorated with different kinds of precious things in which was enshrined a golden image of a Buddha whose topknot was adorned with a precious pearl of which nobody knew the price Once a man intended to steal this pearl but as the temple was strongly guarded he had no way to get to it So he dug a tunnel under the ground through which he entered the chamber to take the pearl But the image rose higher and higher so that the thief could not reach it He gave up his attempt and said Formerly when the Tathagata was practising the Bodhisattva path he never spared bis life and was not niggard in giving up his country or his capital city for the benefit of all living beings Why is he so parsimonious today In view of this I fear that what was said o f him might be untrue Then the image stooped down to give the pearl to the man Having obtained the pearl the man took it out to sell it Someone who recognized the pearl caught hold of him and sent him to the king The king asked him where he had obtained the pearl and the thief said The Buddha himself gave it to me And then he told the whole story The king went personally to see it and saw that the head of the image was still bent down On seeing this holy spirituality the king deepened his faith and gave a large amount of gems and jewels to the thief to redeem the pearl which he replaced on the topknot of the image It was still in existence At the southeast corner of the country was Lanka Mountain which was inhabited mostly by spirits and demons Formerly the Tathagata had preached the Lankavatara Sutra formerly incor rectly known as Lengqie on this mountain Several thousand li over the sea to the south of this country was Narikeladvipa The people of this island were dwarfish little more than three feet high and had human bodies with the beaks of birds They raised no crops but lived on coconuts As that country was far away beyond rough seas one could not go there in person and this brief information was heard from the people From Dravida the Master turned back to the northwest and travelled together with more than seventy Simhala monks to visit and pay homage to holy sites After going for more than two thousand li he reached the country of Konkanapura in the domain o f southern India There were more than a hundred monasteries with over ten thousand monks who studied the teachings of both Mahayana and Hinayana schools and there were also numerous deva temples and heretics Beside the kings palace city was a large monastery with more than three hundred monks who were all wellread scholars In this monastery there was a precious crown o f Prince Sarvasiddhartha formerly incorrectly known as Prince Xida which was less than two feet high and preserved in a valuable casket On festival days it was always displayed on a high terrace and those who worshipped it with utter sincerity might A monastery beside the city had a shrine hall in which was an image of Maitreya Bodhisattva carved in sandalwood It was more than ten feet high and also often effused an auspicious light It was made by the Arhat Srotakotivimsa To the north o f the city was a wood of tala trees more than thirty li in circumference The leaves o f these trees were oblong with a glossy color and they were the best material used for writing in various countries Travelling northwest from here through a big forest infested with ferocious beasts for twentyfour hundred or twentyfive hun dred li the Master reached the country of Maharastra in the domain o f southern India The king a ksatriya by birth was bellicose and fond of martial arts Thus the military forces of this country were well equipped and trained under strict and impartial discipline When his generals were defeated in battle with enemies he would not mete out punishments for them but simply ordered them to wear womens dress in order to humiliate them In most cases they were shamed into committing suicide He maintained several thousand warriors and several hundred fierce elephants In time of war he gave them wine to drink to make them halfintoxicated and then waved his flag to order them to fight Stimulated by the effect of alcohol they would charge forward and shatter the enemy lines without fail Depending on his military strength the king was arrogant and disregarded his enemies in neighboring countries Even King Siladitya who was confident of his own great and farsighted strategic wisdom and had a strong army under his command could not subjugate and control this country when he marched person ally to attack it There were more than a hundred monasteries with over five thousand monks who studied Mahayana as well as Hinayana teachings There were also deva temples of the heretics who smeared ashes on their bodies Located inside and outside the capital city there were five stupas all several hundred feet high built by King Aoka at places which the four past Buddhas had visited From here going northwest for more than a thousand li the Master crossed the Narmada River and reached the country of Bharukacchapa  Proceeding from here to the northwest for more than two thousand li he reached the country of Malava ie the Southern Lata country in the domain of southern India The people of this country were mild and gentle by custom and they loved art and learning In all the Five Indias Malava in the southwest and Magadha in the northeast were the only two countries where the people loved learning and honored sages and were eloquent in discussion as well as graceful in manners In this country there were more than a hundred monasteries with over twenty thousand monks who studied the Hinayana teachings o f the Sammitiya school There were also many heretics who smeared themselves with ashes and worshipped the devas According to tradition sixty years ago there was a king named Slladitya who was highly talented and learned Being a kind and benign ruler he loved and took care of his subjects and respected the Triple Gem From the time he became king until his demise he never spoke a harsh word nor did he show an angry face to anybody He never hurt the feelings of his ministers and people and would not injure the lives of such insects as mosquitoes and ants Water was filtered before it was given to elephants and horses to drink lest the aquatic microbes be killed He also ordered the people in his country not to kill living creatures so that wild animals were domesticated and jackals and wolves ceased to injure men He constructed an extremely magnificent monastery in which images o f the seven Buddhas were enshrined and he also convened the great quinquennial assembly During his reign of more than fifty years he performed such superior deeds without intermission and the multitude remembered him with adoration even at this time Over twenty li to the northwest of the capital city and beside a Brahmin village there was a pit where an arrogant Brahman having calumniated Mahayana teachings fell into hell alive This event is related in the Record o f the Western Regions Proceeding northwest from here for twentyfour hundred or twentyfive hundred li the Master reached the country of Atali in the domain of southern India This land produced pepper trees whose leaves resembled those of the pepper grown in the region of Shu in China and it also produced olibanum trees whose leaves were like those of our birchleaf pear Going northwest from here for three days the Master reached the country of Kheda  and going further north from here for more than a thousand li he reached the country of Valabhi  There were more than a hundred monasteries with over six thousand monks who studied the teachings of the Hinayana Sammitiya school When the Tathagata was living he visited this country several times Monuments were erected by King Asoka at all the places the Buddha had visited The reigning king was a ksatriya by caste being a soninlaw of King Slladitya of the country of Kanyakubja and his name was Dhruvabhata meaning Eternal Lord He was a man of impetuous disposition with imprudent manners but he esteemed virtue loved learning and also believed in the Triple Gem with veneration Every year he held a great assembly for seven days invited monks from different countries and offered them the best food and delicacies as well as bedding garments and everything else including medicine that was neces sary for their maintenance Travelling northwest from here for more than seven hundred li the Master reached the country of Anandapura in the domain of western India Going further northwest for more than five hundred li he reached the country of Surattha in the domain of western India Proceeding northeast from here for eighteen hun dred li he reached the country of Guijara Going southeast again for more than twentyeight hundred li he reached the country of Ujjayanl  Not far from the city was a stupa built at the place where King Asoka had made a hell Going northeast from here for more than a thousand li he reached the country of Jajhoti  Going further northeast from here for more than nine hundred li he reached the country of Mahesvarapura in the domain of Central India From here he returned westward to the country of Surastra Proceeding further west he reached the country of Audumbatira  When the Tathagata was living he visited this land frequently and King Asoka built stupas at all the sacred traces These stupas were still in existence Going west from here for more than two thousand li the Master reached the country of Langala in the domain of western India which was close by the great sea and was the passage to the West Womens Country By travelling northwest from here one could reach the country of Parsa in the domain of northern India It was said that the land abounded in pearls gems thick brocade fine linen good horses and camels which were the prod ucts of the country There were two or three monasteries with several hundred monks who studied the Hinayana teachings of the Sarvastivadan school The alms bowl of Sakyamuni Buddha was kept in the royal palace o f this country On the eastern frontier of the country was the city of Ormus and the northwest part bor dered on the country of Hrom An island to the southwest was the West Womens Country in which there were only women without any men It had many precious products As it was a dependency of the country of Hrom the king of Hrom sent men to mate with them once a year It was their custom that when male babies were bom  they were as a rule not brought up Going from the country of Langala to the northeast for more than seven hundred li the Master reached the country of Patasila  There there was a stupa several hundred feet high built by King Asoka in which there were sariras that often issued a bright light This was the place where the Tathagata as a rsi in a former life was once killed by a king Going northeast from here for more than three hundred li the Master reached the country of Avanda in the domain of western India In a big forest to the northeast of the capital city there were the old foundations of a monastery in which the Buddha had formerly permitted the monks to wear jifu footgear meaning boots Beside a stupa built by King Asoka was a temple that housed a standing statue of the Buddha carved in blue stone It often emitted a bright light In a big forest about eight hundred paces further to the south was another stupa built by King Asoka at a place where the Tathagata had once spent a night and as it was cold covered himself with three robes one over the other The following morning he gave his bhiksus permission to wear double robes Going east from here for more than seven hundred li the Master reached the country of Sindhu in the domain of western India This land produced gold silver brass cattle sheep and camels as well as red white and black salt which was taken as medicine in other places When the Tathagata was living he visited this country several times At all the holy traces stupas were built by King Asoka to mark the spots There were also the traces left by the great Arhat Upagupta when he travelled in this country Going further east from here for nine hundred li the Master crossed the river to the eastern bank and reached the country of Mulasthanapura  It was the custom of this country to worship the devas in a lofty and magnifi cent temple The image of the sun god was cast in gold and adorned with various kinds of jewels Many people of different countries came to pray before it In the temple there were flowers trees pools and ponds with winding stepways paved with bricks All those who visited the temple loved and enjoyed the place without exception Going northeast from here for more than seven hundred li the Master reached the country of Parvata in the domain o f northern India Beside the city there was a big monastery with more than a hundred monks all of whom studied Mahayana teachings This was the place where the Sastrin Jinaputra meaning Victorious Son composed the Yogacarabhumi Sastra Karika and it was also the place where the Sastrins Bhadraruci and Gunaprabha renounced their homes to become monks From here the Master turned toward the southeast and returned to Nalanda Monastery in Magadha After having paid homage to the Right Dharma Store he heard that three yojanas to the west of the monastery was Tiladhaka Monastery in which lived a virtuous monk named Prajnabhadra a native of the country of Balapati who had become a monk of the Sarvastivada school and was well versed in the Tripitaka of his own school as well as in Sabdavidya and Hetuvidya The Master went to stay with him for two months to seek his advice about the solution to some doubtful points the Master had in his mind From here the Master again went to an upasaka  the Sastrin Jayasena at Stickwood Hill Jayasena was a native of the country of Surastra and a ksatriya by birth Since his youth he loved learning and at first he studied Hetuvidya with the Sastrin Bhadraruei Then he learned Sabdavidya and the treatises of both Mahayana and Hinayana schools from Sthiramati Bodhisattva He also studied the Yogacarabhumi Sastra with the Dharma teacher Silabhadra As regards various nonBuddhist books such as the Four Vedas astronomy geography medicine and the art of divina tion he thoroughly mastered all their fundamental sources as well as the subjects that branched from them Since his learning included both Buddhist and nonBuddhist lore and his virtue was esteemed by the people of the time King Pumavarman the lord of Magadha who revered sages and respected scholars was pleased to hear about his reputation He sent a messenger to invite him to be the royal preceptor with a conferment of twenty large villages as his fief But the Sastrin did not accept the invitation After the demise of Pumavarman King Siladitya again asked the Sastrin to be his teacher offering eighty large villages in the country of Udra as his fief and the Sastrin again declined The king invited him insistently time and again but each time the Sastrin was resolute in declining the proffered honor He said to the king I Jayasena have heard that one who accepts the emolument given by a person has to share his responsibilities Now since I am urgently engaged in trying to save myself from the bondage of rebirth how can I have the leisure to attend to the kings affairs Having said so he saluted the king and went away and thus the king could not retain him any more Since then he often stayed at Stickwood Hill training and educating his disciples and he always lectured on Buddhist scrip tures The number of monks and laymen who came to study under him always exceeded several hundred The Master stayed with him for two years to learn the Vijnanamatraparikalpana Sastra the Manasabhidheyata Sastra the Abhayasiddhi Sastra the Asamgamanirvana Sastra the Dvddasahgapratityasamutpada Sastra and the Sutralamkara Sastra He also resolved some dubious points in the Yogacarabhumi Sastra the Hetuvidya Sastra and some other works One night the Master dreamed that the buildings of Nalanda Monastery were in a deserted and filthy condition with some buffaloes tied therein and had no more monks He entered the monastery through the western gate of the Court of King Baladitya and saw a golden figure on the fourth story of the pavilion with a dignified appearance and a brilliant light that illuminated the whole room With a happy mind he wished to go up but there was no way The figure said I am Manjusri Bodhisattva Because of your karmic condition you cannot come up here And then he pointed at the outside of the monastery and said Look there Looking at the place indicated the Master saw that the villages and towns out side the monastery were all burned to ashes The golden figure said You may return home soon Ten years from now King Siladitya of this place will pass away and India will fall into a state of great turmoil Then evil people may do you harm When the Master awoke from the dream he felt it very strange and told it to Jayasena who said As the Three Worlds are devoid o f security such things might well happen Since you have been told so it is up to you to make your own decision From this we may know that wherever the Master went he was always protected by the Bodhisattva When he was about to start his journey to India Silabhadra was exhorted to wait for his arrival When he lingered too long he was reminded of the prin ciple of transitoriness o f life and was advised to return home If what he was doing was inconsistent with the Holy Mind who else could have aroused such spiritual aid By the end o f the Yonghui period Siladitya actually died and India fell into a condi tion of great turmoil just as had been foretold The Chinese envoy Wang Xuance witnessed all the events It was at the beginning of the first month of our calendar when it was the custom of the western country to display during this month the Buddhas relic bones preserved in the Bodhi Temple All the monks and lay people of different countries came to see and worship the holy relics The large ones were the size of pearls with a reddish white hue and the flesh relics as large as peas had a glossy red color When innumerable devotees had offered incense and flowers and worshipped them with praise the relics were put back in the stupa Just after the first watch in the night Jayasena discussed with the Master the different sizes of the relic bones and said I your disciple have seen at other places that the relics were as big as grains of rice Why are the ones we have seen here so big Dont you teacher have any doubt about it The Master said in reply I also have the same doubt about it A moment later the lamp in the room suddenly became dim but it was very bright inside and outside the house Being amazed they went out to see and saw that the relic stupa was issuing a brilliant light the rays of which flew high up to the sky It was a multicolored light shining so brightly upon the sky and the earth that the moon and stars were overshadowed They also smelt an unusual fragrance that pervaded the courtyard Thus the people told one another that the relics were showing a great miracle Upon hearing this the multitude reassembled to worship the relics and praised it as a rare occurrence After about the time required for taking a meal the light gradually diminished When it was about to disappear it encircled the bowl that covered the relics several times and finally entered it Then the sky and earth became dark again and the stars reappeared Having witnessed this sight the people were freed from the net of doubt After having worshipped the Bodhi tree and other holy sites for eight days the Master returned to Nalanda Monastery The Sastrin Silabhadra asked the Master to lecture on the Mahayanasamparigraha Sastra and the Vijhanamdtraparikalpana Sastra for the monks At that time the learned teacher Simhaprabha had already expounded the Madhyamika Sastra and the Sata Sastra for the four groups of Buddhist followers on a previous occasion in refutation of the theories of the Yogacarabhumi Sastra Being learned in the Madhyamika Sastra and the Sata Sastra as well as proficient in the Yogacarabhumi Sastra the Master con sidered that the saints founded each of their theories for a particu lar purpose without obstruction or contradiction between them and that deluded ones who could not understand them thoroughly thought them to be contradictory It was but the fault of the transmitters and had nothing to do with the Dharma Out of pity for his narrowmindedness the Master went to interrogate the lecturer several times but the man could not give adequate replies Thus his disciples gradually dispersed and came to study under the Master Considering that the purpose of the Madhyamika Sastra and the Sata Sastra was mainly to refute of the view that grasped the false to be true the Master did not mention that things depend upon conditions for their arising nor did he mention the idea of seeing things in their perfect true nature and so Simhaprabha could not well understand the truth As he saw that the Yogacarabhumi Sastra asserted that all things are void and that nothing can be obtained from them he held the opinion that the view of seeing things in their perfect true nature etc as advocated in the sastra should also be discarded In order to harmonize the teachings of the two schools without incongruity the Master wrote the Nikayasamgraha Sastra in three thousand stanzas When the treatise was completed he presented it to Sllabhadra and all the monks who praised it as a good work and propagated it as well as put it into practice Feeling ashamed of himself Simhaprabha went away to the Bodhi Temple where he asked his schoolmate one Candrasimha o f eastern India to come and start a debate with the Master in order to erase his humiliation But when that person came he was awed into silence in the presence of the Master and dared not speak a word Thus the Masters reputation became still greater Before Simhaprabha went away Ring Siladitya had constructed a bronze temple over a hundred feet high beside Nalanda Monas tery It was well known in various countries Afterward the king went personally to conquer Kohgoda and crossed the country of Udra where all the monks were Hinayana adherents and did not believe in Mahayana teachings saying that they were the views of the Sunyapuspa heretics and were not taught by the Buddha When they saw the king they sneered at him saying We have heard that Your Majesty has constructed a bronze temple beside Nalanda Monastery It is indeed a magnificent work of great merit but why did you build it there and not near some heretical temple of the Kapalikas The king said What do you mean by saying so The monks said in reply Because the friars of Nalanda Monastery being Sunyapuspa heretics they are not different from the Kapalikas There was formerly an old Brahmin teacher by the name of Prajnagupta who had consecrated the king of southern India by sprinkling water on his head and was learned in the theories of the Sammitlya school Could there be any Mahayana follower who could refute a single word of it The king said I your disciple have heard that some wild foxes and small mice claimed to be more powerful than a lion but when they actually saw a lion they were scared out of their wits Because you teachers have never seen Mahayana teachers of great virtue you persist in your erroneous views Once you see them I am afraid you will be just the same as the foxes and mice They said If Your Majesty is in doubt about it why do you not hold a meeting to decide the right and wrong The king said There is no difficulty in doing that And on the following day he wrote a letter and dispatched a messenger to send it to the Venerable Sllabhadra the Right Dharma Store of Nalanda Monastery Knowing that the virtuous monks of the monastery possess both talent and wisdom in abundance and understand what ever they have learned I your disciple took the liberty of granting them their request I am ordering my messenger to submit this report to you and I would like you to dispatch four virtuous monks well versed in both Mahayana and Hinayana teachings as well as knowing both the inner and the outer learning to come to my temporary residence in the country of Udra Upon receiving this letter the Right Dharma Store assembled the monks to select the proper persons and he appointed Sagaramati Jnanaprabha Simhaprabha and the Master as the four persons in compliance with the kings order Sagaramati and the other two monks were worried but the Master said to them I have studied the Tripitaka of the various Hinayana schools and completely mastered their theories while I was in my own country and during my stay in Kasmlra It is impossible for them to refute the Maha yana teachings with their own theories Although my learning is shallow and my intellect weak I have the confidence to deal with the matter I hope you teachers will not worry about it In case I am defeated in the debate I am a monk from China and you will not be involved in the matter The other monks were pleased to hear it But later King Siladitya sent another letter in which he said that the monks he had invited in his previous letter need not start the journey immediately but should wait for further notification as to whether they should go or not At that time a heretic of the Lokayatika school came to seek a debate and wrote his argument in fourteen points which he hung on the door of the monastery while he announced If anybody is able to refute any one point of my argument I shall cut off my head to apologize After the passage of several days nobody came out to accept the challenge The Master then asked his personal servant to take down the poster destroy it and trample the broken pieces under his feet Being greatly enraged the Brahman asked Who are you The servant said in reply I am a servant o f the Mahayanadeva The Brahman who had already heard of the fame of the Master was ashamed of himself and did not say anything more The Master sent for him and brought him to the presence of the Venerable Sllabhadra with various virtuous monks as witnesses to start a debate with him about the principles of his school and the theories founded by other heretical sects as well The Master said Such heretics as the Bhutas the Nirgranthas the Kapalikas and the Jutakas are clad in four different ways with different appearances while the theories established by the Samkhyas and the Vaisesikas formerly known as Weishishi are different from each other The Bhutas smear their bodies with ash as a means of spiritual cultivation rendering themselves as pale in color as a dusty cat that has slept on a kitchen range The Nirgranthas make themselves look strange by practising nudism and they pluck their hair as a deed of virtue With broken skin and chapped feet they resemble rotten trees beside a river The Kapalikas make chaplets of skulls to adorn their heads or hang them on their necks and the sunken and driedup sockets in a crooked form make them appear just like yaksas in a cemetery And the Jutakas wear dirty clothes drink urine and eat filth with a stinking and foul smell like a mad pig wallowing in a latrine Are you not stupid to regard these practices as the Way As regards the Samkhya heretics they hold the theory of twentyfive True Entities  viz from Selfnature comes the Great Source of Intellect  which gives rise to Selfconsciousness  and this again causes the Five Subtle Elements  the Five Gross Elements  and the Eleven Organs  Meanwhile the Vaisesikas hold the theory of the Six Categories of Cognition  viz substance  quality  action karma generality  particularity  and correlation  which are possessed by the Spirit When the Spirit is not emancipated it has always been using the abovementioned Six Categories and when it is liberated having sepa rated itself from the Six Categories it is the same as the state of nirvana Among the twentyfive entities as you hold the entity of purusa is of a particular nature while the other twentyfour entities are interrelated into one substance and the entity of Selfnature is composed of the three qualities viz sattva  rajas foul ness and tamas  These three qualities also extend and constitute the other twentythree entities of mahat etc each of these twentythree entities having the three qualities as its sub stance Now if mahat and the rest are all constituted by the three qualities they should then be the same as an assembly or a forest which are merely unsubstantial false conceptions How can you say that they are True Entities Again if mahat and the rest are all composed of the three qualities then one of them should be the same as the others And if one is the same as the others then any one of them should have the same functions as all the others But since this is not the case why should you hold the view that the three qualities are the substantial nature of all the entities Again if one entity is just the same as the other entities then the organs of mouth and eye etc should have the same function as the excretory organs And if each organ has the func tions of all the other organs then the organ of the mouth ought to smell odors and the ear see colors If it is not so how can you hold the view that the three qualities are the substance of all things How could a wise man have formulated such theories Moreover if Selfnature is unchangeable it should be like the substance of purusa How can it be transformed into mahat and the other things Again if the purusa as you conceive it is unchangeable by nature then it ought to be the same as Selfnature and should not be the purusa And if it is the same as Selfnature then its substance is not that of the purusa and ought not to enjoy the other twentyfour entities In such a case purusa is not the sub ject that is able to enjoy nor are the twentyfour entities the objects to be enjoyed Then he rose to his feet and said with an apology I am defeated and I am ready to keep my word The Master said We Buddhists do not take any mans life I now make you my slave and you should work according to my orders The Brahman was glad to obey the Masters orders with reverence and was brought to his living quarters At that time when the Master intended to go to Udra he obtained a treatise in seven hundred stanzas composed by the Hinayanists in refutation of Mahayana teachings He asked the Brahman whom he had subdued in debate Have you attended lectures on this treatise The Brahman replied I have attended lectures on it five times When the Master wished him to give an explanation o f the treatise he said As I am your slave how can I explain anything to Your Reverence The Master said As this is a work of another school I have not seen it before There is no harm in you giving me an explanation of it The Brahman said If so please wait until midnight lest people hear that you are studying the Dharma with a slave and defile your good name Thus in the night the Master sent away all other people and asked the Brahman to expound the treatise He found out the erroneous points and refuted them with Mahayana teach ings in a treatise he wrote in sixteen hundred stanzas entitled the Aghadarsanabheda Sastra He presented the work to the Vener able Silabhadra and showed it to his disciples who all praised it with appreciation and said With such allcomprehensive scrutiny there is no opponent he could not vanquish The treatise is to be found elsewhere Then the Master said to the Brahman You have been my slave since you were defeated in the debate Now I set you free and you are at liberty to go anywhere you wish Being delighted the Brahman took his leave and went to the country of Kamarupa in eastern India where he informed King Kumara about the Masters virtue and righteous ness The king was pleased to hear it and immediately sent an envoy to invite the Master Beginning with the Prediction of a Nirgrantha about His Homeward Journey and Ending with His Arrival at the Western Canal in the Imperial Capital Before the arrival of the envoy sent by King Kumara a naked Nirgrantha named Vajra unexpectedly came to the Masters room Hearing that the Nirgrantha was good at divining the Master invited him to take a seat and asked him to resolve his doubts saying I am a Chinese monk and have come here to study for quite a number of years Now I intend to return home but I am not sure whether I shall be able to reach my home or not As regards my going back or staying here which is more auspicious for me And how long shall I live He told the Master It is good for you to stay as you will enjoy the respect of the monks and lay people of the Five Indias If you go back you will be able to reach home and will also enjoy respect but it will not be as good as staying here As regards the length of your life you will live for another ten years from now If you perform more meritorious deeds your life may be prolonged but that is beyond my knowl edge The Master then said that though he desired to go back he did not know how he could carry back a large amount of scriptures and images The Nirgrantha said Do not worry King Siladitya and King Kumara will dispatch men to escort you on the way You will surely get back without trouble The Master said in reply I have never seen these two kings How would they grant me such favors The Nirgrantha said King Kumara has already sent a messenger to invite you and he will be here in two or three days The Master then made preparations for his return journey and packed up his scriptures and images When the monks heard about it they all came to persuade him to stay saying India being the birthplace of the Buddha the traces and tracks left by him are still here though the Great Saint has passed away To wander around worshipping them with praises would be a great pleas ure in anyones life Why do you wish to leave after having come here What is there for you to be nostalgic about The Master said in reply The King of the Dharma has founded his teachings and it is proper for us to propagate them Moreover that country is highly civilized and the people have a code of conduct to observe The Emperor is sagacious and his ministers are loyal The father treats his son with benignity and the son is filial to his father Kindness and righteousness are esteemed and the aged and virtuous respected The people are moreover able to discern what is subtle and profound and their wisdom coincides with that of the gods They behave according to the law of nature and the Seven Planets cannot overshadow their culture They invented the device for the division of time and made the flute to produce the six masculine notes of music Thus they have the capability to enslave birds and beasts inspire the spirits and deities adapt themselves to positive and negative circum stances and benefit as well as pacify all things between Heaven and earth Since the Buddhas bequeathed Dharma was spread to the East they have laid importance on Mahayana teachings prac tised meditation in a tranquil state like a pond of clear water and observed the Vinaya rules as a pervading influence like that of fragrant incense They put their hands palm to palm for mental cultivation with the realization of the Three Bodies of a Buddha as their ultimate goal Great saints who heard the wonderful teach ings with their own ears and saw golden figures with their own eyes have always shown the spirituality to edify the people per sonally with the Dharma How can you despise that land simply because the Buddha was not born there But the monks said It is said in the scriptures that according to different meritorious deeds heavenly beings have different kinds of food though they eat together We are however living together in Jambudvipa but the Buddha was bom here in this country and did not go there to your land because it is a vicious borderland As that land is devoid of felicities we advise you not to go back The Master said in reply Once Vimalakirti remarked Why does the sun go across Jambudvipa The answer is to dispel darkness It is because I wish to follow the suggestion of this metaphor that I intend to return home When the monks saw that the Master would not listen to them they asked him to go with them to the Venerable Silabhadra to state his wishes Silabhadra asked the Master What is your final decision The Master said in reply This being the country where the Buddha was bom I certainly do not dislike it But my intention in coming here was to acquire the Great Dharma in order to benefit all living beings Since my arrival at this place I have had the honor to attend your lectures on the Yogacarabhumi Sastra whereby my net of doubts has been resolved I have wor shipped the holy sites and studied the very profound teachings of various schools I am glad in my heart that my journey has not been fruitless I wish to return home to translate into Chinese the texts I have learned here so that those who have the good oppor tunity may also learn them as I did In this way I may repay the kindness of my teachers That is why I have no leisure to linger here any longer Silabhadra was pleased to hear this and said This is the wish o f a Bodhisattva and it is also what I expected of you Let him pack up his luggage you people need not try to detain him any more After having said so he returned to his chamber Two days later the envoy sent by King Kumara of East India arrived with a letter for the Venerable Silabhadra in which the king said Your disciple wishes to see the virtuous monk from China May the teacher kindly send him here so as to satisfy my wish After receiving this letter Silabhadra told all the monks King Kumara desires to invite Xuanzang to his country but he has already been appointed by the assembly of the monks to proceed to the place of King Siladitya to hold a debate with the Hinayana adherents If he goes now what shall we do when King Siladitya needs him It is inappropriate for us to let him go So he said to the envoy As the Chinese monk wishes to return to his own country he has no time to comply with the kings order to visit him When the envoy had returned home the king sent him to come again with a message of invitation saying I hope you will condescend to do me the favor and will not act contrary to my request As Silabhadra did not send the Master the king became greatly enraged and dispatched another envoy to send him a letter in which the king said Your disciple being an ordinary person is addicted to worldly pleasures and does not know how to turn his mind toward the Buddha Dharma Now I am truly delighted to have heard the name of the foreign monk and it seems that the sprout of faith has burst in me But the teacher does not allow him to come wishing to keep all living beings enshrouded in eternal darkness Is this the way for a vir tuous monk to glorify the bequeathed Dharma to lead the people As I am longing to meet him with a mind of respect I am sending this second letter to you with sincerity If he is not coming then I am bound to be a wicked person Recently King Sasarika had the power to defame the Dharma and destroy the Bodhi tree I will certainly array my troop of elephants and concentrate them to trample on and break Nalanda Monastery to dust Upon receiving this letter Silabhadra said to the Master Usually that kings good mind is shallow and the Buddha Dharma is not very popular in his domain It seems that he has fostered a deep mind for spiritual achievements since he heard your name You may have been a good friend of his in a previous life You had better try to go as our aim in becoming monks is to benefit others and this is now the right time to do so It is like felling a tree When the root is cut off the long branches will become dried up by them selves If you go there and arouse the kings mind of spirituality his people will follow his example If you refuse to accept his invitation something devilish might happen Do not hesitate to take this small trouble After taking leave of the teacher the Master went away with the envoy Upon his arrival in that country the king was very much pleased Leading his ministers he welcomed the Master with salutation and praise and invited him to his palace Every day the king entertained him with music and offered him food drink flowers incense and all kinds of offerings He also asked to observe the Precepts In this manner the Master stayed there for more than a month When King Siladitya returned from his campaign in Konyodha he heard that the Master was at Kumaras place and said with amazement I have repeatedly invited him but he did not come Why is he now in that country He dispatched an envoy to tell King Kumara Send the Chinese monk to me immediately As King Kumara respected the Master and had such great adoration for him he was unwilling to part with him and said to the envoy You may have my head but the Master cannot go right now The envoy returned and reported this to King Siladitya who was greatly enraged and said to his attending ministers King Kumara despises me Why should he speak such rough language just because of a monk Then he sent another envoy to reproach him saying Since you said that I could have your head now hand your head to my envoy so he can bring it back to me Deeply fearing that he had made an indiscreet remark Kumara at once ordered the arraying o f twenty thousand elephant troops and the preparation of thirty thousand boats and then sailed together with the Master along the Ganges to the place of the king  Before he started the voyage King Kumara had ordered his men to prepare a temporary palace north of the Ganges After having lodged the Master properly on the day he arrived at his temporary palace he and his ministers went to see King Siladitya south of the river Knowing that Kumara respected and adored the Master he did not blame him for what he had said before but simply asked W here is the Chinese monk He is at my temporary palace was the reply The king asked Why does he not come Since Your Majesty reveres the sages and takes an interest in the Way it is inappro priate to send for him to come and see Your Majesty replied Kumara The king said Very well You may go now and I shall come tomorrow Kumara returned and said to the Master Although the king said that he would come tomorrow I am afraid he might come tonight We should wait and see In case he comes you need not move yourself The Master said I shall certainly behave myself in accordance with Buddhist manners At about the first watch of the night the king actually came Someone reported Several thousand torches and candles are burning on the river and the noise of the pacing drums is heard The king said This must be King Slladitya coming Then he ordered that candles be lit and went personally with his ministers for a great distance to bid welcome Whenever King Slladitya went out he always had several hundred metal drums beaten once for every step he walked This was known as beating the rhythmic pacing drums King Slladitya alone had this privilege no other king enjoyed the same honor Upon his arrival he worshipped at the Masters feet scattered flowers and looked at him with reverence After having eulogized the Master with many poetic expressions he said to him Why did you not come when I previously invited you The Master replied I came from afar to seek the Buddha Dharma and to learn the Yogacarabhumi Sastra When I received your order I was just in the midst of attending lectures on the sastra and that was why I could not come to have an audience with Your Majesty The king inquired again You come from China I have heard that in your country you have a dancing melody known as The Triumph of the Prince of Qin But I do not know who this person the Prince of Qin is or what meritorious deeds he has done to earn such praises The Master said in reply When the people of my country see anybody possessing the virtues of saints and sages and capable of wiping out the ferocious and brutal for the protection and advan tage of the masses they sing his praises as part of the music performed in ancestral temples above and as folk songs sung by the common people below The Prince of Qin is now the reigning Emperor of China before he ascended the Throne he had been made the Prince of Qin At that time the country was in a condition of disorder without a lord to rule over the people Human corpses piled up in the wilderness and human blood flowed in the rivers and valleys Evil stars gathered together at night and ominous vapors condensed in the morning The regions of the Three Rivers suffered from the avarice of those who were as greedy as giant pigs and the Four Seas were troubled as if by the poison of huge snakes Being a son of the former Emperor the Prince in compliance with the good order o f Heaven summoned up all the courage and energy of his army to suppress the rebels who were as un righteous as whales swallowing small fishes holding his battleax and brandishing his spear he pacified the land as far as the sea Thus he restored tranquillity in the land and made the Three Luminaries shine brightly again As the people in the whole coun try were grateful to him they composed that music to sing his praises b The king said Such a person is really sent by Heaven to be a lord of men And he also said to the Master I am going back now and I shall welcome you tomorrow The following morning the kings envoy came and the Master went in company with Kumara When they arrived at the side of the palace of King Slladitya the king and more than twenty o f bis personal teachers came out to greet the Master and invited him to take a seat in the palace Different kinds of delicious food were spread on the table and after having made offerings to him with the performance of music and the scattering of flowers the king said I have heard that you have composed the Aghadarsanabheda Sastra Where is it The Master replied Here it is And then he presented the work to the king who was delighted after having read it through and said to his personal teachers I have heard that when the sun is shining the glimmering of a firefly and the light of a candle are dimmed Now all the theories advocated by you teachers have been refuted by him Would you try to offer a counter reply All the monks dared not speak a word The king said Your teacher Devasena claims to be the most learned among all scholars and is well versed in various systems of philosophy He originated variant views and always defamed Mahayana teachings But when he heard that this guest monk of great virtue was coming he went away to Vaisali to worship the holy sites as an excuse to avoid meeting the guest From this I sensed your incapability The king had a younger sister who was clever and intelligent and was well versed in the theories of the Sammitiya school She was sitting behind the king When she heard the Master explain ing the profundity of Mahayana teachings and pointing out the shallowness of Hinayana doctrines she was so glad and happy that she could not refrain from praising the Master The king said The teachers treatise is most excellent and I your disciple as well as all the other teachers here are convinced of it But as I fear that the Hinayana adherents and heretics of other countries may still stick to their ignorance and delusion I wish to convene an assembly on your behalf at the city of Kanyakubja and ask all the sramanas Brahmans and other heretics of the Five Indias to take part in the gathering so that you may show them the subtle principles of the Mahayana doctrines and stop their minds of calumniation as well as manifest your high virtue and smash their sense of arrogance On that day the king issued an edict to different countries inviting the theoreticians to assemble at the city of Kanyakubja to read the treatise composed by the Master from China At the beginning of the eleventh month the Master sailed together with the king up the Ganges They reached the venue of the assembly in the twelfth month Among those who were present at the gathering were eighteen kings from the Five Indias more than three thousand monks well versed in both Mahayana and Hinayana teachings and more than two thousand Brahmans Nirgranthas and other heretics as well as more than a thousand monks from Nalanda Monastery All these wise people well under stood the meanings of literature and were highly talented in argumentation As they wished to listen to the voice of the Dharma they came to attend the meeting They had attendants and came either by elephant or by carriage Each of them was surrounded by pennants or streamers in a grand and lofty manner like rising clouds and mist emerging in an area of several tens of square li It was said that the region of the Six Princes of Qi was so thickly inhabited that when the people raised their sleeves they might form curtains and that in the area of the Three Wus when the people wiped their sweat it would rain like a shower But even such big crowds were still inadequate to compare with this grand assembly The king had beforehand ordered that two thatched halls be built at the place of the gathering in which to install the Buddhas image and to accommodate the monks When he arrived there both halls had been completed they were high and broad and each was capable of seating more than a thousand persons The kings temporary palace was located five li west of the venue of the meeting Every day an image was cast in gold in the palace and a big elephant was caparisoned and carried a precious enclosure wherein the Buddhas image was placed Ring Siladitya dressed himself as Indra holding a white chowry in his hand and attending at the right side while King Kumara attired as Brahma held a precious canopy and attended at the left side Both of them wore celestial crowns and garlands and were adorned with pearl necklaces and jade pendants Two more caparisoned elephants carried precious flowers and followed behind the Buddhas image flowers were scattered as the elephants proceeded along the way The Master and the kings personal teachers were asked to ride on different elephants that followed behind the king in the procession Three hundred more elephants were arranged for the kings of different countries the ministers and the monks of great virtue to ride on they walked by the side of the road one after another like a shoal of fish swimming in an orderly line while praises were chanted as they proceeded along Starting in the morning people dressed themselves and set out from the temporary palace to the meeting place Upon arriving at the gate of the courtyard were asked to alight from the elephants Then they carried the Buddha image to the hall and placed it on a precious pedestal The king and the Master together with some others made offerings to the image in proper order and then the eighteen kings were ushered in Next came in more than a thousand of the most reputable and widely learned monks from various countries After them came in more than five hundred Brahmans heretics and wellknown ascetics followed by over two hundred ministers of different countries It was arranged that the other monks and lay people stay outside the courtyard in an orderly way The king ordered that food be served to all within and without the courtyard When the meal was over one golden tray seven golden bowls one golden bathing jug one golden staff three thousand golden coins and three thousand robes made of the best felt were offered to the Buddha while the Master and the other monks also received different gifts When the almsgiving was completed a separate precious seat was prepared The Master was invited to take the chair in the assembly to extol Mahayana teachings and to explain his intent of composing the treatise The Venerable Vidyabhadra a sramana of Nalanda Monastery was asked to read it to the congregation while a written copy was hung outside the gate of the meeting place for everybody to read If one word was found illogical or refutable in the treatise the writer would cut off his head in apology But until nightfall nobody raised a word of objection Ring Slladitya was glad of it and after adjourning the meeting he returned to his palace The other kings and monks also returned to their respec tive lodgings Then the Master and King Kumara returned to their own palace On the following morning they came again carrying the Buddha image and entering the assembly hall just as on the previous day After the elapse of five days the Hinayana adherents and the heretics seeing that the Master had crushed their theories felt hatred and intended to murder him The king got wind of it and issued an order saying Since a long time ago the heterodox schools have always tried to corrupt the truth in order to bury the right teachings in oblivion and to delude and lead the people astray If there were no man of superior wisdom who could discern what is untrue The Chinese Master is a man of profound and broad mind whose knowledge and practice are very deep He came to tour this country in order to reveal and propagate the Great Pharma and to lead the ignorant to enlightenment Some evil and presumptuous people who are not ashamed of themselves are trying to hatch a sinister plot against him with a mischievous intention If this is tolerable what else is unforgivable Anybody in the assembly daring to injure the Master will be beheaded and anyone who insults or abuses him will have his tongue cut out But no limit is set on the argumentation of those who wish to make a state ment in defence o f their own doctrines After that the evil people withdrew from their malignant attempt and for eighteen days nobody started a debate In the evening when the congregation was about to disperse the Master once more extolled Mahayana teachings eulogized the merits of the Buddha and caused numerous people to return from the wrong to the right and to discard Hinayana theories and embrace Mahayana teachings King Siladitya respected him all the more and offered him as alms ten thousand golden coins thirty thousand silver coins and a hundred robes made of highquality felt Each of the eighteen kings also offered him rare and precious things But the Master did not accept any of the gifts The king ordered his attending ministers to caparison a large elephant with a canopy on it for the Master to ride He also asked his noble ministers to accompany and safeguard him when passing through crowds of people and announcing that the Master had established his theories unchallenged It was the custom of the western countries that the winner in debate be honored in this way The Master declined to accept the honor and would not go but the king said Such has been done since ancient times and we must not do things against it Then the Masters robe was taken to the people with the announcement The venerable teacher from China has established the Maha yana teachings and refuted various heterodox views During the last eighteen days nobody dared to hold a debate with him It befits you all to know this fact All the people were delighted and they vied with one another in giving him honorary titles The Mahayana believers called him Mahayanadeva meaning Divine Being of the Mahayana while the Hinayana adherents named him Moksadeva meaning Divine Being of Emancipation They burned incense scattered flowers and paid homage to him before they dispersed After that the Masters reputation for virtue reached still farther To the west of the kings temporary palace there was a monas tery supported by the king In it was a Buddhas tooth relic about one and one half inches long with a yellowish white color It often issued a bright light Once in olden times the Krita caste in the country of Kasmira destroyed the Buddha Dharma and the monks dispersed One bhiksu travelled far away to India Afterward the king of Himatala in the country of Tukhara felt indignant that the king of a slavish caste should have destroyed the Buddha Dharma So he disguised himself as a merchant bringing with him three thousand warriors and a large amount of rare and valuable things which he pre tended to offer  That king being an avaricious man was pleased to hear about this and he sent an envoy to welcome the guests But the king of Himatala was a person of a heroic and brave nature as dignified and austere as a deity When he approached the Throne he removed his hat and reprimanded the king of the Kritas who was struck with awe at the sight of the king in disguise and fell to the ground Then the king of Himatala strangled his neck and killed him He said to the ministers I am the king of Himatala Because you slaves have destroyed the Buddha Dharma I have come to punish you Only those who instigated their king to commit such an atrocity will be banished to other countries while the rest of you will not be questioned After having suppressed the wicked evildoers he founded a monastery summoned back the monks to whom he made offerings and then returned to his own country On hearing that peace had been restored in his country the bhiksu who had previously fled to India took up his mendicant staff and returned home On the way he met with a herd of elephants that came trumpeting toward him When he saw the animals he climbed up a tree to hide himself One of the elephants put the bhiksu on its back with its trunk and carried him to a big forest where a sick elephant suffering from a wound was lying on the ground The elephant placed the bhiksus hand on its painful sore and he saw a bamboo splinter in the wound So he plucked the splinter out squeezed the pus and blood and tore a piece of his robe to dress the wound Thus the elephant was gradually cured On the following day the elephants busied themselves in gathering fruits to offer to the bhiksu When he had taken the fruits one elephant brought a golden casket and gave it to the sick one who in turn handed it to the bhiksu When the bhiksu had received the casket the elephants carried him out of the forest to the place where they had found him They placed him on the ground and knelt down to worship him before they went away The bhiksu opened the casket and found in it a Buddhas tooth relic which he brought back to worship Recently King Slladitya heard that there was a Buddhas tooth relic in Kasmlra and he went personally to the borderland to see and worship it But the monks were so illiberal that they would not allow it to be taken out and concealed it at some other place Their king however feared the power and influence of Slladitya and so dug in the ground everywhere to search for the holy relic When he had found it he presented it to Slladitya who had deep respect for it when he saw it Depending upon his mighty power he snatched the tooth relic and took it home and made offerings to it This was the tooth relic just mentioned above After the assembly was dissolved the king put the golden image he had made together with the robes and money in that monastery in the custody of the monks As the Master had already taken his leave of the virtuous monks of Nalanda and obtained scriptures and images he desired to take leave of the king and return home on the nineteenth day when the assembly was over The king said It has been more than thirty years since I your disciple succeeded to the Throne of the lord of the state I always worried that my felicity and vir tue were not on the increase and that my good causes of the past might not continue Therefore I accumulated wealth and valu ables and founded a great meeting place between the two rivers in the country of Prayaga where every five years I invited the sramanas the Brahmans and the poor and desolate people of the Five Indias to attend an unlimited gathering to receive alms for seventyfive days I have convened such gatherings five times and I am now going to hold the sixth one Would you not like to see the gathering and share the happiness of the people The Master said in reply In the course of practising the Way a Bodhisattva cultivates both worldly welfare and spiritual wis dom When a wise man has obtained the fruit he will not forget the tree If Your Majesty is not parsimonious in giving valuables and wealth to others why should I refuse to stay a little longer Please allow me to go with Your Majesty The king was greatly delighted On the twentyfirst day they started for the site of the grand almsgiving in the country of Prayaga with the Ganges in the north and the Jumna in the south both flowing from the northwest to the east and joining in this country To the west of the confluence of the two rivers there was a great tableland about fourteen or fifteen li in circumference and as flat as a mirror Since olden times all the kings came to this place to give alms hence it was called the Site of Almsgiving It was said by tradition that the merit of giving one coin here was greater than that of giving a hundred or a thousand coins at other places Thus it had been held in esteem since ancient times The king issued a decree that a site of alms giving be built at the tableland surrounded by a fence o f reeds one thousand paces long on each side Several tens of thatched halls were built inside the fence to store various precious things such as gold silver pearls red crystals precious emeralds and sapphires Beside the halls were several hundred storerooms to keep silk robes and robes made of spotted felt as well as gold and silver coins etc Kitchens were built separately outside the fence In front of the treasure storerooms were built more than a hundred rows o f long houses resembling the streets in the markets of our capital each of them capable of accommodating over a thousand men Before the congregation the king had issued an edict inviting the monks the heretics the Nirgranthas and the poor and deso late people of the Five Indias to assemble at the site of almsgiving to receive gifts Some of those who had attended the meeting of the Master held in the city o f Kanyakubja did not go back home but went directly to the place of almsgiving The eighteen kings also followed the king to that place When they reached the site of the meeting more than five hundred thousand monks and lay people had already arrived there King Slladitya encamped on the northern bank of the Ganges King Dhruvabhata of South India encamped west of the confluence King Kumara encamped beside a flowery wood south of the Jumna and all the almsmen encamped west of King Dhruvabhatas lodgment On the following morning King Slladitya and King Kumara sailed on board warships while King Dhruvabhata went with his elephant troops in an orderly and wellguarded array to assemble at the place of meeting The eighteen kings and those below them in rank accompanied them in an orderly manner On the first day the Buddhas image was installed in the thatched hall at the site of almsgiving and the best valuables and robes as well as delicious food were offered to it Music was performed and flowers scattered until nightfall when the devotees returned to their encampments On the second day the image of the God of the Sun was installed and half the amount of valuables and garments offered on the first day was presented to this image On the third day the image of Isvaradeva was installed and the offerings presented to it were the same as those offered to the God of the Sun On the fourth day alms were given to more than ten thousand monks seated in a hundred rows to each o f whom were given one hundred golden coins one pearl and one felt robe After food drink incense and flowers had been offered to them they left the place The fifth group of alms receivers were the Brahmans and it took more than twenty days to distribute gifts to them all The sixth group of alms receivers were the heretics and it took ten days to give alms to every one of them The seventh group of alms receivers were people coming from afar to seek alms and it took ten days to present gifts to all of them The eighth group of alms receivers were poor and desolate people and the distribution of gifts to them all took one month Then the king exhausted all that he had accumulated in his treasure house during the past five years except his elephants horses and weapons which he kept for the suppression o f rebel lions and the defence of the state All other valuables including his own garments gems earrings bracelets precious headdress neck laces and the lustrous pearl in his topknot were given away as alms without sparing a single one When everyth in g had been given out he asked his younger sister to give h im a coarse suit to wear and worshipped the Buddhas of the ten quarters with great delight He joined his palms and said Since I accumulated these valuables I always feared that I could not store them in a strong treasure house Now I have stored them in the Field of Blessedness and they are really well stored I hope I can always possess wealth and the Dharma to give them as alms to all living beings in all my future lives so that I may achieve the Ten Capabilities and realize the Two Adornments After the conclusion of the meeting the various kings gave their valuables and money to the people to redeem the necklace of gems the topknot pearl the royal garments etc which King Slladitya had given away as alms and returned them to the king as gifts to him In a few days the king wore his royal garments and bis best jewels as usual Then the Master desired to take his leave and return home but the king said I your disciple am only intending to spread the bequeathed Dharma together with Your Reverence King Kumara was also solicitous to detain him and said to the Master If the teacher can come to stay in my country and live on my offerings I will build one hundred monasteries for you Upon seeing that the kings were so earnest in their intention the Master appealed to them sincerely saying China is a country far away from here and the Buddha Dharma became known there at a very late time It is owing to the sincerity of the sages of my homeland who are eager to study the Dharma that I have been able to realize my wishes Therefore I can never forget them even for a moment It is said in a scripture Those who impede others from studying the Dharma will be bom without eyes for many lives in the future If you keep me here you would deprive many monks of the advantage of le a rn in g the Dharma in that land Wouldnt you fear the retribution of being bom without eyes The king said As I admire and respect your virtues I wish I could always support you Since it would spoil benefits to many people I am really afraid of doing so But I do not know which route you will take for your homeward journey If you go by way of the South Sea I shall send an envoy to escort you The Master said in reply When I came from China I reached the western border of my country where there is a country by the name of Gaochang the king of which is an intelligent brilliant person who takes delight in the Dharma King Kumara also offered him various valuables but the Master did not accept anything except an aurnika cape made of the finest wool presented by King Kumara to be used in case of rain during the journey Then he took his leave and the kings and monks escorted him for a distance of several tens of li before they turned back At the moment of parting none of them could refrain from sobbing The Master bringing his scriptures images etc with him travelled in company with the army of King Udita of northern India He rode on a horse and proceeded gradually Later King Siladitya sent an elephant three thousand golden coins and ten thousand silver coins to King Udita to cover the Masters travelling expenses Three days after the parting the king together with King Kumara and King Dhruvabhata each bringing several hun dred light cavalrymen came up to say farewell again to the Master so much did they accord him warm hospitality and cordiality Four attendant officials known as mahatara similar to our offi cials without portfolio were dispatched to send the kings letters written on white kapok cloth and sealed with red wax to the various countries through which the Master would pass on his way requesting that the authorities supply him with horses and escort Rim stage by stage until he reached the land of Han Starting from the country of Prayaga and travelling through the wilderness of a big forest toward the southwest for seven days the Master reached the country of Kausambi To the south of the city was the garden presented to the Buddha by the Elder Ghosila After having worshipped the holy site he proceeded again with King Udita to the northwest In more than a month he passed through several countries and revisited the holy site of the Heavenly Ladders Proceeding further northwest for three yojanas he came to the capital city of the country of Vilasana where he stayed for two months and met two schoolmates Simhaprabha and Simhacandra who were then lecturing on the Abhidharmakosa Sdstra the Mahayanasamparigraha Sdstra the Vijnaptimdtratasiddhi Sdstra etc They were very happy to greet him After his arrival the Master also lectured on the Yogaparikalpana Sdstra and theAbhidharmasamuccayavyakhya Sdstra for two months after which he took his leave and continued his return journey Going northwest again for more than a month and passing through several countries the Master reached the country of Jalandhara the capital of the king of North India where he sojourned for another month King Udita then appointed a guide to escort him Going westward for more than twenty days he reached the country of Simhapura There were then more than a hundred monks all northerners who carried scriptures and images and travelled with the Master on their way home After more than twenty days they came to a mountain stream that was infested with bandits Fearing that he might be robbed by them he always sent a monk to precede the others and asked him to tell the bandits in case he should encounter them A monk has come from a distant country to seek the Dharma May you almsgivers protect him and not cherish any ill intention The Master leading the other monks followed behind He actually met with some bandits on several occasions but they did not do him any harm After travelling for more than twenty days he reached the country of Taksasila and revisited the place where King Candraprabha had sacrificed his head a thousand times in his previous lives Fifty yojanas to the northeast of this country was the country o f Kasmfra The king sent an envoy to invite the Master but as he was riding on an elephant and had luggage with him he was unable to go After staying there for seven days he proceeded northwest again for three days and reached the great Sindhu River which was five or six li broad His scriptures and images were loaded in a boat with his companions to sail across the river while the Master waded through the river on his elephant He had appointed a man in the boat to take care of the scriptures and some seeds of different kinds of rare Indian flowers At that time the king of Kapisa who was already in the city of Udakhanda heard that the Master was arriving and went person ally to the riverside to greet him He inquired I heard that you lost your scriptures in the river Did you bring any seeds of Indian flowers and fruits with you Yes I did was the reply The king said That was the cause of the gale that stirred up the waves and almost overturned your boat Since ancient times those who brought flower seeds to cross this river have always had the same trouble Then he returned to the city with the Master who lodged in a monastery for more than fifty days As he had lost some of his scriptures he sent a man to the country of Udyana to copy the Tripitaka of the Kasyaplya school On hearing that the Master was approaching the king of Kasmlra disregarding the long distance also came personally to pay his respects to him and spent one whole day before he returned home The Master travelled with the king of Kapisa toward the northwest for more than a month and reached the domain of the country of Lampaka The king sent his prince to go beforehand to instruct the people and monks in the capital to prepare pennants and streamers to greet the Master outside the city while the king and the Master proceeded slowly When they reached the capital they were greeted by several thousand monks and lay people holding pennants and streamers in a grand and spectacular man ner Upon seeing the Master the people were very happy After worshipping him they surrounded him and proceeded with him while chanting praise In the capital the Master stayed in a Mahayana monastery and the king also convened a great and unlimited almsgiving meeting for seventyfive days From here the Master proceeded again due south for fifteen days and went to the country of Varana to worship the holy sites Again going northwest he went to the country of Avakan and also to the country of Jaguda Again going north for more than five hundred li he reached the country of Vrjisthana Going out east ward from here he reached the domain of the country of Kapisa where the king once more held a great almsgiving meeting for seven days Then the Master took his leave and continued his journey Going northwest for one yojana he reached the city of Grosapam where he parted with the king and proceeded northward The king dispatched a minister commanding more than a hundred men carrying fodder and food supplies to escort the Master across the Snow Mountains After a journey o f seven days they reached the summit of the great mountain which had peaks rising one higher than another and dangerous cliffs of different shapes Some were flat and some steep with irregular features It is difficult to describe in M l the hardships and difficulties of climbing this mountain After that the Master could not ride on a horse and had to walk with a cane in hand Travelling for seven days more he came to a high range below which was a village of about one hundred families The villagers reared goats as large as donkeys He lodged at this village At midnight he resumed his journey with a villager riding on a mountain camel to lead the way That place was full of snow gullies and icecovered streams with out a villager as guide all the travellers feared they might fall into them The following day he crossed this dangerous icy place By then there were only seven monks with some twenty hired men and one elephant ten mules and four horses On the next day he reached the bottom o f the range Going by a winding path he climbed up to another range which looked to be snow clad but when he approached it he saw it was all white rocks This was the highest range and not even clouds and snowflakes could reach its top In the evening of that day he reached the summit of the mountain The cold wind was so strong and piercing that none of his companions could stand erect There was neither grass nor tree on the mountain There were only rocks piled up high into lofty peaks resembling a forest of stalagmites As the mountain was high and the wind strong no bird could fly over it it could only stretch its wings at a distance of several hundred paces away on either the southern or the northern side of the range None of the lofty mountains in Jambudvipa surpassed this one in height The Master descended from the northwestern side of the moun tain for a few li and came to a little piece of flat ground where he encamped for the night and resumed his journey the next morning After five or six days he came down from the mountain and reached the country of Andarab which was the old territory of Tukhara There were three monasteries with several tens of monks who studied the Dharma of the Mahasamghika school There was a stupa erected by King Asoka The Master stayed there for five days and came down the mountain on the northwest side After proceeding for more than four hundred li he reached the country of Khost which was also the old territory of Tukhara Going again northwest from here in a mountainous area for more than three hundred li he reached the country of Ghur which was situated beside the Oxus River and was the eastern boundary of Tukhara The capital city was on the southern bank of the river There the Master had an interview with the grandson of Yehu Khan As he ruled over Tukhara he claimed to be a yehu The Master stayed in his yamen for a month and then the Yehu sent guards to escort the Master on his eastward journey in the company of some merchants Two days later he reached the country of Munjan Beside it were the countries of Arini Rohu Krsma and Parghar all old territories of Tukhara Going again eastward from Munjan through a mountainous region for more than three hundred li he reached the country of Himatala which was also the old territory of Tukhara Here the customs were roughly the same as those of the Turks What was peculiar was that the married woman wore a headdress with a wooden horn more than three feet high It had two branches in front representing her husbands parents with the upper one denoting her fatherinlaw and the lower one her motherinlaw On the death of one parent the corresponding branch was removed When both parents were dead the whole headdress was discarded Going again eastward from here for more than two hundred li the Master reached the country of Badakshan which was also the old territory of Tukhara Because of the cold weather and snow he stopped there for more than a month Going southeast from here through a mountainous region for more than two hundred li he reached the country of Yamgan Again proceeding southeast by a dangerous path for more than three hundred li he reached the country of Kuran Going north east from here over mountains for more than five hundred li he reached the country of Tamasthiti  This country was located between two mountains close by the Oxus River It produced good horses which were small in size but of sturdy build The customs of this country lacked etiquette and righteousness Its people were fierce by nature illlooking in appear ance and different from those in other countries Most of them had blue eyes There were more than ten monasteries In the city of Khamdadh the capital of the country there was a monastery built by a previous king Above the stone image of the Buddha in this monastery was a canopy made of gold and copper and adorned with various gems suspended by itself just over the Buddhas head When anybody worshipped the image by circumambulating it the canopy also rotated with him When the worshipper stopped walk ing around the canopy also stood still Nobody could explain this miraculous phenomenon A detailed account of the establishment of this monastery is to be found elsewhere Going northward from the great mountain in this country the Master reached the country of Sikni After traversing the country o f Tamasthiti he reached the country of SambhI Going eastward from here over mountains for seven hundred li he reached the Pamir Valley which was more than a thousand li from east to west and over a hundred li from south to north being situated between two snowy mountains As it was in the midst of the Pamir Ranges flurries of wind and snow never ceased even in the spring and summer seasons Since it was a place of piercing cold there were scarcely any plants and no crops at all In the middle was a large lake three hundred li from east to west and over fifty li from south to north situated in the center of Jambudvipa The terrain was high and protruding and the lake was so vast that the eye could not reach its limit There were hundreds and thousands of different varieties of aquatic animals which produced a boisterous noise like the din of various craftsmens workshops in the marketplace There were also different kinds of birds as tall as ten feet with eggs as big as urns which were perhaps what the Tajiks called huge ova in olden times A river branched out from the west of the lake flowing westward to the eastern boundary of the country of Tamasthiti where it converged with the Oxus and flowed westward to the sea All the rivers on the right side converged in the same way Another big river branched out from the east of the lake flowing eastward to the western boundary of the country of Kashgar where it converged with the Sita River and flowed eastward to the sea All the rivers on the left side converged in the same way Beyond the mountains to the south of the valley was the country of Balura which abounded in gold and silver The gold was of a fiery color The length of this lake from south to north corresponded to that of the Anavatapta Lake Exiting from this valley in the east climbing over precipices and walking on snowy paths for more than five hundred li the Master reached the country of Kabandha The capital city was built upon a lofty range with the Sita River at its back in the north This river flowed eastward into the Salt Lake and then became a subterranean current coming out again at the Mountain of Accumulated Stones which was the source of the rivers in this country The king was wise and intelligent and had been on the Throne for many years He acknowledged himself to be a descendant of the Cinadevagotra  In the old palace of the king there was a temple of the Sastrin Kumarajiva This venerable teacher was a native of Taksasila Being a man of divine perception and refined manners he recited thirtytwo thousand words daily and wrote as many words in his treatises He was so conversant with the Dharmas that they seemed to be childs play for him and he was such a productive writer that he composed several tens of treatises all very popular works He was the founder of the Sautrantika school At that time Asvaghosa in the east Deva in the south Nagarjuna in the west and Kumarajiva in the north were known as the Four Suns as they could shed light on the delusions of living beings As Kumarajiva had a great reputation the late king went personally to attack his homeland and brought him back in order to make offerings to him More than three hundred li to the southeast of the city the Master went to a great precipitous rock where there were two caves In each of them one arhat entered the Samadhi of the Cessation of Mentality sitting erect and motionless and looking very thin and weak but not collapsing or decaying for more than seven hundred years The Master stayed in this country for more than twenty days Going northeast again for five days he came upon a gang of robbers His merchant fellowtravellers were so frightened that they climbed up the mountain and his elephant was chased and drowned in a river When the robbers had gone away he proceeded again with the merchants gradually descending toward the east Braving the cold climate and travelling through dangerous ways for more than eight hundred li he emerged from the Pamir Ranges and reached the country of Usar Two hundred li to the west of the city was a great mountain with very lofty ridges and peaks on which stood a stupa He heard an old legend that several hundred years before the mountain had once collapsed with the shaking of thunder and in it was found a driedup and tall body of a bhiksu sitting with closed eyes his long beard and hair covered his face and shoulders A woodcutter saw it and reported to the king who came in person to see and worship the bhiksu Upon hearing about this the common people assem bled there from far and near and made offerings of flowers that were piled up in heaps The king inquired Who is this person A bhiksu said in reply This is an arhat monk sitting in the Samadhi o f the Cessation of Mentality He must have been here for many long years so that his hair has grown to such a length The king said How can we wake him up from his meditation The bhiksu replied Once a person is out of meditation his corporeal body that is sustained by material food will be ruined He might thus come out from meditation The king said ExcellentAnd he followed the advice o f the monk sprinkled milk over the arhat and struck a bell The arhat then opened his eyes and looked around saying W ho are you dressed in religious robes They replied W e are bhiksus The arhat asked Where is my teacher Kasyapa Tathagata now They replied He entered nirvana long ago Upon hearing this the arhat felt sorrowful and inquired again Has Sakyamuni Buddha achieved Supreme Enlightenment yet They replied He has already achieved enlightenment After having completed his task of benefiting all living beings he also has entered nirvana On hearing this the arhat lowered his eyes for a long time and holding up his hair in his hands he rose into the air and performed a great miracle which produced fire and cremated his body His ashes dropped to the ground and the king and the people collected them and built a stupa in which to bury them This was the stupa that they built Going north from here for more than five hundred li the Master reached the country of Kashgar which was known in olden times as Sule after the name of its capital but the correct pronun ciation is Srlkritati the name Sule was incorrect Again going southeast from here more than five hundred li he crossed the Sita River climbed over a large mountain and reached the country of Chakuka  In the south of the country there was a great mountain with many caves Most of the Indians who had gained the various stages of sainthood came to live in those caves by supernatural powers and quite a number of them entered nirvana there There were then three arhats still living in the caves Since they were in the Samadhi of the Cessa tion of Mentality their beard and hair grew long gradually so the monks went to shave them from time to time In this country there were many Mahayana scriptures Those that consisted of ten thousand stanzas each amounted to several tens of works Travelling eastward from here for more than eight hundred li the Master reached the country of Kustana meaning Earth Breast that being the correct name used by the people commonly known as the country of Hvamna to the Huns it was known as Odun and to the various Hu tribes as Hotan while the Indians called it Kustana it was incorrect to call it Yutian in olden times Most of the country was sandy land that was good for growing cereals and had plenty of fruits It produced carpets and fine felt and the feltmakers also spun coarse and fine silk The land also had large quantities of white as well as black jade The climate was temperate The people knew rites and righteousness and were fond of learning and music they deported themselves in a meticulous and correct manner quite different from the customs of the other Hu peoples Their system of writing was derived from the Indian language but with slight alterations The Buddha Dharma was esteemed there were a hundred monasteries with more than five thousand monks most of whom studied Mahayana teachings The king was a valorous and intelligent man with a martial spirit and he respected and loved men of virtue He claimed to be a descend ant of the deity Vaisravana His ancestor was a prince of King Asoka in the country of Taksasila who was later exiled to the north of Snow Mountain to be a shepherd In the course of searching for water and grassland he came here and founded his capital But for a long time he did not have a son and so he prayed for one in the temple of the deity Vaisravana A son was born to him from the forehead of the deity and the ground in front of the temple pro duced something with a wonderful taste as sweet and fragrant as milk which was taken to feed the infant After the demise of the king his son succeeded him on the Throne The influence of his virtue spread far and wide and he was so powerful as to have annexed many other countries The reigning king was descendant of his As his ancestor was nourished with milk from the earth the country should correctly be called Kustana meaning the Earth Breast country After entering this country the Master came to the city of Bhagya in which there was an image of the Buddha seated more than seven feet in height wearing a precious crown and with dignified and perfect features It was said by legend that this image was originally in the country of Kasmira and was brought to this city Once an arhat had a novice who was afflicted with measles At the moment of dying he wanted to eat some vinegary rice cakes With his divine sight the teacher saw that there were such cakes in Kustana So he went there secretly with his power of divine feet and begged for some to give to the novice After eating the cakes the novice was happy and wished to be reborn in that country By the power of his will he was reborn after his death in the family of the king When he had succeeded to the Throne he was brave and talented in strategy As he was ambitious and desirous of annexing the territory of other countries he crossed the Snow Mountains to attack the country of his previous life Then the king of Kasmira also selected his generals and drilled his troops to resist the invaders The arhat said to him Do not take the trouble to raise your weapons I shall send him away So he went to the place of the king of Kustana and told him the fault of cherishing a mind of craving and cruelty When the novices robe worn by him in his previous life was shown to him the king gained the wisdom of knowing past events and felt deeply ashamed of himself He renewed his friendship with the king of Kasmira and withdrew his troops but he brought back with his army the Buddhas image which he had worshipped in his former life When the image reached this city it refused to be moved any further Even when the king and his soldiers tried to move it with maximum effort they failed to shift it Thus a temple was constructed over the image and monks were invited to live there The king gave his crown which he loved to adorn the head of the Buddha image The crown was still in existence with many valuable gems on it and those who saw it praised it with admiration The Master sojourned there for seven days When the king of Kustana heard that the Master had arrived in his domain he came in person to welcome and greet him On the day after the following day the Master continued his journey while the king returned to the capital beforehand leaving his son behind to attend to the Master When the Master had proceeded for two days the king dispatched his attending officials to meet him He stopped for the night at a place forty li away from the capital On the following day the king together with monks and lay people received the Master on the left side of the road with music incense and flowers Upon his arrival he was invited into the city and was lodged in a Hinayana Sarvastivada monastery More than ten li to the south of the royal city there was a large monastery constructed by a previous king of this country for the Arhat Vairocana  Formerly when the teachings of the Dharma had not spread to this country the arhat came here from Kasmira and sat in meditation in a wood When someone saw him dressed in a strange manner he reported it to the king who upon hearing it went personally to see and asked him W ho are you staying alone in this wild wood The arhat said I am a disciple of the Tathagata and am staying here calmly in accordance with the Dharma The king inquired What is the meaning of the term Tathagata The arhat said in reply Tathagata is an honorable title of the Buddha who was Prince Sarvasiddhartha the son of Ring Suddhodana Out of pity for all living beings submerged in the sea of suffering without salvation or rescue the Prince abandoned all his property all the seven kinds of jewels that were the possessions of wealthy persons and gave up being a universal monarch ruling over the four continents to live in a quiet forest and practise the Way After six years he achieved his fruition gained the golden body of a Buddha and realized the Dharma untaught by any teacher He sprinkled the Sweet Dew at the Deer Park and let his mani pearl sparkle on Vulture Peak For eighty years he taught his teachings for the benefit and delight of the people But how is it that you are in such darkness as not to have heard about it The king said I was submersed in my accumulated sins so I did not hear the name of the Buddha It is by the benefit of the blessedness of my ancestors that today I am honored by the presence of a saint Since there are images and scriptures bequeathed by the Buddha I beg to have them so that I may practise the Way The arhat said in reply If you have such a wish you should build a temple first and then a divine image will come by itself Thus the king turned back his royal carriage Together with his ministers he selected a fine plot of land with discretion and ordered that good artisans be chosen After having asked the arhat about the style of the building they constructed a temple WhenPrediction and Return the temple was completed the king inquired again Now the temple is ready but where is the Buddha image The arhat replied Just be utterly sincere in your mind The image is not far from coming The king and his ministers together with the com mon people burning incense and holding flowers in their hands stood with concentrated minds In a moment a Buddha image came down from the air and descended onto the precious pedestal shining brilliantly with aweinspiring features The king was happy to see it and praised it without limit and he invited the arhat to preach the Dharma to the people Thus the king and the people of the country made profuse offerings to the temple which was the first one ever erected in this country As the Master had lost some scriptures while crossing the Indus he sent someone after arriving in this country to Kucha and Kashgar to seek new texts As the king of Kustana pressed him to stay he could not resume his homeward journey at once Thus he wrote a letter and asked a servitor from Gaochang to go in com pany with some merchants to inform the court of China that he had gone to the Brahmanic countries to seek the Dharma and was now at Kustana on his return journey I Sramana Xuanzang beg to make the following statement I have heard that Ma Rong was a man of great erudition and Zheng Xuan went to Fufeng to study under him and that Fu Sheng was a scholar with a bright and intelligent mind so Chao Cuo repaired to Jinan to be his student From this we may know that ancient people travelled far to acquire even the shallow learning of Confucianism Needless to say we should not be daunted by the long distance and give up the attempt to visit the mysterious traces left by the Buddha after he had benefitted living beings or to search for the wonderful teachings of the Tripitaka that will emancipate us from the bondage of ignorance I undertook the journey because the Buddha flourished in the western countries Although his bequeathed teachings had been transmitted to the East and the outstanding texts had been introduced to our land there were still many to seek to make them complete So I always thought of going to undertake further studies disregarding the safety of my life Thus in the fourth month of the third year of Zhenguan  I ventured to act against the law and the regulations and I set out privately for India I traversed the vast shifting desert climbed over the lofty range of the Snow Mountains passed through the dangerous way of the Iron Gate and sailed across the billowy Hot Sea I started from the divine capital of Changan and ended at the new city of Rajagrha The distance in between was more than fifty thousand li Although I travelled through lands with a thousand dif ferent customs and encountered a myriad of dangers and hardships I met no hindrance wherever I went because I was depending upon Your Majestys celestial prestige I even enjoyed magnanimous hospitality so that I did not feel fatigue or weariness and had my wishes fulfilled Thus I could visit Grdhrakuta Mountain and worship the Bodhi tree see the traces that I had never seen before and read scriptures unheardof previously I witnessed all the divine wonders in the universe and perceived the transformation and development of the principles of yin and yang in nature I also publicized the grace and virtue of Your Majesty so as to inspire the respect and admiration of the people in the countries with dissimilar traditions that I visited in the course of travelling around for seventeen years Starting from the country of Prayaga coming through the domain of Kapisa climbing over the Pamir Range and crossing the Pamir Valley I have now reached Kustana on my homeward way As my elephant has been drowned and I have brought with me a large number of scriptures that I have not yet obtained horses to carry I have to stop on the way for some time and am unable to come by galloping steed to have an interview with Your Majesty at an earlier moment While I stretch my neck and look up to Your Majesty with extreme respect I am sending Ma Xuanzhi a layman of Gaochang to go with some merchants to present this letter before my arrival After that the Master lectured on the Yogacarabhumi Sastra the Abhidharmasamudaya Prakarana Sastra the Abhidharmakosa Sastra and the Mahayanasamparigraha Sastra for the monks of Kustana In one day and one night he expounded these four treatises one after another The king together with the monks and lay people took refuge in the Master and attended his lectures and a thousand people came every day After the lapse of seven or eight months the messenger returned with an imperial decree from the court promising to dispatch envoys to welcome the Master with an expression of regards It said We are extremely happy to hear that the teacher is coming back after seeking the Way in foreign lands He may come speedily to see us Let him bring back those foreign monks who understand the Sanskrit language and the meanings of the scriptures We have already instructed the authorities of Kustana and other countries asking them to escort the teacher so that carriers and horses may not be lacking The governor of Dunhuang has also been ordered to receive the teacher in the desert and the governor of Shanshan to receive him at the Jumo River Having received this decree the Master immediately resumed his journey and the king of Kustana presented him with rich farewell gifts After leaving the capital and travelling eastward for more than three hundred li the Master reached the city of Pima in which was a standing image of the Buddha carved in sandalwood more than thirty feet high that had a stately and aweinspiring appearance and worked miracles very often If a man was suffering from a disease he might paste a piece of gold foil on that part of the image corresponding to his diseased part and his illness would be cured at once Whatever prayed for would mostly be fulfilled It is said by tradition that this image was made when the Buddha was living in the world by King Udayana of the country of Kausambl After the nirvana of the Buddha the image flew from there to the city of Araurak north of this country Afterward it moved itself to its present place  It is also said by tradition that a prediction foretold that the image would enter a dragons palace after the extinction of the Dharma of Sakyamuni Buddha From east of the city of Pima the Master entered the desert After travelling for more than two hundred li he reached the city o f Nina From here he again went eastward to the great shifting desert in which the sand drifted with the wind and there was neither water nor grass but many troubles from heatstroke demons and evil spirits There was no path and wayfarers had to look for human and animal skeletons as road signs when they travelled to and fro It was difficult to cross this barren desert one had to follow the traces and proceed from stage to stage Going again for more than four hundred li he reached the old territory of Tukhara Again going for more than six hundred li he reached the old country of Calmadana the land of Jumo Again going northeast for more than a thousand li he reached the old country of Navapa the land o f Lulan and finally the domain of his own country after passing through many different places Having obtained horses he dismissed the messengers from Kustana who returned home with their camels and horses The local authorities wished to reward them for their services but they departed without accept ing anything Upon arriving at Shazhou the Master wrote another letter to the Emperor who was then in his palace at Louyang When the letter arrived the Emperor knew that the Master was approach ing He instructed Fang Xuanling the Imperial Regent of the Western Capital and Left Premier with the title of the Duke of Liangguo to order the authorities to wait and welcome the Master Having heard that the Emperor was about to go on a punitive expedition to the region near the Liao River the Master feared that he would be delayed on the way and could not see the Emperor in time Beginning with His Arrival at the Western Capital in the First Month of the Spring in the Nineteenth Year and Ending with His Thanks for the Preface Written by the Emperor to the Scriptures and the Emperors Reply in the Sixth Month of the Summer in the TwentySecond Year On the day of Jingzi of the first month in the spring of the nineteenth year of Zhenguan  when the Master arrived with scriptures and images Fang Xuanling the Imperial Regent in the Capital and Left Premier with the title of the Duke of Liangguo and some others dispatched Houmochen Shi the Great General of the Right Wuhou Li Shushen the Prefect of Yongzhou and Li Qianyou the Magistrate of Changan to greet and welcome him On that day the authorities issued orders to various monas teries that carriages with curtains and gorgeous banners be pre pared for sending the scriptures and images to Hongfu Monastery The people were so delighted that they vied with one another to prepare the adornments On the following day a great meeting was held south of Vermilion Bird Street at which several hundred articles brought back from the Western Region by the Master were displayed in an orderly manner including one hundred fifty grains of the Tathagatas relic bones a golden image of the Buddhas shadow as left in the Dragon Cave at Pragbodhi Mountain in the country of Magadha three feet three inches in height including the halo and the pedestal a sandalwood imitation of the image of the Buddha when he first turned the Wheel of the Dharma at the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi three feet five inches high including the halo and the pedestal a sandalwood replica of the image of the Buddha made by King Udayana of the country of Kausambi when he was desirous of seeing the Tathagata two feet nine inches high including the halo and the pedestal a silver image o f the Buddha which was a copy of the statue of the Tathagata descending from the Heavenly Palace by precious steps in the country of Kapitha four feet in height including the halo and the pedestal a golden replica of the image of the Buddha preaching the Saddharmapundarika Sutra and other scriptures at Vulture Peak in the country of Magadha three feet five inches in height including the halo and the pedestal a sandalwood statue carved after the shadow image left at the place where the Buddha subju gated the venomous dragon in the country of Nagarahara one foot five inches high including the halo and the pedestal a sandalwood image of the Buddha going around the city to collect alms in the country of Vaisall and so on With increasing enthusiasm and keenness the people vied with one another in making the most splendid arrangements of b a n n ers and curtains tapestries and canopies as well as precious tables and carriages They moved forward with the scriptures and images amid the tinkling of pearls and jade pendants and golden flowers of various hues were scat tered None of the participants in the procession for sending the scriptures did not praise it as a rare occasion they forgot the dust and fatigue and admired it as a rare event Along the way begin ning from Vermilion Bird Street up to the main gate o f Hongfu Monastery a distance of several tens of li the common people and scholars in the capital as well as officials inside and outside the palace lined up on both sides of the road standing there to see the procession and making the street so overcrowded that the authori ties fearing that they might tread on one another ordered that they should bum incense and scatter flowers at the places where they were standing without moving about Thus the fumes of incense and the sounds of praise continued from place to place Formerly when the Tathagata was born in Kapilavastu and when Maitreya first ascended to the Tusita Heaven the dragons and deities made offerings to them and heavenly beings sur rounded them Although this procession was not as grand as those occasions in ancient times it was a great event after the Dharma had been bequeathed to the world On that day all the people simultaneously saw a beautiful cloud of different colors appear north of the sun in the sky It circled around above the scriptures and images and stretched over an area several li in circumference as if it were welcoming and escorting them When it reached the monastery it vanished out of sight Shi Yanzongs annotation Formerly when the Tathagata was bom in Kapilavastu and when Maitreya was about to ascend to the Tusita Heaven dragons and deities made offerings to them and heavenly beings received and welcomed them The present occasion was however not as grand as that in ancient times Nothing so glorious had ever happened since the introduction of the bequeathed Dharma to the East On the twentythird day the Master had an interview with Emperor Taizong at the palace in Luoyang On the first day o f the second month he again saw the Emperor at Yiluan Hall where the Emperor received him with great lovingkindness After taking his seat the Emperor said W hy did the teacher take the journey without informing us The Master said in reply with an apology When I was about to take the journey I had repeatedly submitted petitions to Your Majesty but as my sincere wishes were insig nificant I was not favored with official permission For my guilt in taking action without authorization I feel deeply ashamed of myself and fearful The Emperor said As you are a homeless monk you are treated in a different way than the lay people We are glad that you could risk your life to seek the Dharma for the benefit of the common people so you need not feel ashamed of yourself But we wonder how you managed to reach that land at a great distance beyond the hindrances of mountains and rivers and through various places with peoples of different mentalities The Master said in reply I have heard that to visit the Heavenly Lake is not far for those who can ride on a speedy wind and it is not difficult to cross a stormy river if one sails in a dragon boat Since Your Majesty held sway over the empire and pacified the Four Seas your virtue prevailed in the Nine Regions and your benevolence covered the Eight Areas with the wind of honesty blowing to the hot regions in the south and imperial prestige reaching so far as beyond the Pamirs Therefore whenever the rulers of foreign tribes saw a bird flying from the East they would suspect that it started in the Superior Country and would bow to it to show their respect not to say that I am a human being who has personally received education and edification from Your Majesty Since I depended upon imperial prestige I have been able to go and return without difficulty The Emperor said This is but the saying of a teacher We are not worthy of the praise Then he inquired in great detail about events in the lands west of the Snow Mountains and in the domain of India such as the climate in the four seasons the products and customs the old traces of the eight kings the ancient sites of the four Buddhas and what was not mentioned in the writings of Zhang Qian or the Marquis of Bowang nor recorded in the historical works written by either Ban Gu or Sima Qian As the Master had visited those places in person and had seen the countries and cities he could remember all that he had heard and seen without forgetting anything He made replies in an orderly manner to whatever was asked of him  The Emperor was greatly pleased and he said to his attending ministers Formerly Fu Jian praised the Venerable Daoan as a man of divine personality who was respected by the whole court Now we see that the Masters utterance is elegant and refined and his character and morality are pure and lofty He is by no means inferior to the ancients but far surpasses them Zhangsun Wuji the Duke of Zhaoguo said to the Emperor It is as Your Majesty has remarked I your humble servant have read the Annals o f the Jin Kingdom in which is related the life story of Daoan who was indeed a monk of noble deeds and erudite learning He was unlike the Master who has been to the Land of Purity in person done research into the origin of all the wonderful teachings and visited the site where the Buddha entered nirvana The Emperor said What you have said is right And he also said to the Master The Land of the Buddha is far away Since the teacher has personally visited that land an account of it should be written to inform those who have not heard about it Through observation the Emperor also realized that the Mas ter was competent to take the post of premier or minister and so he exhorted the Master to give up the robe in order to assist him in administering secular affairs The Master declined the offer saying Since my youth I have been living a monastic life I believe deeply in the way o f the Buddha and I have studied his profound teaching but I have learned nothing of the theories of Confucius If Your Majesty ordered me to return to secular life it would be like dragging a ferryboat out of water and putting it on land Not only would it become useless but also it would get rotten for nothing I wish to practise the Way for life in order to repay the kindness shown to me by the state At that time the Emperor was about to leave on a punitive campaign to the region of the Liao River and the military forces were already concentrated at Luoyang When he heard that the Master had arrived he ordered that in spite of his busy military activities the Master should be ushered into the court just to have a brief interview with him But he was so interested in the conver sation with the Master that he was unaware that the sun had passed the meridian So Zhangsun Wuji the Duke of Zhaoguo reminded the Emperor The Master is staying at the guesthouse o f the Department of Protocol I am afraid it is getting too late for him to return The Emperor said W e are in such a hurry that we have not yet fully expressed ourselves We wish that the teacher could go with us to the East to see the place and observe the local customs so that we could continue our conversation besides com manding the army What does the teacher think of it The Master said with an apology As I have travelled a long way and I am suffering from a rash I am afraid I am unable to accompany Your Majesty The Emperor said You have been able to travel alone to faraway regions the present journey is merely a step for you Why should you refuse to go with us The Master said in reply In the eastward expedition Your Majesty will be protected by six armies In pu n ish in g traitors and executing treacherous ministers Your Majesty will surely achieve the merit of Muye the place where King Wu of the Zhou dynasty overthrew the tyrannical King Zhou of the Shang dynasty and enjoy the same victory as Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han dynasty who defeated the troops of the usurper Wang Mang at Kunyang I think that my presence could render no service to the campaign but would simply make me feel shame at wasting provisions on the way Moreover a monk is prohibited by the disciplinary rules from beholding military operations Since this is the teaching of the Buddha I must report it to Your Majesty That will be a great honor for me The Emperor accepted his words and ceased to invite him The Master said again to the Emperor I have obtained from the Western Region more than six hundred Sanskrit texts of which not a word has been translated into Chinese I know that south of Song Mountain and north of Shaoshi Peak there is Shaolin Monas tery It is located in a quiet place where there are springs and boulders far away from noisy markets and villages and was constructed by Emperor Xiaowen of the Later Wei dynasty It is the place where the Tripitaka Master Bodhiruci translated scriptures I wish I could stay there to translate the Sanskrit texts for the sake of the country After your departure to the West we constructed Hongfu Monastery at the Western Capital in honor of our mother the late Empress Mu You may stay there to translate the Sanskrit texts The Master said again to the Emperor As the people are curious and know that I have returned from the West they are eager to see me and would thus turn my dwelling into a market place It would not only be against the law but also impede me in my religious affairs I hope that janitors will be appointed to prevent people from committing blunders Being greatly pleased to hear this the Emperor said What you have said is a precaution for safeguarding yourself necessary measures will be taken You may rest for a few days and then return to the capital to settle down at Hongfu Monastery For whatever you need just consult with Fang Xuanling Then the Master took his leave and went back On the first day of the third month the Master returned from Luoyang to Changan and took up his abode at Hongfu Monastery When he was about to undertake his translation work he wrote a letter to Fang Xuanling the Imperial Regent Minister of State Affairs and Duke of Liangguo requesting that he appoint assis tants such as theoryprovers literary composers scribes copyists etc Fang Xuanling ordered the authorities to make a report to the Emperor at Dingzhou who issued a decree to the effect that whatever the Master needed must be adequately provided On the second day of the sixth month in the summer twelve monks of great learning who were well versed in both Mahayana and Hinayana scriptures and treatises and esteemed by the people of the time arrived to be theoryprovers namely Sramanas Lingrun and Weibei of Hongfu Monastery in the capital Sramana Huigui of Luohan Monastery Sramana Mingyan of Shiji Monastery Sramana Faxiang of Baochang Monastery Sramana Puxian of Jingfa Monas tery Sramana Shenfang of Fahai Monastery Sramana Daoshen o f Fajiang Monastery at Guozhou Sramana Xuanzhong of Yanjue Monastery at Bianzhou Sramana Shentai of Pujiu Monastery at Puzhou Sramana Jingming of Zhenxiang Monastery at Mianzhou and Sramana Daoyin of Duobao Monastery at Yizhou There arrived also nine literary composers namely Sramana Qixuan of Puguang Monastery in the capital Sramana Mingjun of Hongfu Monastery Sramana Bianji of Huichang Monastery Sramana Daoxuan of Fengde Monastery at Zhongnan Mountain Sramana Jingmai of Fuju Monastery at Jianzhou Sramana Xingyou of Pujiu Monas tery at Puzhou Sramana Daozhuo of Qiyan Monastery SramanaArrival and Emperors Preface Huili of Zhaoren Monastery at Youzhou and Sramana Xuanze of Tiangong Monastery at Luozhou There arrived also one philolo gist namely Sramana Xuanying of the Great Zhongchi Monastery in the capital There arrived also one prover of the Sanskrit language and script namely Sramana Xuanmu of the Great Xingshan Monastery in the capital And other scribes and copyists as well as material requisites provided by the authorities also arrived at the same time On the first day the Master started to translate the palm leaf Sanskrit texts He first translated four texts the Bodhisattvapitaka Sutra the Buddhabhumi Sutra the Saddvaradharani Sutra and the Prakaranaryavaca Sastra Of these the translation of the Saddvaradharani Sutra was com pleted on that same day and the Buddhabhumi Sutra was finished on the fifteenth day  while the Bodhi sattvapitaka Sutra and the Prakaranaryavaca Sastra were done by the end of the year On the first day of the first month in the spring of the twentieth year  he began to translate the Mahayanabhidharmasamyuktasamudaya Sastra which was completed in the second month He also translated the Yogacarabhumi Sastra On the first day of the seventh month in the autumn the Master presented the newly translated scriptures and treatises that had already been completed to the Emperor and attached a letter as follows I Sramana Xuanzang beg to submit the following words I have heard that the teaching of the Eightfold Noble Path is a ferryboat or a bridge for crossing over the sea of suffering and that the doctrine of the Ekayana is a ladder for ascend ing to the state of nirvana But as the opportunity was not ripe  they were stored on the western side of the Pamir Range During the reign of the ancient monarchs they were not heard of and they did not reach us during the Zhou and Qin dynasties It was at the time when KasyapaMatanga came to the region o f Luo that these teachings were spread over the area of the Three Rivers and it was not until Senghui visited the State of Wu that the regions of Jin and Chu received their benefit Since then the people have had cause to cultivate emanci pation and families can perform deeds of Bodhi Thus we may know the benefit of transmitting the Dharma of which the advantages are really great Although they fanned the wind of abstruse teachings both o f them lived under the rule of illegitimate governments Having risked my life to take the journey I am the only person to have met with a noble and sagacious ruler to whom I could present all the scriptures and treatises I have brought back home As Your Majesty esteems and respects the holy teachings I have the honor to be ordered to trans late them into Chinese Working together with various theo retically learned monks I have spent all my time without wasting a single moment with brush in hand but I have not yet completed the translation of all the texts What I have finished are five works in fiftyeight fascicles namely the Mahabodhisattvapitaka Sutra in twenty fascicles the Buddhabhumi Sutra in one fascicle the Saddvaradharani Sutra in one fascicle the Prakaranaryavaca Sastra in twenty fascicles and the Mahayanabhidharmasarnyuktasamudaya Sastra in sixteen fascicles copied separately and bound in eight bundles These I have respectfully brought to the palace to be presented to Your Majesty I also have the humble view that when the holy image was made in Hongfu Monastery Your Majesty personally went there in an Impe rial Carriage decorated with small tinkling bells to open the eyes of the image which were in the shape of blue lotus flowers So I hope that now as the scriptures and treatises are first translated into Chinese as new literature of the present glorious dynasty Your Majesty will condescend with the previous event as a precedent to write a preface with the Divine Pen to extol the supreme teaching so that the profound doctrine and the abstruse gists may shine as brightly as the sun and the moon The words written by Your Majesty will last as long as Heaven and earth to be read and sung for a hundred generations without limit and to be seen with admiration for a thousand years without end When the Master saw the Emperor at Luoyang on a previous occasion he was ordered to write a Record o f the Western Regions which was completed by now On the fifth day the Master presented another letter to the Emperor in which he said I humbly consider that Mount Panmu and the State of You are recorded by ancient officials as having been the territory of Emperor Xuanyuan and that according to the History o f Xia the region from the shifting desert up to the blue sea was the domain of Emperor Yao The white jade ring of Wangmu in the West was offered to the lord dressed in a loose garment  and the fragile arrow made of a red vitex twig of the Yi tribe in the East was presented to the monarch who ruled over his land without resorting to punishment These were past events of the bygone days and the ancient classics are on the wane By excavating trees into canoes and stretching strings on wood to make bows you extended your prestige to the whole empire to succor the people Empress Niiwa in remote ages cut four legs off a turtle to support the four comers of the earth absorbed floods with the ashes of reeds reclaimed the square land and mended the dome of Heaven Thus she displayed the seven military virtues and expounded the ten principles of moral culture Her benefi cence permeated all fountains and sources of rivers and her edification benefitted mugworts and reeds so that they could be used to make musical instruments One took delight in parks with trees and ponds where musicians were trained and the notes were tuned by bam boo pitch pipes Pimple grease was used in the palace and white clouds flew over the jade covers of book containers I Xuanzang being fortunate enough to live at a time when the empire was under correct governance and peace prevailed in China and abroad had deeply set my mind on the Brahmanic domains and ventured to be in keeping with good actions although my life is as ephemeral as morning dew and my strength is comparable only with that of a katydid in the autumn season As years passed my wish was granted by Heaven and thus I was able to go to the Snow Mountains and cross the Hiranyavatl River I looked at Crane Grove and saw Vulture Peak The road to Jetavana Garden seemed to be still in existence and the foundation of the city of Rajagrha remained there on the slopes I sought the holy sites and travelled to visit them As time elapsed I spent more than twelve years before I started my homeward journey back to the imperial capital The countries I have either heard of or visited in person amount to one hundred twentyeight in number In my humble opinion Zhang Yuns book of travels only stated the extension of the places he had visited and nothing else while Kuafii though flying high did not relate the natural conditions or social customs of the localities he had gone through Ban Chao the Marquis of Dingyuan yuan means far did not travel far and Zhang Qian the Marquis of Bowang  was not widely travelled though he did see some places What I have related now is different from what was heard before Although I did not reach the limit of the great world I visited all the regions west of the Pamir Range and made a factual account of them without daring to add any embel lishment in flowery language With due compilation and abridgement my work is entitled the Great Tang Dynasty Record o f the Western Regions in twelve fascicles as copied separately I hope that it will be publicized by your honor able pen and my incorrect wording improved so that it may cover all the wide knowledge of the minister of Jin and enlarge the Record o f the Nine States in the present imperial dynasty But as my endowment is shallow and my learning short my work must be full of omissions and defects More over as I am clumsy in writing I am afraid it is unworthy of perusal Being shallowly learned and dullminded we are deluded even in worldly affairs How can we fathom the mystic and subtle teachings of the Buddha As for your request that we write an inscription for your trans lations of the scriptures that is something we have not heard of As to your new work The Record o f the Western Regions we shall certainly read it through The above is written to Monk Xuanzang On the seventh day the Master wrote another letter to the Emperor which read as follows I Sramana Xuanzang beg to make the following statement I collected exotic books and cherished the memory of distant countries in order to pro vide material for the court to carry out education and edifi cation I am honored to have been asked to translate the scriptures and treatises I have obtained They are now bound into fascicles and scrolls but without a preface I have heard that the sun and the moon beautify the sky and also shed their light on doors and windows and that the rivers flow on the earth but also moisten cliffs and crags The grand music of the zither played on Mount Yunhe does not hide its melody from the deaf and precious gold jade and other valuables do not conceal their brilliant luster from the blind I humbly beg that Your Majesty will condescend with the might of thun der to grant me the favor of writing a composition that will shine like stars in the sky last as long as Heaven and earth and hang in the air forever like the sun and the moon Thereupon the promise was granted In the spring of the twentysecond year the Emperor favored the Yuhua Palace with his presence On the fourteenth day o f the fifth month in the summer the translation of the Yogacarabhumi Sastra was completed in a hundred fascicles On the first day of the sixth month an imperial decree arrived inviting the Master to go to the palace When the Master had started on the way imperial envoys arrived repeatedly asking him to proceed at leisure and not to get tired After his arrival he was very happy to see the Emperor at the Yuhua Palace The Emperor said As we were troubled by the hot climate in the capital we came to this palace in the mountains As it is cool here amid fountains and boulders we feel somewhat better and more energetic thus we are able to attend to court affairs But as we are thinking of Your Reverence we have sent for you to take the trouble to come here You must have been greatly fatigued on the way The Master said gratefully in reply All the common people within the Four Seas depend upon Your Majesty for their lives Upon hearing that your Presence is here with a good appetite whoever of the people with sentience will not dance with delight May Your Majesty keep eternal sublimity as limitless as the sky Being a mediocre person with meager knowledge I feel it is a great honor to have been summoned by Your Majesty as if I were a man of talent Filled with a sense of gratitude I did not feel any fatigue Realizing that the Master was an erudite scholar with an elegant demeanor the Emperor often considered pressing him to persuade him to give up his robe so that he could appoint him to serve in the court in managing state affairs This he had mentioned to the Master before when he granted him an interview at the palace in Luoyang They were sagacious kings and wise lords and yet they depended upon able and virtuous men for assistance How can we a man of little learning act without the aid of sagacious people Our desire is that you take off the dyed religious robe worn by Subhuti and put on the white dress used by Vimalaklrti so as to ascend the path leading to the position of a minister stating your political views and sitting in the courtyard under locust trees to discuss the Way as highranking officials do What do you think of it The Master said in reply As Your Majesty has said the affairs of the world are extensive Even the Three Monarchs and the Five Emperors of ancient times could not keep them in order alone but had to depend upon various sages and wise men to achieve it Confucius also remarked that what the monarch might lose his ministers would gain to make it up therefore the monarch is the head and the ministers are merely his limbs I deem that this saying was for the admonishment of mediocre people and was not said for men of superior intelligence If all monarchs who had ministers to serve them would always make achievements then did the tyrannical rulers Jie and Zhou not have ministers to assist them Drawing an inference from this fact it is unnecessary to follow that adage Moreover since Your Majesty has possessed the empire by destiny the whole country has been in a state of peace and happiness and tranquillity and felicity have prevailed in and outside the country This is but the result of Your Majestys nonnegligence of state affairs and nonextravagance in private life and of your never indulging in sumptuousness and wastefulness but being cautious and conscientious not forgiving even what is forgivable thinking of danger while living in safety and doing good deeds in accordance with the order of Heaven Your Majestys strategy of ruling over the whole empire within the eight directions in an orderly manner your talent for employing and managing outstanding personages your repression of rebellions and disorders your upholding of peace and happiness your intelligence and adroitness in managing state affairs and your physical form which is the embodiment o f goodness and befits the supreme position are all endowed by Heaven and not inherited from man The ultimate Way is connected with other bypaths Your deep kindness reaches far to benefit the peoples beyond the region of the sun in the east over the Kunlun Range in the west to the edge of the Fiery Island in the south and to the Great Wall in the north Those who have the custom of tattooing their feet and drinking through their noses and those who wear clothes made of ko hemp with lappets buttoned on the left side all come while forecasting the wind and rain to kowtow and kneel down offering precious treasure as tribute They filled the guest house for receiv ing foreigners The troubles caused by the tribe of Xianyun started a long time ago The Five Emperors could not subjugate them nor could the Three Kings suppress them Thus the region between the Yellow River and the Luo River became a wild place inhabited by uncivilized people with dishevelled hair and the areas o f Feng and Hao were turned into battlefields with the shooting of whistling arrows Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty mobilized his troops and the famous generals Wei Qing and Huo Qubing exerted themselves to the utmost However though the branches were cut off the root still remained intact Since then no more good strategy was heard of If one says that this was the achievement of the ministers then there had been numerous sagacious assistants to rulers since the Yu and Xia dynasties Why did they not gain such an achievement Therefore we know that this achievement was acquired by the one who possesses the Way and not by anybody else This is the fourth point The Emperor of the Sui dynasty commanding all the troops of the whole empire personally went on three punitive expeditions But while he attacked the cities he did not break even half a battlement nor did he capture a single prisoner of war He simply lost his six armies for nothing and returned home in an awkward predicament Your Majesty went there for a short time strong formation of the guards of the enemy and broke the fortified cities at Liao and Ge Although the soldiers were employed and the generals directed in the same way the House of Sui lost its power and the Court of Tang gained sovereignty From this we know that it all depended on the ability of the lord without the aid of anybody else This is the fifth point Moreover when Heaven and earth are in perfect communication with each other the sun and moon shine brightly an atmosphere of peace prevails the clouds of rejoicing are rich and luxuriant the five auspicious things appear in substantial form the unicorn emerges as a strange sight and white wolves and foxes as well as red phoenix and red grass are clearly seen in a mixed way Such things are so numerous that they are counted by thousands and crores and cannot be cited one by one All of them come in response to your virtue and are not caused by any other man As regards the analogy of the ancient king who depended upon his ten courtiers to gain his merits I presume to take a different view from that of Your Majesty Even if persons are really needed there are now many sagacious people as good as Yi Yin and Lu Shang How can I Xuanzang being a humble mediocre man be competent to participate in political affairs Since you wish to propagate the abstruse Way we shall not act contrary to your sublime convictions Be effortful and from now onward we shall help you spread the Way Comment by Shi Yancong They could by no means compare with the Master who just by making a scholarly statement won the Emperors consent and permission His pure character turned purer and his final aspiration proved true From this we may say that we need not make an appraisal to see who was superior and who was inferior At that time Chu Suiliang the Chief Privy Councillor made a statement to the Emperor saying Peace now prevails in the empire within the Four Seas and the Nine Regions enjoy comfort and tranquillity All this is due to the sagacious virtue of Your Majesty As the Master has truly said your humble servants did nothing more than occupy official positions Under the light of the sun and the moon what merit can a glowworm or a candle achieve The Emperor said with a smile No A valuable fur coat is not made with the fur of a single fox and a large amount of timber is needed for the construction of a great mansion How can a ruler do anything by himself alone It is because the Master wishes to preserve his moral integrity that he extolled and glorified us so profusely The Emperor asked the Master What scriptures and com mentaries are you translating now The Master said in reply I have recently completed the translation of the Yogacarabhumi Sastra in a hundred fascicles The Emperor remarked This is indeed a voluminous work By whom is it written and what theory does it elucidate The Master replied saying It is taught by Maitreya Bodhisattva for the exposition of the Seventeen Stages of Bodhisattvahood W hat are the Seventeen Stages inquired the Emperor again In reply the Master said They are the stage of correlation of the five cognitions the stage of correlation of mental functions the stage of having both deliberation and discrimination the stage of having no deliberation but only dis crimination the stage of having neither deliberation nor discrimmeditation the stage of nonsamahita the stage of mental activ ity the stage of nonmental activity the stage of achievement by hearing the Dharma the stage of achievement by reflecting on the Dharma the stage of achievement by practising the Dharma the stage o f Sravakas  the stage of Pratyekabuddhas  the stage of Bodhisattvas the stage of incomplete nirvana and the stage of complete nirvana And he also gave an outline and explained the gist of the work The Emperor was so deeply pleased with it that he dispatched a messenger to the capital to fetch the Yogacarabhumi Sastra When the treatise arrived he read it in detail finding that both the theories and the language of the work were more grand and farreaching than he had ever heard before He remarked to his attending ministers with admiration We see that Buddhist scrip tures are comparable with the immeasurable height of the sky or the fathomless depth of the sea The Master has obtained the profound Dharma from foreign countries but as we were busy in military and state affairs we did not have time to engage ourselves in pursuing the teachings of the Buddha Now we have come to see that the teachings have a far and profound origin We can hardly know their limits Compared with the Buddhist teachings Confu cianism and Taoism including all the nine schools o f thought are merely a small pond in contrast with the great sea It is ridiculous that the world should say that the three religions are equal in value Thus an imperial decree was issued to the authorities to instruct the copyists of the Imperial Secretariat to produce nine copies of each of the newly translated scriptures and treatises to be distributed to the nine states of Yong Luo Bing Yan Xiang Jing Yang Liang and Yi for circulation from place to place so that all the people in the whole land might receive the doctrines that they had not heard before At that time Zhangsun Wuji the Minister of Education and Duke of Zhaoguo Chu Suiliang the Chief Privy Councillor and some others presented a report to the Emperor saying Your servants have heard that the Buddhas teaching is so profound and abstruse that it is beyond the comprehension of heavenly and human beings The principles expressed by the words are very deep and the language barrier is difficult to cross You grant beneficence to places far away and give ample edification to the Central Region Your Majesty protects and advocates the Five Vehicles and establishes the Triple Gem Therefore Your Majesty has gained the acquain tance of a Master who has an elegant demeanor in the Age of Decline such as is bom only once in a thousand years He passed over one obstacle after another to seek the scriptures and travelled over dangerous roads to acquire the Way He has seen strange and peculiar customs and obtained the true texts which he has brought back home and translated into Chinese for propagation just as originally taught in the Amravana Garden The refined language and abstruse teachings are just the same as what the Golden Mouth spoke All these are effected by the influence of Your Majestys holy virtue We your humble ser vants being ignorant persons deficient in judgement have the chance to participate in this event and thus have a boat by which to cross the rolling sea of suffering Moreover Your Majestys heavenly compassion extends far and wide spreading the Buddhist texts to all the nine states so that the uncivilized masses of common people may also enjoy the taste of the wonderful Dharma It is indeed very lucky of us to have met with what is rarely encountered once in a hundred million kalpasl The Emperor said This is due to the great power of the Masters compassionate vow It is not caused by us alone The Emperor had previously promised to compose a preface to the newly translated scriptures but as he was busily engaged in state affairs he had no time to pay attention to the matter At this time as the Master had made the request again the Emperor moistened his brush with ink and completed in a short time a composition entitled the Great Tang Dynasty Preface to the Holy Teachings o f the Tripitaka in  characters The Emperor staying at the Qingfu Palace attended and guarded by different officials asked the Master to be seated and ordered Shangguan Yi a scholar of the Institute for the Expansion of Culture to read aloud the preface the Emperor had composed in the presence of all the officials It was written in a brilliant and flowery style with the highest praise and extolment The words of the preface are as follows We have heard that Heaven and earth have visible forms to cover and carry all things that possess life and that the four seasons though formless may potentiate cold and hot cli mates for the evolution of all things Therefore by watching Heaven and scrutinizing earth mediocre and ignorant peo ple may perceive their origin but by understanding and having a keen insight into the principles o f yin and yang  even sages and wise men can hardly thoroughly comprehend the fate of the world This is because Heaven and earth have forms so they are easily perceived even though they contain the principles ofyin and yang While the principles of yin and yang are latent in Heaven and earth they are difficult to grasp thoroughly because they are formless But the Great Teaching flourished in its base the Western Land It was introduced into the Court of Han as the result of a clear dream of the reigning Emperor and so it shone upon the Eastern Region with spreading compassion Formerly when was bom in his own separate form with sepa rate traces his edification was achieved even before his words were spread In todays world the people respect his virtue and know enough to follow his example When his shadow faded away and returned to ultimate truth and he shifted his appearance to another world his golden features lost color without the luster of his three thousand rules of deportment Since then his subtle words have been widely spread for the salvation of living beings in the three evil states of existence and his bequeathed instruc tions have been propagated extensively to guide all living beings to the Ten Stages of Bodhisattvahood But the true teaching is difficult to appreciate and nobody can make the ultimate purport an allpervading unity while crooked theo ries may be easily followed Thus disputes arose between the right and the wrong The theories of unreality and reality were either accepted as right or denied as wrong according to convention and both the Great and the Lesser Vehicles prospered for some time and declined by turns over the passage of time Being a leader of the Buddhist community the Vener able Master Xuanzang has been pure and clever since his childhood and realized the mind of three voidnesses at an early age The wind from a pine wood and the reflection of the moon in water are not comparable to his purity and elegance so how can the dew of immortality and lustrous pearls be a match for his brilliance and resplen dence Thus his wisdom is perfect without bondage and his spirituality could inquire into what is formless He tran scends the Six Defilements and is far removed from the world He concentrated his mind on the inner domain and grieved at the decline of the Right Dharma He fixed his consideration on the Gate of the Abstruse Teaching and regretted that there were errors and mistakes in the pro found texts He desired to make a systematic analysis of all that he had learned before in order to cut off the spurious and perpetuate the genuine for the benefit of the learners of the future Therefore he raised his mind toward the Pure Land and travelled to the Western Region overcoming dan gers through long distances and journeying alone with a staff in his hand Accumulated snow flew in the mornings and the earth was lost to sight on the way Startling sand storms rose in the evenings bhirring the sky into outer space Crossing a distance often thousand li over mountains and rivers he pushed through colored mist and proceeded with nobody but his own shadow For many years through the cold and hot seasons he trod on frost and dew to follow the track forward He attached importance to sincerity and slighted toilsomeness What he sought after was profound and his wishes were fulfilled He travelled in the Western World for seventeen years and visited all the states where the Way prevailed to acquire the right teaching The Way of the One Vehicle and the five schools of the Vinaya were speedily accumulated in the field of his mind and the texts o f the Eight Stores and the Three Baskets were lectured on fluently through his mouth Then from the countries that he had visited he collected all the important texts of the Tripitaka totalling  works which were translated and spread in China for the propaga tion of superior deeds The cloud of compassion was ushered in from the extreme West and the rain of the Dharma poured down over the borderland in the East Thus the Holy Teaching which was incomplete  was made complete and the common people regained blessedness after the purification of their sins The flames of the house on fire were extinguished and all people were saved from the wrong path The bewitching waves in the river of desire were stilled so that everyone could reach the other shore together From this we may know that evils diminish because of deeds and goodness arises from condi tions The commencement of the rising and falling depends upon man only When an osmanthus tree grows on a high ridge only cloud and dew can fall on its flowers when a lotus emerges from pure water no flying dust can defile its leaves It is not that the lotus is pure by nature nor that the osmanthus is undefiled by origin It is owing to the height at which the tree is rooted that not even a tiny th in g can cling to it and as what the flower depends on is pure n o th in g of the foul sort can contaminate it Even inanimate flowers and trees thus depend upon goodness to achieve goodness So how can human beings not draw sup port from felicity to win felicity We now hope that the circulation of these scriptures will be as everlasting as the sun and moon and that the blessedness gained there from will spread far and always be as great as Heaven and earth When the Master received the preface composed by the Emperor he wrote a letter to him to express his gratitude I humbly think that Your Majesty the Emperor conde scended to make inquiries of me with your jade writing brush and that your Golden Wheel is driven across the sky You have extended the nine states of former monarchs and your glory outshines hundreds and thousands of suns and moons You have enlarged the territory possessed by succes sive generations and embraced as many Dharmadhatus as there are grains of sand in the Ganges Thus the Jetavana Vihara is situated within a fief o f the empire and spiritual texts inscribed on palm leaves are included in the Imperial Library I searched for the Tripitaka and saw all that is stored in the Naga Palace I studied the Unique Vehicle and made a thorough inquiry about the bequeathed theories at Vulture Peak These have been carried back by white horses and offered to the imperial palace Later I have been honored to receive an imperial decree ordering me to translate the holy texts My knowledge is not the same as that of Nagarjuna and yet I have the honor to transmit his Lamp of Truth My talent is different from that of Asvaghosa whose elo quence like water pouring out of a bottle caused me deep humiliation There must be many errors and mistakes in my translations of the scriptures and treatises yet I have enjoyed the imperial favor of having a preface composed by Your Majesty with concentrated spirit Its wording excels the exposition of the symbolism and the Great Treatise in the Book o f Changes Its reasoning includes all the wonder ful gates of the Dharma Now this humble person has per sonally heard the voice of the Buddha making me dance with delight as if I had heard the Buddhas prediction As I am extremely happy and grateful I am presenting this letter to the palace to express my gratitude Upon receiving the letter the Emperor wrote a reply with his own hand in which he said Our endowment is less brilliant than jade and we are ashamed that our words are not broad and extensive The preface we composed yesterday is very awkward and unpolished and we fear that it would defile your writing inscribed on golden plates It is like marking a heap of pearls with a piece of rubble I have now received your letter in which you overpraise us with high commendation After making retrospection and consideration of ourselves it made us feel all the more ashamed It is not good enough to be praised and is unworthy of your thanks Beginning with the Composition of the Statement of the Sacred Preface by the Crown Prince in the Sixth Month of the Summer in the TwentySecond Year and Ending with a Reply by the Master in the Second Month of the Spring in the Fifth Year of Yonghui In the sixth month of the summer in the twentysecond year of Zhenguan  when the Heavenly Lord and Great Emperor a title adopted by the Crown Prince later in  after his ascension to the Throne was living at the Spring Palace he read the Sacred Preface with respect and composed A Statement on the Sacred Preface the wording of which is as follows In displaying and propagating the right teaching if one is not a man of wisdom his literature will not widely spread In the advocacy and exposition of subtle sayings their essence cannot be ascertained by a man who is not sagacious The Holy Teaching of tathata is the mysterious gist of all Dharmas and the criterion of various scriptures Its content is great and farreaching and its abstruse pur port is lasting and profound explaining the theories of voidness and reality in their extreme fineness and subtlety and embodying the essence of birthanddeath The wording is ornate and the way it expresses is broad so much so that a seeker could not find its origin the language is apparent but the meaning is so deep that a practiser could not fathom its bottom Thus we know that under the cover of holy compassion no good deeds are unattainable and that by the influence of wonderfifl edification no evil conditions cannot be cut off It unties the headrope to open the net of the Dharma in order to publicize the right teaching of the Six Paramitas and it saves all living beings from misery and suffering and opens the secret gate of the Tripitaka There fore its name flies far though it has no wings and the Way although without root is steadfast for ever The Way and its name transmit happiness to the future and they always have done so since remote and ancient ages The Buddhas body that moved in response to the needs of living beings will not decay for as many kalpas as an enormous number of atoms The sound of the bell in the morning and the voice of chanting hymns in the evening mingled on Vulture Peak the Sun of Wisdom and the Stream of the Dharma turned the Twin Wheels in the Deer Park The precious canopy that stretched in the air fluttered with the fleeing cloud and the exuberant grass in the wild forest in springtime added its color to the heavenly flowers I humbly consider that His Majesty the Emperor hav ing been blessed by Heaven governs the empire within the eight quarters without taking any action He covers the people with his virtue and dressing himself properly he meets from all countries His grace is extended to the dead whose bones are rotten and in stone chambers he stores palmleaf texts His kindness benefits even insects and Sanskrit stanzas are kept in golden caskets for circula tion Thus the water of Anavatapta Lake is connected with the eight rivers in the Divine Land and Grdhrakuta Moun tain is linked with the green peaks of the Song and Hua Mountains In my humble opinion the nature of the Dharma is immutable and quiet and no mind that turns toward it will not comprehend it The stage of wisdom is mysterious and abstruse but when moved by sincerity it will become mani fest Shall we say that it is like a torch of wisdom shining inThe Crown Princes Preface a night of darkness and ignorance and like the rain of the Dharma pouring upon the house on fire Thus a hundred rivers flow separately but they all meet in the sea a myriad of distinctive meanings aggregate to constitute reality As there was nowhere to make inquiries in China he went to India to search for true texts He travelled far to the Ganges and obtained Mahayana scriptures at last he repeatedly climbed the Snow Mountains and also acquired Hinayana texts He spent seventeen years on his way there and back and thoroughly mastered the Buddhist texts with a mind to benefit all living beings On the sixth day of the second month in the nineteenth year of Zhenguan  he was ordered by imperial edict to translate at Hongfu Monastery the important texts o f the Holy Teaching amounting to  books The current of the great sea of the Dharma is diverted without being exhausted to wash away defilements and the lasting flame of the Lamp of Wisdom is transmitted to dispel darkness with constant brightness If he had not cultivated superior conditions a long time ago how could he have revealed and propagated such Teachings That is why it is said that the Dharma nature is eternal and as bright as the light of the Three Luminaries and that our Emperors blessedness is as solid as Heaven and earth Now I have the honor to read the preface written by the Throne to the various scriptures and commentaries shining upon ancient times and illuminating the present age Its reasoning is expressed by exquisite phrases with the melody of music and its literary style is polished by wind and clouds I Zhi ventured to add an atom of dust to supplement the big mountain and let fall a drop of dew to replenish the flowing river in citing the outlines of the preface in this statement The Master submitted a letter of thanks as follows I Xuanzang have heard that the Seven Luminaries emit light and depend upon the high sky to cast shadows and that the nine rivers spread moisture and flow unobstructed because the earth is thick From this we may know the beauty of interdependence Such being the case in natural phenomena it is also true in the propagation of the Dharma which has to depend upon men There is no doubt about this reasoning Your Highness the Crown Prince has given full play to your literary talent in repeating the Heavenly Com position to commend the Mahayana doctrine and glorify the theory of reality It is written in a fluent style like rolling pearls and polished jade as splendid as the evening glow and unfolded brocade shining brilliantly like the light of the sun and moon and rhyming with the melodies of the ancient music of xian and shao I Xuanzang being a humble person but very fortunate bathing in special privilege beg to sub mit this letter of thanks to express my deep gratitude I Zhi have always been a man with little talent and learning nor am I bright and intelligent by nature I have not read any Buddhist texts and in the statement I wrote about the preface there must be many vulgar and awkward expressions Your Reverence and other teachers took the trouble to reach faraway lands which makes me feel deeply abashed  Is this why it is said that the edification of inferiors by superiors is like wind bending the grass growing beneath it It was for just this reason that the Tathagata entrusted the Dharma to kings At that time Abbot Yuanding of Hongfu Monastery and some other monks in the capital asked permission to inscribe the two prefaces on metal vessels and stone slabs to be preserved in the monastic buildings and the Emperor granted permission Later the monk Huairen and some others of the monastery collected the characters from among the calligraphies of Wang Xizhi General of the Right Army of the Jin dynasty and had them engraved on slabs On the first day  the Crown Prince whose mother the late majestic Empress Wende had relinquished her people and died early in life wished to repay his mothers kindness by performing posthumous religious ceremonies as good deeds for the benefit of the departed He ordered Gao Jifu a Great Officer of the Middle Class and Acting Director of the Crown Princes Right Palace to make the following announcement I a man o f little virtue am unfortunate in that my evil deeds caused trouble to the person on whom my feelings were concentrated for when I was at the age of innocence my loving mother left me behind in lifelong distress which pierced painfully into my heart and my sorrow at being unable to be filial to my deceased parent hurt me deep in my bones On each anniversary of the demise of the late Empress I expressed my grief and cherished a feeling of affection for my mother in vain simply increasing the sor row of remembering her in my mind My desire to repay her kindness which is as great as Heaven could not be fulfilled and now I can no longer express my filial sentiment in the way a young crow feeds its mother The authorities should be ordered to select a suitable site at some disused temple in the capital for constructing a monastery in the name of the late majestic Empress Wende When the con struction is completed a number o f monks will be specially ordained for the occasion Trees should be planted and fountains made amidst the monastic buildings so as to render it a place with perfect scenery Thus the authorities carefully chose a superior location at the Jinchang residential quarter to the south of the palace city facing Qu Lake There a monastery was constructed at the site of the former Jingjue Temple After the stars were observed and the land measured it was built to resemble the imperial palace and imitate the Jetavana Park with ingenious workmanship like that of the famous craftsmen Lu Ban and Chui of ancient times and the best timber from the Heng and Huo Mountains In the woods there were plenty of rocks o f fine grain catalpa and cassia trees and camphor and palm trees and for decoration pearls and jade cinnabar and blue earth ochre and chalk and gold and jadeite were provided There were more than ten courtyards comprising storeyed buildings and complex halls together with deep cham bers and pavilions that towered to the clouds and a total number of  rooms fully furnished with beds quilts utensils and other articles His Majesty Emperor Wenwu also read the Bodhisattvapitaka Sutra submitted by the Master and praised it Thus he ordered the Crown Prince to write a postscript to the scripture which was written in the following words If one wished to verify the Red Book by examining obscure say ings one would be ignorant of the origin of reality If one consulted the literature written in green ink to do research into what is subtle and mystic that would not be the way of permanence and joy Yet their activities still enlarged and glorified the contents of literature and history and aroused the southeast wind blowing to the eight points of the com pass Their virtue benefited living beings and they stirred up the waves of their influence so that it rolled forward to a myriad of generations I humbly consider that His Majesty the Emperor ruling over the empire with ease as a Cakravartin King extended his edification as far as the Kukkuta Garden  and that although he is residing in his superior palace wearing his crown in an august manner he is in spiritual communication with Vulture Peak with the title of the General Guide of Men is beyond the squinting perception of intelligent men and the words of the Emperor sum up the teaching of prajna which is not comparable to the theories o f the Great Treatise and the Symbolism in the Book o f Changes Thus the teaching extended far beyond boundary markers and conveyed the voice o f the Eight Emancipations and its inculcation benefitted the whole empire comprehensively so that all people could proceed along the track of the Four Dhyanas Thereupon the three thousand Dharma worlds could be expected to cherish all living beings and a hundred kotis of Sumeru Mountains might enter the fiefs of the feudal lords to be prominent land guardians in them The water of virtue of the Nairanjana River is near the Blue Lake at the Imperial Residence and the Amravana Garden in Sravasti is connected with the exuberant wood o f Shangling Grove Although the nature of the Dharma is void and tranquil it does respond to indi vidual requests through spiritual communication and the vehicle of truth being deep and wonderful is able to shed light upon all that is dark His body is so wellproportioned and possesses such a good shape that it is beyond conception and description and if one compares it with the beauty of former monarchs they cer tainly cannot be mentioned in the same breath At the time when Heaven was separated from earth the land was limited at the drifting desert while Cathay was not bright and the divine language was hidden and undevel oped Through spiritual inspiration Emperor of the Han dynasty had a dream on a dark night and the remark able sincerity of Empress Jin caused Buddhist scriptures to be brought to the White Horse Monastery But it was merely like measuring the water in the sea with a ladle one could not reach the edges of the Four Seas by only doing this It may also be compared to peeping through a pipe how could one perceive the abstrusity of the seven stars through it When the imperial spirit spread far its prestige reached the outside of the Iron Enclosing Mountains When the Most Sacred One was clearly elucidated his virtue extended to the edges of the Diamond Ranges In as many countries as the grains of sand in the Ganges the people wear clothes and caps properly in a civilized manner and the Gate of Emancipation is open so that they can tread on the Path of Reality The stanzas in Sanskrit preserved in the Dragon Palace are surely collected on the Terrace of Purity and the Lions Roar of the Buddha as inscribed on palm leaves is stored in the Imperial Library This Sweet Dew is sprinkled to moisten all sprouts and stalks universally and this cloud of wisdom is lowered to benefit all birds and beasts Is this not a manifestation of the superior deed of taking refuge and the spiritual inspiration of His Majestys sagacious administration The Bodhisattvapitaka Sutra contains the gist of the teachings of Mahabodhi  It was by practising this Way that the Buddha realized the wisdom of nonrebirth and all Bodhisattvas who accept it and hold onto it will attain to the stage of nonretrogression It is the key to the achievement of the Six Paramitas and provides the roots and potencies of the Four Unlimited Mental States It is indeed a ford to cross to the yonder shore and a guide to the attainment of perfect enlightenment In the middle of the Zhpngnan period  Sindhu came under the politi cal influence of the Emperor who extended the use of his calendar by which the first day of each month was fixed across the hot slope and treasures were transported over the suspension bridge Since the language is similar and carriages are built with axles of the same length so that they can travel along common tracks there was no obstacle on the way After paying my respects to the Emperor I spent my leisure time in studying the precious teachings of the wonderftd Dharma with a pure heart After that the Emperors faith and friendly feeling increased day by day and he made comments on the doctrines of the Dharma He never stopped saying things about the Field of Blessedness and merits and he did not leave the Master even for a single moment Orders were issued to provide more supplies to the Master and his seasonal payments and beddings were changed for new ones from time to time After the conclusion of the summer retreat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month in the autumn a religious robe worth a hundred gold coins was presented as alms to the Master It was so dexterously made that the stitches left no trace of sewing In the palace storehouse there were many religious robes made at pre vious times but none of them were good enough So the Emperor ordered the ladies in the harem to make this one to his satisfac tion and several years were spent completing the needlework Wherever the Emperor went in his carriage on inspection tours to the four quarters he always brought along with him In the twentysecond year the Emperor favored Luoyang Palace with his presence There then were the Ven Daogong of Suzhou and the Ven Huixuan of Changzhou both persons of high character and learned in both Buddhist and worldly lore who had won the praise of the court as well as of the common people The Emperor summoned them and after their arrival they were ushered in to take seats and exchanged greetings Each of the two monks was wearing a religious robe presented by Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty to their teachers They had inherited the robes as treasures As they came to visit the Emperor they took them out and wore them Smiling at the poor quality of the robes the Emperor produced the robe and showed it to the two monks asking them to write poems in praise of it The Ven Daogongs poem reads The Field of Blessedness provides a symbol of virtue The seeds of the Holy Teaching are deeply perfumed No gold is used as thread for sewing But colors are employed to form patterns Huixuans verse are as follows If I may put it on for a moment A Field of Blessedness it is to my content By this verse he indicated that he wished to have the robe but the Emperor gave it to neither of them However he presented fifty rolls of silk to each of them This was the robe mentioned above and considering its exquisiteness it was not for an ordinary person to wear except for the Master whose high virtue qualified him to use it I Sramana Xuanzang have respectfully received the gifts of a religious robe and a razor granted by Your Majesty Special favors have been bestowed on me repeatedly and the good graces I have received from Your Majesty are great and conspicuous Facing this kindness with sense of awe and uneasiness I feel as if I were walking over ice in springtime In this robe of endurance the colors resemble the glow of sunset and the knife of wisdom is sharp enough to cut jade I shall protect myself with this robe against the evil spirit of defilement and carry the razor to break the entanglement of trouble in the mundane world I am afraid I shall arouse more sneers from other people and I fear that my shallowness of learn ing is unworthy of the glory that I venture to enjoy I feel ashamed that I rushed about from place to place without any achievement I hasten forward to bow with respect and while I cultivate my mind with an uneasy feeling my spirit soars high With a feeling of great trepidation and gratitude I am writing this letter of thanks to Your Majesty while I crouch and tremble with fear lest it disturb your serene mind During his punitive expedition to Liaodong he suffered from the vile weather the rain and frost After he returned with his troops his strength became much less vigorous than before thus he worried about his life When he met the Master he paid attention to the Eightfold Path and protected the Five Vehicles and then he recuperated and regained his health So the Emperor asked the Master W e intend to perform meritorious deeds but which is most beneficial The Master said in reply Living beings lie in delusion and without wisdom they cannot be enlightened If you would foster the sprout of wisdom the Dharma is conducive to its growth As the propagation of the Dharma depends upon men the most beneficial deed is the ordination of monks The Emperor was thus highly pleased On the first day of the ninth month in the autumn a decree was issued saying When the former Sui dynasty lost its power of governance the empire was shattered to pieces The people within the Four Seas suffered great misery with all the eight quarters in turmoil and confusion like a seething cauldron It befitted us to suppress the turbulence and we had to go in person with our troops We were frequently attacked by wind and frost and spent the night on horseback In spite of taking medicine we were not completely cured of illness Only recently have we recovered health Is it not a symbol of good fortune effected by good and beneficial deeds Each of the monasteries in the capital and the various states of the empire should ordain five monks with the exception of Hongfu Monastery which should ordain fifty Before then the monasteries in the empire had suffered destruc tion during the Sui dynasty and Buddhist monks had become almost extinct After ordination was performed once again Buddhist disciples were multiplied The Emperor again inquired The Vajracchedikaprajnaparamita Sutra is the source from which all Buddhas are bom The merit of hearing it without calumniation surpasses that of surren dering ones body in almsgiving and cannot be overtaken by offer ing as many gems and jewels as the grains of sand in the Ganges Moreover as its teaching is subtle and its wording concise most virtuous and prominent gentlemen love to hold onto it We are not sure whether the meaning of the previously translated text is fully expressed or not The Master said in reply The merit of this sutra is really as Your Majesty has remarked All the people in the West hold it dear and respect it Now I see that in the old transla tion of this sutra there are a few omissions The full title o f the text in Sanskrit is Vajracchedikdprajndpdramita Sutra but the old version simply entitled it the Vajraprajnd Sutra It is intended to explain that for a Bodhisattva discrimination is regarded as afflic tion and the delusion of discrimination is as strong as diamond Only by the wisdom of nondiscrimination that is explained in this sutra can it be cut off thus it is known as the Vajracchedikaprajndparamita Sutra From this we may know that the component part cchedika has been omitted from the title of the old translation And in the ensuing text one of the three inquiries and also one of the two verses are missing Out of the nine parables three are wanting etc The teacher Kumarajivas translation of sravasti and Bodhirucis translation of bhagavat are more or less acceptable The Emperor said Since the teacher is in possession o f the Sanskrit text we entrust Your Reverence with producing a new version so that living beings may read a full text Since what is valuable in a scripture is its teaching it is unnecessary to use polished language in contradiction to its doc trine Thus the new version of the Vajracchedikaprajhaparamita Sutra was translated according to the Sanskrit text It was pre sented to the Emperor who was very much pleased with it In the tenth month in the winter the Imperial Carriage returned to the capital and the Master also returned with it The Emperor had previously ordered the authorities to construct a separate house known as Hongfayuan House for the Propagation of the Dharma to the west of Ziwei Hall in the northern part of the imperial palace After his arrival the Master was lodged in it In the daytime the Emperor invited him to stay to engage in conver sation with him and at night he went back to his house to translate scriptures He translated Asvabhava Bodhisattvas Exposition of the Mahayanasamgraha Sastra in ten fascicles and Vasubandhus Exposition of the same work in ten fascicles as well as the Pratityasamutpada Sutra and the Satadharmavidyanikaya Sastra each in one fascicle On the first day the Crown Prince again announced an imperial decree saying The construction of the Cien Monastery is nearly completed with all its lofty splendor but there are no monks to live in it An imperial edict has been issued to ordain three hun dred monks and invite a separate group of fifty monks of great virtue to live and practise the Way at the divine abode Upon receiving the decree ordering him to be the Chief Monk of the monastery the Master wrote a letter to the Emperor to decline the appointment I Sramana Xuanzang beg to submit the following state ment I have respectfully received the imperial edict order ing me to be the Chief Monk of the Cien Monastery Upon hearing this honorable order with a feeling of deference my mind is so upset that I walked to and fro and held my breath trembling with deep fear It was depending upon the spirituality of the Emperor that I travelled far to seek the Way and what scriptures and commentaries I have obtained are to be translated under imperial order in the sincere hope that the Stream of the Dharma will gradually bring in moisture able to benefit the Throne and that the Holy Teaching will continue to spread and glorify history Formerly when I was undertaking the dangerous jour ney I was suffering from a rash for a long time rendering me as weak and exhausted as a lame jade I feared that I would not be able to fulfill my task would fail to live up to the goodness shown to me by my country and would be punished without pardon The order that I should take charge o f the monastic affairs would put me in a position of incurring reprimand just as when fish and birds changed their nature and the flying and submerging ones lost their way I humbly wish that the farsighted wisdom of Your Majesty will attend to the blessed cause of spreading the Dharma and that Your Majesty will be kind enough to stoop to consider my foolish but loyal sincerity so that this monk of the Dharma will not have to repent the fault o f declining the appointment and the fish and birds may each enjoy their own pleasures of flying or sinking under water With utmost loyalty and sincerity I am submitting this letter to express my circumstances while feeling a sense of shame increased awe and trepidation On the twentysecond day of the twelfth month an imperial edict was issued that Daozong the Prince of Jiangxia and Director of Ceremonies should command the nine palace bands and that Song Xingzhi the Magistrate of Wannian and Pei Fangyan the Magistrate of Changan should lead the musicians of their respective prefectures as well as the religious banners and canopies of various monasteries which should be arranged in an extremely grand and solemn manner On the morning of the twentythird day they assembled at the street of the Anfii Gate to welcome the Buddhas images and send the monks to the Great Cien Monas tery The procession was then arrayed in the thoroughfare It consisted of over fifteen hundred carriages with handrails deco rated with variegated silk and more than three hundred curtains and canopies as well as magicians performing jugglery amidst pendent streamers On the previous day more than two hundred pieces of embroidery and paintings of the Buddhas image two golden and silver statues of the Buddha and five hundred banners made of satin and silk gauze sewn with gold thread were brought out from the palace and sent to Hongfu Monastery for the night The scriptures images and relics of the Buddha that the Master had brought back from the western countries were then taken out of Hongfu Monastery and placed on curtained seats in various carriages that proceeded in the middle of the procession On both sides in front of the images there were big carts moving along on which were erected long poles hanging banners Behind the ban ners were the Divine King of Lions etc set as vanguards of the procession There were also fifty precious carriages to carry various monks of great virtue while the other monks in the capital holding incense and flowers and chanting praise followed behind Next came the civil and military officials accompanied by their attendants and bodyguards arranged in rows The nine bands of the Board of Ceremonies flanked both sides and the musicians of the two prefectures followed behind them The pendent streamers and banners and the bells and drums presented a riot of color in the air that dazzled the eye and produced loud noise resounding throughout the capital The Crown Prince dispatched his chief Guard Yuchi Shaozong and Deputy Chief Guard Wang Wenxun to command more than one thousand bodyguards to act as carriers The Emperor also ordered Li Qianyou the Imperial Inspector to be Grand Astrologer and assist the Marquis of Wu in supervising the procession The Emperor attended by the Crown Prince and the ladies of the harem stayed on the towerarch of the Anfu Gate with a thurible in his hand watching the procession passing by him with great delight Tens of thousands of people on the street looked on the procession When the scriptures and the Buddha images reached the gate of the monastery the Duke of Zhao and the Duke of Ying together with Chu Suiliang Chief of the Imperial Secretariat were ordered by the Emperor to receive and place them in the main hall while holding censers in their hands The nine bands played music and dancers performed the Dance of Triumph and other acrobatic feats in the courtyard When this was over they returned home On the twentysixth day  the ceremony for the ordination of monks was ready to be performed On the twentyfifth day the Crown Prince left his palace and spent the night at his old residence On the morning of the following day he came from south of the monastery with his guard of honor lined up in rows holding flags decorated with feathers fixed on poles After worshipping the Buddhas image he had an interview with fifty monks of great virtue to whom he related his purpose in building the monastery with sobs as he spoke and his sentiment affected those who were beside him None of the attending minis ters and monks did not shed tears of sympathy Considering his emotion of filial piety he might be regarded as an Emperor Shun of his time Having finished his talk with the monks he ascended the eastern pavilion of the main hall and ordered Zhang Xingcheng Deputy Manager of General Affairs to the Crown Prince to pro claim an imperial decree of amnesty to all prisoners then confined in the capital and he had hair shaved Then he watched them having their midday meal After presenting gifts of rolls of silk to the princes and dukes and those below them in rank the Crown Prince had the people cleared away and descended from the pavilion to worship the Buddha image When he came to the chamber of the Master he composed a poem with five characters to a line and pasted it on the door reading Halting my carriage to see the Hall of Bliss I looked at the imperial capital in the far distance Around the sun the Dharma Wheel is turning Touching the clouds the gorgeous canopy is fluttering The emerald mist renders the splendid pavilion fragrant Red sunset shines upon my precious raiment The colors of the rainbow on the banners are mixed far away Beyond space the hues stay separately To the Tenth Stage I have serenely attained As in myself the Triple Gem I comprehend After visiting the monastery the Crown Prince returned to his palace All of them sang his praises saying that the abstruse Way was revived that the Buddhas bequeathed Dharma would prosper again and that such an affair had never happened in ancient days or in recent times On that day an imperial decree was issued asking the Master to return to the northern palace In the fourth month of the summer in the twentythird year the Emperor favored the Cuiwei Palace with his presence and both the Crown Prince and the Master accompanied him After his arrival the Emperor besides attending to state affairs only discussed metaphysics and the Way with the Master He asked him about the law of causation and retribution as well as about the holy traces left by former sages in the Western Region The Master answered all the questions with quotations from scriptures which the Emperor accepted with deep faith he often pushed up his sleeves and remarked with a sigh We met the teacher too late so that we did not perform Buddhist affairs more extensively When the Emperor left the capital he was though slightly indisposed still filled with divine dignity and wise discernment as usual On the twentysixth day of the fifth month he suffered a slight headache and kept the Master to spend the night in the palace On the twentyseventh day he died at Hanfeng Hall but his demise was kept a secret and was not announced until his remains were brought back to the capital where his coffin was laid at the Taiji Hall On that day the ascension of the Crown Prince to the Throne took place beside the coffin his reign title was changed to Yonghui in the following year The Master returned to Cien Monastery and engaged exclu sively in his translation work without wasting a single moment He made a timetable for himself and if he did not complete his work because of the interference of some business or other in the daytime he would finish it at night He put down his pen only after the second watch When he had laid aside the scriptures he would worship the Buddhas image as a means of practising the Way until the third watch and then go to sleep for some time In the fifth watch he would get up to read the Sanskrit texts and mark out with red ink the paragraphs he would translate the following day After the midday meal and for two divisions of time in the evening every day he would lecture on the newly translated scriptures and commentaries The student monks and others from various regions always came at this time to solve their doubts and ask for elucida tion Since he was abbot of the monastery monastic affairs were also brought up for his attention Palace envoys were sent to perform meritorious deeds They made altogether ten complete sets of all scriptures as well as producing more than two hundred images of the Buddha made o f double ramie and decorated with gems When the sun had set in the evenings more than a hundred disciples in the monastery would all flock into the corridors and side rooms to seek his admonitions He would answer their questions and handle their dubious points without missing a single person Although he had to attend to the various duties that were focused on him he coped with them in a leisurely manner without confusion He also talked with the virtuous monks about the theories established by the saints and sages of the West and about the heterodox views of different schools as well as how he attended lectures at various learning centers in the capi tal when he was young He was so unusually energetic and full of vigor that he often talked eloquently in high spirits without feeling tired Several princes and ministers often came to worship the Buddha and repented o f their faults On the eighth day of the first month in the spring of the second year  Jia Dunze the governor of Yingzhou Li Daoyu the governor of Puzhou Du Shenglun the governor of Cuzhou and Xiao Rui the governor of Hengzhou who were in the capital to attend a court assembly made an appointment to visit the Master when they were free from public affairs and asked to receive the Bodhisattva Precepts The Master granted their request accord ingly He explained to them in detail the practices of a Bodhisattva and exhorted them to serve their monarch with loyalty and treat those below them with love and kindness The governors took leave of the Master and went away They offered their wellearned money and dispatched a messenger to take a letter to the Master to express their gratitude for having received the Bodhisattva Precepts They were also done for the sake of receiving the people according to their capacity of understanding and propagating the Way by means of phe nomena The one who does the deed expresses his sincere respect for the Dharma and the one who receives the deed gains the blessedness of practising almsgiving How can we say that their mind is attached to this or that or that their intention is stained by fame and profit We respectfully believe that you have planted the root of virtue in the past not merely at the time of one two or three Buddhas and that you deeply understand the aspects of the Dharma being learned in the scriptures of the Twelve Divisions You realized the true teaching by yourself and travelled far to look for holy sites visiting the pure land of Grdhrakuta Mountain and bathing in the limpid water of the Ganges You went deep into the world of the Dharma to seek good advisors collected the most excellent texts to be handed down for a hundred generations in the future and also probed into the abstruse doctrine that was advocated a thousand years ago You received officials of all grades dis regarding whether they were brilliant or unintelligent and treated them all equally without giving priority to anyone As we are unaware of the two categories of voidness we are submerged through our own deeds in the three spheres of the world just like a silkworm bound by its own silk or the winch over a well that keeps on turning without cease However we have faith in the teaching of which we have acquired comprehension and understanding take refuge in it with homage and adhere to the theory expounded by the Four Propositions We engage ourselves in meditation at secluded places while abhorring suffering and seeking per manent happiness But we were obstructed by ignorance for a long time in the past and at the present time we are in the dark about the ultimate truth not knowing that the Buddha nature is within ourselves and that external environ ments are but the reflection of consciousness Our minds are not free from grasping at theories concerning existence and nonexistence We are like wishing to cross the sea without a boat or facing a wall that obstructs our sight Yesterday as we had some spare time we were able to pay you a visit and you condescended to receive us and granted us the Bodhisattva Precepts You gave us the Dharma that we had never heard before and aroused in us the supreme mind of the Way One thought may break through the infinite and the four boundless mental states will pass into the future The seed of Bodhi arises from passions and a lotus flower growing out of fire is inadequate to compare to it Thus we begin to know that the nature of the Tathagata is none other than that of the world and that nirvana is not different from birthanddeath The practice of prajna is the nonpractice of it and the attainment of Bodhi is on the contrary nonattainment Being persons of little intelligence we have heard the Great Teaching all of a sudden accepted it reverentially and pondered on it with unlimited delight The action of dana has six meanings of which the dana of the Dharma excels all the others There are three positions of honor and the teacher occupies one of them With great compassion he benefits all living beings but he does so like the sun and moon shedding fight upon all without intention We turn up to the fight with a feeling of gratitude resembling the sunflower and the bishopwort that are sensitive to sunlight Once when the Bodhisattva heard the Dharma he sacrificed his body we can never hope to do this At the sight of the Buddha the young prince offered him a handful of earth this is an example we may venture to follow We are sending you a small gift as stated separately to express our minds of respect After accepting this small gift you may spend it as you wish just as a drop of dew added to the sea may deepen the Bohai Sea and flying dust may accumulate into a mountain as lasting and strong as Mount Sumeru is durable and enlargeable As it is still rather cold in the spring season we hope you will take proper care of yourself With homage from Jia Dunze and others He was adored like this by the worthy personages at the Imperial Court In the third month in the spring of the third year the Master intended to build a stone pagoda south of the main gate of the monastery because he feared that as human affairs were inconstant the scriptures might be lost in the course of successive changes and also as a means for preventing fire disaster The pagoda was designed to be thirty zhang in height with the inten tion of showing the magnificent foundation of the great country and in imitation of the ancient sites of Sakyamuni Buddha When the construction was about to start a report was submitted to the Emperor who ordered Li Yifu an imperial secretary to inform the Master The pagoda to be built is such a great undertaking that we are afraid it cannot be completed in a short time so it should be constructed with bricks As we also do not wish the Master to labor for it we have ordered the contribution of all the garments and other properties left by the deceased members of the imperial household including the Eastern Palace the harem and other chambers seven in all in the palace toward the construction of the pagoda Thus bricks were used for the construction and the site was shifted to the west courtyard of the monastery Each side of the base of the pagoda was  feet in length after the style o f the Western Region not following the old Chinese fashion The pagoda had five storeys and including the Wheel Sign and the Dew Basin it was  feet in height At the center of each storey there were relic bones as many as a thousand or two thousand amounting to more than ten thousand grains On the top storey was a stone chamber with two slabs on the southern side one inscribed with the Preface to the Holy Teachings o f the Tripitaka composed by the late Emperor and the other one with the Postscript written by the reigning Emperor The inscriptions were engraved in the callig raphy of Right Premier Chu Suiliang the Duke o f Henan I have admired the Dharma ever since I was a youth and have listened attentively to the words that conveyed the truth left behind by the Buddha When I heard about the religious practices of the Bodhisattva I thought of equalling him even though I am an inferior person and when I heard about the Dharma realized by the Tathagata I looked up to it both physically and mentally Thus I always esteemed what my teachers taught me and made extensive inquiries of advanced scholars It is true that envoys were sent to the West because of a dream of an Emperor of the Han dynasty and consequently the Right Dharma was transmitted to the East But as the road was obstmcted and long the transmission was incom plete Thus there arose particular controversies most of which stuck to the theories of the two categories of perma nence causing suspicion and dissidence among different parties contrary to the teaching of One Taste This made the students of later times look at one another not knowing which way to follow While I secretly prayed for spiritual protection and openly depended upon the prestige of my country I made up my mind to travel out o f the land where I was born and threw myself into the regions at the risk of almost certain death As I stayed at holy sites I paid visits to all the spiritual spots of the Buddha and wherever there were people who propagated the Dharma I would go to all of them to seek the right theories When I passed through a place I would be deeply moved to see what I had never seen before When I came across a word I would be happy to learn it if I had not learned it previously So I spent all my resources saving a portion required to sustain my life to copy texts that were missing at home How can the great events of the translation of Buddhist scriptures at White Horse Monastery in the eastern capital and at Caotang Monastery in the western capital be mentioned in the same breath with the present occasion But as living beings are shallow in fortune and have lost the one whom they venerated it is feared that the Sanskrit texts of the Tripitaka might be scattered and sink into oblivion and that the celestial com positions written by these two saintly Emperors might be left unknown without a record Therefore I formed the intention of constructing this pagoda with veneration in order to store the Sanskrit texts as well as to erect steles engraved with the inscriptions of the Preface and the Post script so that they may stand loftily forever and all the thousand Buddhas may see them as we do The Master personally carried baskets or crates to fetch bricks and stones for the construction which was completed in two years time On the twentythird day of the fifth month in the summer the most virtuous monks Jnanaprabha and Prajnadeva of Mahabodhi Monastery in Central India sent a letter to the Master Jnanaprabha thoroughly understood the teachings of both the Mahayana and Hinayana schools as well as such heretical works as the Four Vedas and the treatises of the five branches of learning Being the chief disciple of the Venerable Sllabhadra he was held in esteem by all scholars in the five regions of India Prajnadeva was erudite and well versed in the theories of the eighteen Hinayana sects and he was also respected for his virtue in giving instructions as a teacher While the Master was touring the Western Region they often exchanged views to promote learning However he gained merits in studying Hinayana theories and did not set his mind on Vaipulya texts For his obstinacy in sticking to biased views the Master always berated and denounced him At the religious assembly convened in the city of Kanyakubja he was completely frustrated in debate and admitted defeat with a sense of shame So they asked Dharmadirgha a sramana in the same monastery to send a letter together with eulogistic verses and two rolls of cotton cloth to the Master singing his praises with minds of deep veneration The letter said The abbot Prajnadeva of Mahabodhi Monastery at the Dia mond Seat of the mysterious and auspicious Worldhonored One surrounded by a multitude of learned monks begs to send this letter to the Moksacarya of the country of Mahacina who is most learned in the subtle teachings of many scriptures disciplinary texts and treatises extending to him unlimited respect and wishing that he may live in good health with the least ailment and trouble I bhiksu Prajnadeva have composed verses in praise of the Buddhas great supernatural powers as well as the wisdom of inference from the various scriptures and commentaries etc which I have handed to the bhiksu Dharmadirgha to deliver to you The old virtuous acarya Jnanaprabha of this place whose learning is unlimited also sends his greetings to you just as I said above and the upasaka Suryalabdha also prostrates himself to pay homage to you We are now sending you two rolls of white cotton cloth to indicate our remembrance of you As the way is long we hope you will not deem it a small gift but will accept it Whatever scriptures and commen taries are needed over there just give us a list and we shall make copies of the same and send them to you This shows how the Master was admired by scholars of distant lands In the second month of the spring of the fifth year Dharmadirgha took his leave to return home and asked the Master to write a reply The Master wrote a reply and prepared some tokens He made a copy of the letter and submitted it to the Emperor before he handed it to the messenger In the letter he said Bhiksu Xuanzang o f the great empire of Tang begs to send this letter to the presence of the Tripitaka Master Venerable Jnanaprabha of the Kingdom of Magadha in Central India As time passes so quickly it has been over ten years since I took leave of you Being separated from you by a long distance I have scarcely heard any news of you My remem brance of you often increases my prolonged concern about you When Bhiksu Dharmadirgha arrived he conveyed your kind regards to me and informed me that you are living happily in good health As the season is becoming warmer I wonder how you are getting on since you wrote your letter Some years back when our envoy returned home he informed me that the great teacher of the Law the Right Dharma Store had passed away to verily the Principle of Impermanence It may be said that the ferryboat on the sea of suffering has sunk and the eyes of heavenly beings and men are closed The pain of his passing away befell us so soon The Right Dharma Store had cultivated bliss long in the past and performed meritorious deeds for many kalpas thus he was endowed with an excellent nature that engen dered the qualities of simplicity and tranquillity as well as great talent that symbolized perfection and prominence He succeeded to the virtue of Aryadeva and continued the splen dor of Nagarjuna and he also rekindled the torch of wisdom and raised once again the Banner of the Dharma He extin guished the fire on the mountain of heterodoxy and dammed up the torrential current in the sea o f suffering and he also urged those who were fatigued to proceed on the way to the place of treasure and showed the Great Path to those who lost their way He also comprehensively stored in his bosom and thoroughly understood by heart such teachings as the doctrines of both the Great and the Lesser Vehicles of the Three Vehicles as well as the books of the heretics advocating the theories of annihilation or permanence He could lucidly apprehend difficult and complicated literature and clarify hidden and obscure teachings Therefore he was followed by both Buddhists and nonBuddhists who re garded him as a religious teacher of India He was good at teaching his pupils by an orderly method day and night without feeling tired His knowledge was compared to a selfreplenishing wine vessel placed at a crossroad it was inexhaustible for all who came to drink from it When I was seeking the Way some years ago I had the opportunity to receive his instructions he was so kind as to enlighten me by pointing out my ignorance When I was about to return home he gave me deep advice and admonitions His solicitous words are still sounding in my ears I hoped that he would live in good health and grow eyebrows o f longevity so as to glorify the mysterious way and I never expected that he would return to eternity so soon It is really unbearable for me to recall what has gone forever I humbly consider that you having received the teachers good instruction at an early time and being his longstanding and learned student must have had a hard time getting rid of the emotional attachment to your teacher Since this is but a phenomenal world what can we do In the past when the Great Enlightened One faded away with his brilliance Mahakasyapa succeeded him to spread the Great Cause When Sanakavasa passed away Upagupta elucidated his good Way Now that the Leader of the Dharma has returned to reality you are the person to continue his task I hope that your elegant language and wonderful eloquence in debate will always flow like the water in the Four Seas and that your adornments of bliss and wisdom will last as long as the five mountains O f the scriptures and commentaries that I have brought back I have already translated the Yogacarabhumi Sastra and other long and short texts making a total of over thirty works The translation of the Abhidharmakosa Sastra and the Abhidharmanyayanusara Sastra is not yet completed but it will be finished this year The reigning Emperor of the Great Tang Empire is enjoying every felicity with peace prevailing throughout his land With the compassion of a Cakravartin King he has spread the edification of the Buddha composed a preface with his Divine Pen to all the Chinese translations of the scriptures and commentaries and also ordered the authorities to copy them for circulation in the country Thus even neighboring states also follow and study them Although we are now at the end of the Image Period the brilliance of the Dharma is still as genial and as glorious as when it was taught in the Jetavana Garden in Sravastl I am now sending you herewith a list of the lost texts of which I request that you send me new copies by some convenient messenger Attached under separate cover is a small offering to you As the way is far I could not send you anything more And he also wrote a reply to the Venerable Prajnadeva as follows Bhiksu Xuanzang of the Great Tang Empire begs to send this letter to the Tripitaka Master Prajnadeva of Mahabodhi Monastery It has been a long time since we parted and I have been thinking of you with deep respect As no means of communication is available I have no way to comfort myself in remembering you When Bhiksu Dharmadirgha arrived he conveyed to me to my great delight your kind letter in which you inquired after my health and welfare Also received are two rolls of fine white cotton cloth and one folder of eulogistic verses as a token of deep friend ship While the season is becoming warm I do not know how your health is since you wrote me the letter I presume that since you are well versed in the theories of a hundred schools fix your mind in pondering the scriptures of the Nine Divisions raise the Banner of the Right Dharma to guide those who Fascicle VII have been converted to Buddhism beat the drum o f victory to vanquish the boastful heretics feel proud in the presence of kings and nobles and associate with people of eminent talent your life must be quite happy and pleasant When I was travelling in your country for my studies I had the chance to meet Your Reverence In the assembly con vened at Kanyakubja we held debate in the presence of various kings and hundreds and thousands of disciples to test the depth and shallowness of our arguments One side advocated Mahayana teachings while the other side sup ported the incomplete Hinayana theories In the course of argumentation the words and tones must have been high or low As we were determined to defend the truth we did not care about personal feelings often resorting to humili ating and abusive language But as soon as the meeting was over all resentment was cleared up in no time Now your messenger again conveys to me your apology in connection with that event Why do you stick so much to scruples Your Reverence is a scholar of rich learning and clear expression with a strong will and a noble character The water in Anavatapta Lake is not comparable to the amount of your learning and the stainless mani pearl cannot equal your purity Being a criterion for those who come after you you belong to the class of highminded men I hope you will strive to be a good example for the propagation of the Right Dharma The grudge I bore against you was that you did not have deep faith in them like one taking pleasure in possessing a goat cart or a deer cart while discarding a cart drawn by a white bullock or appreciating quartz instead of precious crystal As our body which is as perishable as a utensil is ephemeral and cannot last long it befits you to awaken the great mind for enlightenment and entertain the Right View at an early date so that you may not feel remorse on your deathbed Now the messenger is returning home and I am asking him to convey my respect to you Also attached is a small gift for you in token of my gratitude for your good wishes to me quite inadequate to express my deep admiration of you This I hope you will note Formerly when I was crossing the Indus on my return journey I lost a pack of scriptures I am writing separately a list of the lost texts and I hope you will kindly send me new copies of the same at your convenience As regards other matters I am unable to relate them all in detail in this letter Sent respectfully by Bhiksu Xuanzang Beginning with the Translation of the N yd ya m u k h a S a stra in the Fifth Month of the Summer in the Sixth Year of Yonghui and Ending with the Expression of Thanks by Court Officials for the Inscription Composed by the Emperor for the Monastery in the Third Month of the Spring in the First Year of Xianqing On the first day of the fifth month in the summer of the sixth year  the Master translated besides his regular work of translation the Nyayamukha Sastra He had previously trans lated the Hetuvidya Sastra while he was living at Hongfu Monas tery Each of these two treatises comprises one fascicle They are works on logic explaining the methods of argumentation or refuta tion by direct perception and inference The monks at the monastery of translation competed with one another in writing commentaries on the works The monk translator Xixuan showed the treatises to Lii Cai the Chief of the Imperial Medical Bureau who altered the reasoning pointed out strong and weak points and composed A Diagrammatic Exposition o f Proposition and Refutation in the Commentary on the Hetuvidya Sastra of which the preface reads as follows However this principle has not spread to the external world but is practised within our domain By penetrating into the principle ofym and yang  one cannot fathom its depths Has anyone ever heard that the expressions of Symbolism and the Appended Judgments also opened the gate to the Eightfold Noble Path and that before the formation of the material world the teachings of the two categories of wisdom were already propagated That is why through the application of the theories of voidness and reality one can gain double insight and by meditating on truth and convention one can realize the two tranquilities be ferried across the sea of lust by the boat of the Six Paramitas and escape from the burning house by riding on the three kinds of carts From this we may know that the Dharma power of the King of the Dharma surpasses all living beings without hindrance He enlightened himself as well as others and destroyed all evil ones while he remained alone in Awakenment When he started his karmic move ment it had the force of thunder and lightning When his cause of edification had reached its limit he vanished like fire extinguished when the fuel is consumed In view of the traces of his incarnation he seemed to show coming and going but in consideration of the Eternal Truth there is ultimately neither birth nor abiding in the world Yet as the Way of great salvation responds to those who have the cause to be saved and heavenly blessedness and illustrious virtue may reach all places however far they may be so he had his inception of life in the past with his divine light only seen in days of yore They extended their prestige and influence without limitation and standardized the method of writing as well as the length of axletrees of carriages for common use in all coun tries under the sky Thus they offered sacrifices to a hundred kotis of Sumeru Mountains and allowed the three thousand Dharma worlds to enjoy the benefit of imperial influence Thus people coming from the five parts of India were asked to change their simple garments in the guesthouse on Gao Street  and the eighteen books of the Veda were translated from the Sanskrit into Chinese in the Impe rial Library Now there is the Venerable Xuanzang the Tripitaka Master who may be said to be the Sakyamuni of our present age Having innate intelligence and wisdom being a learned scholar of versatility pure in virtue and deed and studying the disciplinary rules hard he is indeed a pillar of the Triple Gem and a leader of the four groups of Buddhist followers It was lucky for him that Heaven and earth were in har mony and no disturbance raised dust within the Four Seas so that he was able to start his journey to the Great Desert and reach the Pamir Ranges to shake his travelling staff with pewter rings Thus he reached the source of the River in the Western Region and crossed the Ganges east of Kapilavastu He collected palm leaf scriptures at Grdhrakuta Mountain and got a glimpse of the texts of Golden Words at the Crane Grove He visited the capitals of more than a hundred countries where he obtained nearly seven hundred books of scriptures and commentaries which were carried by relays of carriages from garrison stations and brought back to the imperial capital Thus he was able to present the texts to His Majesty and explain the supreme doctrine to him face to face This Hetuvidya Sastra is one of the Sanskrit texts obtained by the Tripitaka Master Its principles include the teachings of all of the Three Vehicles and the matters it cites comprise a hundred dharmas It does research into the essence of the doctrines o f voidness and reality and elaborates the teach ings of both Buddhist and nonBuddhist schools Its wording is however concise its reasoning is comprehensive and its style of writing is truly subtle although its meanings are obvious A student cannot grasp its abstrusity in one life time and those who are interested in studying it for several years cannot fathom its origin As it is the gate to all mystic teachings it has been translated first There were then the Dharma teachers Shentai Jingmai Mingjue and others who were all men of divine intelli gence with high aspirations and noble deeds well versed in various scriptures and having such understanding and com prehension They were ordered by a special decree of the Emperor to take part later than the others in the Dharma congregation Thus they had the opportunity to derive bene fit from the Master by listening to his instructions while holding texts in their hands Being adept at preaching the Dharma the Tripitaka Master thoroughly expounded theTranslation Work mystic and profound teachings in a marvelous manner Thus the Venerable Shentai and the others recorded what they had heard each in his own way in explanation of the lectures When the expository comments were finalized they were ready to be published for circulation but most of the people did not have a good chance to read them Now the Dharma teacher Xixuan has been an old friend of mine since we were young Formerly when I was living in seclusion on Song Mountain I once set foot at the outer entrance of the monastery After coming to serve as an official in the imperial capital I still lived in a cramped abode in a mean alley It has been more than thirty years since I cultivated the allembracing virtues We two being bosom friends are sincere in being earnest and urging each other in a perfect manner But the Dharma teacher is refined and pure in moral integrity and his observance of the disciplinary rules is as stainless as ice and frost What he has learned is aimed at achieving the Ekayana the One Vehicle and his actions are confined within the scope stipu lated in the Sarvastivada Vinaya On seeing that he was living a simple and ascetic life I often urged him to change his way of living according to the principles of permission and prohibition The teacher calmly said to me Munificent man you have stud ied the Six Classics and probed into the abstruse theories of a hundred schools You can prognosticate unseasonable weather by calculating the principles of yin and yang and discern the slightest deviations in music I have also heard that you had never read the Great Mystery Classic Tai Xuan Jing but could explain it instantly when the Emperor inquired about it and that you had never glanced at chess but tried to make a set of chessmen in ten days With utmost effort I probed into its pro found theories and endeavored to acquire the subtle gist through comparison and inference Afterward I also borrowed the theoretical commentaries of the three teachers and made further studies Although the various teachers explana tions are deep and rich in meaning and their literary style has unity and coherence they make contradictory remarks because they hold to different points of view Even what the Buddha taught in his one voice was understood in different ways by various types of people so why should a layman clad in white be excluded from the category of living beings In my spare time when I was free from public affairs I wrote this commentary in which I follow the good opinions of the three teachers as explained in their works but refute their doubtful views with my own standpoint Divided into three fascicles it is entitled Annotated Commentary on Theoreti cal Proposition and Refutation For the elucidation of these obscure languages and of theories that are somewhat difficult to perceive I have also drawn a theoretical diagram for the purpose of making comparative studies with the text Since the treatise is unintel ligible to outsiders nowhere could one get an interpretation on the highway If people say that I know it inherently that is certainly not my expectation But in the matter of learn ing one who does not need a second inquiry may be con sidered a Transmitter of the Lamp  and one who knows ten points of the subject after having heard only one may be said to be near to perfection Moreover as I did not study it with a teacher my annotations cannot be without errors and incoherences I have heard that when a yaksa of the Snow Mountains spoke on the law of birthanddeath the wild animals in the countryside were so delighted that they remarked that they had never heard it before If what he said was reasonable he would win the respect and homage of heavenly beings and immortals I hope what I write in my annotations will be almost like that If you teachers can forget about my mean and low position like that of a fox fairy and a ghost and reflect on the significance of those passages that are valuable selecting the good points to follow them disregarding whether they are written by a religious or a secular person then the Tathagatas Way will not fall to the ground and many people will propagate it How can there be any immutability in this matter If you insist on the idea of a permanent ego and your theories do not discern right from wrong then I will still avoid the two extremities  On the first day of the seventh month in the autumn the monk translator Huili feeling concern on hearing about this matter wrote a letter to Left Premier Yu  the Duke o f the State of Yan to discuss the pros and cons of the issue as follows I Huili have heard that in establishing his teachings the Buddha used classic language with abstruse meanings to explain deep and subtle doctrines that were as expansive as the dome of the sky and similar in vastness to the blue sea When one talks about the nature and form of tathata  one is bewildered even if one has attained to the Tenth Stage  When one speaks about the causation of a little grass one is ignorant o f it even if one is free from rebirth Moreover when one is entangled in the net of the Eight Erroneous Practices and submerged in the stream of the Four Inverted Views is it not absurd if one should wish to penetrate syllogisms consisting of proposi tion reason and thereby distinguish simi larity and dissimilarity and make them manifest The holy scriptures he has translated amount to more than three hundred scrolls among which is a short treatise entitled Hetuvidya which is a guidebook to methods of argumentation and narrates the rules for refuting erro neous views Although it is not an essential and mystic text of the profound teachings of Buddhism it cannot be under stood in a hurry I have recently heard that Lii Cai Chief of the Imperial Medical Bureau with his mediocre talent has plagiarized the theories of various teachers and composed the Diagram o f Hetuvidya for the exposition of the mean ings of logic Being unable to understand it accurately he is likely to cause heterodox views In order to seek fame improperly he gives strained interpretations in a wrong way He denies the right sayings of virtuous men and allows his selfconceit to lead him to biased views He would try to flaunt his learning in the presence of nobles and people of high rank and make a clamorous display of himself by the side of the street brazenly and without shame not feeling tired of it As the Chief of the Imperial Medical Bureau was somewhat familiar with worldly affairs he thought that he could also understand the truth of religion just like a house mouse saying that it was not difficult to climb over Langfeng Peak in the Kunlun Mountains when it saw that it could ascend the cooking oven or a spider that seeing that it could easily make a net over a thornbush thought that it could also enmesh the giant mulberry not considering the limits of its ability I have also heard that ultrasound makes scarcely any noise and that a man of great eloquence is slow in speech Again Shudu enjoyed fame as great as the ocean and Yuanli had the reputation of being an exemplary person yet I never heard that they praised themselves to win the commenda tion of government officials With this letter from Huili the matter was settled On the first day of the tenth month in the winter having heard that the matter was settled Liu Xuan an official scholar of the Board of Rites composed A Letter o f Homage in Verse to inspire the monks who took part in the translation of the scriptures as follows Homage to all Buddhas May they protect us with divine powers One who sinks in darkness without awakening Should return to complete enlightenment In the sea of desire one has long been submerged There is scarcely a boat with oars for crossing When variant views are in disagreement One should depend upon harmonization And be free from existence and attachment In order to reason without faults and selfcontradiction Arrogant and perverse views of the Eightfold Noble Path Will lead one astray into a hundred evil ways Grasping and rejecting of desire are mixed in argument Defilement and purity are put in confusion Gold should be picked out and rubble discarded Jade needs to be carved to increase its brilliance Since he has achieved the Great Way Who dares to defame him Forthright words will sublimate virtue Sycophancy causes gradual downfall I hope you will listen to my words So as to develop the meanings May you show sympathy with my truthfulness And grant me in return your admonitions The tree of the Buddha cast its shade in the West and the shadow of enlightenment covered the East This happened during the Han and Wei dynasties Under the rule of the houses of Fu and Yao it flourished with great brilliance Since then eminent monks have emerged one after another virtuous and sagacious people followed one another in succession the Sun of Wisdom always hung high and the Wheel of the Dharma rotated constantly A separate branch stretched far to Luofu and recently Buddhatunga appeared in the states of Zhao and Wei where he spoke in a brief manner and behaved with uncompromising uprightness that cannot be related in detail They debated nothing else but the theories of voidness and existence as taught by the Ekayana or they discussed the suffering and the cause of suffering the Four Noble Truths To understand the meaning of existence through verbal exposition cannot release one from conditioned exist ence One has to cease talking about the Way to comprehend it in order to realize the state of absolute quietude If one clings to abstrusity to seek for abstrusity that abstrusity is not the theory of abstrusity If one forgets about abstrusity because it is abstrusity that abstrusity may be the meaning of abstrusity Once variant opinions were expressed by words viewpoints on right and wrong rose in swarms one party fighting against another just as in a war in which the defeated held his breath tight while the winner voiced his first triumph Thus we esteem the conquest of Mara and the subjugation of various heretics If it were not for dauntless eloquence and adroit refutation of challenging questions the heretics and the like would be noisily arrogant and put us to shame Therefore we should fix our mind on under standing the Way and maintain absolute control over all good and evil influences so as to raise high the Banner of the Dharma and beat loudly the drums of the Dharma When the banner and drum are properly set up the antago nists will be crushed and since the Wheel of Dharma is in rotation what force will not be subjugated If a man lowered his banner on sight of the enemy at a distance and rebutted challenging queries with irrelevant words it would be impos sible for him to propagate the Triple Gem Lii Cai the Chief of the Imperial Medical Bureau has entered the gate of the theories of voidness and existence and is galloping along the Path of Right View What he has learned and practised is similar to that of the past sages and his understanding of the subtle teachings is equal to that of philosophers in bygone days His purpose is to spread the Buddha Dharma and to approve or disapprove the Commentary on Hetuvidya One must approve the strong points of correct views and it is reason able to point out the shortcomings of incorrect ones Now I see that all the monks who are assembled here are trying to derive benefit from other peoples knowledge as one gets a grindstone from another mountain to carve ones own jade into a vessel All o f them listened attentively to his words which were as fluent as water flowing out of a bottle with the hope wiping away the source of ambition and remorse and dissolving the accumu lation of doubts and resentment Upon hearing about this statement Li Chunfeng the Court Astronomer wrote me the following letter I your servant cherish the Right Path in my mind My deeds are in connection with the refuge in the Triple Gem regarding substantial wisdom as the mystical embodiment of the Great Enlightened One and non action as the Dharmabody of the Buddha the Guide of Men But the bright sun glorifying the sky actually aids the function of Heaven and the sagely monks who expound the Dharma really support the wonderful Way of the Teacher of Men and Heavenly Beings This is what I believe and accept and it is where I rest my mind I dare not however take a piece of yellow leaf for gold or a pheasant for a phoenix It has been nearly two thousand years since at the Crane Grove As the Right Dharma started declining the Final Period of the Dharma has commenced when abstruse teaching is depressed and unmanifest and the Way of enlighten ment is going to sink into oblivion The Master Xuanzang who practised dhuta moral ity in the Dharma world travelled far to Kapilavastu saw the Bodhi tree as well as the Hiranyavati River beheld the seven places where the Avatamsaka Sutra was preached in eight assemblies visited in person the city of Vaisall and Vulture Peak in that country and testified to the authenticity of the sala trees where the Buddha passed away and of the Precious Staircase by which the Buddha once descended from the Tusita Heaven As for his journey to Rajagrha Dantaloka Mountain the Ganges etc it is not easy to relate them all in full All the famous monks of the Western Region discussed the theories of prajna with him and he inquired of those teachers to solve the doubts and questions he had entertained in the Eastern Land He observed the Vinaya Pitaka without negligence and always understood the full meaning of the Abhidharma through insight He has obtained the sutras through oral transmission and had his doubts and knotty points solved by Supreme Enlightenment All Dharmas whether great or small are contained in his bosom and all theories deep and shallow are comprehended by his keen deliberation Therefore the title of Tripitaka Master is reverentially conferred on him in Cathay while he is commonly known as Mahayanadeva in Kapilavastu Lii however is a versatile scholar who is proficient in the theoretical principles and knows well the crucial importance of words and deeds which may produce either good or bad effects As regards theTranslation Work protection of the Buddha Dharma he knew it inher ently his unhindered eloquence was not acquired by learning and practice But as the meaning of the Hetuvidya is obscure there arose diverse interpretations just as a group of blind men who grope at different parts of an elephant get variant ideas of the shape of the animal or as cooked rice collected in the same alms bowl may have various colors Lii per sists in his own views both monks and lay people are looking forward to a decisive opinion When autumn frost has fallen  one listens attentively to the toll of a bell to count his last days Since the Cloud of Dharma has spread in the sky thunder has seldom crashed But a donkey is incapable of being treaded on and trampled by a dragonelephant just as a layman is not expected to set foot in the secluded living quarters of a monk I venture to attach my humble note  Please do not feel annoyed by it If there is any obscurity or doubt I hope you will seek the advice of the Tripitaka Master to give a judgement If you will show and transmit what teach ings you have received to the four groups of Buddhist followers then the Right Way may prosper and be free from destruction and obstruction forever What exceeds this limit is beyond the scope of my knowledge Expressed with homage from your disciple Liu Xuan A respectable good teacher he is Who actually guides all deluded beings A hundred rivers with mild waves flowing Being of the same taste are swallowed at one gulp The eightfold wrong path is spreading fast One strives for fame with a verse of four lines Distorting what is right covering up mistakes And suppressing the important in favor of triviality But ice melts under the shining sun And water becomes clean when a pearl is put in The supreme virtue is manifested The embodiment of the Way rests upon moral integrity Even if he is praised or disparaged He would not be moved by derogation or sublimity Lofty is the sage of reverence The one who is abundant in sentience Let us wait for one who is allknowing To balance the right and wrong of things When one goes into it to see its elegance is it not truly so What a pity the sea of desire has waves running high to the sky and the mountain of heresy is as lofty as the sun Those who hold the conception of an individual soul will fall and topple down without stopping and those who rely on the bondage of pride will sink into endlessly Thus those who held the sixtytwo views strove to find shelters in which to lodge themselves and the ninetyfive types of heretics prostrated themselves one after another and forgot to return home With great compassion as his original vow the Tathagata forgetting about secondary causes conde scended to respond to them Internally he perfected the four wisdoms and externally he revealed the six supernatural powers Employing the Ten Powers he subjugated the heav enly demons Speaking aloud in seven eloquent ways he defeated the heretics in argument He pointed out the causes and showed the effects reverting to the root and returning to the origin of things So great is the function of compassion and wisdom that it is not describable by words Formerly when he ascended the seat under the Bodhi tree his prestige and edification spread to over a hundred kotis of people When he ceased his activities in the grove of sala trees his bequeathed teachings were promoted in the Three Thousand Worlds When the Sun of the Buddha sank in the West with its remnant radiance shining upon the East the auspice of a bright light indicating the exist ence of the Buddha was seen on a night during the Zhou dynasty They translated the scriptures to spread the Dharma saved the people of their times with supernatural power subdued heretics with their brilliant views and rested their minds in quiet meditation Consulting nobody but himself accompanied by his own shadow he shook his robe and held a religious staff in hand to start his journey to search for the origin of the Way The defective texts of the bequeathed teachings are being made complete in his day and the perfect theories of the Vaipulya school are spread more exten sively than former sages in the past The superior theories he has expounded are the most wonderful in the center of the world The real nature of true voidness extends to the outside of the universe Because one has the desire to grasp  this grasping causes one to lose the truth If one seeks truth from nothingness that nothingness will spoil reality If one removes the traces of the two extremes and forgets about the Middle Way one cannot easily reach the depth of truth even if one repeat edly tries to do so If one lays emphasis on voidness how can one attain ultimate truth How important and wonderful it is It is profound and great indeed When it is engraved on the mind then it is regarded as the Dharma In the mind it is the Dharma and uttered in words it is teaching Dharma has individual as well as common aspects and teaching is negative or positive expositions How can one get a system atic understanding of such pure gists and abstract teach ings in a hurry The Master concentrated his spirit and made use of his wisdom to study the root in detail in order to put right the branches He shed light on the abstruse texts and widely opened his mind He kept secret the rare voice which responds in big or small volume according to the strength of the striker Thus men of great virtue from different quarters and eminent monks of various regions were convinced of his knowledge Since he has drunk from the river of knowledge until his abdomen was full his depth of learning is unfathomable One would be amazed to listen to his remarkable utterances not knowing how far they could reach As regards the small way of Hetuvidya its direct knowledge and inference are but a mere method to guide beginners and a standard for establishing a thesis As for the pivot of spiritual abstrusity the secret key to truth and the wonderful root of achievement they are all related in profound texts and are not to be mentioned here He raised a high wind in the garden of argumentation and displayed his glorious brilliance in the forest of eminent scholars with his head held high up to the clouds as a leading figure in the capital Having mastered all strategies he still had ample time to pay admiring respect to Mahayana teachings in which he had inherent and sincere faith Once he had a jocular talk with his friends They incidentally came to the subject of Hetuvidya but he disregarded what his teacher had taught him and gave strained interpretations in discreetly refuting all the commentaries one by one point ing out their defects and finding fault with them He pronounced his views at court and rashly put them into writing As far as his ambition is concerned it is unsur passed but when his knowledge is examined it is really doubtful This treatise of his is complete in one fascicle consisting of five pieces of paper in which all three commentaries are studied in full detail he having read them through once He raises forty objections without mentioning a single correct point of his own He says nothing right himself but he says he is right The commentaries have nothing wrong in them but he would say they are wrong What he says is wrong is not wrong and what he says is right is not right Since what he says is right is not right it is always wrong Since what he says is wrong is not wrong it is always right As what he condemns as wrong is always right it is right but not because he says it is right As what he justifies as right is always wrong it is wrong but not because he says it is wrong It was because of such derogatory views that he incurred censure upon himself Moreover cause has two aspects the producing cause and the illuminating cause but he grasps one entity forgetting about the two functions Both the illuminator and the illuminated are given one name which makes one perplexed about the two entities Again of the two component parts the subject and predi cate of a proposition he retains the subject while giving up the predicate as the proposition As for the substantial meaning of the example and the object on which the example depends he rejects the substantial meaning while keeping the object on which the example depends as the example Due to these two systems of thought there arose many doubtful views groundlessly and the confusion of a conclu sion accepted by both parties in argumentation would cause the seven confutations in a wrong way Although he praises the two treatises to the utmost he regards his own mind as his teacher misunderstanding the context of the sentences and pronouncing the words in mistaken tones He also mistakes the Samkhya Sastra for the Sabda Sastra and cites the City of Birth as the City of Death This not only is contrary to the separation or combination of the proposition and the reason but also deviates from the sequence of the antecedent and the consequent  He also tries to use vulgar words and erroneous rhymes to trans literate original Sanskrit terms Although he widely cites the seven norm cases they are simply equal to one case in the Sanskrit language He does not mention the eighth case the vocative Where did these arbitrary errors and absurd mistakes come from Moreover the Vaisesika school holds that the atoms are permanent and infinite in number but infinitesimal in body In time they gradually amalgamated and produced many offspring atoms the number of which decreased to half of the original atoms while their bodies became twice as large as those of their parents In the end their bodies pervaded the great chiliocosm but tracing to the ultimate limit their number is only one Lii cites the Appended Judgements in the Book o f Changes The Supreme Ultimate engenders the two Primal Forces yin and yang These two Primal Forces give rise to the Four Forms which in turn give rise to the Eight Tri grams from which all things are created He remarks that this saying is different in language but the same in meaning  If the citation of similarities is intended to show off erudition what if the connotations are perver sive Suppose a good example is cited to exemplify a similar concept of production but the elucidation is the same as that of heterodox views How can one mix the right with the wrong just for the sake of winning the praise of ones contemporaries Unless one bears a personal grudge against somebody why should one go so far as this All of Mr Liis errors and confusions cannot be fully related His awkward position is caused simply by his own imprudence Since the roots are not upright the branches and leaves will naturally fall to one side From mistakes arise doubts and the doubts lead to perplexity Can one expect to see a crooked object casting a straight shadow I am just giving two or three examples so that one may get a general idea As the deep errors are manifold rejoinders will be given separately In the manifestation of truth and convention difficulty and ease are as different as clouds and mud low down on the earth The Buddhas teachings have spread far to the prominent regions of Chu and Yue where the Right Dharma is firmly established like a burning furnace that cannot be quenched with a handful of snow or like the Bohai Sea which cannot be crossed by a boat built with glue Li the Court Astronomer has immersed his mind in what is abstruse and cherishes in his bosom what is remote and farreaching He is specially versed in the Nine Princi ples of Mathematics and has comprehensively studied divi nation with the six lines of a hexagram He has made extensive researches into ancient texts and has observed the color of clouds to augur things while despising Wei Hong for his loss of propriety and disdaining Pi Zhao for his unskill fulness His spirit is unobstructed and it is in this that his reputation lies Liis discus sions on other subjects he has also made further inquiries considering ultimate reality as the mystical embodiment of the Great Enlightened One and nonaction as the Dharmabody of the Guide of Men This means that through faith in the unconscious impression of virtuous deeds one has culti vated one may gain partial realization of truth it can never be achieved spontaneously after all I am very much afraid that your words may be seemingly good with contrary mean ings and that your expressions are Philistine with obscure purposes As regards the mystic Way of the heavenly teacher I hope you will reconsider it Moreover the heavenly teacher Kou was specially recommended to the court by Mr What more can be said to show that they caused the disaster together Although they did not indiscriminately mix the water of the Zi and Sheng Rivers they did confuse gold and brass You shield yourself with benevolence and righteousness and treat people accord ing to the pivotal rules of conduct of a gentleman Solemnly and magnanimously your unbending moral integrity soars high up to the clouds and your pure and simple benefitting spirit pacifies the earth Your good reputation has spread in literary circles and you stand as a principal figure in the assembly of scholars You have collected the principles of the Nine Categories of the Great Law of Governance and have made detailed researches into the theories of the two Dais  As for the three hundred rules of the Regular Rites and the three thousand Minor Rules of Conduct you can understand all of their meanings as easily as you can point to your palm the matter is as simple as bending down to pick up a thing Thus the satiric poem Xiangshu criticizing improper man ners is heard no more among the people and the eulogistic ode Yuli is now filling the ears of the court Your fame matches your deeds perfectly well The sincerity of your honesty and piety is inherited from innate endowment You have always truly cherished the mind of spreading and protecting  and so in this clamorous argument you also share the feeling of shame and compunction Therefore you could have cast away your calling cards to live a retired life in seclusion and forbear erroneous views in order to glorify the Great Teach ing If you were not a talented man well versed in both Buddhist and nonBuddhist lore illuminating the darkness of the neighboring regions how could you dispel evil and encourage good as well as rectify vulgarity and preserve truth Formerly the Venerable Kumarajiva had three thou sand disciples who submitted themselves to the Way In the present congregation there are as many men of the same virtue as people in the market I a poor mediocre and incompetent monk have been privileged to take a back seat in the assembly Although I am happy to have heard about the Way in the morning I am ashamed that I still have to be active and vigilant up to the evening It is well known that all three virtuous monks who wrote the commentaries were thoroughly learned in the teachings of the Five Vehi cles Their wall of knowledge was a fathom high hard to peep over Their words were as lofty as peaks that are difficult to look up to If the shangyang bird is dancing on one foot  one will surely be graced by the benefit of moisture and humidity but a sudden peal of thunder may leave one no time to cover ones ears It is said by all that the ancients remarked that a bird may fold its wings and perch on branch so it need not confine itself in a forest created by a divine being and that a pond is deep enough for a fish to sink down in so it need not wait until it is in the blue sea Therefore without considering my stupidity and weakness I have been obliged to examine what is false As I am not spared the task in spite of my decline I present this statement in a rough outline Although the style of writing is poor the content may be readable Looking at my own mediocrity and incompetence simply increases my trembling with shame I am just giving a response to the sayings that have been pointed out I have nothing more to express Stated by Shi Mingjun On the seventh day  when Xuan received the letter he again incited Lvi  Chief of the Imperial Medical Bureau who consequently reported the matter to the Emperor The Emperor ordered that a group of ministers and scholars be dispatched to Cien Monastery to invite the Tripitaka Master to hold a decisive debate with the revered Mr Lti had a weak case and withdrew with an apology On the first day of the first month in the spring of the first year of Xianqing  Zhong the Crown Prince considering that he was not an offspring of the Empress and not daring to occupy the position of Crown Prince for long followed the example of Taibo and submitted memorials once and again to the Emperor asking to retire from his position The great Emperor consented and made him the Prince of Liang with a grant of ten thousand gift articles and a magnificent mansion of the first grade In the same month Hong the Prince of Dai was appointed Heir Apparent On the twentythird day a feast to entertain five thousand monks in honor of the Crown Prince was prepared in the Great Cien Monastery Each of the monks was offered a gift of three pieces of linen and silk while courtiers were dispatched by order of the Emperor to offer incense in the monastery When Xue Yuanchao a palace attendant and Li Yifu an imperial secretary visited the Master on that occasion they asked him The transla tion of Buddhist texts is indeed a good task for the Gate of the Dharma but we do not know what else could be done for its glorification We also do not know in what manner the translation work was achieved in ancient times The Master said in reply As the Dharma Pitaka is abstruse and profound it is really hard to elucidate it at full length How ever it depends upon the Sakya monks for the exposition of its inner meaning and for its safekeeping while its external protec tion and establishment rest on Emperors and kings Just as a boat that sails on the sea may travel a thousand li or the kudzu vine that twines upon a pine tree may stand a myriad fathoms high it must depend upon favorable conditions to be able to extend its benefits widely Now as the Han and Wei dynasties have lasted a long time we need not discuss them here in detail Besides the monks the lords and ministers also supported the task At the time of Fu Jian Dharmanandi translated scriptures with Zhao Zheng a palace attendant as his amanuensis At the time of Yao Xing when Kumarajiva translated scriptures both the Lord of Yao and Yao Song the Marquis of Ancheng served as amanuenses During the Later Wei dynasty when Bodhiruci translated scriptures Cui Guang the Premier acted as amanuensis and composed a preface to the translated texts Such was the case during the Qi Liang Zhou and Sui dynasties At the beginning of the Zhenguan period  when Prabharana translated scriptures Fang Xuanling the Left premier Li Xiaogong the Prince of the Prefecture of Zhao Du Zhenglun Chief Chamberlain to the Crown Prince and Xiao Jing the Impe rial Treasurer were ordered to supervise and pay scrupulous attention to the compilation But now we do not have such a system Moreover this Cien Monastery has been constructed by order of the present Emperor in memory of his deceased mother the Holy Empress of Cultural Virtue If you gentlemen would send word to the Emperor this good idea could be realized The two honorable officials consented and went away On the following day when they attended the court they submitted a report on behalf of the Master and the heavenly Emperor granted him all his requests It is befitting to appoint Yu Zhining Grand Tutor to the Crown Prince Cabi net Minister Left Premier and the Duke of the State of Yan Lai Ji Chief of the Imperial Secretariat concurrently Min ister of the Board of Official Personnel Affairs with the rank of Imperial Inspector and the Statefounding Baron of Nanyang County Xu Jingzong Minister of the Board of Rites and Statefounding Baron of Gaoyang County Xue Yuanchao Acting Palace Attendant concurrently Left Attendant to the Crown Prince with the rank of Imperial Inspector and Statefounding Baron of Fenyang County Li Yifu Acting Deputy Chief of the Imperial Secretariat concurrently Right Attendant with the rank of Imperial Inspector and Statefounding Baron of Guangping County Du Zhenglun Deputy Chief of the Imperial Secretariat and some others to read the translations from time to time If scholars are needed two or three persons may be coopted to meet the requirements When the interview was over the Emperor sent the eunuch Wang Junde to dispatch the message to the Master saying As Your Reverence needed men of letters to assist you in translating the scriptures we have instructed Yu Zhining and others to go to you As regards the slab inscription we wish to compose it with our own hands We do not know whether this is satisfactory to you or not We are just sending you this information Upon receiving this imperial decree which satisfied the Mas ters longcherished desire he felt moved and happy in the pres ence of the messenger and could not refrain from shedding tears of gratitude On the following day he went with his disciples to the court to present a letter of thanks to the Emperor Original note the text of the letter has been lost In the second month there was a bhiksuni named Baocheng who had been a lady official under Emperor Gaozu posthumously honored as Emperor Shengyao She was a daughter of Xue Daoheng Governor of Xiangzhou and Duke of Linghe of the Sui dynasty Her father was a scholar renowned for his learning and she did not deviate from the family tradition of education She mastered the classics and also possessed good literary talent When the great Emperor was young he studied under her When he ascended the Throne he showed his gratitude to her as his old tutoress by conferring upon her with great respect the title of the Lady of Medong Prefecture As the Lady desired to become a mm the Emperor fulfilled her wishes and specially built the Helin Nunnery in the Forbidden Palace for her resi dence with a slab inscription erected to record her virtues Sev eral scores of people were also permitted to be her attendants The four requisites were provided for them by the government so that they might be ready to receive full ordination On the tenth day of the second month an imperial decree was issued to invite the Master to proceed to Helin Nunnery to ordain the Lady of Hedong Prefecture the Xue bhiksuni and to bring with him nine virtuous monks each one waited upon by an attendant It was also ordered that ten preciously decorated carriages and ten carriages for musicians should wait inside the Jingyao Gate Horses had previously been sent to the monastery to welcome the monks and when they reached the city gate they were invited to ride in the carriages to proceed forward The carriages for the monks went in front and those for the musicians followed behind As it was in the second month of the spring season the scenery was beautiful and splendid with green willow leaves and pink peach flowers as well as blue pine trees wrapped in a mist of jasper color An altar was erected to ordain Baocheng and more than fifty others The Master alone was the crya  the other monks were merely witnesses to the ceremony which lasted for three days When the ordination ceremony was over a skillful artisan Wu Zhimin was asked to draw portraits of the ten teachers to be kept and venerated Beside the Helin Nunnery there was the Deye Nunnery which had been built previously and had several hundred bhiksunls living in it They also requested that the Master confer on them the Bodhisattva Precepts and so he went to the Deye Nunnery After the function was completed he took his leave and returned to his own monastery with the rich alms that had been offered to him The Emperor ordered the eunuch Wang Junde to lead some ser vants holding a gorgeous umbrella to escort the Master Later the Helin Nunnery changed its name to the Longguo Nunneiy Shortly afterward the Emperor completed his composition of the inscription He ordered Zhangsun Wuji the Lord of Military Affairs to show it to all the noblemen We have heard that at the commencement of the constitu tion of the universe and at the beginning of the creation of all things nothing was not carried on the earth and covered under the dome of Heaven But the two luminaries shining in the sky are unfathomable in their waxing and waning phases and it is impossible to get to the limit of the billows in the Four Seas flowing over the earth Moreover the Gate of the Dharma is profound and quiet and it manifests its existence before its nondestruction The Holy Teaching is allembracing and shows its form beyond formlessness Thus the light of the Way shines through kalpas as numerous as atoms in the world to edify all living beings comprehensively Light issued from the divine pond and the trees bent their branches low in the air He pronounced the Voice of Virtue at the Deer Park and met various men of learning in the Dragon Palace blessing those beings who had committed sins and invigorating a genera tion of men that were on the decline In order to enable the ignorant of the lowest class to imbibe the Way he broke his bones at a cemetery in the wilderness The silky rain of the Dharma quenched the flames of the house on fire and the Sun of Wisdom rolled up high and illumined the deep darkness of midnight to bring in the light of day The essence of negativity however abruptly obscured the moon whose light of righteousness was hidden forever The maternal connection was cut off with its out standing events sunk into oblivion eternally When her toilet mirror is stroked our feeling of sorrow is increased and we wish to ascend the barren hill to look around but where could we find any trace of her In old times Zhong You heaved a sigh of sadness at the sight of his emolument of one thousand zhong of millet reminding him of his mother who died poor and Yuqiu suffered grief over his three losses Therefore we intended to construct a memorial building and so this monastery has been established like one paved with gold on the ground At its back is a suburb the Bin District where a thousand estates dot the brocadelike scenery of trees while in the front it faces the Zhongnan Mountains with peaks spurting out like lotus flowers to the height of a hundred fathoms On the left side are eight rivers the waters of which formed lakes shining like mirrors scattered over the earth On the right side it adjoins the highway that reaches nine localities and moving along it are carriages with canopies of feathers so tall as to touch the clouds It overbears the inner area of the Land of Heaven and is credibly a superior spot in the Upper Capital It displays engraved long corridors winding away to a far distance and it has gorgeous pavilions rising up high in the air The Morning Crow emerging in the rosy clouds shines upon the Palace of the Sun with variegated hues and the New Rabbit appearing in the clear sky illuminates the Hall of the Moon with lucid brilliance The paths are perfumed by autumn orchids wisteria hangs in the courtyard where trees are sparse osmanthus renders the rocks fragrant in the winter and the windows are closely covered with clus ters of red blooms The lamps are brightly lit producing many puffs and flames bum on the craneshaped lampstands in the midst of smoke Streamers mark the distant spires of pagodas and their colors entangle the rainbow beyond the sky The flights of steps are irregular and mois tened with dew resting on jade with a fine grain The light curtains roll back and forth with their nets shrunk into the shape of dimples and strings of pearls The low hills are reddened by the rosy dawn and over the ponds floats the green o f the quiet mist The tinkling of jade pendants har monizes with the sound of evening bells and the gentle breeze mingles with voices chanting Sanskrit stanzas in the morning Not only is the Heavenly Palace of Accumulated Fragrance shamefully inferior in splendor but the abodes of the immortals on Langfeng Mountain are also regretfully less exquisite in carved ornamentation We have the Venerable Xuanzang who is really the crown of understanding of the truth of Suchness Being a man of quiet and dignified bearing he is like a cool breeze blowing gently over a tall pine tree His resplendent thoughts are multifarious resembling beautiful clouds reaching as far as the Milky Way and his wisdom that surpasses the present age and discerns ancient times is inherent while his sincere wish to foster tranquillity and cherish truth was aroused when he was a child An outstanding figure of his generation he has excelled Daosheng and Huiyuan and glorified previous ages and with intelligence excep tional in this millennium he surpassed Buddhasimha and Kumarajlva of a later time Marching on a long road in the moonlight his shadow was his temporary companion at night Going far over precipitous peaks his form always became solitary with the approach o f dawn He thoroughly researched the sphere of wisdom and deeply investigated the ultimate truth His mind understood the Buddhas teachings exhaustively and knew well the gists of secret learning He mastered what previous sages did not know and comprehended what he did not learn pre viously from books Thus the golden texts were introduced to the East to maintain teachings that were on the verge of breaking up and the precious stanzas were shifted from the West to fill in the missing words While he was looking reminiscently at the ruins of temple foundations in that country his mind was fixed on this land He propagated the profound gists while the leaves were verdurous in the Jetavana Grove When he opened his mind in a distant land the waves in the water of meditation became quiet once again Let us pray that our mother the deceased Empress will gain liberation through the Six Paramitas that her spirit will appear in front of the red gate of the palace and that having rested in the four stages of Dhyana her spirit will come over the area of the imperial residence The Jade Candle is easily gone urging the four sea sons to change from warmth to cold The Golden Arrow is hardly detainable driving the Six Dragons to compete with the sundial and clepsydra in speed We fear that slopes may be removed but the trees will be still there that seas may turn into mulberry fields and the locality remain the same but that landforms may be changed when high peaks have sunk into deep valleys Hence we respectfully inscribe this everlasting slab to state and make known the true circum stances The inscription reads as follows The Three Luminaries shine upon all forms Like water flowing everything changes The human path is long and farreaching And time has its waxing and waning The waves of passion submerge consciousness And the mist of deeds besmirches sentiments His wonderful Way excels in abstrusity His profound origin controls tranquility Vulture Peak stood high in the distance The Dragon Palace was broad and spacious The Sim of Wisdom issued brilliant light The clouds of compassion shed the rain of benevolence Retrospection on the holy words and teaching Gives rise to reflection on the Voice of Virtue These theories were esteemed in past kalpas And the Way covers both the present and the future His spirit prevails throughout the Nine Regions And his traces vanished at the twin sala trees The dream of Emperor Ming of Han seems still in existence But the star dropped suddenly during the Zhou dynasty The solid structures are adorned with engraved flowers The purple ridgepoles retain the moonlight With the glow of sunset are the red beams embellished At the windows painted with clouds leaves are scattered Over the pond flowers drift up and down in the wind The Imperial Carriage lowers its canopy and halts Beside the bridge the rainbow is slanting With the life of wisdom the Master is endowed An outstanding person with a calm and peaceful mind A unique personality appearing once in a thousand years He walks alone on the Path of Three Voids In the Jetavana Garden he had a taste of the Way In the Snow Mountains he ate his meal in the gale The Lamp of Wisdom is rekindled And the true words are once again esteemed On the sixth day of the third month various honorable gentle men on receiving the Emperors composition went together to the court to submit a memorial to express their gratitude to the Throne It reads We knelt down to see heavenly flowers blooming and wit nessed the marvelous treasure of the God o f the Yellow River We piously opened the secret scriptures and listened to the sweet melody of the Fairy Lady Yunyin The composi tion embraces the moral principles of a myriad of genera tions and contains the unusual views of a thousand years We hastened to impart the happy news to one another and our delight knew no bounds We humbly believe that the Run of Wisdom shining from the West has illuminated midnight and dispelled the darkness and that the River of the Dharma has flowed to the East and moistened withered roots to enable plants to grow tall and gracefrd again Nowhere is the edification not one and the same and all principles in concordance with things come to the same end Through successive dynasties up to the present all people have esteemed these texts We bow down to consider that Your Majesty may cut off the sea by merely dropping a garment and discerns affairs in the Central Region as clearly as if in a mirror The way of having dutiful descendants from generation to generation is increasingly glorified but the ferry to cross over the sea of rebirth is more important A Jetavana Garden has been opened in the superior area and eminent ascetics have been invited to live in retirement in it The place is extremely lofty and resplen dent and the people therein are marked by moral strength as mighty as that of dragons and elephants We your subjects have always been ignorant of the teaching but are lucky to have a peep at Your Majestys composition It is however just like comparing a small amount of water in a depression on the ground with the huge pool in which the divine turtle lives or like a group of ephemeral mayflies discussing how they feel about the long life o f the cranes on which the immortals ride We sang and danced while we were reciting the composition by heart Having read it completely through we could not refrain from leaping for joy Beginning with a Letter of Thanks for the Completion of the Inscription of the Cien Monastery in the Third Month of the First Year of Xianqing and Ending with His Return to the Western Capital with the Emperor in the First Month of the Third Year On the ninth day of the third month in the spring of the first year of Xianqing  the Emperor completed the composition of the slab inscription regarding the Great Cien Monastery Xu Jingzong the Minister of the Board of Ceremonies dispatched a messenger to send the composition to the Master while the Protocol Depart ment also granted a tally of authentication to the monastery On the tenth day the Master bringing with him the monks of the monastery repaired to the palace to submit a letter o f thanks in which he said I Sramana Xuanzang beg to state that having received the tally from the Protocol Department I bowed to accept the imperial decree informing me that Your Majesty has person ally composed with your sacred writing brush the essay to be inscribed on a slab for the Great Cien Monastery The Gate of Mystery has thus become loftier and the glory of Buddhist monks is augmented I feel ashamed to squat on this thick earth as I am short of strength to support the high firmament I Xuanzang have heard that the function of nature is to produce things through which to effect edification and that the Way of the saints is to express their sentiments through words and phrases But the draw ing of the Eight Diagrams to bequeath literature to pos terity is merely empty talk about things possessing definite shapes and the explanations and divisions of the strokes of the diagrams do not go beyond the world The virtue of Emperor Fuxi was extolled in ancient times and the moral ity of Empress Ji was prominently high in a later age But how could they be compared with the development o f peo ples aspirations for the achievement of their affairs with the ornate writings for the exposition of the eight aspects of human relationships or with the utterances for the expla nation of the Way in order to testify to the Three Clear Insights for the guidance of ordinary people The reasons elaborated in the essay reach the limit of what is manifested by Heaven and earth and the sentiment expressed in it is beyond the sun and the moon If we compare them as to superiority or inferiority this essay is the most magnificent o f all I humbly believe that the Golden Wheel of Your Majesty is in motion that time is guided by the calendar that moral edification fills the four continents and that kindness extends to the nine states Your Way includes the Great Saint and your merits are as plentiftd as those of the gods Your various abilities were endowed at birth and your talents were given by Heaven First you were grieved at the sight of the toilet mirror  and then a caitya was constructed where splendid banners were hung immediately It is like the blooming of heavenly flowers Wise words surge forward like great waves swallowing up a sea o f fine words including the Dragon Palace and covering a forest of rhetorical phrases embracing the Crane Wood The ruins of the Jetavana Garden are raised higher in reputa tion by these precious thoughts and the remnant fragrance of the park at Varanasi is kept undispersed with the aid of this excellent composition It does not merely defame or praise a dreamland or enlighten those who have gone into the wrong path It is really a model for all in the four quarters under Heaven and comprehends all the Three Worlds My words and deeds are insignificant and I am just an ordinary person among the monks I have enjoyed extreme kindness from the Throne and have always considered myself fortunate I had the good opportunity to visit the city of Kanyakubja twice and I am happy to have been born at this prosperous time during the Image Period of the Dharma I am ashamed of my unworthiness but I also bounce with delight and feelings of actuality are mixed in my mind With unlimited respect and sincerity I come to the Imperial Court to present this letter to express my thanks On the eleventh day the Master again thought that the liter ary talent and brilliant intelligence of the Sovereign were endowed by Heaven that he was both sagacious and versatile and that not only were his literary works as elegant as those of the ruler of Wei but his calligraphy also surpassed the characters written by the Lord of Han Considering that the inscription was being composed by the Emperor the Master thought that it should also be written with the Divine Pen Thus he went to the palace with a letter to ask the Emperor to write the inscription with his own hand saying Sramana Xuanzang and others beg to say that we presume that the heavenly bodies are shown in accordance with circumstances and that their divine functions are great and comprehensive Edification is implemented at any time that it is required so that holy duties may be completely fulfilled From this we may know that when both the sun and the moon are bright they can move through their full course across the sky and when both grasses and trees are exuber ant they fully manifest their power of beautifying the land We humbly believe that the wisdom of Your Majesty covers all things on earth and that your kindness benefits the Three Worlds both glorifying the Great Teaching and eluci dating abstruse moralization King Mu of the Zhou dynasty was disdained for his fondness for the Way simply because he appreciated the song of Lake Yao the dwelling of the immortals in an empty way Emperor Ming of the Han dynasty was slighted in spite of his veneration of the Dharma as he merely founded White Horse Monastery and did nothing more So condescended to write a Heavenly Composition to spread the abstruse gists far and engraved a piece of splendid jade to perpetuate the excellent prin ciples They are similar to the melodies produced by the antique music of the Six Yings and are like the radiance issued from the five planets spreading utmost tenderness to inspire the common people and enhancing the great oath to rectify the defects of the time It is certainly not merely for deep praise of the Doctrine of Suchness and propagation o f the mysterious and profound Teachings Although the elegant composition is fluently accomplished and is ready to be inscribed on an emerald slab the characters have not yet been written and the imperial edict in red script is still unproclaimed After the music of the kui has been started with the beating of drums and bells mounted on xun stands no vulgar songs can be sung in harmony with it After the rooster has crowed at daybreak how can the flame of a torch give any more ilhimination If Ya and Kuang did not play the sevenstringed zither in harmony with the melodious rhythm and the sun did not control all things how could the great sound of the drum of the Dharma be spread far and the resplendent colors of the Sum of Wisdom be made more glorious It will not only glorify the teachings o f the Image Period but also greatly benefit sentient beings It will really extol the present age of good polity when both the ancestral temple and the state are enjoying unlimited blessed ness Being stupid and shallow by nature I have spent a number of years among the monks as an unworthy man feeling shame at my lack o f learning and my imperfection in observing many of the disciplinary rules but the Throne has deigned to overpraise me with panegyrical phrases Although I am seized with so much fear that I have no place to hide myself I have felt eager and earnest in my sincere request for many days and I venture to repeat my annoying entreaty with a feeling of trepidation as if I were walking on thin ice or burning charcoal The petition was not accepted On the twelfth day the Master submitted another request saying Yesterday I was honored to receive with great delight a letter from the Throne not consenting to favor me with the divine handwriting but I still hold fast to my mind of loyalty I humbly consider that Your Majesty wrote the composition with a balanced mind very exquisitely maintaining peace without exerting effort Your grand pattern glorifies the banks of the Luo River and the expert cursive calligraphist acquired his talent by prac tising handwriting beside a pool as his inkstand I have previously received Your Majestys favor which I accepted like flowers of the ruo tree from the Golden Mirror It is not only because the two component parts of a pair o f carved jade always match each other or because it is the joining of rays that wins our admiration but also because it is feared that nothing but your hand writing could carry the composition which is as brilliant as the sun and the moon Although I am longing for the favor with all my soul and I touch the ground with my forehead in earnest expectation I do not dare to hope for it At the request in this petition the Emperor wielded his divine writing brush As the Emperor had granted his entreaty the Master being highly pleased and greatly delighted wrote a letter to express his thanks saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that I have deferentially received the edict granting the favor of writing with your own hand the composition for the slab inscription for the Great Cien Monastery When the decree af fixed with the Great Seal arrived it brought me Your Majestys profuse kindness which I accepted with a sense of apprehension feeling ashamed of my own unworthiness and embarrassed at not knowing what to do I have heard that when a powerful crossbow is drawn to the full a mere flying squirrel is not strong enough to pull its trigger and that when a big bell is silent a slender dry leaf of grass can never make it sound I never thought that the light of the sun and the moon would cast my shadow at the Gate of Emptiness or that the moisture of rain and the evaporation of clouds would arouse inspiration in a secluded monastery That is what I wished for but it is not what I aimed to acquire I humbly think that Your Majesty walking on the Crater and riding upon the Dubhe wielded the scepter and suc ceeded to the good fortune of the Throne You have followed after Emperor Xuanyuan and exceeded Emperor Zhuanxu of ancient times You could comprehend the Xia and embrace the Yin dynasties elucidating various wonderful teachings for the education of your time and assembling versatile talents to illumine the common people All men within the Nine Regions of the empire are bathed in the wind of kindness and even those who are outside the four quarters under the sky are also benefited by the edification of the mysterious Teachings But the Dharma that serves as a bridge to cross a river cannot be traced to its origin unless it is explained by a perfect saint and how can the task of elucidating the profound teachings be widely done if it is not done by a consummate man Buddhist monks however will feel double happiness and dance with rejoicing as if they heard in a dream the magnificent music performed at the center of Heaven which is no more marvellous than their present exhilaration Even if they obtained the pearl in the topknot of a Wheelturning King it would not be more precious than a piece  We shall inscribe it on a durable slab o f stone and plant it in the Courtyard of Blessedness so that ignorant and deluded people may open their ears and eyes This blazing torch of the Dharma will be transmitted to the future to enable those who see the valuable words and appreciate the calligraphy to cherish the mind of Bodhi on that same day By reading the impres sive composition they may seek the ultimate truth and realize prajiia on the very spot For as many kalpas as there are innumerable mustard seeds the brilliance of the beauty of the composition will exist eternally Through changes in the world such that seas may turn into mulberry fields your graceful style will never perish But ever since I discarded my hair ornaments after having cut off my hair to become a monk I have thought of propagating the mysterious Way It was depending upon imperial pres tige that I was able to visit Kapilavastu Now in my trans lation work I have again received encouragement from the court During the Zhenguan period I bathed myself though unworthy of it in the great compassion of the Throne Since the commencement of the Yonghui period I have enjoyed all the more special treatment from Your Majesty Through the Divine Pens of these two lords I have been overpraised and the encomiums of two Emperors have overwhelmed me with honor and glory In view of my own stupidity and inferiority my mind is really filled with anxiety and fear Day and night I never forget my sincere wish to repay this kindness The alms given to me are as large as a lofty hill and I cannot express my thanks for them with a grain of dust All I should do is to depend upon the various powers of wisdom and make use o f them without limit to support the Great Blessedness in the Imperial Ancestral Temple and to assist in maintaining the deep foundation of the empire for a long period With extreme fear and respect I am writing this letter which I entrust to the Palace Attendant Wang Junde to submit with my gratitude to Your Majesty Having offended your august prestige unscrupulously I am crouching with trembling and deep trepidation On the eighth day of the fourth month in the summer the engraving on a slab of the inscription written by the great Emperor was completed by carving artisans When it was about to be sent to the monastery the Master out of respect for the Emperor did not dare to wait and do nothing for its arrival So he led his disciples in the Cien Monastery as well as the monks and nuns in the capital in proceeding with banners canopies precious cur tains streamers and flowers all prepared by themselves to the Fanglin Gate to welcome the inscription The Emperor also dis patched musicians of the nine bands of the Board of Rites and the orchestras of the two counties of Changan and Wanlian to send the inscription Of the more than three hundred ceremonial articles even the shortest banners rose above the clouds and the smallest streamers touched the firmament There were over a hundred vehicles carrying the musicians On the evening of the seventh day they assembled at Anfu Gate Street in the western part of the city It rained that night and on the eighth day the road became unfit for the procession to move on So the Emperor ordered the suspen sion of the procession but still invited the Master to the palace On the tenth day as the weather had turned fine and sunny the Emperor ordered the display set out as had been arranged On the m o rn in g of the fourteenth day the procession started with ban ners and streamers and other articles properly arrayed one after another presenting a gorgeous view that filled the road for thirty li from the Fanglin Gate to the Cien Monastery The Emperor went up to the tower of the Anfu Gate and was very much delighted to watch the procession More than a million people in the capital witnessed the sight On the fifteenth day seven persons were ordained to be monks and a feast was prepared to entertain two thousand monks with nine bands playing music in front of the Buddha hall It was not until nightfall that they dispersed On the sixteenth day the Master again went with his disciples to the court to express his gratitude for the arrival of the slab inscription at the monastery In a memorial he said Sramana Xuanzang and others beg to state that on the fourteenth day of this month we respectfully received the imperial decree sending the inscription engraved in the pattern of Your Majestys handwriting for the Great Cien Monastery together with an offering of music performed by nine bands The sun shining high shares its light to increase the brilliance of the torch of wisdom The great expanse of the sea stretches its waves to replenish the River of the Dharma to its fullness The great stele stands erect as a precipice and the Heavenly Composition is as brilliant as sunlight resembling colorful clouds shining in the morning upon Grdhrakuta Mountain and giving the impression that an illuminant star has descended upon a divine peak All monks and laymen have rushed to the spot like fleeing clouds stimulated by lightning to see the inscription with amazement dancing as if they had never seen such a marvel lous thing before I humbly believe that the Eight Trigrams bequeathed the symbols of writing and that the six lines of the Hexa grams are explained by the Appended Statements in the Book o f Changes By observing the traces of birds the principle of writing characters was formulated and the melody of The Weeping Kylin and the Lamenting Phoenix evolved into an allusion quoted in literary works This is all the sages could do as is seen in these examples They set up moral stand ards as an example for posterity giving instructions when ever necessary and molding the character of sentient beings so as to glorify and publicize their good demeanor and meritorious deeds But the rock carvings of the first Emperor of Qin just exalted his performance o f the ceremony of offering sacrifices to Heaven to mark his ascension to the Throne while the slab inscription engraved by the Empress of Wei merely recorded the merit of offering grand sacrifices at the Ancestral Temple Even such doings were praised as estimable as standing high to look down upon all other rulers It has rhymes like music performed with metal instruments and its forceful strokes produce a bright and splendid impression Your Majesty visited the Dragon Palace and mastered the three mysterious teachings of Laozi Zhuangzi and the Book o f Changes Your calligraphy sur passes the phoenix style of writing and is extremely good in all the eight types of penmanship It raises waves in the springtime to give free play to your thoughts while it drops autumnal dew to create a novel style It propagates the wonderful theories of the Ekayana and extols the abstruse meanings of the Six Paramitas It edifies all the regions of the Three Thousand Worlds with its fame spreading beyond a hundred kotis of Buddha lands The subtle sayings uttered at the Deer Park are rendered more mani fest by your heavenly words and phrases and the Bodhisattvas of the Bamboo Grove Monastery are more respectful because of your Divine Pen Thus did the Brahmanic ascetics turn their minds  breaking the net of doubts under great guidance Likewise Paplyan the Evil One rectified his intrigues crushing down the hill of wickedness to follow the Way Not only are the people within the gate of the mundane world beginning to be aware of their wrong position but also those who are held back in this dreamlike life are also taking actions to detach themselves from the sphere of suffering The teachings of the Image Period were introduced to the East nearly six hundred years ago but their propagation was not so popular then as it is now In spite of the inspiration that Emperor Ming of the Han dynasty had obtained in his dream he still consulted with Fu Yi about the matter and when the Lord of Wu adopted Buddhism he had to inquire of Kan Ze to solve points on which he had doubts Since then nobody else is worth mentioning except Your Majesty who edifies the people according to circumstances and pushes forward all alone toward the bright future of destiny Your good deeds will certainly be rewarded and you will be able to build a strong foundation for posterity Your Majestys divine merits are as uncountable as those of a King of the Golden Wheel and your good fortune and happiness are as everlasting as those of an Emperor wearing a crown adorned with precious jade With feelings o f extreme fear and gratitude we come respectfully to the palace to express our thanks to your Presence When the slab inscription arrived the authorities built a separate stele house to preserve it at the northeast comer in front of the Buddha hall The building had double arches and over lapping beam supports and the lintels were painted with cloud patterns The ridgepoles were gorgeously decorated with golden flowers shining downward and precious windbells emitting light upward while the dewreceiving basin supported by the palms of an immortal was the same as that of a relic stupa The Emperor was good at writing in regular script the clerical style the cursive hand and the running style of characters The inscription was written in the running style but the four characters xian qing yuan nian were done in the flying white style both styles being written in a most marvellous and beautiful manner Thousands of people came to see the inscription every day Those civil and military officials above the third rank who asked to make rubbings of it were permitted to do so For example Emperor Yuan of the Han dynasty was good at writing the clerical style for recording history Emperor Wu of the Wei dynasty was expert at writing the cursive and running styles Zhong You was adept at writing the three styles ancient script the seal script and the clerical style Wang Cizhong was skilled at writing the eight fen square characters Liu Shao and Zhang Hong were known for their ability to write the flying white style and Zhang Boying and Cui Ziyu were wellknown as sages of cursive writing Only Wang Xianzi Chief of the Imperial Secretariat and Wang Xizi Right Army Commander were somewhat experienced at writing more than one of these beautiful styles but even they could not write all the types of calligraphy Thus when Wei Wenxiu saw the hand writings of the two Wangs he remarked The two Wangs may certainly be praised as good hands at handwriting but they know nothing of the art of calligraphy Our Emperor the prominent gracefulness of his sharp strokes and the highly elegant and forceffil structure of his characters He the various types of handwriting of the ancient sages possesses the versatilities of all wise men of previous ages is peerless among great calligraphists and is matched by scarcely anyone in writing compositions As the Master attended lectures and studied hard in the days of his youth and travelled across icy mountains and snowy ranges on his way to the West he suffered from a kind of cold disease Each time it relapsed his heart was infarcted causing him much pain and trouble For several years he depended upon medicaments to prevent recurrences of his illness and keep himself in a steady condition During the summer of this year in the fifth month he went to live in a cool place to avoid the heat of the season This caused an attack of his old illness that became almost fatal to him Both the monks and the lay people worried about his health When the imperial secretary heard about the matter he reported it to the Emperor who ordered that the experienced imperial physician Jiang Xiaozhang and the acupuncturist Shangguan Cong be sent to attend upon him exclusively All medicines needed were sent from the palace Messengers were dispatched from the Imperial Guards several times a day in shifts to observe climatic conditions and send back information Even the Masters sleeping quarters were arranged by adroit attendants sent from the inner palace He was treated with such great care by the Emperor that it was no less than the affection of a kindly father treating his only son Jiang Xiaozhang and others attended on the Master day and night without leaving him After five days his recovery from illness made people within and without the palace feel relieved Having received the beneficence of the Emperor the Master submitted a letter of thanks to him on the following day saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that as I am inept at taking care of my health my cold disease became so much exacerbated that I was in critical condition and was on the verge of taking my last leave of Your Majesty Under your heavenly beneficence however good physicians were sent to me and as soon as the needle and medicine were admin istered to me I regained my health My declining age was retained when it was drawing near to its end and my spirit was revitalized when it was about to disperse I am not only cured of my fatal disease forever and have my poor consti tution regulated at all times but I shall be able to see once again the prosperity of the time and follow more of your instructions What has been granted to me is heavy while my life is light and I do not know how to repay the kindness All I can do is to depend upon the Power ofWisdom to requite your deep benefaction As I am still feeble and weary I am unable to come in person to the palace to express my gratitude With much fear and respect I am sending my disciple Mahayanaprabha to sub mit this letter to your Presence After reading the letter the Emperor sent the palace attendant Wang Junde to console the Master saying Since you have just taken medicine you must still be feeble in strength May Your Reverence take good care of yourself It is unfitting for you to exert your mind very soon Having been inquired after by the Emperor the Master was overjoyed and felt awe and respect He wrote another letter to express his thanks saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that due to my karma I suffered from the pains of disease and in an instant of breath I was almost separated from the present age of brightness Suddenly the Emperor and Empress favored me with a mind of compassion and worried about my life Imperial messengers came more than ten times to console me and I was saved by divine medicine as if I had taken a single pill that cured my illness at once By drinking and bathing in the kindness of Your Majesties I have been relieved of my severe pains and by the medical treatment I was able to get rid of my ailment I never anticipated that my dying soul would be summoned by the Supreme Emperor and that my life which was about to end prematurely might be retempered in the great furnace of morality When I privately examined myself and my faults I made an infrospection of my own mediocrity and insignificance and won dered why I should have enjoyed all these favors I clapped on my chest feeling ashamed of being overendowed with grace and of my words being unworthy of publicity With extreme gratitude and respect I am submitting this letter of thanVc to your Presence Formerly in the eleventh year of Zhenguan  an imperial decree was issued saying As Laozi was our forefather his name position and titles should be placed before those of the Buddha At that time the virtuous monk Fachang of Puguang Monastery the virtuous monk Puying of Zongchi Monastery and several hundred others debated the matter at court but no rectification was granted After returning home the Master sent repeated petitions about the problem to the Emperor who promised to reconsider the matter but before it was done Emperor Wendi passed away In the sixth year of Yonghui an edict was issued to the effect that if Taoist priests and Buddhist monks violated the law in a case difficult to judge they could be tried and investigated according to secular judicial procedure As the officials at the frontier and distant places did not properly understand the intent of the edict they unscrupulously cangued and cudgelled priest and monk culprits to their great grief and humiliation disregarding whether it was a grave or a minor case The Emperor sent him a reply saying We have noticed what you stated in your note As the name and position of the Buddhists and Taoists were designated by the preceding Emperor the matter needs deliberation and clarification As for the decree that places priests and monks on the same level as lay people  it should be cancelled immediately The Master should be at ease and try to take medicine On the twentythird day an edict was proclaimed saying The teachings of Taoism inspire purity and voidness and the texts of Buddhism are subtle and wonderful They con stitute a bridge for the people and are followed with respect in the Three Worlds As it is now the Final Period of termination of the Dharma people are disposed to do evil and liable to break regulations and the law Thus were put under the control of the secular legal system as a temporary expedient to punish evildoers in the hope of forbidding them to do evil and persuading them to do good It is not out of contempt for the Dharma if monks are involved in a lawsuit But as the homeless ones have their own disciplinary rules it must be troublesome for them to subject themselves to another judi cial system The order issued previously that Taoist priests and priestesses as well as Buddhist monks and nuns were to be tried according to secular law if they committed an offence should be abolished If they commit any offence they should be dealt with according to their monastic rules and regulations Upon receiving this favor from the Throne the Master submitted a letter to the Emperor and went to the palace to express his gratitude saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to state that I have respectfully seen the imperial edict abolishing the regulation that when monks and nuns commit an offence against the law they should be punished according to the secular jurisdiction and restoring the old institution Unexpected grace is sud denly bestowed upon the monks and nuns dressed in dark robes and unlimited kindness has benefitted the religious establishment like the morning sun shedding its light upon the Way with actual glorification I humbly believe that since the King of Dharma has passed away the edifica tion of the Image Period of the Dharma is transmitted in vain and the enforcement of monastic rules depends upon the favor and help of wise monarchs Although their sentiments are still involved in the world of the five turbidities and they are mostly imperfect in keep ing the disciplinary rules they are the embodiment of the Field of Blessedness because they are dressed in the three robes The close meshes of the net of justice are cut open and instead the principle of leniency and kindness is spread It is true that the straight words from the Golden Mouth rightly transfer this merit for the good of all This is indeed a pleasure carried by celestial gods and terrestrial deities that respond to good omens The monks and nuns are not only grateful for the kindness but their purity and firmness are also augmented If anyone acts against this policy of leniency and forgiveness he will incur calamity upon him self and his action will be contrary to the strict teachings of the Buddha the great teacher and unworthy of the deep compassion of our Imperial Lord It befits all wise deities to reprimand such a person without waiting for the delibera tion of the law to mete out punishment to the offender I am a mediocre and stupid person unworthily occupying a place among the monks and often enjoying undeservedly great beneficence that makes me feel ashamed and uneasy As I have been ill recently I could not come to attend regular interviews in the palace With unlimited respect and sincerity I am sending my disciple Mahayanaprabha to submit this letter to express my gratitude to your Presence After that the monks lived in peace engaging in meditation and recitation of scriptures With mixed feelings of grief and joy the Master was moved to tears making his sleeves and the front of his garment wet while he clapped his hands and danced merrily He wrote another letter to the Emperor to express his thanks saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that I have been graced with the edict abolishing the statute that monks and others were liable to be interrogated according to secular law In my humble opinion the rise and fall of the Right Dharma depends upon its being uplifted or repressed by the ruling lord and high or low ethical standards match the perfection or deficiency of an Emperors moral influence Recently monks who were imperfect and who incul cated the people in an abnormal way internally damaged the good name of Buddhism and externally violated the imperial law When one person is guilty the entire group is covered with blemishes Thus imperial prestige is offended and the culprit should be dealt with according to secular law in order to eliminate evildoers and prevent them from com mitting further evil deeds Thus he granted unusual bene volence and abrogated the law of strict punishment not because those men are good enough to be valued but because the Dharma they stand for is to be respected Therefore the fishes caught in a net were able to swim once again in the Yangzi and Han Rivers and the birds ensnared in a cage could fly back to the distant sky The water of the Dharma turned pure once again after being turbid and the Field of Blessedness regained fertility after being barren Every one of the monks and others is deeply grateful They know they must try their best to clear away evil so as to be in concor dance with the mind of the Emperor and concentrate on worshipping the Buddha and reciting scriptures in order to repay the kindness of the Great Heaven I humbly wish that Your Majesties the Emperor and the Empress will achieve a hundred blessings forever by your merit of perpetuating and making prosperous the truth of Buddhism By your deeds of compassion you will govern the empire without effort for a myriad of springs The region of Cathay is associated with auspiciousness and the city of Vaisall is in possession of goodness With extreme gratitude while danc ing in delight I am submitting this letter to express my thanks once again I am in great fear that it may cause annoyance and offence to the Crown After reading the letter the Emperor knew that the Master had recovered from his illness and sent a messenger to invite him to the palace He was lodged and given offerings at the western pavilion in the court of the Ningyin Palace where he continued his translation work and came out only every twenty or thirty days In the tenth month during the winter when the Empress was about to lie in confinement she took refuge in the Triple Gem praying for spiritual protection The Master said to the Emperor Her Majesty will certainly be safe in childbirth but should the infant be a boy I wish that he be allowed to become a monk after he is bom in safety The Emperor consented instantly On the fifth day of the eleventh month the Empress offered one religious robe and a few scores of miscellaneous articles to the Master who wrote a letter of thanks saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to state that I have been favored with the gifts of a religious robe and some miscellaneous articles which I received with a sense of fear and shame without compare The superior robe sewn with golden thread and handed down by previous sages and the invaluable cassock that I have heard about in the sacred texts are not so fine and exquisite as this one I see with my own eyes As for the colors evenly spread on the silk in rich and light shades even Jing Jun could not surpass the skill required to produce them It is cut and sewn with such fine and minute stretches that even Li Lou with his sharp sight could not discern the space between them Once it is put on one feels as if mist and clouds had entered the chamber and it seems that a bouquet of orchids is placed on ones body When one turns around to look at oneself the value of glory is augmented at once In olden times Taoan whose words were valued during the Qin period did not come across such benevolence and Zhidun praised and venerated during the Jin dynasty seldom heard about such grace But I being a mediocre and shallowminded person have alone enjoyed such great favors and the kindness bestowed on me by Your Majesties in person has made me tremble and perspire more and more I respectfully wish that the Emperor and the Empress will have a large number of offspring and enjoy limitless blessings that you will be constantly present at the Jade Mirror and rule with the precious title forever so as to protect and nurse all the common people in a manner as unlimited as the sky With a feeling of deep shame and gratitude I am writing this letter to express my thanks The alms given to me are heavy while my words are light and I am incapable of expressing myself in full After the time of sheng on the fifth day a red bird came all of a sudden and alighted on the imperial tent at which event Xuanzang rejoiced and was delighted He wrote a letter of congratulations saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that I have heard that a white turtledove augured prosperity for the Emperors of the Yin period and that a red bird presented a good omen of happiness for the monarchs of the Zhou dynasty From this we may know that the presage of human affairs by good omens granted by Heaven has had a long standing After the time of sheng and before you today I saw inside the curtain at the courtyard of Xianqing Hall a red bird its back abdomen and feet covered all over with red feathers coming flying from the south After entering the tent it stopped at the Throne pacing up and down and hopping in a leisurely manner Upon seeing this strange bird I said to it As the Empress is pregnant and the time is yet unripe for the delivery I am deeply concerned about her safety for which I have said prayers If my prayer is to be answered show me a good sign Apparently under standing my human mind the bird then turned around and stepped with its feet as a gesture of showing safety Feeling delight deeply in my mind I beckoned at it and moved slowly toward it So in return for its good will I tried to make it take refuge in the Triple Gem but before I could catch it it flew away while I was following it up and down I humbly believe that Your Majesties the Emperor and the Empress have virtues that communicate themselves to the deities and that your benevolence is extended to the myriads of common people with rites conducted harmo niously and music performed in a happy way Your kindness is deep and your righteousness farreaching Thus it has caused the feathered tribe to present auspicious signs and the divine bird to offer natures service showing that your offspring will thrive and that their prosperity will last for the long period of eight hundred years Being a humble man I am lucky to have seen for the first time this happy and auspicious event My gladness is so deep that I dare not keep silent about it So I write this brief report to submit to your Presence As regards the impressiveness of the birds feathers and wings the sim plicity and grandness of its masculine spirit the researches done about it in successive dynasties and the foreign land from which it emerged they are beyond the scope of my knowledge Stated with respect Shortly after the letter had been submitted to the palace an imperial order was issued to send a messenger to inform the Master saying The Empress has finished parturition eventually giving birth to a boy who is unusually handsome A divine light filled the courtyard and shone up to the sky Our delight is without limit and the people danced in and outside the palace We will certainly not go back on our promise We wish the Master will protect the baby keep him in mind and name him Prince Buddha Light The Master wrote a letter of congratulation saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that I have heard that the ultimate Way keeps itself and unfolds to enlighten human and heavenly beings at the beginning of their lives Being moved by your deep expectation a sagely child of wisdom and discernment is bom I humbly believe that the Emperor and the Empress have realized the three subjective and objective voidnesses as well as edified and protected all sentient beings living in the nine dwelling spheres Thus Your Majesties could discard your crowns with jade pen dants on account of the two forms of truth and give up your riding horses to take the One Vehicle At the first moment of jubilation in the Empress palace she made a crore of vows A hundred deities protected good people and paid homage to the inner chamber of the palace Therefore disasters and evil devils were cleared away and the child was bom in peace and safety Seven flowers raised their heads to support his first steps and nine dragons spouted water to bathe his body His traces will be stored in the Gate of Abstrusity and among the trees of the Way there will be the shade of spirituality Although the Emperors of yore saw auspicious signs that touched the sky to indicate unusual events how can that be sufficient to compare with the present gift granted by Heaven and match this personage of outstanding resourcefulness The whole empire is singing with delight at the imperial lineage being blessed by divini ties and the monks who are courageous and astute are happy at the arrival of a divine colt I humbly wish that Your Majesty will not withdraw your previous favor but will give a special order that the baby should wear religious robes and always cling to their gorgeous patterns so as to make good karma Moreover the sublimity of the son of an Emperor is perpetual no matter where he is and his duty as the King of the Dharma is more and more lofty and prominent In addition merits have no limit A ferry or a bridge may help one go far supposing that Your Majestys kindness is fault less and that your great vow remains unchanged I believe that the merit of giving all the resources within the Four Seas in charity is not adequate to compare with the merit of this donation  and the deeds of all the Ten Stages of Bodhisattvahood cannot parallel this foundation of blessedness It befits me to wish that the Emperor and the Empress will enjoy a hundred blessings that will coagulate into flowers with a brilliance to match the North Star and live for a myriad of springs on a base as solid as South Mountain May you enjoy all amusements in your long lives and act upon allknowing wisdom for many kalpas to come The Crown Prince who is honest and splendid will steadily succeed to imperial sover eignty the one who is still in swaddling clothes is a brilliant descendant whose good fortune and happiness will increase day by day He will mark his high moral integrity to pos terity and succeed his sagely predecessor on the grass seat  I have incidentally met with this period of great fortune and confined my shadow within the gate of the forbidden palace It is lucky that national jubilation has begun and the foundation is laid for pure deeds I am so happy that I am dancing with delight Even should I be ground to dust I should have no regrets With unlimited gladness and greetings I respect fully submit this letter to your Presence Three days after the birth of the Prince Buddha Light the Master wrote another letter to the Emperor saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that I have heard that in the Book o f Changes the idea of daily renovation of ones virtue is praised and that in the Book o f Songs an unlimited line of progeny is glorified So the Throne of the Zhou dynasty which lasted a very long time and the calendar of the Han period which was handed down from the distant past were responses to this Way I have also heard that at the Gate of the Dragon the water whirls rapidly and that because of its long source it flows a great distance Osmanthus trees grow in thickets and owing to their deep roots their flowers are fragrant and exuberant It is humbly believed that the imperial dynasties were succeeded by one sagely Emperor after another and that all of them have repeatedly observed the rules of accumulating and cultivating kindness and righteousness for the benefit of the common people since a long time ago Thus the two Sovereigns had the honor to accept the Throne as a base for their descendants and this may well be called having deep roots and a remote source After Your Majesty accepted the order of Heaven your exploits increased all the more Returning to simplicity and restor ing purity Your Majesty overstepped the traces of the Three Sovereigns and the Five Emperors you have formulated rites and composed music surpassing the standard estab lished during the Yin and Zhou dynasties You do not depend on the Imperial Carriage covered with yellow silk to show your nobility and the salvation of billions of common sub jects is in your mind Before dawn you ask for your clothes to rise and you forget food when the sun has declined in the west With one man ruling over the country this vast empire ten thousand li in area is in peace and tranquillity Even the prosperity of the periods o f King Cheng and King Kang of the Zhou dynasty was not up to the level of the present time Therefore auspicious clouds scatter luxuriantly and both the rivers and the sea are waveless All regions under the sun follow your moral instruction and the Country o f the Dragon is bathed in your edification It is difficult to relate them at full length Then the Way is in connection with Heaven and the perceptive deities have granted blessings At a propitious hour in an auspicious month the Crown Prince was bom The branches of the imperial family are extensive and prosperous with jadelike calyxes spreading increasingly and none of the people in the whole country is not rejoicing with a mind of dependence I am not only happy at the safety of Her Majesty the Empress I am also glad that the Tathagata has one more successor I respectfully wish that Your Majesty will not recall the previous edict but will instantly allow the Prince to leave home so that the offspring of a secular monarch may be transformed into a son of the King of the Dharma wear ing religious robes with a clerical name given to him and taking the Three Refuges among the ranks of monks He will follow the dense traces of Vimalanetra and tread in the high steps of Candrachattra He will cut off the two kinds of bondage and become a fully enlightened one with a splendid physical body like the king of mountains adorned with a net of flames that will outshine the sun and the moon After that he will shade the domain of the great chiliocosm with the cloud of compassion raise high the torch of wisdom to a hundred kotis of conti nents strike the drum of the Dharma to defeat the heavenly devils wave the superior banners to subdue the heretics hold the deep water of the turbulent sea quench the blazing fire on the evil mountain drain the profound river of pas sions and break the huge egg of ignorance to be a teacher of celestial and human beings and a Guide of Men Let us pray that on account of the good fortune of their offspring the imperial ancestors and progenitors will ascend to the other shore  and that with the bene diction of your son the Emperor and the Empress may enjoy a myriad of years of long life eternally holding sway over the empire and always being present in the Nine Regions of the country Only in this way can a son be considered a person of great filial piety who glorifies his parents It was therefore for this reason that Sakyamuni abandoned his kingdom and strove to gain enlightenment How could the trivial goodness of the Prince of Dongping and the mediocre talent of Prince Si of Chen dispute with him about supe riority or inferiority on the same day or argue about who is deep or shallow in the same year I have respectfully pre pared the religious robe and an alms bowl in my hands to wait for the welcome guest A seat has been whisked clean and the road swept clear for the arrival of the carriage that will carry the Prince from the imperial city With great delight and respect I am submitting this letter to your Presence The prince immediately took the Three Refuges and put on the religious garb He was under the care of the Grand Tutor but his dwelling place was always close to the Master On the fifth day of the twelfth month when the Prince was a full month old an imperial decree was issued to ordain seven persons to become monks in the name of Prince Buddha Light and the Master was also invited to tonsure the Prince To express his gratitude the Master submitted a letter to the Emperor saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that yesterday I received the imperial decree ordering me to shave the hair of Prince Buddha Light and to ordain seven persons to be monks By shaving his hair the passions of the Prince are cut off and the m o n k s ordained are to be his attendants and guards Thus the palace of Papiyan the Evil One is shaken and the hearts of the dwellers in the Heaven of Pure Abode are gladdened Since the great vow has been announced the grand blessedness will become more splendid It cannot be considered a humble and unskilled hand that applies the craft to the skin of a noble person Common men are allowed to enter the Way on auspicious occasions when all people high and low happily clap their hands with mixed feelings of sadness and joy I humbly think that it is important to be given protection when one is first dressed in swaddling clothes and that to put down ones hair orna ments is the inception of the cause of emancipation I believe that the Way of the Emperor and the Empress is concentrated beyond material limit and that their blessed ness permeates the human world What I wish is that the imperial descendants will enjoy blessings and that the Emperor sitting in front of jade screens will live on in prolonged peace and harmony reign ing over a hundred kotis of worlds for thousands and myriads of years As he is guarded and protected by benign deities all Buddhas will lay their hands upon his head to increase the glory of his wise and sagacious countenance and place their hopes for the prosperity of the Dharma on him The newly ordained monks having received deep grace should also look up to and seek to achieve deeds of the Way and observe the disciplinary rules in a perfect manner so as to fit in with the imperial decree With respect I am submitting this letter to your Presence On that day the Master also celebrated the occasion of Prince Buddha Light being one hill month old He presented him with a religious robe while writing a letter saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that I have heard that a whirlwind or a quickflying eagle takes several days to soar up to the sky and that when one is depicting the moon or polishing a pearl not quite round one requires more than ten days to achieve fullness and the round shape From this we may know that that which has received its spirituality from beyond the material world and shines colorfully in the middle of the sky will certainly reveal its beauty at a later time and renew what is good and fair Prince Buddha Light depending upon superior goodness will create auspicious ness By expounding the philosophy of equilibrium and harmony he will cultivate virtue If it were not for the Sun of Wisdom shining upon the Emperor and the Empress whose thoughts are washed in the Stream of the Dharma so that they place the l glorious achievements they have inherited from their prede cessors on a basis as solid as a huge rock and unveil the abandoned hair ornaments to heavenly beings how could the Prince have enjoyed the bliss of his swaddling clothes and sucked milk in security without harm or distress to grow into an intelligent youngster Now the new moon has been shining for its first round and the appearance of the Prince after a full month is indeed magnificent When the auspicious plant mingjia has grown new stalks during its monthly period of growth his lotuslike eyes will turn out to be really handsome Therefore everyone in the imperial palace is feeling pleased and all the common people are delighted the seven groups of Buddhist disciples will seek his protection and at the four gates of the center of learning scholars will stand long to wait for his instruction How could he be merely a man making daily inquiries into back biting or be like a crane or a horse ready for its rider I am lucky to have been favored with a promise to grant me protection but it is not my hope to form the relationship of teacher and disciple with the Prince However to foster a feeling of fraternity in the same brotherhood would be in keeping with my mind Thus I venture to offer a copy of the Prajhaparamita Sutra written in golden characters in one fascicle and kept in a case one copy of The Story o f the Scripture o f Requiting Favors as well as one religious robe an incense burner together with a table to place it on for burning incense a bathing jug a reading shelf a rosary a staff with pewter rings and a vessel containing bathing power all articles used by a monk to express my personal exultation I expect that he will ride in an auxiliary carriage and play with half a piece of jade substituting an arrow made with a stalk of bitter fleabane for a doubleedged sword so that when the good deities see it they will dance with delight and his great vow will be strengthened I make bold to offer these gifts of ordinary use and for my indiscre tion in doing so I really feel deep fear with trembling I humbly wish that the Emperor and the Empress may be served by honored and aged men like stars surrounding the North Star with the sun and the moon shining together at the same time May they gain the affection of myriads of common people and enjoy long life for ten thousand springs The prince is comparable to the Smaller Sea which is clear and lucent and covers a vast area I pray that a thousand Buddhas may stroke the head of Prince Buddha Light and that a hundred blessings may concen trate upon his body so that his Voice of Virtue will increase day by day and his good moral standard gives great assis tance to others In the second month during the spring of the second year of Xianqing  the Emperor favored the palace at Luoyang with his presence The Master also accompanied him bringing along with him five scripturetranslating monks each attended by one disciple with all their daily requisites provided at public expense Prince Buddha Light set off before the Emperor and the Master went with the Prince while the other monks followed behind Upon their arrival they were lodged at Jicui Palace In the fourth month during the summer the Emperor went to Mingde Palace to avoid the heat of the season The Master again accompanied him and was lodged at Feihua Palace Bordered by the Zao Brook in the south and stretching over the Luo River in the north this was known as Xianren Palace during the Sui dynasty In the fifth month an edict was issued ordering that the Master return to Jicui Palace to do his translation work Having received the imperial decree the Master wrote a letter to take his leave of the Emperor saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to state that I have respectfully received the kind edict permitting me to translate scriptures at Jicui Palace I am very grateful for this mu nificent treatment which I accept with a feeling of deep thanks and gladness The thought of departure from Your Majesty instantly made me feel sorry in my heart I respectfully consider that as the Emperor and the Empress are sage wise and magnanimous as well as kind and merciful in edification and moralizing all o f the people have enough and the unitary empire is at peace This would make me feel sad and melancholy but that at the mere sight of Cogon Grass Ridge I am glad to think that Your Majesty will stay here longer I respectfully hope that the Imperial Residence will enjoy everlasting peace and that the immortal peach will bring long life while Your Majesty passes a cool summer at the Sweet Spring as one might spend a pleasant time at the Jade Pond the dwelling place of immortals I hope that the trees growing in the warm season will usher in the autumn and that a cool breeze will prevail in the summer I shall be waiting for your returning carriage at the slabpaved path amid the fields and reverentially put away my darkcolored staff in the high forest to hail long life I shall be willing to follow Your Majesty to distant places numerous times With a very sad feeling of reluctance to leave I am submitting this letter to take farewell of Your Majesty My mental confusion is shown on my face and it causes me such uneasiness that it is as if fire and water were fighting in my mind When the Master was in the capital he had already translated the Abhidharmajhanaprasthana Sastra in thirty fascicles but had not yet completed the translation of the Mahavibhasa Sastra into Chinese With his recondite contrivances that extend far without impediments the Emperor has created everything to guard the imperial capital city from the surrounding suburbs and to glorify the palmleaf scriptures at Yulin A separate cottage for the work of translation has been opened and a grand preface has been composed as a favor from the Throne which will shine forever and transmit the brilliance for numerous generations in the future Your Majesty has suc ceeded to the Great Task the light of which will spread far in a graceful manner Your divine functions are renewed daily You never neglect to praise and distinguish the people I have undeservedly enjoyed natural endowments and have respectfully received sagacious edicts Each time I stroke my humble self I always feel deep fear while panting with uneasiness On a day last month a decree was received to the effect that among the scriptures and treatises to be translated into Chinese those which have not been pre viously translated should be done first while those which already have Chinese versions are to be translated anew at a later time But as for the Mahavibhasa Sastra a work in two hundred fascicles for the exposition of the Abhidharma jhanaprasthana Sastra only half of it has been previously translated into Chinese in some one hundred fascicles with many errors and mistakes that need to be rectified in a new translation Since last autumn I have been translating this text and have finished more than seventy fascicles with some one hundred thirty fascicles remaining untranslated As this treatise is very important for scholars I hope that I may be permitted to complete the translation As for trans lations of other scriptures and treatises either in full or in abridged forms which have faulty or mistaken renderings I also wish to retranslate them as the case may require to make them coincide with the holy teachings The Emperor granted the request The Master left Luoyang the capital when he was young As he was now among the retinue attending the Emperor on his journey he had a chance to pay a short visit to his native place where he went to see his old family house and inquired about his relations and old acquaintances But all of them were deceased except his elder sister who had married into the Zhang family at Yingzhou He sent for her and when they met each other they felt both grief and joy He asked his sister where the tombs of their parents were located then he went in person to sweep the graves and pay his respects to his deceased parents As the graves had been neglected for many long years they were in a state of dilapi dation thus he carefully selected another plot of good land desir ing to rebury the inner and outer coffins Although he had this intention he dared not take arbitrary action I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that I being unblessed by Heaven lost my parents when I was young and as it was during the chaotic times of the Sui dynasty the funeral ceremonies were performed in a hurry Time has flown by More than forty years have passed and the graves have become dilapidated almost disappearing completely When I look back on past events I cannot calm down my emo tions Together with my old only sister I have respectfully collected the coffins containing the remains of our deceased parents and removed them from that narrow unsightly place to be reburied at the West Plains so as to express in a small way our gratitude for the kindness of our parents which is as limitless as the great heavens Yesterday I was favored with an edict allowing me to go out on an inspection tour for two or three days As I have neither an elder nor a younger brother but only one old sister I have fixed by divination a distant date the twentyfirst day of this month to perform the reburial service Now because the affairs of the reburial have scarcely been arranged I am afraid that the two or three days granted to me will not be sufficient for me to make the arrangements I beg of Your Majesty the favor of allowing me to complete the reburial affairs and then return Moreover an honorable Brahmanic guest is travelling with me If the funeral functions are too brief and perfunctory I fear he would sneer at me For all these troubles and harassment caused by me I am extremely sorry and fearful I respectfully submit this letter to your Presence begging the kindness of Your Majesty which is like the sky covering all clouds drifting under it to comply with the request of an orphan After reading the letter the Emperor granted the request and also instructed the authorities to provide the Master with whatever he needed for the funeral service at public expense Having received such unusual favor the Master wrote another letter to the Emperor to express his thanks saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to state that my disasters are deep and my sins have accumulated in heaps but the deity in charge of punishment has failed to inflict the death penalty upon me so that I have dragged out my life to this day Luckily I accompanied the Imperial Carriage Thus I was able to come to my native place with permission to realize my long cherished wish to change the burial ground of my parents coffins Whatever was needed for display at the tumulus was provided through the kind ness condescendingly shown by the Emperor and the Empress to help me build the graves I did not expect that the light of the sun and the moon would shine even upon debris or that the humidity of clouds and rain would also moisten such wild plants as erigeron and artemisia With great gratitude toward the living as well as the deceased I am writing this letter to express our thanks to the Throne This is a matter of importance for me and being a humble person I am unable to express myself in full With the permission of the Emperor the Master reburied the coffins of his parents in another place and the funeral service was performed at public expense More than ten thousand people both monks and laymen of Luoyang attended the ceremony When Emperor Xiaowen of the Later Wei dynasty moved his capital from Dai to Luoyang he built Shaolin Monastery to the north of Shaoshi Mountain Consisting of twelve courts built along the slope of the mountain it has two separate parts known as the upper and lower sections With Mount Song on the east the monastery faces Shao Peak in the south while at its back in the north is a high ridge of mountains with three streams flowing down Towering rocks and precipitous steeps are reflected in the flying waterfalls Pine lichens twine round giant bamboos and cassia cypress lycium and catalpa trees form a dense forest presenting a grand and lovely view of peace and purity It is really a pleasant place The Western Terrace which is the most beautiful spot is the place where Bodhiruci translated scriptures and it is also the place where theDhyana Master Buddhabhadra used to sit in meditation A stupa preserving his body is still there At the end of the Daye period  a group of insurgents tried to bum it but found it incombustible People far and near thought it was a marvelous event At the foot of the range of mountains to the northwest of the monastery is Chen Village also known as Chenbu situated in the Phoenix Valley in the southeast of Goushi County which is the birthplace of the Master On the twentieth day of the ninth month in the autumn the Master asked permission to live at Shaolin Monastery to carry on his translation work He wrote a letter to the Emperor saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that I have heard that the road to enlightenment is long and the one who is prepared to go along it has to make use of funds and provisions and that the river of rebirth is deep and the one who wishes to cross it has to depend on a boat or a raft Funds and provisions consist of wonderful deeds of the three learnings and the three kinds of wisdom not merely rice pounded overnight or the like A boat or raft means pure deeds of the Eight Endurances and the Eight Insights and not merely a boat a raft or the like Because the Buddhas possessed  they were able to go to the other shore while ordinary people lacking them have to sink into the river of rebirth Thus the vast world of three spheres is completely flooded by the river of the seven leakings and the multitude of beings bom through the Four Modes of Birth are all submerged under the waves of the ten bond ages None of them are not tumbling in the waves or whirl ing in the mist of bewilderment and confusion without remission even at the end of an infinite amount of time when the kalpa rock is wiped away Their bewilderment and confusion become even stronger when as many kalpas as there are mustard seeds stored in a city have been exhausted They do not know to get out of the house on fire by riding on the Three Vehicles or how to repair to the treasurehouse by proceeding along the Eightfold Noble Path Really pitiful they are It is not the atmosphere of autumn that increases sigh ing but rather the sentiments of Confucius concerning gains and losses That is why I sometimes stop eating at the time of taking meals or start to wake up from sleep I have often reflected that this physical body is a temporal congre gation of various conditions and that it is impermanent thought after thought Even a tree growing by a riverside or a cluster of liana climbing on the wall of a well are not adequate to compare with its precariousness and fragility and the foam on the water in a dry city is not comparable to its instability Therefore any morning or evening may be the end of ones period of existence and nobody can hope for a long and lasting life The months and years elapse as fast as flowing water and in a blast of wind I have already reached the age of sixty Since time is passing so quickly one should be aware of how brief the span of human life is Moreover as I sought after the Dharma and looked for teachers and friends when I was young I travelled to many places at home and abroad and these long journeys made me feel quite exhausted In recent years I have felt all the more weak and feeble My funds and provisions for the journey to enlighten ment have not yet been sufficiently collected and my future is gradually shortened Not a day passes without my feeling worry about this matter indescribable by my writing brush and ink As regards my increment of fame and repu tation and the spread of my good name and prestige flying without having wings and ascending to the skies while I still sit on my seat receiving offerings of the four requisites and surpassing the glories of my contemporaries such cases are not to be found even among the ancients What merits have I to reach such a stage of privileges It is all due to the extensive waves of benevolence of the Emperor like the light of the sun and the moon shining in a curved way even upon things lying in corners so that the worthless rocks of Mount Yan are turned into precious stones and a jade is taken as a valuable steed With a sense of introspection I feel deeply ashamed Moreover to avoid completeness and avert fullness is a good adage of former sages to be content with few desires is also a truthful saying of all the Buddhas I beg permission to live in the forest on a mountain for the rest of my life so that I may worship the Buddha recite the scrip tures and walk up and down in meditation in order to repay the support and encouragement rendered me With the dignity of a Cakravartin King and as a monarch to spread the edification of the Dharma Your Majesty ordered that the texts of the scriptures obtained from the Western Region be translated into Chinese I an incompetent person have been unworthily favored with an appointment to take up the task Since I received the imperial order I have been busy without rest from morning until night every day Up to now I have translated more than six hundred fascicles of texts all of which are the theoretical gists of the Four Agamas in the Tnpitaka and pivotal works of both the Great and the Lesser Vehicles They constitute a compre hensive collection o f the deeds and positions of both ordi nary and saintly beings and a sea of the eighty thousand Dharma gates they are praised and sung as texts for pacify ing the country in the Western Region None of the literary definitions one should know is not found in them As one chooses timber in a fairy wood one may get a big or a small tree at ones option as one collects pearls at the seaside one is free to take square or round pearls They seem to be the principal gists for scholars With these translations I wish to repay the kindness of the state It is true that I can never do so in full but I hope I may repay one tenthousandth of the favors granted to me But to cut off and subdue passions one needs the aid of samadhi andprajna which are like the two wheels of a cart neither of them is dispensable As regards study and pondering over the scriptures it is the lore of wisdom while sitting relaxed in meditation in a forest is the lore of contemplation Since my youth I have engaged myself mostly in theoretical studies and have had no time to set my mind on the four categories of meditation and the nine grades of contemplation Now I wish to pay attention to the practice of meditation and tranquilize my mind in the water of contemplation so that I may curb my sentiments from being flippant like an ape and hamper my mind from galloping like a horse If I do not seclude myself from the world to live in the mountains I shall not be able to achieve my object This is where the Tnpitaka Mas ter Bodhiruci of the Later Wei dynasty period translated scriptures One may really stay here to practise meditation and contemplation Moreover even the two Shus who were courtiers understood to retire and live in seclusion after resigning their glorious posts and the two laymen Chao Fu and Xu You also knew to abide in truth and preserve naturalness I have what is more renounced my home for the sake of the Dharma but on the contrary I am staying inside a city being stimulated by a cool breeze I feel all the more ashamed whenever I think of this matter I respectfully believe that Your Majesty is brighter than the Seven Luminaries and illuminates down to the nether world beneath nine layers of earth If I am granted my request I shall follow the example of the good behavior of Huiyuan of Lu Mountain and continue the pure moral integrity of Daolin of Yan Hill But I still hope to engage myself from time to time in translating scriptures in leisure hours left after practising meditation which I would be very glad to do After reading the letter the Emperor did not give his consent On the twentyfirst day of that month the Emperor personally wrote a reply with his Divine Pen saying By reading your letter we have come to know that you wish to live a retired life in the mountains amid springs after the example of Daolin and Huiyuan of past ages and to engage in practising meditation in tranquillity along the tracks of Buddhacinga and Kumarajiva to set up a standard for the present time We are devoid of knowledge and have acquired little learning having never studied what is lofty and profound But with our shallow judgement and superficial experience we do not see the advisability of your proposal Serving as a ferry or a bridge in the Three Worlds to conduct and guide all beings of the Four Modes of Birth with bright intelligence issuing from the lamp of your mind with your mentality crystalized like tranquil water by the practice of contemplation Your Reverence cannot be obstructed by the dusts of sentiment so how can the waves of mental agitation startle you As you abide in morality there is no need for you to go to live in the overlapping ranges of Taihua Mountain Since you can make a lodging out of voidness and tranquility Shaoshi Mountain with its layers of peaks is not the only retreat in which you can stay Pray put away what you have said and do not make the request again Then the public marketplace will be a great hermitage to be valued not only by ancient sages alone Moreover you may greatly increase your knowl edge to win the esteem of the present age Since the imperial decree ordered him to cut short his request the Master did not venture to say anything more I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that the messenger Li Junxin has arrived with the decree written personally by Your Majesty for me The vigorous strokes of your hand writing are beautiful in the characters written in vermilion and the wise phrases are as splendid as the mystic diagram that emerged from the Yellow River The words appear like rocks piled together in the shapes of mountains and hills and they seem to be suffused with the vitality of wind and clouds I never expected that in the autumnal days of my life I might read literary writing as beautiful as flowers in springtime or that while staying between the Yi and Luo Rivers I would all of a sudden see a piece of precious jade from the Kunlun and Jin Mountains I held it in both hands and danced with delight Formerly when Jizhong received a letter from the Lord of Wei it only expressed friendly feeling at their being parted from each other while the letter sent by the Emperor of the Jin dynasty to Huiyuan merely ordered that the monk be provided with rice In their letters no such idea as making a lodging out of voidness and tranquillity is seen neither is there the friendly emotion of the instruction that the public marketplace can be a great hermitage From this I certainly know that the bosom of Your Majesty cherishes everything in both the mundane and the supermundane categories to the utmost degree But I am of the disposition of white silk and particularly fear the colors red and blue my body is of the nature of kudzu and climbing plants that really need pine and willow trees to depend upon Therefore I ventured with utmost ignorance to submit a report at the risk of my life in the hope that the compassion of a sage monarch ruling over his country would not forsake even a wild duck or a quail and that the moistening effect of clouds and rain would not desert a spider or a rooteating insect But the illustrious decree arrived without granting me permission however it still favored me with praise and preserved my glory in a roundabout way As my five senti ments are trembling I do not know by which one I should abide Since I have put aside my request I dare not repeat it I am respectfully writing this letter to express my thanks shuddering more and more in fear In the winter on the fifth day of the eleventh month the first birthday anniversary of Prince Buddha Light the Master again presented a religious robe to him with a letter saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that I have heard that one who passes by orchids blooming in the Purple Garden will surely feel happy and that when one comes across a cassia tree flourishing beside a stream of bluish water one will be delighted by its fragrance If even a plant or a tree possesses such  it is needless to speak of a human being and an imperial offspring at that I humbly believe that the Emperor and the Empress having imbibed divine and wise endowments possess the virtues of Heaven and earth placating and pacifying the various regions of the empire and fostering all their subjects as their children At the same time they have constructed a large number of monasteries and have widely performed meritorious deeds in order to make the Throne constant and unchangeable and to strengthen the destiny of the empire and make it as strong as a diamond It is their wonderfully good way of spiritual cultivation that makes the Crown Prince more and more intelligent and energetic day by day As for the Prince of Luzhou his extraordinary talent is becoming ever more brilliant Prince Buddha Lights youthful wisdom has augmented his luster which may be said to have overtopped the Zhou and excelled the Shang dynasties to match the Yellow Emperor in sublimity This is a matter for celebration by descendants for ten thousand years into the future Though a humble person of lowly position I have been allowed the privilege of having interviews from time to time with the Prince and others to my delight real joy and happiness at the bottom of my heart As today is the first birthday of Prince Buddha Light gifts must be offered in accordance with social etiquette and so out of my benighted sincerity I solemnly present a religious robe to him I respect fully wish the Prince to be protected by ten thousand deities sustained by a hundred blessings and in peace and felicity whether awake or asleep May he have a balanced appetite for his feedings of milk May he perpetuate and make pros perous the Triple Gem subjugate the four Maras practise the Way of a Bodhisattva and succeed to the causes of a Tathagata I am extremely happy to see a jade calyx on the celestial branch with beautiful and exuberant flowers I beg to submit this letter together with the religious robe to your Presence The Master was then engaged in translation at Jicui Palace As he labored without even momentary stops he fell ill from constant overwork When this was reported to the Emperor he was unhappy to hear about it and dispatched by imperial order the palace physician Lu Hongzhe to comfort the Master With inces sant feelings of pain and joy intermingled the Master wrote a letter of thanks to the Emperor saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that the envoy Lii Hongzhe and others have arrived with an imperial order to console me while I am suffering from illness and to permit me to go out of the palace for recuperation When the gracious edict suddenly arrived my feeble body instantly stood up as if I were in the presence of the Crown with awe as if I were placed on the thin ice over a deep pond As my way of conserving good health is contrary to regular methods disease and illness have befallen me Since I left your Presence I have felt doubly troubled by a pain in the heart a depressed sensation in the back bonesore and painful muscles abrupt loss of appetite insomnia and weaker and weaker breath Fearing that something unthoughtof might happen to defile the buildings of the palace I thought of moving out and discarding myself in gullies but I feared that it might cause alarm to Your Majesty thus I dared not report the matter to the Throne With the aid of my gate registration I went out of the palace to the monastery where due to exhaustion and fatigue my disease became critical and my mind was also separated from the present time of good governance Then the court physician Zhang Dezhi of the Palace Medical Department treated me with acupuncture by which I was gradually cured of my ailment it also enabled me to pre serve my head Recollecting the guilt of having taken arbi trary action I am awaiting condign punishment I humbly believe that the sun and the moon with their brightness always forgive me for my stupidity and awkward ness and that the moistening effect of the rivers and the sea has been specially lenient toward my faults but how can imperial grace be extended to a humble person distorting the law in favor of a common institution I hope that justice will be upheld so as to maintain the solemnity of the judiciary A miscarriage of justice can be lightly done but the use of the axe is a great matter My remnant soul and decaying body are still under the illumination of impe rial favor and I pat my chest to remember your sayings which are engraved on my flesh and bones I consider that I am not lying in my sickbed because of a common ail ment But my regret is that I could not repay great kindness before the collapse of my hum ble life I respectfully think that Your Majesty is assiduous sparing no pains to take part personally in hunting expedi tions and to inspect military forces in order to train the troops You have shown kindness both in releasing a uni corn and in recording the merit of one who offered a phoenix for which people assembled from far and near to cele brate Both the high and low were simultaneously joyous while the god o f wind swept away dust and the mountain deities protected the wilderness When you went to pronounce the explicit Precepts for a hundred days you completed the mission and returned in twelve days You disdained travel ling around on fine horses like the eight reputed steeds o f King Mu of the Zhou dynasty and would turn back from a nearby place The Imperial Carriage may be halted but your constant remembrance is a comfort to me In managing affairs I hesitate for fear that I might commit dereliction of duty at the end of my life With utmost grati tude and dread I am respectfully submitting this letter for your hearing while awaiting punishment In perplexity and trepidation not knowing what to do I am crouching to listen to your edict The Emperor was quite pleased to read the letter Three days later he dispatched an envoy to welcome the Master to the palace where he was entertained with the four requisites of a monk for many days in succession Then the Master was sent back by imperial order to Jicui Palace to continue his task of translation In the winter in the twelfth month the palace at Luoyang was made the Eastern Capital Because the area delimited for the capital was too small portions of the counties of Sishui in Zheng zhou and Heyang in Huaizhou in the east were incorporated into the environs of the capital while in the west Guzhou was abro gated and Yiyang Yongning Xinan Mianchi and such counties were taken and put under the jurisdiction of the metropolis As the position of the Masters hometown was thereby elevated he wrote a letter of thanks to the Emperor saying I Sramana Xuanzang beg to say that I have heard that the Quails Head demarcated the boundary of the State of Qin as a testimony of God presaging that the Qin Emperors reign would be as strong as a golden city and that the scripts presented by a tortoise to the Emperor of the Xia dynasty opened a hole through which to peep at the Jade Spring in the imperial city From this we may know that the purpose of divine gifts is apparently the Emperors edifica tion Good praise forecasts the distant future and a light is placed high to shine to the utmost limit I humbly believe that the Emperor and the Empress manage everything adjudicate all matters and pacify the secular world with impartiality You have repaired to an important habitable place in the middle of the land and settled there in the course of a pleasure trip Following the example of the preeminent and glorious old system an outer city wall has been built after the fashion of the capital of the Zhou dynasty at Hao But a plain and simple palace was still cherished in your mind and hard labor was substituted for the service system of old days As you were absorbed in riding your galloping horse you detested living in comfort and rose early in the morning How can one indulge in the Emperors kind consideration shown in his announcement of his irrevocable decree Thus when the order was first issued the luxuriant mountains and rivers changed their appearance At the beginning of the development of the system the flying mist and clouds altered their colors The lofty ridges of the palace halls are brilliant in the sunshine and the imperial highway is peaceful with a gentle breeze The deities responded to prayers and moral relations among the people were agreeable and harmonious If Your Majesty wishes to compose a poem on the bream of Wuchang and take pleasure in shifting the imperial resi dence I will vie with the crane standing in a pavilion on the heights to attend the imperial auxiliary carriages I will imme diately slight the dependence of the State of Zheng upon the State of Jin and depreciate the tactics of Liu Ba toward Zhang Fei Some former kings who were narrowminded established Fen and Luoyi as their capitals at different times but our lord who is in control of every thing constructed both the Yi Valley and Xianyang as his seats of government simultaneously The brilliant imperial clan will be prosperous and the destiny of the empire will last to the distant future It will certainly pacify Pingluo in the east and reach the Jianzhang Palace in the west The standing musician played the sheng to wish for a long life and peace and happiness are recorded in elegant language that is spread far and wide through intonation Being a man of no use I am unable to render any service My fear about this is becoming deeper and deeper But my native village is included in the suburbs of the capital in the region of the Three Rivers This honor which will last a thousand years makes it a prosperous new town My poor cottage has vanished but my humble life is still in existence I am glad that my native place is incorporated into the capital area though I was not embarrassed to live outside the pass Moreover jubilation of nationwide stability is a matter for common rejoicing far and near and the good health of Your Majesty is what the humble people specially bear in mind Being overwhelmed by extreme gladness I respectfully sub mit this letter to express my gratitude for your hearing In the first month in the spring of the third year  the Emperor returned to the Western Capital and the Master also followed him back Beginning with His Return to the Western Capital with the Emperor from Luoyang in the First Month of the Third Year of Xianqing and Ending with His Demise at Yuhua Palace in the Second Month of the First Year of Linde In the first month of the third year of Xianqing  the Emperor returned from the Eastern Metropolis to the Western Capital and the Master also returned with him In the seventh month during the autumn an edict was again issued asking the Master to move his residence to Ximing Monas tery This monastery was constructed on the nineteenth day of the eighth month in the autumn of the first year of Xianqing  A decree had previously been announced that one Taoist temple and one Buddhist monastery should be built in the name of the Crown Prince at the site of the old house of the Prince of Pu on Yankang Street Thus the whole site was used for the construction of the Buddhist monas tery while the Taoist temple was separately built on Puning Street The Buddhist monastery was built first and the construction was completed in the sixth month during the summer o f the same year The monastery was  bu on each side with a circumference of several li On both the left and the right sides there were thoroughfares while in the front and at the back there were markets and hamlets Green locust trees were planted in rows outside the buildings and a brook of limpid water flowed through the compound The corridors halls storeyed houses and terraces were so tall that they would frighten flying birds and touch the Galaxy The gilded door knockers and the beams painted in colors were as dazzling as the glow of sunlight There were ten courtyards with more than four thousand rooms The whole estab lishment was so splendidly decorated that neither Tongtai Monas tery of the Liang dynasty nor Yongning Monastery of the Wei dynasty could surpass it The Emperor had previously instructed the authorities to select fifty learned monks each with an attendant Later he also ordered that one hundred fifty youths who were practising moral deeds be chosen by examination to be ordained as monks On the thirteenth day of that month a ceremony of ordination was per formed in the monastery and the Master was invited to supervise the ordination On the fourteenth day of the seventh month in the autumn the monks were welcomed into the monastery with a procession of people holding banners and umbrellas and playing music just as when the Master and the imperial inscription were welcomed into Cien Monastery The Emperor ordered Ximing Monastery to furnish one of its best rooms for the use of the Master with ten of the newly ordained sramaneras  Haihui and the others to be his disciples As the Master had been respected by the preceding ruler the reigning Emperor after succeeding to the Throne venerated him all the more Palace messengers and cour tiers were sent to inquire after him without cessation A total of more than ten thousand rolls of floss silk damask and brocade together with several hundred monks garments patchwork vest ments and cassocks were offered to him as alms at different times After receiving these gifts the Master spent them all for the construction of pagodas for copying scriptures or making images of the Buddha for the benefit of the country or for alms to the poor as well as to foreign Brahamanic guests He made a vow to make ten kotisone koti being one million of images of the Buddha which all were made In the Eastern Country the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra was highly esteemed Although it had been translated into Chinese during a previous dynasty the translation was incomplete so the people requested that the Master kindly translate it anew But as this sutra was a voluminous work the Master feared that if he stayed in the capital where there were many distractions human life being ephemeral he might not be able to fulfil the task Thus he asked for permission to live at Yuhua Palace to translate the sutra and the Emperor consented In the tenth month during the winter o f the fourth year  the Master left the capital for Yuhua Palace together with other learned monktranslators and disciples All their supplies were provided for them as in the capital Upon his arrival there he was lodged at the Sucheng Court On the first day of the first month in the spring of the fifth year  he started to translate the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra the original Sanskrit text of which consisted of two hundred thousand verses In compliance with their wishes the Master planned to translate the text in the way that Kumarajiva did his translations by deleting the superfluities and cutting out the repetitions Having thought so he had a dream one night in which he saw some extremely fearful things as warnings to him such as sailing in a dangerous boat or walking on a precipitous peak or a fierce animal pouncing upon him He managed to escape these predicaments with trembling and perspiration After awakening he was fright ened and told his disciples while making up his mind to translate the text in full In the night he saw various Buddhas and Bodhisattvas emitting light from the middle of their eyebrows shining over his body and making him feel happy and pleasant The Master also saw that he held flowers and lamps to offer to the Buddhas or that he ascended a high pulpit to preach the Dharma to an assembly of many people who surrounded and praised him with veneration Or he dreamed that some people offered him famous fruits When he awoke he felt pleased and happy and dared not make any alteration or abridgement but translated the work exactly as the Sanskrit text was The Buddha preached this sutra at four different places namely It consists of a total of sixteen parts combined into one book The Master had obtained three different versions of this text in the Western Region and at the time of translating it he compared the three versions to fix the correct wording whenever he came across dubious or mistaken points in the text He made attentive researches before he put it into Chinese his scrupulosity and carefulness had no parallel since ancient times Whenever he hesitated at some peculiar phrase or obscure meaning he would always feel an unusual mental state as if someone were solving his doubts His mind would suddenly become clear as if he were seeing the sun when the clouds opened up He said Such powers o f understanding are not due to my shallow knowledge they are due to the spiritual assistance of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas In the first part of the sutra there is the Chapter on the Adornment and Purification of Buddha Lands in which it is related that various Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas for the sake of the prajnaparamita and by their supernatural powers carried the best gems and jewels all kinds of wonderful incense and flowers food and drink of a hundred tastes garments music and all excellent things produced at will that are pleasant to the five senses as well as various other offerings of the great chiliocosm to adorn the places where the Dharma was preached During that night Huide abbot of Yuhua Monastery and Jiashang a monktranslator had a similar dream in which they saw that Yuhua Monastery was broadly and extensively decorated and purified with beautiful adornments of pennants and curtains precious carts flowery banners and musicians performing music everywhere in the monastery They also saw that innumerable monks holding flowery canopies and offerings like those described above came together to offer them to the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra All the alleyways and walls in the monastery were deco rated with gorgeous brocade and famous flowers on which the monks stepped and walked were scattered over the ground As for the Court for Translating Scriptures it was doubly fine and exqui site just like the land with precious adornments depicted in the scripture They also heard that sermons were being given in three halls of the court with the Master preaching in the middle one Upon seeing this sight they felt delighted and awoke They both sent to see the Master and told him about their dream The Master said As we are just now translating this chapter the Bodhisattvas must have offerings for it Since Your Reverences have seen it do you not believe it Beside the hall there were two apple trees that suddenly blossomed several times out of season in a very lovely manner with sixpetalled flowers of brilliant red and white colors The monks discussed the matter in detail saying that it was a sign of the revival of the theory of prajna and that the six petals signified the Six Paramitas of reaching the other shore But at the time of translating this scripture the Master was constantly worried about the impermanence of human life He said to the monks I am sixtyfive this year and I am sure I shall end my life here in this monastery As this sutra is a voluminous work I have often feared that I might not be able to complete the translation So every one of us should work hard with more effort and spare no pains On the twentythird day of the tenth month in the winter of the third year of Longshuo  the translation was completed in six hundred fascicles altogether with the title Daborejing The Scripture o f Great Wisdom in Chinese Closing his palms together with exhilaration the Master told his disciples This sutra has a special relationship with the land of the Han people It is on account of this sutra that I have come to this Yuhua Monastery If I had stayed as before in the capital where there were many miscellaneous affairs to distract my mind how could I have finished the work in time It is with the spiritual assistance of the Buddhas and under the protection of the dragons and deities that I have completed the task As this is a text that will guard the nation and a great treasure of men and heavenly beings you all should rejoice and be glad at its completion After the celebration ceremony was over Jizhao the duty distributor of Yuhua Monastery prepared a feast as an offering  On that day the sutra was taken from Sucheng Hall to Jiazhou Hall where the feast was arranged for exposition and recitation When the sutra was being taken this work on prajfia emitted a light and flowers rained from Heaven while music was heard in the air accompanied by an unusual fragrance Having witnessed these spiritual auspices the Master was greatly pleased and said to his disciples It is recorded in the sutra itself that in this country there will be people taking delight in Mahayana teachings All kings ministers and followers of the four groups who copy receive and keep it as well as recite and circulate it will be reborn in the heavens and obtain ultimate emancipation Since there is such a passage we must not keep silent about it On the twentieth day of the eleventh month he asked his disciple Kuiji to write a report to the Emperor entreating him to compose a preface for the sutra On the seventh day of the twelfth month Feng Mao a court secretary announced an imperial decree consenting to the request The impure body should be discarded far away Upon hearing these words his disciples wept piteously While wiping their tears they said Your health is still tolerably good and your countenance is as usual Why do you suddenly say such things The Master said I know it myself How can you understand it On the first day of the first month in the spring of the first year of Linde  the monktranslators and other monks of Yuhua Monastery earnestly requested that the Master translate the Maharatnakuta Sutra into Chinese Now I wish to go to the Lanzhi Valley and other places to pay my last homage to a koti of Buddhas images Then he went out with his disciples and the monks looked at one another with tearful eyes After worshipping the images he returned to the monastery and engaged exclusively in practising the Way doing no more translation On the eighth day his disciple Xuanjue a monk from Gaochang dreamed that a tall and magnificent pagoda suddenly collapsed He was surprised at the sight and got up to tell the Master who said It has nothing to do with you It is a sign of my dissolution In the evening of the ninth day when the Master was crossing a ditch behind his room he tumbled and slightly injured his shin Then he was confined to bed by an illness and his breath gradually weakened On the sixteenth day he said in a dreaming condition There is a white lotus flower as large as a dish pure and lovely before my eyes On the seventeenth day he again dreamed that he saw hundreds and thousands of men gigantic in stature and all clad in silk bringing with them gorgeous embroideries beautiful flowers and valuable jewels to decorate the Masters bedroom up to the whole Court for Translating Scriptures inside and out Even the hills and woods behind the court were decked with banners and pennants in a colorfiil way and music was played He also saw outside the gate numberless precious carriages carrying hundreds and thousands of different varieties of fragrant food and delicious fruits not products of the human world to be offered to the Master The Master declined the offerings and said Such delicious food can be enjoyed only by those who have attained supernatural powers Not having attained to such a stage how dare I accept it In spite of his declining the food was offered to him without stop The Master also said According to this phenomenon it seems that what blessedness and wisdom I have cultivated in my life have not been acquired in vain I believe that the law of causality as taught by the Buddha is not false Then he asked the Venerable Jiashang to make a list of the scriptures and commentaries he had translated into Chinese which amounted to a total of  works in  fascicles It was also recorded that he had painted pictures of BhrkutI and Maitreya each  times as well as ten kotis of clay statues He had also transcribed the Vajracchedikdprajndpdramita Sutra the Bhaisajyaguru Sutra the Sadmukhadharani Sutra and other scriptures each  times He had given alms to more than  poor people made offerings to more than  monks lighted hun dreds and thousands of lamps and redeemed the lives of tens of thousands of living creatures When the list had been made he asked Jiashang to read it out Having heard it he closed his hands palm to palm with happiness and jubilation He also told his disciples The time of my passing away is approaching and I wish to make a confession of the offences I have committed against the disciplinary rules in the presence of the community of monks Let all the monks who are able to come be assembled here Then he gave up his robes and other property to make more images and invited the monks to perform a ceremony On the twentythird day a feast was prepared for the monks and alms were offered to them On the same day also asked the sculptor Song Fazhi to erect an image o f the Buddha in the posture of attaining enlightenment in the Jiazhou Hall When the skeleton had been finished he happily bade farewell to the monks of the monastery and the monktranslators as well as his disciples saying This pestilent body of mine is deeply abomi nable Since my work has been done it is unnecessary for me to live any longer I wish to share the merits of the blessedness and wisdom I have cultivated with all living beings so that we all may be reborn in the Tusita Heaven to serve Maitreya Bodhisattva together with his inner retinue The realm of sight is void and all sense realms up to the realm of mind are also void The realm of sightperception is void and up to the realm of the mental faculty are also void Ignorance is void and all nidanas up to old age and death are also void Even enlighten ment is void and voidness itself is also void He also uttered a stanza and taught the people to repeat Homage to Maitreya Tathagata the Fully Enlightened One May I be reborn among them after I have forsaken my present life At that time the abbot Huide again dreamed that he saw a thousand golden figures coming from the east and alighting at the Court for Translating Scriptures while the air was filled with fragrant flowers At midnight on the fourth day of the second month Mingzang a master of meditation who tended the Master during his illness saw two men both about ten feet in height holding together a white lotus flower the size of a small wheel with three layers of petals and a leaf more than one foot long very clean and lovely which was brought into the presence of the Master Those who held the flower said All the evil deeds you have done to harm others from time without beginning have been annulled on account of your indisposition You should rejoice at it The Master looked at them and put his hands palm to palm for a long while Then he supported his head with his right hand stretched his left hand over his left thigh and lay down on his right side with his feet relaxed one on the other He remained in this posture until his death and he did not move nor drink or eat anything At midnight of the fifth day his disciples Puguang and others inquired of him Are you sure Reverend Sir that you will be reborn in the inner court of Maitreyas abode The Master replied I am sure to be reborn there After he had said so he panted and his breath gradually diminished His body gradually became cool from the feet up to the top which was the last spot that remained warm His countenance was of a pinkish white color with an unusually relaxed and pleasant expression did not change for seven weeks nor did it have any offensive smell If he had not adorned himself with meditation and wisdom and guarded himself with the fragrance of the disciplinary rules how could he have attained to such a condition In Cien Monastery there was a monk Minghui who practised good deeds diligently and ascetically and recited scriptures or walked in meditation during the first the middle and the last parts of the night without being idle or negligent On the night of the Masters demise he was walking around the Buddha hall to practice the Way after midnight when he saw four white rainbows stretching from the north toward the south brightly and distinctly through Gemini right over the pagoda in Cien Monastery He won dered what they meant and remembered that when the Tathagata entered nirvana twelve white rainbows stretched from the west right through the constellation Taiwei whereupon the Great Saint passed away Now might this phenomenon be a symbol signifying the death of the Master at Yuhua Monastery At dawn he told the monks what he had seen and they all thought it strange On the morning of the ninth day tidings of the Masters death which had coincided with the occurrence of the phenomenon actually reached the capital Those who heard about it were amazed at the unusual spiritual event The Master was over seven feet in stature and his body was of a pinkish white color with broad eyebrows and bright eyes He was as dignified and solemn as a sculpture and as handsome as a figure in a painting His voice was clear and farreaching and he spoke elegantly and sonorously so that his listeners were never bored Whether he was with his disciples or entertaining guests he would sit for half a day without movement He liked to wear Gandhara costume cut out of fine felt only neither too tight nor too loose When he walked he carried himself gracefully looking straight ahead never glancing sideways His magnificent manners were like the Great River flowing over the earth and his brilliant wisdom resembled a lotus flower growing in the water Moreover he always observed the disciplinary rules in the same strict man ner from the beginning to the end  He took better care of the disciplinary rules than he would take of a floating bag when crossing a river and he held to the rules more tightly than he would bind a bundle of cogon grass He loved contentment and natural simplicity and did not like social life Once he entered a place for practising the Way he would not come out unless there was a summons from the court After the death of the Master during the period of Qianfeng  the Vinaya Master Daoxuan the abbot of Ximing Monas tery who had the power of communicating with divine beings once saw a deity appearing before him The deity avowed himself to be a disciple saying I am a son of General Weito among the heavenly beings and I am in charge of ghosts and divine beings When the Tathagata was about to enter nirvana he instructed this disciple of yours to guard and maintain his bequeathed Dharma in Jambudvlpa I have recently seen that you are pure and strict in observing the disciplinary rules that you pay attention to the texts of the Vinaya Pitaka and that people of the four quarters who have doubts come to consult you for a solution But there are to be found from time to time abnormal and erroneous points in the commen taries you have written on the major and minor Precepts As you are getting advanced in age you have been incorrect in your writings which might mislead people of later generations Thus I have come to let you know the Buddhas intention Then he pointed out the errors and mistakes in the commentaries and exegeses Daoxuan had written on the major and minor Precepts and asked him to correct them Upon hearing this Daoxuan trem bled with both grief and joy Then he asked about various dubious and ambiguous points found in the scriptures disciplinary rules and commentaries to which he could not find a solution The deity solved them all for him Again he asked about the morality of the monks who had transmitted the Dharma since ancient times and he also inquired about the Master The deity said in reply Since ancient times teachers have been either strong in understanding the Dharma but weak in practising it or weak in understanding but strong in practice without a unitary standard The Venerable Xuanzang alone cultivated the deeds of both blessedness and wisdom in nine lives In every incarnation he was always learned and erudite intelligent and eloquent always the first and foremost in the land of Cina in Jambudvipa Such were his blessed virtues also His translations are good both in literary style and in quality and are not inconsistent with the Sanskrit texts Owing to the power of his good deeds he has now been reborn in the inner court of Maitreya in the Tusita Heaven where he will hear the Dharma with comprehension and understanding and he will never again be bom in the human world After inquiring about the Dharma from Maitreya he will gain comprehension and understanding and attain to sainthood Having received these words of the deity Daoxuan took his leave and returned and he recorded this event in several fascicles that are now stored at Ximing Monastery Based on this account we may say that if it were not for the deity who would know the Masters high talents and excellent virtue How could the mind of an ordinary man conjecture them When the Master was ill Xu Xuanbei an official sent to inspect the translation of scriptures submitted a memorial to the Emperor on the third day of the second month in that year saying that the Master had been ill because of an injury to his foot On the seventh day o f that month a decree was issued to the effect that the Palace Service Department should send physicians to attend him with medicine The authorities immediately dispatched the imperial physicians Chang Dezhi and Cheng Tao to go posthaste with medicine to see the Master But when they arrived the Master has already passed away and it was too late to give him any medical treatment Then Du Shilun Prefectural Magistrate of Fangzhou reported the demise of the Master to the Emperor who was so much grieved at the sad news that he suspended court affairs and said We have lost a national treasure At that time all the civil and military officials wept piteously and the Emperor after utter ing the remark also could not refrain from sobbing mournfully On the next day the Emperor said again to his ministers What a pity that our country has lost the Venerable Xuanzang Although he was only one man it may be said that a pillar of the community of monks has collapsed and that all living beings of the Four Modes of Birth have lost their guide It is like a host that has suddenly sunk in the vast sea of suffering or a lamp that has gone out in a dark room After saying so the Emperor sobbed without cease On the twentysixth day of that month an imperial edict was issued saying It is reported by Du Shilun that the Venerable Monk Xuan zang of Yuhua Monastery has passed away All require ments for the funeral service should be provided at public expense On the sixth day of the third month another decree was issued saying Since the Venerable Xuanzang of Yuhua Monastery has died his translation work should be suspended The scrip tures he had already translated into Chinese should be copied by the government as usual while the other untrans lated texts should be handed over to Cien Monastery for safekeeping and must not be lost Those of the Masters disciples and cotranslators who were not formerly resident monks at Yuhua Monastery should be allowed to return to their original monasteries On the fifteenth day of the third month there was another decree saying On the day of the funeral of the late Venerable Monk Xuanzang o f Yuhua Monastery the monks and nuns in the capital should be permitted to make banners and canopies to escort his remains to the cemetery Being a person learned in the Way and highly virtuous the Master was deeply adored by the reigning monarch who therefore issued decrees repeatedly in favor of him after his death Then his disciples in compliance with his last instructions made a hearse out of bamboo mats and carried the coffin back to the capital where it was placed in the Hall for Translating Scrip tures in Cien Monastery Several hundred of his disciples cried so piteously that they shook the earth and the monks and laymen in the capital who hurried to the place weeping and sobbing amounted to hundreds and thousands every day On the fourteenth day of the fourth month when the burial was to take place east of the Chan River the monks nuns and laypeople in the metropolis arranged a funeral procession holding more than five hundred articles such as unadorned canopies and white banners curtained carriages used on the occasion of nirvana a golden coffin kept inside a silver one the sala trees and so forth arrayed in the streets one after another like clouds touching the Galaxy while funeral music sounded mournfully in the air up to the sky Over a million people in the capital city and from various states within a radius of five hundred li attended the funeral procession Although the funeral affairs were arranged gorgeously the Masters coffin was carried in a bamboomat hearse The silk traders of the Eastern Market used three thousand rolls o f silk fabrics to make a nirvana bier decorated with resplendent jade ornaments in an extremely fine manner and asked that the Masters coffin be placed on it Fearing that it might be contrary to their teachers wishes the disciples did not consent Thus they placed the Masters three regular robes as well as a patchrobe worth a hundred pieces of gold and offered by the state on the bier to proceed in front while the bamboomat hearse followed behind it All the onlookers shed tears and were choked with sobs On that day over thirty thousand people both monks and laymen spent the night in the cemetery On the morning of the fifteenth day when the coffin pit had been filled up a feast was prepared at the cemetery for the people before they dispersed At that time the sky darkened and the earth changed color and the birds and beasts cried in lamentation If even the animals felt so sorrowful it is needless to say how sad the hearts of human beings felt They all remarked that the boat of compassion had suddenly sunk in the deep river of passion and that the light of the Lamp of Wisdom had gone out when the long night was still dark They were as pained at the departure of the Master as if they had lost their own eyes It was not merely comparable to the collapse of a mountain or the ruin of an arbor How piteous it was On the eighth day of the fourth month in the second year of Zongzhang  an edict was issued that the tomb o f the Master be shifted to the plain north of the Fan River where a pagoda and a temple were constructed This was because the original tomb was too near the capital and was visible from the imperial palace so that the Emperor was often grieved at the sight of it The ceremony for the reburial was duly performed The disciples were moved by sadness and way farers felt deep sorrow and were just as mournful as before Comment by Shi Huili We observe that stars at dusk and the moon at night continue the brightness of the sun that has sunk in the west and that the three rivers and nine streams help expand the sea in the east Such is the way that things assist each other There is no difference between them and men in the transmitting of tradition Since the brilliance of the King of the Dharma faded away and Ananda presided over the Assembly of Elders a thousand years have elapsed and ten generations have passed away Each of them cherished his own great ambition and all of them were profuse in superior wisdom They carried on their shoulders the teachings bequeathed by the Buddha and guided heavenly beings and men while their Way could becalm a whirlwind and their spirit could overturn the seas and mountains Some of them could stretch a fing er to produce moistening rain or issue a marvellous light to illumine another ones rooms Others wished to spread the Dharma at a frontier monastery risking winds and waves on the dangerous journey and still others were openminded in dealing with others and sought provisions to travel to deadly places As the source of purity is inexhaustible we now have the Master who has succeeded to the tradition The Master was endowed with the spirit of the stars and imbued with the ascending vitality of the great mountains his talents surpassed the bamboo arrows of the east a synonym for men of genius and his reputation was as good as that of the bronze vessels of the south His refined character was unusually prominent and his strong virtue was unparalleled He assumed the salvation of all beings of the Four Modes of Birth as his own responsibility and regarded the establishment of the Right Dharma as his personal duty His intelligence and great talents origi nated spontaneously while his appreciation of the Way and his disdain of worldly glory arose out of his natural ten dencies As regards the profundity of his versatility and wide learning he capped and was even higher than Daoheng and Sengzhao and his ability to scrutinize abstrusity and perceive what was subtle outstripped and went even farther than that of Daosheng and Daorong He will make the edification of the Image Period shine again during the Period of Decadence That was why a man of such brilliance and virtue was born in this world The Master believed that although the virtuous teachers of ancient times and in his day all based their expositions of the scriptures and commentaries on the holy teachings they had cited different texts and caused theoretical disputations in a confused manner for a long time More than a hundred topics were in dispute such as whether the alayavijnana suffers retribution or not whether a transformed person has mind or not whether or not the sin of those who repeatedly threaten the harmony of the Sangha might be absolved by hearing or through the influence of the Dharma and so forth All these are compli cated subjects in the Tripitaka and the Four Agamas and were key problems for both the Greater and the Lesser Schools which were not solved by former sages and com monly caused doubt among present savants The Master too was hesitant about these points and this made him unhappy He sighed with emotion and remarked The scrip tures and commentaries we have in this land are but branches of the Gate of the Dharma they are not the roots The various teachers moreover hold different views they can not dispel the doubts in their minds The full texts must be obtained and we shall probably be able to get the decisions only at Jetavana Grove Thus he cherished a lofty aspiration and made up his mind to travel to a foreign land In the eighth month in the autumn of the third year of Zhenguan  he made a vow and packed up to go his way at once He reached Nalanda Monastery in Central India where he met a great teacher named Sllabhadra meaning Eminent in Virtue who prac tised both of the two schools of Buddhism and whose unusual discernment was profound and farreaching since he was well versed in the Tripitaka and adept at the Four Vedas As this treatise was the crown of all scrip tures it was specially favored and frequently taught and preached It was originally composed by Maitreya Bodhisattva and being the root system of all Mahayana Teachings it was what the Master had made up his mind to seek All of the sixteen great states turned toward it with adoration and the students who studied its theories always numbered over ten thousand people When the Master went to visit the teacher to study with him they were pleased to meet each other at first sight and regretted that they did not meet sooner Whatever he had heard once he could repeat without omission just as Mengsi takes in the water of all rivers or as Mengzhu lake absorbs all the water of the swamps of Yunmeng The teacher sighed with surprise and remarked that he had never seen such a prodigy before He said W e rarely hear even the name of such a person not to say discuss the mysterious teachings with him at this time Since then the Masters fame spread to west of the Pamir Ranges and his name was known in the eight coun tries Having heard about his renown the elder teachers and eminent scholars of those countries all being experi enced writers of profound learning came to debate with him Upon seeing him King Siladitya and others applauded with delight prostrated themselves before him with their elbows on the ground to kiss his feet and offered him all the valuables they had in their possession When the congregation was over the Master continued to study Sanskrit texts and various scriptures and treatises including all of the Vaipulya teachings spoken by the Tathagata during his lifetime on Grdhrakuta Mountain the incom plete texts taught at the Deer Park the works written by the later saints Asvaghosa Nagaijuna Asanga and Vasubandhu and even the heterogeneous views of the eighteen schools of the Gokulikas etc and the ultimate gists of the five groups o f Mahayana texts of the superior Way which he collected and did research into to understand their essence and grasp their literary meanings He also visited those places where the Buddha had left his traces during his lifetime such as the wood of evergreen sala trees where he entered nirvana the Bodhi tree under which he subjugated Mara the Evil One the lofty stupa built by Ajatasatru and the hill where the Buddha left his shadow The Master paid homage in person to all those spots and saw all of the spiritual wonders without omission Having fulfilled his expectations and completed his studies the Master was about to return to his homeland he had copied over six hundred Mahayana and Hinayana texts and obtained seven statues of the Buddha and more than a hundred grains of sarira relics On the twentyfifth day of the first month in the spring of the nineteenth year of the present reign of the Tang dynasty he returned to Changan The monks and laity rushed out to welcome him and all the markets in the capital closed for the day At that time the mist disappeared and the fog rolled away unveiling beautiful scenery with a light breeze waft ing gently Precious curtains filled the streets and orna mental banners covered up the sun Auspicious clouds emitted colorful rays in the sky in a rich and luxuriant manner and the common people and scholars sang praises on the thorough fares in booming and sonorous voices Evil winds were then suppressed and the Sun of Wisdom was conspicuously bril liant once again Although it was not as joyful as when the Worldhonored One descended from the Trayastrimsa Heaven to Jambudvlpa it may well be called a happy occa sion that happens once in a thousand years On this journey the Master travelled tens of thousands o f li through various kinds of hardships and perils As for the frozen and icy cold mountains the rivers with surging billows and turbulent waves the extremely toxic vapors of black winds the herds of lions wolves and hyenas the country where Faxian lost his travelling companions and the place where Zhiyan parted company with his friends these were places not visited by Ban Chao nor toured by Zhang Hai But the Master travelled alone by himself with out fear of obstacles spreading the virtues of Tang beyond the eight rivers and propagating the national culture among the five regions of India Thus he made the lords and kings of distant lands turn their minds toward the Emperor of China and the chieftains of faraway quarters admire the celestial capital Although rare merit as was achieved by the Master is not to be seen in every generation it is also due to the influence of the power and prosperity of the imperial dynasty The Emperor holding the mystic diagrams in his hand ascended the Throne in accordance with the preordained order of succession and coincided with the red prediction that he would rule over the people as supreme lord He put right the broken pillars at the four quarters and quelled the overflow of the great sea to set up the universe anew and cast it again in another mold The nine functions of his government included all those of the Yu and Xia dynasties  and his seven mar tial virtues crowned those of the Han and Wei dynasties  The country was in such a peaceful condition that the great sea was calm and the Yellow River became clear while the weather was propitious and pro duced rich harvests Moreover as the sun and moon are attached to the sky the significance of the three good may become prominent and as his ministers are loyal and assiduous it is fitting to sing their praises The purple ganoderma bloomed at the jade steps and the fruit trees blossomed beside the crimson pavilion is also like the auspicious rock found at West Prefecture or the supernatural omen shown on a piece of jade in Song County which recorded the one thousand years reign of the sagacious monarch and manifested the deeds to be suc ceeded to by the Crown Prince Sentences are being written by talented scholars that are as rarely seen as the feathers of a phoenix and compositions concerning the Superior Fruit of the Sun of the Buddha which have not been heard of for numerous generations in the past are now appearing during the reign of the present Emperor Is not this a sign of the divinities assisting the Virtuous One and of Heaven blessing the members of the imperial family On the other hand the Master fixed his attention on the ultimate truth and protected the Five Vehicles like a city wall and its moat He remembered the features of Grdhrakuta Mountain and recalled the sermon delivered by the Ajitavati River Thus the Buddhas image with purple hair arrived brilliantly as auspiciously as when a phoenix appeared at the imperial court and eminent monks learned in the superior texts arrived adding radiance to each other Clouds of compassion spread over the whole world and the drum of the Dharma sounded throughout the three thou sand great chiliocosms with heavenly flowers flying in pro pitious winds and emerald mist sharing the fragrance of the smoke of incense So those who are submerged in the stream of mundanity may hope to get ashore in time and those who are pursuing spirituality and practising mysti cism can see the three voidnesses not far away It is said that by means of the compass that points the road those who have lost their way may find directions and that when the autumnal wind blows through a forest all hollows sound by themselves To compare the depth of their learning they were but ditches beside a road while the Master resembled a river or a lake To contrast their brilliance one was the morning sun while the others were glowworms Formerly when a penannular jade ring from Zhong Mountain arrived Emperor Wen of the Wei dynasty offered to write a rhapsodic poem in praise of it When a phoenix presented itself Jia Kui composed a verse to describe its marvellous appearance If even such humble things as a bird and an inanimate object were exalted in poems in days of yore how can we keep silent at the present time when an enlightened ruler is on the Throne without saying anything to eulogize the Masters immortal deeds and his great function as a pillar of the state As regards the beauty of his pure character and good repute and the traces of his unprecedented and unre peatable journey they will be recorded separately by other great men of the pen and cannot be fully described here I hope gentlemen of clear discernment will refrain from sneering at me The eulogy says Perishable are the senses of living beings The Great Saint has shifted his spirit Nobody but a sage Can continue his heritage Serene and majestic was the Masters deportment Surely he was a man of integrity More elegant than celestial beings And unhampered by worldly defilements Having thoroughly mastered the profound teachings And being also learned in Confucian principles He was as pure as brilliant pearl With virtues as fragrant as orchids and angelica Magnanimous was his personality Gallant sincere and scrupulous His name resounded in the Western Region And to the guesthouse he returned with merits The Jade Mirror of wise judgement hung high again The Pearl Bags were awarded once more to ministers of rank Having explained the Three Vehicles He also elucidated the Ten Stages of Bodhisattvahood So that the Sim of Wisdom Might become brighter out of obscurity A common and insignificant man am I But lucky to follow in the dust he raised I have observed that since the introduction of Buddhism to the Eastern Land tens of thousands of talented and intelligent people have renounced their homes to enter the Way but few of them have been versatile in an allround way though some of them may have had one or two good points I have also heard that the Tripitaka Master never per spired at the height of summer nor would he shiver in times of severe cold He never curled up or stretched himself and never yawned or sneezed This was because he could not adapt to circumstances it should not be taken as a measure to judge saints or sages Moreover when he was ill at the Northern Palace all amusements and elaborate formalities were suspended On the day when he was about to pass away his color and features looked amiable and pleasant There was also something difficult to interpret About month after his demise a man came with some sandalwood powder and asked permission to rub it over the Tripitaka Masters body in the manner of the western countries But all the monks would not allow him to do so That man changed countenance and said This disciple has come by special order If you teachers do not permit me to do this you may write a report to the Emperor Then the monks gave consent When they opened the coffin and unbuttoned the shroud they smelled a strange fragrance like the odor of lotus flowers They asked one another about it in amazement and all of them said that they had also sensed it The man who had just come took off the shroud leaving only the underclothes on the body All the monks saw that the features of the Tripitaka Mas ter remained as if he were alive and they cried most pite ously while they looked at the corpse When the man had rubbed the body with sandalwood powder redressed it in the cerement and closed the coffin again he instantly dis appeared to nowhere The monks suspected that he was a heavenly being Considering the Tripitaka Masters longcherished mind and in view of his recent activities if he was not a Mahasattva what else could he have been I venture to consider that the vast space between heaven and earth is so extensive and that the dissimilarities of human beings endowed with consciousness and intelligence are so variant that the Talk on Heaven could not trace their limits nor could the Comprehensive Map of the Earth distinguish their original sources From this we may know that it is impossible to relate all the places that are not mentioned in the regional records and lie beyond the reach of the inuence and education of the imperial court As regards India it has a long history since its establishment as a country There saints and sages spring up generation after generation and the morality of kindness and justice is their common custom But in the past we never had contacts with that country and its territory is not conjoined with the Middle Kingdom It is neither recorded in the Shanhai jing nor mentioned in the Wanghui pian Chapter on the Royal Meeting The Kunming route was obstructed by the mountainous region of Yuexi in the southwest and so Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty could only excavate the Divine Lake at Changan to train his navy but to no effect Therefore even though astrological signs had shown the good omen of the birth of the Buddha his abstruse teachings were impeded from being introduced to China for a thousand years Emperor Ming of the Han dynasty dreamed of a golden gure with a sunlike halo behind its head but the divine light of Buddhism was still enshrouded in secret ten thousand li away After that the governance of the state became faulty and eunuchs and people of ignoble character swayed the realm They brought disaster upon the Eastern Capital and disrupted the country The Empress and Empress Dowager started disturbances and split the nation as one tears a piece of silk into pieces There were however occasional inquisitive travelers who visited that country to hunt for novelty Although they have left us some records they did not make a full account of the products and topography of the places they visited They merely quoted passages from books of strange stories and did not make a thorough study of the truth of bhūtatathatā  Even at the time of the Sui dynasty when the empire was unied and the domain considerably expanded people could only gaze at the sea in the West and regret that they were unable to proceed further They had to ponder over the situation while looking at the country of Dongli  It is true that many a man has hoisted banners and ags outside the Yumen Pass but no record can be found about anyone who successfully crossed the Pamir Range How could anyone ride through the Snow Mountains and halt for a while beside the dragon lake This was really because the virtue of the Sui rulers was not pervasive and their prestige not farreaching The House of Great Tang holding sway over the empire has opened up the world for the initiation of imperial prospects Its achievements are as great as the creation of the universe and its brilliance is equal to the light of the sun and the moon All people are grateful for having gained a new life as if they had been saved from the mouths of jackals and wolves Every family is glad about having a new lease on life as if their souls had returned from the sphere of ghosts and demons Alien residents of different nationalities reside on Gao Street in the capital and all distant and desolate places are included in the imperial territory It may be said that the Ten Spirits Islands are parts of the Imperial Garden and that the four seas are regarded as its ponds and pools The Five Emperors of old are slighted and the monarchs of ancient ages are held in scorn Having entered the gate of the Dharma in his childhood Dharma Master regretted that he had not been to the Jetavana Garden when he grew up he thought about the traces left by the Buddha and eagerly looked forward to visiting the Deer Park Thus he lifted up his robe to start the journey to the Land of Purity this was his longcherished desire At a time when the general mood of honesty was prevailing westward and in the season when the climate was suitable for ofcials to take homebound trips to the east he started his journey with his pewter staff in hand in the third year of Zhenguan Under the spiritual protection of his ancestors he was able to reach lands with various customs and he met with many dangers that he eventually weathered safely With the aid of deities he traversed risky paths from which he barely escaped with his life He suffered the abrupt changes of scorching heat and bitter cold passing through many places before he reached his destination If we speak of inquiring into the truth it depends on whether one sees or does not see the difference between the theories of emptiness and existence research into the sublime teachings lies in whether one has or has not heard about the doctrine of birth and death Doubts about the sea of truth must be solved to enable all living beings to awaken from the stream of delusion He collected various scriptures of which not a single word he did not understand and he visited all the holy sites none of which did he not see in person After having traveled for many years he returned home and reached Changan in the rst month of the nineteenth year of Zhenguan bringing back six hundred ftyseven books which he translated into Chinese by imperial decree Dharma Master personally visited one hundred ten countries and heard information about twentyeight countries Some of them are mentioned in the historical records of previous dynasties while others are known to us for the rst time in the present age They have paid homage and submitted to the authority of the Emperor beseeching him to dispatch ofcials to reform their language They climbed mountainous paths to come to offer tribute and they were so merrily entertained at the imperial court that they clapped their hands dressed in the costume of the Tang they formed into groups Regarding their different products and local conditions as well as their social customs and the mountains and rivers of their lands we have to refer to their books for ancient times for recent times we can inquire of elderly people Distant are those alien countries but here they appear clearly before our eyes We need not take the trouble to write letters to nd out details that are already written on white silk and entitled The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions in twelve fascicles kept in one cloth slipcase I humbly consider that the information provided in this book is quite detailed while certain trivial matters and minor events will I hope make up what is missing in former historical works This is the preface composed by Jing Bo Assistant Writer of the Imperial Secretarial Department Yu Zhining Duke of Yanguo and Left Premier of the Board of Ministers As the ray emitted from the white curl between the Buddhas eyebrows illuminates the whole earth so the sweet dew of his teachings spreads over the great chiliocosm Like a golden mirror that shines brightly the great order of the Tang empire prevails over the whole domain Having manifested the three realms of the world the buddhadharma may be considered the most venerable of all religions With the light of virtue shining upon the four quarters the Tang empire possesses the largest territory in the world After the shadow of the Buddha the Sun of Wisdom disappeared his teachings were introduced to China in the East and the Way of the Emperor was so glorious that his moral inuence reached far to the West The Tripiṭaka Master of Cien Monastery is named Xuanzang and has the family name of Chen his ancestors were natives of Yingchuan When the Yellow Emperor ascended the throne at Youxiong he controlled Huazhu and established the Chen family Chen Pings six ingenious stratagems played a glorious part in the establishment of the Han dynasty and the petitions submitted by Chen Chong and his son Chen Zhong to the emperors of the Later Han dynasty were like brilliant moonlight shining upon the world after sunset The Master was born under the favorable auspices of the light of harmony and the appearance of the Star of Virtue In his infancy he had a lofty bearing like the glow of the rising sun and moon and in childhood he proved to be a good son as admirable and fragrant as orchids and osmanthus He could discern truth from falsehood at an early age and always had compassion and wisdom He longed to gain a clear understanding of truth and sighed at the limitations of human life He regarded the red silk ribbon attached to the ofcial seal and the purple belts worn by government ofcials as snares of the material world and he thought that the precious vehicles the ekayāna  and the esoteric texts were truly the ways leading one out of the world Therefore he despised all worldly things as dust and rubbish and talked only about serene and broadminded principles His elder brother Venerable Changjie a pillar of the gate of Buddhism was as energetic as a nāga in practicing the Way and his wisdom might be compared with that of āriputra of yore Both those who held ofce at court and those who were not in ofce respected him for his good demeanor and learning and his repute and literary talent were admired by people both at home and abroad The two brothers had a deep feeling of fraternity in concordance with the ethical relationships between members of a family The Master was diligent in serving his elder brother and in receiving instruction from him without wasting a single moment His accomplishments in learning qualied him to be a Chief Monk and thus occupy an outstanding position in a monastery His virtue coincided with the principle of the Middle Way and he was well known among his fellow monks He galloped along the path of equality and comprehended the nine classes of the Buddhist texts his scope of learning being as extensive as the marshland of Yunmeng He rowed his way in the sea of abstruse teachings looking down upon the Four Vedas which appeared to him insignicant In the remote past at the beginning of time the sun and moon shone upon the Terrace of Spirituality and Yang Xiong deliberated about the Way of Heaven which called for deep thought in ones mind Holding the jade handle of his chowrie  the Master waved off the mist on the sea to unveil the billows just like an experienced wheelwright who knows the essence of his craft or a zither maker who understands the knack of producing musical instruments He was so well informed that he instructed people with the uency of water pouring out of a bottle and he traveled alone far away from his native place in a small boat People far and near said to him We have heard that the Xun family of old had eight prominent sons and now we see that the Chen clan has two outstanding brothers It is true that many distinguished persons have emerged in the region between Ruzhou and the Ying River From his youth until he arrived at adulthood the Master engaged himself in studying abstruse Buddhist books Wellknown scholars and predecessors grasped the theories of different sects of Buddhism performing detailed research into side issues and forgetting about the root plucking owers while neglecting the fruit Thus they gave rise to the southern and northern schools with various tenets and contradictory arguments In the longstanding theoretical contentions he was at a loss what to do and feared that the translators might have made mistakes and caused confusion so that he might not be able to get a thorough understanding of the ultimate truth At a time when the country was most prosperous and equipped with unparalleled virtue he started his journey to the remote lands carrying his pewter staff and whisked the dust off his robe In his long journey over land and water he experienced all sorts of hardships and risks He considered the journey undertaken by the Marquis of Bowang not a long one and regarded Faxian as having traveled only in a limited area Wherever he went he studied the local dialect and conducted research into the profound theories there he probed into the essence of the Buddhist teachings in a marvelous way Thus he was eloquent in debate and became famous in India and he brought back to China the Buddhist scriptures written on palm leaves Emperor Taizong who ascended the precious throne as a gold wheel king was a person of elegant character He personally wrote decrees to express his friendly feeling to the Master and sent palace messengers incessantly to inquire after his health At the request of the Master the Emperor composed the Preface to the Holy Teachings of the Tripiṭaka in seven hundred and eighty characters When the reigning Emperor was crown prince and living at the Spring Palace he wrote A Record Relating the Preface to the Holy Teachings of the Tripiṭaka in ve hundred and seventynine characters If the Master had not cast the light of his prestige upon Kukkuṭārāma Monastery and had not spread his fame over Vulture Peak in India how could the emperors have condescended to write such ornamental compositions for the commendation of a contemporary scholar Under imperial edict the Master translated six hundred and ftyseven Sanskrit texts into Chinese Having witnessed the strange customs of distant lands the typical scenes of remote countries the special products of different places the peculiar orders of human relations the regions where the Chinese almanac has been adopted and the localities where Chinese culture and inuence have reached he wrote The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions in twelve fascicles in which he cited passages from profound and obscure texts and included comprehensive investigations and detailed textual researches done in such a way as to render it a work of lasting value Thirtyfour Countries from Agni to Kāpiśī By counting the grand strategies of successive emperors and reading the records of remote events of the past monarchs we know that when Emperor Fuxi rst ascended the throne and when the Yellow Emperor began to rule over the country they managed the affairs of the people and divided the country into administrative regions When Emperor Yao of Tang received the Mandate of Heaven to be the sovereign his glory reached the four quarters and when Emperor Shun of Yu accepted the map of the empire his virtue spread over all the nine districts Since then only the memoranda recording past events have been transmitted and if one wishes to hear from the former sages he or she can only listen to the historians who recorded their words How can these be compared with our time when good government prevails in the empire under a monarch who reigns without ruling As to our great Tang dynasty it has held sway over the empire in accordance with the Mandate of Heaven taking advantage of the times it has controlled the power of governance The Emperor has united the six quarters into one domain and lled it with his glory and he has succeeded to the virtuous deeds of the three ancient emperors as the fourth one in order illuminating the world with his light His subtle inuence has permeated widely and his auspicious edication has extended far He possesses the power of covering and carrying all things like heaven and earth and he acts with the functions of both the stimulating wind and the moistening rain With the Yi tribe at the eastern border coming to offer tribute and the Rong people of the western frontier arriving to pledge allegiance he has founded an imperial heritage for his posterity and in quelling rebellion to restore order he certainly has surpassed former kings His great deeds have included all those achieved by previous dynasties This is the marvelous achievement of his consummate government If I did not mention all these points in my Record I should have nowhere to praise his great exploits and if I did not publish them abroad how could I shed light on his profuse merits Wherever I went in my journey I inquired about the local conditions and customs and although I did not do research into their locations nor did I differentiate their social institutions I believe that the great merits of Emperor have surpassed those of the three ancient emperors and the ve monarchs of old All living creatures are beneted by his genial inuence and every human being who can speak extols his merits From the Tang empire up to the land of India all the people either of secluded regions with different customs or of isolated places and alien countries accept the Chinese calendar and enjoy the fame and teachings of the Emperor The praise of his military feats has become a topic of conversation and the commendation of his civic virtue is the most popular theme I examined various books but found no records of these things and I presume that there is no similar instance mentioned in the genealogical tables Had I not made this narration how could I record the benecial inuence of the Emperor The narratives I have now composed are based on what I saw and heard Now the sahā world consisting of one great chiliocosm is the sphere of the spiritual inuence of one buddha The four continents under the illumination of one sun and moon within the great chiliocosm are the places where the buddhas the Worldhonored Ones emerge in their incarnation bodies and manifest birth and death to enlighten saints and ordinary beings Mount Sumeru meaning Wonderful High Mountain is composed of the four precious substances It is located in the sea standing on the golden wheel under the illumination of the sun and moon in rotation being the residence of heavenly beings surrounded by a ring of seven mountains and seven seas The water in the seas between the mountains possesses the eight virtues Beyond the seven golden mountains is the Salt Sea Roughly speaking there are four habitable continents in the seas namely the Videha continent in the east the Jambu continent in the south the Godānīya continent in the west and the Kuru continent in the north A gold wheel king rules over all these four continents a silver wheel king administers all except the Kuru continent in the north a copper wheel kings domination does not include the Kuru continent in the north or the Godānīya continent in the west while an iron wheel king controls only the Jambu continent in the south When a wheel king is about to ascend the throne a great precious wheel of gold silver copper or iron will appear in the air according to his merits to empower him to rule over four three two or one continent as the case may be As the wheel is an auspicious symbol it is adopted as the title of the kings In the center of the Jambu continent is Anavatapta Lake meaning No Trouble of Heat which is south of Fragrant Mountain and north of the Great Snow Mountains with a circuit of eight hundred li Its banks are adorned with gold silver lapis lazuli and crystal It is full of golden sand and its water is as pure and clean as a mirror A bodhisattva of the eighth stage having transformed himself into a nāga king by the power of his resolute will makes his abode at the bottom of the lake and supplies water for the Jambu continent Thus from the mouth of the silver ox at the east side of the lake ows the Ganges River which after going round the lake once enters the Southeast Sea from the mouth of the golden elephant at the south side of the lake ows the Indus River which after winding round the lake once enters the Southwest Sea from the mouth of the lapis lazuli horse at the west side of the lake ows the Oxus River which after meandering round the lake once enters the Northwest Sea and from the mouth of the crystal lion at the north side of the lake ows the Sītā River which after encircling the lake once enters the Northeast Sea or it is said that it ows by a subterranean course to Jishi Mountain where the water reappears as a tributary of the Sītā and becomes the source of the Yellow River in China As there is no ruler now destined to be a wheel king the Jambu continent is reigned by four lords The dominion under the sovereignty of the lord of elephants in the south is hot and humid in climate and it is t for breeding elephants In the west the lord of treasure rules over the land beside the sea where there are plenty of precious substances The place of the lord of horses in the north is cold and bracing and it is good for rearing horses The country of the lord of humans in the east is well populated with amiable inhabitants In the country of the lord of treasure the people know nothing of propriety and righteousness and overestimate wealth and property They wear short jackets fastened on the left side and cut their hair short but keep long mustaches They live in towns and gain prot by engaging in trade The people under the rule of the lord of horses are of a furious disposition and are cruel manslayers They live in felt yurts and are migratory herdsmen In the land of the lord of humans the people are clever and skillful with obvious sentiments of kindness and righteousness They wear hats and belts and their garments are buttoned on the right side Their carriages and clothes are classied according to the ranks and orders of the people and they are attached to their native land and unwilling to leave it They have a class of people specially devoted to commerce Excluding the lord of humans the other three lords hold the east as the superior direction Their people build houses with doors opening to the east and early in the morning they pay reverence toward that direction In the land of the lord of humans the people respect the southern direction Such is the general condition of the different customs and modes of living in the diverse countries As regards the etiquette observed between a monarch and his subjects and that between the superior and the inferior and the cultural institutions and political systems the land of the lord of humans excels all the other countries as to instructions concerning the purication of the mind and liberation from worldly burdens as well as teachings to relieve one from birth and death the best theories are in the country of the lord of elephants All these matters are recorded in classical works and imperial mandates and are also heard from the local people I have made a careful check about what I saw and heard Though the Buddha was born in the West his Dharma has spread to the East In the course of translation mistakes may have crept into the texts and idioms may have been misapplied When the words are wrong the meaning is lost and when a phrase is mistaken the doctrine becomes distorted Hence the saying It is necessary to use correct names What is valuable is the absence of faults Human beings are of different dispositions stubborn or pliable and speak different languages This is caused by climatic conditions and by customary usage As to the varieties of physical features and natural products of the land of the lord of humans and the different customs and temperaments of its people they are recorded in detail in our national histories As to the customs of the land of the lord of horses and the country of the lord of treasure they are fully described in historical records and we can give a brief account of them But as to the country of the lord of elephants it has never been described accurately in our ancient literature Some said that it was mostly a hot and humid country and others depicted its people as customarily fond of kindness and compassion These are mentioned in topographies but no detailed information can be found As the Way is sometimes prevalent and sometimes in hiding do not human affairs also have changes of fortune Thus we may know that it is difcult to describe all those who predict the right season to pledge allegiance and who come to submit to the benevolence of the Emperor or those who passing one danger after another seek admittance at Yumen Pass bearing tribute of native rarities and bow before the gate of the imperial palace This is why in the intervals of my studies during my long journey inquiring for truth I took notes on the conditions and customs along the way Up to the Black Range the customs of the Hu people are prevalent Although they live together with the Rong people in the same localities they are distinct tribes and their territories are demarcated They are mostly aborigines living in walled cities engaging in agriculture and rearing cattle They value wealth and property and to despise kindness and righteousness is their custom They have no ceremony for marriage and no distinction between the superior people and the inferior The wifes word is authoritative and the husband occupies a low position They cremate the bodies of the dead and have no xed period of mourning but they scrape their faces mutilate their ears cut off their hair and rend their garments They slaughter domestic animals as sacrices offered to the manes of the dead On happy occasions they put on white clothes while at sorrowful events they are dressed in black This is a brief account of the common or similar customs of the tribes the different politics and various institutions of diverse countries will be described separately as the occasion arises and the manners and customs of India will be narrated in the following Record Going out of what was formerly the land of Gaochang I started my journey with the nearest country called Agni  The country of Agni which is more than six hundred li from east to west and over four hundred li from south to north its capital city being six or seven li in circuit is surrounded by hills on four sides with perilous tracks that are easily defended Spring water ows in a network of channels leading the water to irrigate cultivated elds The soil is suitable for growing millet broomcorn winter wheat fragrant jujubes grapes pears crabapples and other fruit The climate is moderate and pleasant and the people are honest and straightforward by social custom Their alphabet is taken from that of India with slight modications The garments of the people are made of felt and hempen cloth The men cut their hair short without wearing any headdress As to their currency they use gold silver and small copper coins The king a native of the country is a brave man but he lacks resourcefulness and he indulges in bragging about his own merits The country has no guiding principle or discipline and government orders are imperfect and not seriously implemented There are more than ten monasteries with over two thousand monks who are followers of the Sarvāstivāda school of the Hinayana teachings Since they practice the scriptural theories and observe the Vinaya discipline of India the students carefully study these subjects in Indian texts They are pure and strict in observing the Vinaya rules but they eat the three kinds of pure meat together with other foodstuffs which shows that they are stagnating in the stage of the gradual teaching Going from here toward the southwest for more than two hundred li I climbed over a hill and crossed two large rivers and then reached a plain in the west After proceeding for more than seven hundred li I arrived in the country of Kuci  The country of Kuci is over one thousand li from east to west and over six hundred li from south to north and its capital city is about seventeen or eighteen li in circuit The soil is t for growing millet and wheat It yields roundgrained rice grapes and pomegranates and plenty of pears crabapples peaches and apricots It produces gold copper iron lead and tin Its climate is mild and the people are honest and upright by nature Their writing is taken from that of India but with minor alterations Their skill in playing wind and stringed instruments is well known in various countries They dress in brocade and hempen clothes cut their hair short and wear turbans For currency they use gold silver and small copper coins Being a man of Kuci the king has little resourcefulness and is under the control of powerful ministers It is their custom to press the heads of their babies into a at shape with wooden planks There are over one hundred monasteries with some ve thousand monks who study the Sarvāstivāda school of the Hinayana teachings Their scriptural teachings and Vinaya discipline follow the example of India so they study the books on these subjects in the original Indian language As they eat the three kinds of pure meat together with other foodstuffs they are still stagnating in the stage of the gradual teaching But they are pure in conduct and deeply engrossed in studies and they compete with one another in their achievement of spiritual cultivation In front of a deva temple to the north of a city in the eastern part of the country there is a big dragon pond The dragons of the pond often changed their form to mate with mares and gave birth to dragon colts which were erce and unruly but the offspring of the dragon colts were tamable That is why plenty of good horses are bred in this country I heard some old people say that there was recently a king named Golden Flower who through his sagacious administration and sharp insight into political affairs convinced one of the dragons to pull his carriage for him When the king was approaching death he touched the dragons ear with his whip and it then submerged into the pond and hid itself up to the present time As there was no well in the city the people drew water from this pond The dragons transformed themselves into human form and mated with the women Their descendants were strong and courageous and could run as fast as a galloping horse In this manner the blood of the dragons was diffused and everybody became a person of the dragon race Relying on their physical strength they rode roughshod over others and paid no heed to the kings orders Thus the king colluded with the Turks to slaughter all the inhabitants old and young in the city After the massacre not a single person was left living in the city which is now a deserted place without a trace of human habitation More than forty li to the north of the deserted city there are two monasteries separated by a river close to the corner of a mountain Both monasteries one on the east side and the other on the west side of the river are named Cakuri The images of the Buddha and the ornaments are so beautifully made that they almost excel human craftsmanship The monks are pure and austere in conduct and are sincere and diligent in their studies In the buddha hall of Eastern Cakuri Monastery there is a jade stone about two feet in width yellowishwhite in color in the shape of a sea clam On the stone there is a footprint of the Buddha one foot eight inches in length and more than six inches wide On fast days it sometimes issues a brilliant light There are two standing statues of the Buddha more than ninety feet in height one at each side of the road outside the west gate of the capital city It is at this place in front of the statues that the great quinquennial congregations are held Every year for several tens of days around the autumnal equinox all the monks in the whole country come here to attend a meeting From the monarch and princes on down to the commoners all suspend their secular affairs and observe the precepts they study the scriptures and listen to the discourses on the Dharma for a whole day at a time without feeling fatigue All the monasteries decorate their buddha images with jewels and gems dress them in brocade and damask and carry them in handcarts counted by the thousand to conduct what is known as the procession of images ocking to meeting place The king always discusses state affairs with his ministers on the fteenth and the last day of the lunar month and after consulting with the eminent monks about their discussion they make a proclamation At the northwest of the meeting place I crossed a river and reached ścarya Monastery The buildings and courtyards of the monastery are splendid and spacious and the buddha images are well adorned Old people of virtue with much learning and great talents are venerated In admiration of their good conduct brilliant scholars come here from distant lands to stay with them The king and his ministers as well as the common people and magnates provide the monks with the four monastic requisites with increasing respect as time goes on I heard some old people saying that once a previous king of this country who revered the Triple Gem wished to go on tour to worship various holy sites at different places and he had his younger brother act as regent during his absence Upon receiving the kings order the younger brother secretly cut off his own genital organ and put it in a golden casket as a precaution against possible calumny He sent the casket to the king who asked What is it His younger brother said in reply Upon your return Your Majesty may open it and see The casket was then handed to a guard of the kings retinue for safekeeping during the journey When the king returned from his trip a slanderer actually accused the regent saying The regent appointed by the king committed adultery in the inner palace On hearing this accusation the king was enraged and intended to impose a heavy punishment on the culprit His younger brother said I would not dare evade the responsibility but I hope that the golden casket can be opened When the king opened the casket and found a severed male organ contained in it he asked What is this strange thing What do you want to say about it His younger brother said When Your Majesty went out on tour and appointed me as regent I feared that the disaster of a possible calumny might befall me so I cut off my genital organ to prove my innocence I hope Your Majesty will make a clear investigation into the case The king was deeply surprised to hear this and since then his fraternity toward his younger brother became more profound so that he was allowed free admission to the inner palace without hindrance Later when the kings younger brother was walking on the road he met with a herdsman driving a herd of ve hundred bulls to be castrated On seeing these animals that were about to suffer the same impairment as he had the kings younger brother reected on his own fate and thought Is it not due to my past evil deeds that I am now a deformed manin this life Thus he redeemed the herd of bulls from mutilation with money and valuables and through the power of his compassion his genital organ was gradually restored As he regained his masculinity he refused to enter the inner palace any more When the amazed king asked him why he told the king all the details Regarding this as a marvelous affair the king constructed the monastery in a beautiful style to transmit good reputation to posterity From here going westward for more than six hundred li I crossed a small desert and arrived in the country of Bālukā formerly known as Gumo or Jimo The country of Bālukā is over six hundred li from east to west and more than three hundred li from south to north its capital city being ve or six li in circuit The native products climate temperament of the people customs written language and law are all the same as in the country of Kuci but the spoken language differs somewhat Its ne cotton and hempen cloth is much valued in the neighboring countries There are several tens of monasteries with more than a thousand monks who study the Sarvāstivāda school of the Hinayana teachings Proceeding northwest from this country for more than three hundred li I crossed a stony desert and reached the Ice Mountains which are located at the northern side of the Pamir Range where most of the streams ow eastward Snow is accumulated in the valleys which are freezing even in the spring and summer seasons and although they sometimes melt a little they soon become frozen again The path is dangerous and the cold wind blows with a piercing vehemence There are frequent disasters caused by ferocious dragons that give trouble to travelers Travelers going by this route should not wear garments of reddishbrown color nor should they carry calabashes or shout loudly The slightest infringement of these taboos will cause immediate disaster A erce wind will arise all of a sudden sand ying in the air and pebbles raining down from the sky Those who encounter such a catastrophe are sure to die it is difcult for them to escape alive Going among the mountains for over four hundred li I reached the Great Pure Lake  which is more than one thousand li in circuit It is long from east to west and narrow from south to north Fish and dragons live together in the lake and supernatural monsters sometimes appear in it Therefore passing travelers pray to them for good fortune and there are plenty of aquatic animals though no one would venture to catch them From the Pure Lake going northwest for more than ve hundred li I reached the City of Sushe River which is about six or seven li in circuit a place where traders of the Hu tribes from different countries mingle their abodes The soil is good for growing millet wheat and grapes but fruit trees are scarce The climate is windy and cold and the people wear clothes made of felt and hemp To the west of Sushe River are some tens of isolated cities each having its own ruler but they do not obey one another and they are all under the domination of the Turks The region stretching from city of Sushe River up to the country of Kasanna is called Suli and the people are known by the same name Their language is also known as Suli The alphabet of their language is brief and simple having only twentyodd rudimentary letters with which a vast vocabulary is formed by a methodical spelling system The people have rough written records which are read vertically and are transmitted from teacher to pupil without interruption They dress in felt and hempen clothes and put on fur and cotton garments Both their undergarments and their upper clothes t tightly They cut their hair short and expose the tops of their heads or they shave their heads completely tying a colored silk band on the forehead They are tall and sturdy in stature but timid in disposition Their general mood is perdious and deceptive They are mostly avaricious and take account of money matters even between father and son A millionaire however may lead a simple and coarse life Half of the population are farmers and the other half traders Going westward from Sushe City for more than four hundred li I arrived at Thousand Springs The district known by this name is over two hundred li square facing the Snow Mountains in the north with plains on the three other sides The soil is fertile and damp and there are luxuriant trees In late spring various owers bloom as beautifully as embroidered silk As there are a thousand springs the district is named as such The Turkish Khan often comes here in the summer season to avoid the heat There are ocks of deer most of them wearing bells and rings They are docile and friendly with people and do not easily become so afraid as to ee These animals are pets of the Khan who has forbidden his subjects to slaughter them on penalty of death so they can live out their natural lifetimes Going westward from Thousand Springs for one hundred and forty or fty li I reached the city of Taras eight or nine li in circuit being a place where traders of the Hu tribes from different countries make their abodes together The natural products and climate are roughly the same as in Sushe Going southward for about ten li is a small isolated town in which live more than three hundred Chinese families who were formerly taken prisoner by the Turks Afterward they gathered together all their compatriots and safeguarded this town in which they settled They adopted the costume and etiquette of the Turks but retained the language and ways of life of their own country From here going southwest for more than two hundred li I arrived at the City of White Water which is six or seven li in circuit The native products and climatic conditions are much better than in Taras

and no one yields to the others They have delimited the boundaries of their districts by rivers and precipitous mountains From here going westward for more than one thousand li I reached the country of Sutrūshana The country of Sutrūshana is fourteen or fteen hundred li in circuit bordering the She River on the east which has its source in the plateau to the north of the Pamir Range It is a mighty river of muddy water with rapid currents The native products and customs are the same as in the country of Shash In this country there is a king who is afliated with the Turks From here going toward the northwest I entered a great desert in which there is absolutely no water or grass The roads are lost in the vast waste and its limits are unfathomable Only by looking at the huge mountains and following the scattered skeletons can one know the direction and nd the path After traveling for over ve hundred li I reached the country of Samarkand  The country of Samarkand is sixteen or seventeen hundred li in circuit long from east to west and narrow from south to north The capital city is more than twenty li in circuit and is a completely invulnerable stronghold with a large population Precious goods of different quarters are mostly centralized in this country The soil is rich and fertile and all kinds of crops are cultivated The trees of the forests are luxuriant and

iron The door panels are strengthened with iron and many iron bells are hanging on them As it is in an impregnable position it is called by this name Going out of the Iron Gate I arrived at the country of Tukhāra formerly transcribed incorrectly as the country of Tuhuoluo This territory is over one thousand li from south to north and more than three thousand li from east to west It borders on the Pamir Range in the east adjoins Persia in the west touches the Great Snow Mountains in the south and occupies the Iron Gate in the north with the great Oxus River owing westward through the middle of it For several centuries the royal family had no offspring and the powerful chieftains competed vigorously with one another each trying to be the lord of his own district delimited by rivers and strategic positions and they divided the country into twentyseven states Although each of these chieftains has his own clearly demarcated territory they are all under the domination of the Turks As the climate is temperate illness and pestilence are rampant By the end of winter and at the beginning of spring when there is continuous heavy rain febrile ailments are prevalent in all the countries south of this territory down to the north of Lampā The monks commence their summer retreat on the sixteenth day of the twelfth month and end it on the fteenth day of the third month It is because this place has so much rain that the dates are thus xed according to the seasons The people are timid and cowardly and are badlooking but in manner they are creditable and loyal and they seldom resort to deception Their language and manners differ slightly from those of other countries There are twentyve letters in their alphabet by which various words are formed to express all things

eight hundred li from east to west and over four hundred li from south to north bordered by the Oxus River on the north Its capital city which is more than twenty li in circuit is popularly known as Smaller Rājagṛha It is a strongly fortied city but sparsely populated There are a great many varieties of native products and the terrestrial and aquatic owers are too many to be enumerated There are more than one hundred monasteries with over three thousand monks all of whom study and practice the Hinayana teachings To the southwest outside the city is New Monastery built by a previous king of this country This is the only monastery north of the Great Snow Mountains in which various Buddhist commentators have worked continuously without intermission The Buddhas image is adorned with famous jewels and the halls are decorated with rare precious substances For this reason the rulers of various countries attacked the monastery in order to capture the valuables In the monastery there is a statue of the deity Vaiśravaṇa who is reliable in his spiritual power and serves as a guardian of the monastery in a hidden sense Recently the Turkish Shehu Khans son named Si Shehu Khan mobilizing all the forces of his tribe and commanding his army launched a surprise attack on the monastery and attempted to seize the jewels Not far away from the monastery he camped with his troops During the night he dreamed of Vaiśravaṇa who said to him What power do you have that you dare to devastate the monastery So saying he thrust his spear through the Khans chest Waking in terror the Khan felt an acute heartache and told his subordinates about his evil dream Then he hurriedly sent messengers to invite the monks so that he might confess his wickedness in their presence but he died before the messengers returned In the southern buddha hall of this monastery there is a Buddhas bathing pot of about one dou in capacity It is of a variegated color and dazzlingly brilliant and it is difcult to say whether it is made of metal or of stone There is also a Buddhas tooth relic about one inch long and eight or nine fen wide It is yellowishwhite in color and bright and clean in texture There is also a Buddhas broom made of kāśa grass about two feet long and seven inches around the handle adorned various precious substances These three articles are always shown on the six fast days to the assembly of monks and laypeople who make offerings to them When moved by the sincerity of the devotees these articles may emit a brilliant light To the north of the monastery there is a stupa over two hundred feet in height plastered with diamonds and decorated with various precious substances A piece of relic bone is enshrined in the stupa which often issues a divine light To the southwest of the monastery there is a vihāra that was built many years ago Therefore only those arhats who had manifested supernatural powers at the time of entering nirvana and had become well known to the monks had stupas built for them These were a hundred in number with their bases very close together Although those monks who had attained sainthood were also numbered by the thousand no memorials were erected for them as they did not show supernatural powers at death Now there are over a hundred monks who work hard day and night for spiritual cultivation but it is difcult to know who is an ordinary monk and who is a saint Over fty li to the northwest of the capital is the city of Trapuṣa and over forty li to the north of this city is the city of Bhallika In each of the two cities there is a stupa more than thirty feet in height When the Tathāgata rst realized buddhahood he rose from his seat under the bodhi tree When he was about to go to the Deer Park the two elders met him in his majestic glory and offered him some parched grain and honey out of their traveling provisions The Worldhonored One spoke to them on the blessedness acquired by human and heavenly beings and they were the rst to hear the ve precepts and the ten good deeds After having heard the instructions on the Dharma they requested something for them to worship Then the Tathāgata gave them some of his hair and nail parings to take back home The two men returned to their respective cities and each built a stupa after the pattern shown by the holy Buddha This was the prototype of the stupas built by the Buddhists according to the teachings of the Buddha More than seventy li to the west of the city is a stupa over twenty feet in height which had been built long ago at the time of Kāśyapa Buddha Proceeding southwest from the capital city one enters a nook of the Snow Mountains and reaches the country of Zumathān The country of Zumathān is fty or sixty li from east to west and over one hundred li from south to north its capital city being more than ten li in circuit Proceeding southwest one reaches the country of Gūzgānān The country of Gūzgānān is more than ve hundred li from east to west and over one thousand li from south to north its capital city being more than twenty li in circuit This country has many mountains and rivers and produces good horses Proceeding northwest one reaches the country of Talaqān The country of Talaqān is over ve hundred li from east to west and fty or sixty li from south to north its capital city being more than ten li in circuit It borders on the country of Persia in the west Going south from the country of Baktra for more than one hundred li I arrived at the country of Kacik The country of Kacik is more than ve hundred li from east to west and over three hundred li from south to north its capital city being four or ve li in circuit The soil is hard and infertile with hills and mounds connecting to one another There are few owers or fruit but much pulse and wheat The climate is severely cold and the people are harsh and erce by custom There are more than ten monasteries with over three hundred monks all of whom study the Sarvāstivāda school of the Hinayana teachings Proceeding southeast one enters the Great Snow Mountains The mountains are high and the valleys deep and the peaks and cliffs are fraught with danger Wind and snowfall follow each other and even at the height of summer it is cold to the point of freezing Snow heaps up in the valleys and the footpath is hard to walk on Mountain deities and evil ghosts when enraged send forth monstrous sprites to create havoc It is also infested with gangs of brigands whose business is murder Going for more than six hundred li I came out of the territory of Tukhāra country and reached the country of Bāmīyāna The country of Bāmīyāna is more than two thousand li from east to west and over three hundred li from south to north being situated among the Snow Mountains The people lived on the slopes of the valleys and gradually became towndwellers The capital city lies upon a cliff and stretches across a valley six or seven li in length with a lofty precipice at its back on the north It produces winter wheat but few owers and fruit It is t for cattle breeding and there are many sheep and horses The climate is severely cold and the customs are harsh and rude The people mostly wear fur and hempen clothes which are suitable for them The written language social institutions and currency are the same as those in Tukhāra The spoken language is slightly different but the manners and features of the people are generally the same Their mind of pure faith is far better than that of the people in neighboring countries They worship the Triple Gem with utmost sincerity and venerate all gods down to the various deities When merchants coming and going happen to witness visions of heavenly deities whether as good omens or as predictions of disaster they worship the deities to pray for blessedness There are several tens of monasteries with several thousand monks who follow the Hinayana teachings of the Lokottara vāda school To the northeast of the royal city at a corner of the mountains there is a rock statue of the standing Buddha one hundred forty or fty feet in height of a dazzling golden color and adorned with brilliant gems To the east there is a monastery built by a previous king of the country To the east of the monastery there is a copper statue of the standing Buddha more than one hundred feet tall It was cast in separate pieces and then welded together into shape In the monastery situated two or three li to the east of the city there is an image of the recumbent Buddha more than one thousand feet long in the posture of entering nirvana At this place the king often convened the quinquennial assembly in which he offered everything from his queen down to the national treasures as alms to the monks When the state repository was exhausted he gave himself up to the monks and then his ofcials paid ransom to the monks to redeem the king Going from the monastery of the image of the recumbent Buddha toward the southeast for over two hundred li I crossed the Great Snow Mountains and reached the Small Marshland in the east where the water of the springs and ponds is as clear and lucid as a mirror with luxuriant trees of green foliage There is a monastery in which are preserved a tooth relic of the Buddha and a tooth of a pratyekabuddha who lived at the beginning of the present kalpa  more than ve inches long and less than four inches wide There is also a tooth of a gold wheel king three inches long and two inches wide as well as the iron almsbowl used by the great arhat āṇakavāsa  with a capacity of eight or nine sheng  These three kinds of relics left by the holy ones are sealed up in golden containers There is also preserved a piece of āṇakavāsas saṃghāti robe consisting of nine stripes of a dark red color It was made of the cloth woven with the ber of the śāṇaka plant āṇakavāsa was a disciple of nanda In a former life he presented a piece of hempen robe to the monks on the last day of the summer retreat Through this meritorious deed he was born ve hundred times always wearing a hempen garment whether he was in the state of intermediate existence or born into the human world In his last birth he was born wrapped in a hempen garment which enlarged with the growth of his body When he was converted to the Buddhist order by nanda his garment turned into a religious robe and when he received full ordination it became a saṃghāti robe of nine stripes When he was about to realize nirvana he entered the ultimate samādhi of perfection through the power of his vow of wisdom he left his robe to last in the world until the end of the bequeathed teachings of the Buddha It will decay only after the termination of the Dharma It is now slightly diminished and this is evidence for the veracity of the legend Going from here to the east and after crossing the Black Range I reached the country of Kāpiśī The country of Kāpiśī is more than four thousand li in circuit with the Snow Mountains at its back in the north and the Black Range surrounding the three other sides It is t for growing rice and wheat and there are plenty of fruit trees It produces good horses and aromatic turmeric Rare commodities from different places are mostly concentrated in this country The climate is windy and cold and the people are rude and rustic by nature Their language is vulgar and indecent and they practice mixed marriage The written language is generally the same as in the country of Tukhāra but the customs and spoken language and social institutions are quite different They wear woolen and cotton clothes and also use fur and hemp in making garments For currency they use golden and silver coins and small coppers whose sizes and shapes differ from those of other countries The king who belongs to the Suli tribe is a man of strategy brave and ery by nature and feared by neighboring regions he has more than ten countries under his dominion He loves and nurtures his subjects and venerates the Triple Gem Every year he makes a silver image of the Buddha eighteen feet in height He also holds a quinquennial assembly for the distribution of charity to the poor and needy and he gives alms to widows and widowers There are over one hundred monasteries with more than six thousand monks most of whom study the teachings of the Mahayana school The stupas and monasteries are tall and spacious and are kept clean in a solemn manner There are over ten deva temples with more than one thousand heretical believers who either go about naked or with dust smeared on their bodies some wear strings of skulls as head ornaments Three or four li to the east of the great city there is a large monastery at the foot of the northern mountain with over three hundred monks all of whom study the teachings of the Hinayana schools I heard some old people say that when King Kaniṣka of the country of Gandhāra was on the throne his prestige extended to the neighboring countries and his inuence reached distant regions He strengthened his military forces and expanded his territory to the east of the Pamir Range Out of fear of the kings might the lord of a Chinese vassal state west of the Yellow River sent his son as hostage to the king Upon receiving the hostage prince King Kaniṣka treated him with special kindness and courtesy providing him with different lodgings according to the seasons In the winter he stayed in various states in India and in the summer he returned to the country of Kāpiśī while in the spring and autumn he stayed in the country of Gandhāra Therefore a monastery was built at each of these places where the hostage prince lived in the three different seasons This monastery was the one built at his summer residence Painted on the walls of the buildings are pictures of the hostage prince his features and costume being quite the same as those of the Chinese people Afterward he was sent back to his own country but in memory of his old residences he continued to send offerings to the monasteries without interruption in spite of the obstacles of mountains and rivers Now the monks of the monastery still perform grand religious functions at the times of commencing and dissolving the summer retreat to pray for blessedness and perform meritorious deeds on behalf of the hostage prince without cease up to the present time Under the right foot of the statue of the great deity at the southern side of the east gate of the buddha hall courtyard of the monastery there was an underground treasure laid up by the hostage prince with an inscription that reads When the monastery is in need of repair take this treasure for its renovation Recently the king of a frontier country an avaricious and cruel man heard that there were plenty of jewels and gems stored in the monastery After he had expelled the monks and was about to dig up the treasure the gure of a parrot on the crown of the great deity vigorously apped its wings and screamed in a terrible manner causing an earthquake The king and his soldiers were so frightened that they fainted and fell on the ground and it was a long time before they came to after which they apologetically returned home On the mountain to the north of the monastery there are several caves in which the hostage prince practiced meditation A large quantity of miscellaneous valuables was stored in the caves with an inscription placed beside them and guarded by a yakṣa  Whenever anyone wished to open the caves to take away the treasure the yakṣa through his supernatural power would appear in different forms as a python a erce animal or a poisonous insect all greatly enraged Therefore no one dared to attempt to take the valuables by force On a great mountain two or three li to the west of the caves there is a statue of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva When anybody earnestly wishes to see the bodhisattva he appears out of the statue in a graceful form to comfort the devotee Over thirty li to the southeast of the great city is Rāhula Monastery Beside it there is a stupa more than one hundred feet in height that sometimes emits a brilliant light on fast days From a crevice on the body of the stupa in the shape of an inverted almsbowl black aromatic oil oozes out and on a quiet night one sometimes hears the sound of music I heard some old people say that it was built by Rāhula a minister of this country When the construction was completed he dreamed that someone said to him In the stupa you have constructed there is no śarīra enshrined Tomorrow morning someone will offer one to the king You may as well ask the king for it The next morning the minister went to court and said to the king May I have the impudence to beg a favor from Your Majesty The king said What is your desire The minister asked Will Your Majesty grant me what is rst offered to you today The king said Let it be so Rāhula then waited at the gate of the palace to see who was coming rst and in a moment a man came with a bottle containing a grain of śarīra The minister inquired of the man What are you going to offer to the king The man said A buddha śarīra  The minister said I shall watch the śarīra for you while you go in to report rst to the king Rāhula fearing that the king might be reluctant to part with the precious śarīra and might go back on his promise quickly went to the monastery and climbed up on the stupa with such a pious mind that the stupa in the shape of an inverted almsbowl moved by his earnestness opened by itself so that he could deposit the śarīra inside The kings messenger chased after the relic but the stone stupa had already closed Thus black aromatic oil oozed out from the crevice More than forty li to the south of the city is the City of vetavat Temple Whenever there is a big earthquake and the mountains and precipices collapse nothing is shaken within the limits of this city More than thirty li to the south of the City of vetavat Temple is Aruṇa Mountain with its lofty peaks and cliffs and gloomy valleys stretching far The top of the mountain increases every year by several hundred feet in height as if to look at unāśīra Mountain in the country of Jāguḍa and then it suddenly collapses I heard the local people say that when the deity unā rst came here from a distant place he wished to stay at this mountain Terried the mountain god shook the rivulets in the valleys The deity said You do not wish me to take up lodging with you and so you shook the earth If you had shown me a little hospitality I would have lled your chest with riches and valuables Now I am going to unāśīra Mountain in the country of Jāguḍa Every year at the time when I receive worship and offerings from the king and his ministers you may only look at me Thus Aruṇa Mountain increases to a height and then immediately collapses More than two hundred li to the northwest of the royal city are the Great Snow Mountains at the top of which there is a lake Whenever people come here to pray for rain or ne weather their wishes are always fullled I heard some old people say that formerly there was an arhat in Gandhāra who always received offerings of alms from the nāga king of this lake Every day at the time of the midday meal he would sit on his folding chair and y through the air to the lake through supernatural power Once his attendant novice hid himself below the folding chair and the arhat went to the lake as usual when the time arrived for him to make the journey On arriving at the nāgas palace he discovered the novice and so the nāga king also invited the novice to the meal The nāga king offered heavenly delicious rice to entertain the arhat while he gave the novice food of the human world When the meal was over the arhat preached the Dharma for the nāga king and the novice washed his masters almsbowl as usual When he discovered some remaining grains of rice in the bowl he was amazed by its fragrance and he immediately cherished a malignant feeling against his master and the nāga king saying May the power of whatever good deeds I have performed appear to kill this nāga and let me be the king The moment the novice expressed this desire the nāga king felt a headache After listening to the sermons delivered by the arhat the nāga king repented his misdeed and blamed himself but the novice deeply resentful would not make a confession nor accept the nāga kings apology Having returned to the monastery the novice by his earnest desire and the power of his good deeds died that night and was reborn as a great nāga king with majesty and valor He came to the lake killed the resident nāga king occupied the nāga palace took possession of his subordinates and became the master of all Out of his old indignation he caused a violent storm that uprooted the trees intending to destroy the monastery At that time King Kaniṣka perplexed by the accident made inquiries into the matter and the arhat told him everything The king then built a monastery at the foot of the Snow Mountains with a stupa over one hundred feet high for the nāga Out of his old resentment the nāga sent forth wind and rain The king cherished the mind of universal salvation but the nāga out of his malignance and hatred caused storms six times to destroy the monastery and stupa but they were rebuilt seven times King Kaniṣka ashamed of his failure intended to ll up the nāgas lake and demolish his dwellings He mobilized his troops and came to the foot of the Snow Mountains Deeply terried the nāga king transformed himself into the form of an old brahman halted the kings elephant and offered a remonstrance to him saying Because Great King you have in the past performed good deeds and sowed many superior causes you are now a king of humans and no one dares to disobey you Why do you contend with a nāga today A nāga is an animal and though of a base and evil species he still possesses great power and cannot be subjugated by strength He can ride on a piece of cloud and y through the air or tread upon empty space and walk over water beyond the control of human power What inuence can your anger produce upon him Now you have mobilized all of the military forces in the whole country to ght with a nāga Even if you win in the battle you will not gain the prestige that you achieve when you conquer a distant land if you lose the war you will bring shame on yourself for being unable to defeat your enemy It is in your own interest to withdraw your troops King Kaniṣka did not listen to this remonstrance so the nāga returned to his lake and caused a thunderstorm and a hurricane that uprooted the trees Sand and stones rained down from the air clouds and mist darkened the world and the kings troops and horses were frightened The king then took refuge in the Triple Gem begging for protection saying Because I have done many good deeds in the past I am now a king of human beings with mighty power to subdue strong enemies and rule over Jambudvīpa Now I am humiliated by this nāga animal which shows that my blessedness is scanty May whatever power I have gathered from doing good deeds be present at this very moment Immediately a huge ame arose from his shoulders the nāga retreated the wind died down and the mist and clouds dispersed The king ordered each soldier in his army to carry a piece of stone to ll up the nāga lake The nāga king resumed the form of a brahman and said again to the king I am the nāga king of this lake and out of fear of your great power I have come to pledge allegiance to you May the king take pity on me and forgive me for the faults I have committed You are a king who nourishes and protects all living beings so why should you do harm to me alone If you kill me we will both fall into the evil ways of existence because you will have commited the sin of taking life while I will have cherished a feeling of hatred and vengeance in my mind Karmic retribution is apparent and shows plainly what is good and what is evil The king then reached an agreement with the nāga that should the nāga commit another offense in the future the king would certainly not pardon him The nāga said Because of my evil karma done in the past I am now a nāga As a nāga is violent by nature I am unable to restrain myself and in a t of anger I may forget about the obligation If you build another monastery I will dare not destroy it again When I hear the sound I shall quench my evil mind The king then constructed another monastery together with a stupa and a guard was stationed to watch to see if any black cloud appeared This is still done without interruption I heard some old people say that inside the stupa there was preserved about one sheng of bone and esh relics of the Tathāgata Marvelous events are difcult to relate in detail Once smoke suddenly arose from inside the stupa and in a moment raging ames burst out of it The people thought that the stupa must have been consumed by the re but after looking at it for a long time when the smoke and ames had vanished they saw the relics resembling a streamer of white pearls winding upwards around an ornamental pillar up to the clouds and whirling down again In Old Royal Monastery on the southern bank of the great river in the northwest of the royal city is a deciduous tooth of ākyamuni Bodhisattva about one inch long To the southeast of this monastery there is another one also called Old Royal Monastery in which is preserved a piece of the Tathāgatas skull bone about one inch broad yellowish white in color with distinctive hair pores There is also a hair of the Tathāgatas head dark purple in color curled up rightward about half an inch long but when extended it measures about one foot These three objects are worshiped with scattering of owers by the king and his ministers on the six fast days of every month To the southwest of this skull bone monastery is Old Queens Monastery in which there is a gilt copper stupa more than one hundred feet in height I heard some local people say that it contained over one sheng of the Buddhas relic bones from which on the night of the fteenth day of every month emits a round light shining continuously upon the dew basin of the stupa which gradually fades into it at dawn To the southwest of the city is Pilusāra Mountain It is called Strong Elephant because the tutelary deity of the mountain assumed the form of an elephant Formerly when the Tathāgata was living in the world the deity of Strong Elephant Mountain once invited the Worldhonored One and his twelve hundred great arhats to the mountain There was a large at rock on the top of the mountain where the Tathāgata took his seat and accepted the alms offered by the deity Afterward King Aśoka erected a stupa more than one hundred feet high on the rock This is what the people now call Strong Elephant Stupa and it is also said that about one sheng of the Tathāgatas relic bones is preserved in it Below the cliff to the north of Strong Elephant Stupa is a nāga spring where the Tathāgata and arhats washed their mouths by chewing willow twigs after taking the meal offered by the deity They planted the twigs in the ground where they took root and grew into the dense wood that it is now Afterward people built at this place a monastery called Piṇḍaka Chewing Willow Twigs Monastery From here I traveled east for more than six hundred li through mountains and valleys connected with each other The peaks and cliffs are steep and precipitous After crossing the Black Range I entered the territory of North India and reached the country of Lampā  End of Fascicle I of The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions Three Countries from Lampā to Gandhāra In a careful study we nd that Tianzhu is variantly designated causing much confusion and perplexity Formerly it was called Shengdu or Xiandou but now we should call it Indu according to the right pronunciation The people of India use different names for their respective countries while people of distant places with diverse customs generally designate the land that they admire as India The word indu means moon which has many names and this is one of them It means that living beings live and die in the wheel of transmigration in the long night of ignorance ceaselessly without a rooster to announce the advent of the dawn When the sun has sunk candles continue to give light in the night Although the stars are shining in the sky how can they be as brilliant as the clear moon For this reason India was compared to the moon Because saints and sages emerged one after another in that land to guide living beings and regulate all affairs just as the moon shines upon all things it was called India In India the people are divided into different castes and clans among whom the brahmans are the noblest Following their good name tradition has designated the whole land as the brahmanical country disregarding the regular lines of demarcation As regards the territory we may say that the whole of India with its ve parts is over ninety thousand li in circuit with three sides facing the sea and the Snow Mountains at its back in the north It is wide in the north and narrow in the south in the shape of a crescent moon The land is divided into more than seventy countries The climate is particularly hot and the soil is mostly moist with many springs In the north there are many mountains and the hills are of salinealkaline soil In the east the plain is rich and moist and the cultivated elds are productive In the south vegetation is luxuriant while in the west the soil is hard and barren Such is the general condition of this vast country told in brief For the measurement of space there is the yojana In olden times it was called youxun yuzhena or youyan all incorrect One yojana is the distance covered by the ancient royal army in one days time Formerly it was said to be forty li or thirty li according to Indian usage while in Buddhist texts it was counted as only sixteen li Then the division goes on by sevens through the louse the nit the crevice dust the ox hair the sheep wool the hare hair the copper dust  the water dust down to the ne dust and one ne dust is divided into seven extremely ne dust  The extremely ne dust is indivisible if divided it becomes emptiness This is why it is called extremely ne dust Although the names of the alternating day and night and the emergence and disappearance of the sun and moon are different from those used in China there is no difference in the measurement of time and season The months are named according to the position of the Big Dipper The briefest unit of time is called a kṣaṇa one hundred twenty kṣaṇas make one tatkṣaṇa sixty tatkṣaṇas make one lava thirty lavas make one muhūrta ve muhūrtas make one kāla and six kālas make one day and one night  Secular people divide one day and one night into eight kālas four kālas in the daytime and four in the night each being subdivided into four divisions From the waxing moon to the full moon is known as the white division and from the waning moon to the last day of the month is called the black division The black division has fourteen or fteen days as the month may be small or big The anterior black division and the posterior white division constitute one month and six months make one year When the sun moves inside the celestial equator it is the northern revolution and when it moves outside the celestial equator it is the southern revolution These two revolutions constitute one year The year is also divided into six seasons namely from the sixteenth day of the rst month to the fteenth day of the third month is the season of gradual heat from the sixteenth day of the third month to the fteenth day of the fth month is the season of intense heat from the sixteenth day of the fth month to the fteenth day of the seventh month is the rainy season from the sixteenth day of the seventh month to the fteenth day of the ninth month is the season of exuberance from the sixteenth day of the ninth month to the fteenth day of the eleventh month is the season of gradual cold and from the sixteenth day of the eleventh month to the fteenth day of the rst month is the season of severe cold According to the holy teachings of the Tathāgata a year is divided into three seasons namely from the sixteenth day of the rst month to the fteenth day of the fth month is the hot season from the sixteenth day of the fth month to the fteenth day of the ninth month is the rainy season and from the sixteenth day of the ninth month to the fteenth day of the rst month is the cold season Or it is divided into four seasons namely spring summer autumn and winter The three months of spring are called Caitra Vaiśākha and Jyeṣṭha corresponding to the period from the sixteenth day of the rst month to the fteenth day of the fourth month in China The three months of summer are called ṣāḍha ravaṇa and Bhādrapada corresponding to the period from the sixteenth day of the fourth month to the fteenth day of the seventh month in China The three months of autumn are known as śvayuja Kārttika and Mārgaśīrṣa corresponding to the period from the sixteenth day of the seventh month to the fteenth day of the tenth month in China The three months of winter are named Pauṣa Māgha and Phālguna corresponding to the period from the sixteenth day of the tenth month to the fteenth day of the rst month in China Thus according to the holy teachings of the Buddha the monks of India observe the summer retreat during the rainy season either in the earlier three months or in the later three months The earlier three months correspond to the period from the sixteenth day of the fth month to the fteenth day of the eighth month in China and the later three months correspond to the period from the sixteenth day of the sixth month to the fteenth day of the ninth month in China Former translators of scriptures and Vinaya texts used the terms zuoxia or zuola  This was because they were outlandish people who did not understand the Chinese language correctly or were not conversant with the dialects and so they committed mistakes in their translations Moreover there are divergences in the calculation of the dates of the Buddhas entry into his mothers womb birth renunciation enlightenment and nirvana this point will be discussed later As regards the towns and cities they have square city walls which are broad and tall The streets and lanes are narrow and winding with stores facing the roads and wine shops standing beside the streets Butchers shermen harlots actors executioners and scavengers mark their houses with banners and are not allowed to live inside the cities When they come to town they have to sneak up and down along the left side of the road Concerning the building of residential houses and the construction of the city walls they are mostly built with bricks as the terrain is low and humid while the walls of houses may be made of wattled bamboo or wood The roofs of houses terraces and pavilions are made of planks plastered with limestone and covered with bricks or adobe Some of the lofty buildings are similar in style to those in China Cottages thatched with cogon grass or ordinary straw are built with bricks or planks and the walls are adorned with limestone The oor is puried by smearing it with cow dung and seasonal owers are scattered over it In this matter they differ  The monasteries are constructed in an extremely splendid manner They have four corner towers and the halls have three tiers The rafters eaves ridgepoles and roof beams are carved with strange gures The doors windows and walls are painted with colored pictures The houses of the common people are ostentatious inside but plain and simple outside The inner chambers and main halls vary in their dimensions and the structures of the tiered terraces and multistoried pavilions have no xed style but the doors open to the east and the throne also faces east For a seat on which to rest a rope bed is used The royal family great personages ofcials commoners and magnates adorn their seats in different ways but the structure is the same in style The sovereigns throne is exceedingly high and wide and decorated with pearls Called the lion seat it is covered with ne cotton cloth and is mounted by means of a jeweled footstool The ordinary ofcials carve their seats in different decorative patterns according to their fancy and they ornament them with rare gems Both the upper and undergarments as well as ornamental garb need no tailoring Pure white is the preferred color while motley is held in no account The men wind a piece of cloth around the waist under the armpits and leave the right shoulder uncovered The women wear a cape that covers both shoulders and hangs down loose The hair on the top is combed into a small topknot with the rest of the hair falling down Some men clip their mustaches and have other strange fashions such as wearing a garland on the head or a necklace on the body For clothing they use kauśeya and cotton cloth kauśeya being silk spun by wild silkworms The kṣauma cloth is made of hemp or similar bers The kambala is woven with ne sheep wool while the hela cape a sort of raincoat is woven with the wool of a wild animal As this wool is ne and soft and can be spun and woven it is valued for making garments In North India where the climate is bitterly cold the people wear tighttting short jackets quite similar to those of the Hu people The costumes of the heretics vary in style and are strangely made They dress in peacock tails or wear necklaces of skulls or go naked or cover their bodies with grass or boards or pluck their hair and clip their mustaches or have disheveled hair with a small topknot Their upper and undergarments have no xed style and the color may be red or white there is no denite rule The monks have only the three regular robes the saṃkakṣikā and the nivāsana robes as their religious garments The different sects have different ways of making the three robes of which the fringes may be broad or narrow and the folds may be small or large The saṃkakṣikā known in Chinese as armpit cover and formerly transcribed as sengqizhi incorrectly covers the left shoulder and veils both armpits It is open on the left and closed on the right side reaching below the waist Since the nivāsana has no strings for fastening it is worn by gathering it into pleats which are tightened with a braid The pleats are folded in different ways by different sects and the color also differs either yellow or red People of the kṣatriya and the brahman castes are pure and simple in lodging and clean and frugal The dress and ornaments of the kings and ministers are very ostentatious Garlands and coronets studded with gems are their headdresses and rings bracelets and necklaces are their bodily ornaments The wealthy merchants use only bracelets Most people go barefoot few wear shoes They stain their teeth red or black have closely cropped hair pierce their earlobes and have long noses and large eyes Such are their outward features They voluntarily keep themselves pure and clean not by compulsion Before taking a meal they must wash their hands Remnants and leftovers are not to be served again and food vessels are not passed from one person to another Earthenware and wooden utensils must be discarded after use and golden silver copper or iron vessels are polished each time after use When the meal is over they chew willow twigs to cleanse  and before washing and rinsing their mouths they do not come into contact with one another Each time after going to defecate or urinate they must wash themselves and daub their bodies with a fragrant substance such as sandalwood or turmeric When the monarch is going to take a bath music made by beating drums and playing stringed instruments is performed along with singing Before offering sacrices to gods and worshiping at temples they take baths and wash themselves It is known that their writing composed of fortyseven letters was invented by the deva Brahmā as an original standard for posterity These letters are combined to indicate objects and used as expressions for events The original branched as it gradually became widely used and there are slight modications of it according to place and people As a language in general it did not deviate from the original source The people of Central India are particularly accurate and correct in speech and their expressions and tones are harmonious and elegant like the language of the devas They speak accurately in a clear voice and serve as a standard for other people The people of neighboring lands and foreign countries became accustomed to speaking in erroneous ways until their mistakes became accepted as correct and they vied with one another in emulating vulgarities not sticking to the pure and simple style As regards their records of sayings and events there are separate departments in charge of them The annals and royal edicts are collectively called Nīlapiṭa  in which good and bad events are recorded and calamities as well as auspicious signs are noted down in detail To begin the education of their children and induce them to make progress they rst guide them to learn the Book of Twelve Chapters and when the children reach the age of seven the great treatises of the ve knowledges are gradually imparted to them The rst is the knowledge of grammar which explains the meanings of words and classies them into different groups The second is the knowledge of technical skills which teaches arts and mechanics the principles of yin and yang  and calendrical computation The third is the knowledge of medicine including the application of incantation exorcism drugs stone needles and moxibustion The fourth is the knowledge of logic by which orthodox and heterodox are ascertained and truth is differentiated from falsehood The fth is the inner knowledge which thoroughly investigates the teachings of the ve vehicles and the subtle theory of cause and effect The brahmans study the Four Vedas  The rst treatise is on longevity dealing with the preservation of good health and the readjustment of mentality The second is on worship that is offering sacrices and saying prayers The third is on equity concerning ceremonial rituals divination military tactics and battle formation The fourth is on practical arts which teaches unusual abilities crafts and numeration incantation and medical prescriptions The teachers must be learned in the essence and thoroughly master the profound mysteries They expound the cardinal principles and teach them with succinct but penetrating expressions The teachers summon up their pupils energy to study and tactfully induce them to progress They instruct the dull and encourage the less talented Those disciples who are intelligent and acute by nature and have sensible views intending to live in seclusion conne themselves and lock the door against the outside until they complete their studies On reaching the age of thirty they have xed their minds and gained achievements in learning After having been appointed to ofcial posts the rst thing they do is to repay the kindness of their teachers But the state honors wise and learned people and the people respect those who are noble and intelligent according them high praise and treating them with perfect etiquette Therefore people can devote their attention to learning without feeling fatigue and they travel about seeking knowledge and visiting masters of the Way in order to rely on the virtuous ones not counting a thousand li as a long journey Although their families may be rich such people make up their minds to live wandering about the world begging for their food wherever they go They value the acquisition of truth and do not deem poverty a disgrace Those people who lead a life of amusement and dissipation eating delicious food and wearing expensive garments neither have virtue nor study constantly they incur shame and disgrace upon themselves and their ill repute spreads far and wide The Tathāgatas teachings may be comprehended by each listener according to his own type of mentality and as we are now far away from the time of the holy Buddha some of his right Dharma is still pure and some has become deled There are different sects like peaks standing against each other and debating various viewpoints as vehemently as crashing waves They study divergent specic subjects but they all lead to the same goal Each of the eighteen sects is expert in argumentation using sharp and incisive words The manner of living of the Mahayana followers and that of the Hinayana followers differ from each other Samādhi and prajñā are far apart and noisiness and calmness are quite different Each community of monks has laid down its own restrictive rules and regulations All texts whether belonging to the Vinaya  the Abhidharma  or the Sutras  are scriptures of the Buddha A monk who can expound one text is exempted from routine monastic duties One who can expound two texts is supplied with additional good rooms and daily requisites One who can expound three texts is to be served by attendants One who can expound four texts is provided with lay servants at his service One who can expound ve texts is entitled to ride an elephant when going out One who can expound six texts has a retinue protecting him The honor given to those who have high morality is also extraordinary Assemblies for discussion are often held to test the intellectual capacity of the monks in order to distinguish superior from inferior and to reject the dull and promote the bright Those who can deliberate on the subtle sayings and glorify the wonderful theories with rened diction and quick eloquence may ride richly caparisoned elephants with hosts of attendants preceding and following behind them But those to whom the theories are taught in vain or who have been defeated in a debate explaining few principles in a verbose way or distorting the teachings with language that is merely pleasant to the ear are daubed with ocher or chalk on the face while dust is scattered over the body and they are exiled to the wilderness or discarded in ditches In this way the good and the evil are distinguished and the wise and the ignorant disclosed Thus people may take delight in the Way and study diligently at home They may either forsake their homes or return to secular life as they please To those who commit faults or violate the disciplinary rules the community of monks may mete out punishments A light offense incurs public reprimand and the penalty for the next gravest offense is that the monks do not speak to the offender One who has committed a grave offense is excommunicated that is he is expelled contemptuously by the community of monks Once expelled the offender will have nowhere to take shelter and will suffer the hardships of a vagabond life or he may return to his former life as a layperson As far as the different clans are concerned there are four castes among the people The rst caste is that of the brahmans who are pure in conduct adhere to their doctrines live in chastity and preserve their virtue in purity The second is the caste of kṣatriyas formerly transcribed incorrectly as chali who are royal descendants and rule the country taking benevolence and humanity as their objects in life The third is the caste of vaiśyas formerly transcribed incorrectly as pishe who are merchants and traders exchanging goods to meet the needs of one another and gaining prot far and near The fourth caste is the śūdras farmers who labor in the elds and toil at sowing and reaping These four castes are differentiated by their hereditary purity or delement People of a given caste marry within the caste and the conspicuous and the humble do not marry each other Relatives either on the fathers or the mothers side do not intermarry A woman can marry only once and can never remarry There are numerous miscellaneous clans grouped together according to their categories and it is difcult to give a detailed account The monarchs and kings of successive generations have always been kṣatri yas When usurpation and regicide occasionally happened other families assumed supreme power The warriors of the nation are wellchosen men of extraordinary bravery and as the occupation is hereditary they become experienced in the art of war In peacetime they guard the palace buildings and in times of war they courageously forge ahead as the vanguard The army is composed of four types of troops namely infantry cavalry charioteers and elephantmounted soldiers The war elephant is covered with strong armor and its tusks are armed with sharp barbs The general who controls the armed forces rides on it with two soldiers walking on each side to manage the animal The chariot carrying the commanderinchief is drawn by four horses and arrays of soldiers march beside the wheels to protect him The cavalrymen spread open to draw up a defensive formation or gallop ahead to pursue the defeated enemy The infantry daring men chosen for their boldness go lightly into battle carrying large shields and long spears sabers or swords and dashing to the front of the battle array All their weapons are sharp and keen and they have been trained in such weaponry as the spear shield bow and arrow saber sword battle axe hatchet dagger axe long pole long spear discus rope and the like with which they practice generation after generation Although the people are violent and impetuous by temperament they are plain and honest in nature They do not engage in treachery and are creditable in keeping their promises Government administration emphasizes simplicity and honesty and the people are amicable by social custom There are occasionally criminals and scoundrels who violate the national law or scheme to endanger the sovereign When the facts are discovered these criminals are often cast into jail where they are left to live or die they are not sentenced to death but are no longer regarded as members of human society The punishment for those who infringe the ethical code or behave against the principles of loyalty and lial piety is to cut off the nose excise an ear mutilate a hand or amputate a foot or the offender may be banished to another country or into the wilderness Other offenses can be expiated by a cash payment When a judge hears a case no torture is inicted upon the accused to extort a confession The accused answers whatever questions are put to him and then a sentence is fairly passed according to the facts In order to ascertain the actual facts of a case ordeals are required to justify a nal judgment There are four ways namely ordeals by water re weighing and poison In the ordeal by water the accused person is put into a sack and a stone is put into another sack the two sacks are connected together and thrown into a deep river to discriminate the real criminal from the suspect If the person sinks and the stone oats his guilt is proven but if the person oats and the stone sinks he is then judged as having concealed nothing In the ordeal by re the accused is forced to crouch on a piece of hot iron and required to stamp on it with his feet to touch it with his hands and to lick it with his tongue If the charge against him is false he will not be harmed but if he is burned he is judged to be the real culprit If a weak and feeble person cannot stand the heat of the scorching iron he is asked to scatter some ower buds over the hot iron If he is falsely charged the buds open into owers but if he is truly a criminal the buds are burned In the ordeal by weighing the accused is weighed on a balance against a stone to determine which is heavier If the charge is false the person goes down while the stone goes up if the charge is true the stone is weightier than the person In the ordeal by poison the right hind leg of a black ram is cut and poison is put into it as a portion for the accused to eat If the charge is true the person dies from the poison but if the charge is false the poison is counteracted and the accused may survive These four ordeals are the methods for the prevention of a hundred misdeeds There are nine grades in the manner of paying homage They are inquiring after ones health bowing down three times to show respect bowing with hands raised high bowing with hands folded before the chest kneeling on one knee kneeling on both knees crouching with hands and knees on the ground bowing down with hands elbows and head to the ground and prostrating oneself with hands elbows and head touching the ground In all these nine grades the utmost veneration is expressed by doing only one obeisance To kneel down and praise the others virtue is the perfect form of veneration If one is at a distance  one just prostrates with folded hands If a venerated person is nearby one kisses their feet and rubs their heels When one is delivering messages or receiving orders he must hold up his robe and kneel The honored person who receives veneration must say some kind words in return or stroke the head or pat the back of the worshiper giving him good words of admonition to show his affection and kindness When a homeless monk receives salutation he expresses only his good wishes in return and never stops the worshiper from paying homage to him One often pays reverence to a great respected master by circumambulating him once thrice or as many times as one wishes if one has a special request in mind When a person is sick he refrains from eating food for seven days and during this period he may often recover his health If he is not cured then he takes medicine Medicines are of various properties and have different names and physicians differ in medical technique and methods of diagnosis At a funeral ceremony the relatives of the departed one wail and weep rend their clothes and tear their hair strike their foreheads and beat their chests They do not wear mourning clothes and have no xed period of mourning There are three kinds of burial service The rst is cremation in which a pyre is built and the body is burned The second is water burial in which the corpse is put into a stream to be carried away The third is wilderness burial in which the body is discarded in a forest to feed wild animals After the demise of a king the rst function is to enthrone the crown prince so that he may preside over the funeral ceremony and x the positions of superiority and inferiority Meritorious titles are conferred on a king while he is living and no posthumous appellations are given after his death No one goes to take a meal at a house where the people are suffering the pain of bereavement but when the funeral service is over things go back to normal and there are no taboos Those who have taken part in a funeral procession are considered unclean and they must all bathe themselves outside the city before reentering the city walls As regards those who are getting very old approaching the time of death suffering from incurable disease or fearing that life is drawing to an end they become disgusted with this world desire to cast off human life despise mortal existence and wish to get rid of the ways of the world Their relatives and friends then play music to hold a farewell party put them in a boat and row them to the middle of the Ganges River so that they may drown themselves in the river It is said that they will thus be reborn in the heavens Out of ten people only one cherishes such ideas and so far I have not seen this with my own eyes According to monastic regulations homeless monks should not lament over the deaths of their parents but should recite and chant scriptures in memory of their kindness so as to be in keeping with the funeral rites and impart happiness to the departed souls As the government is liberal ofcial duties are few There is no census registration and no corve labor is imposed upon the people The rst division is used by the state to defray the expense of offering sacrices to gods and ancestors the second division is used for bestowing efs to the kings assistants and ministers the third division is for giving rewards to prominent and intelligent scholars of high talent and the fourth division is for making meritorious donations to various heterodox establishments Therefore taxation is light and forced labor rarely levied Everyone keeps to his hereditary occupation and all people cultivate the portions of land allotted to them per capita Those who till the kings elds pay onesixth of their crops as rent Also in order to gain prots merchants and traders travel about exchanging commodities and they pay light duties at ferries and barriers to pass through For public construction no forced labor is enlisted laborers are paid according to the work they have done Soldiers are dispatched to garrison outposts and palace guards are conscripted according to circumstances and rewards are announced in order to obtain applicants Magistrates and ministers as well as common government ofcials and assistants all have their portions of land so that they may sustain themselves by the ef they have been granted As the climate and soil vary in different places the natural products also differ in various districts There are diverse descriptions of owers herbs fruit and trees with different names such as āmra  āmla  ma dhūka  badara  kapittha  āmalaka  tinduka  uḍumbara  moca  nārikera  and panasa  It is difcult to give a full list of such fruit  and here I just mention a few of them that are valued by the people Dates chestnuts and green and red persimmons are unknown in India Pears crabapples peaches apricots and grapes are often alternately grown in Kaśmīra and elsewhere while pomegranates and sweet oranges are planted in all countries In the cultivation of elds such farm work as sowing and reaping ploughing and weeding and seeding and planting are done according to the seasons either laboriously or with ease Among the native products rice and wheat are particularly abundant As for vegetables there are ginger mustard melon calabash and kanda  Onion and garlic are scarce and few people eat them Those who eat them are driven out of the city Milk ghee oil butter granulated sugar rock candy mustardseed oil and various kinds of cakes and parched grainse are used as common food and sh mutton and venison are occasionally served as delicacies The meat of such animals as oxen donkeys elephants horses pigs dogs foxes wolves lions monkeys and apes is not to be eaten as a rule Those who eat the meat of such animals are despised and detested by the general public and the offenders are expelled to the outskirts of the city they rarely show themselves among the people As regards different spirits and sweet wines of diverse tastes drinks made from grapes and sugarcane are for the kṣatriyas and fermented spirits and unltered wines are for the vaiśyas to drink The śramaṇas and brahmans drink grape and sugarcane juice as they refrain from taking alcoholic beverages For the low and mixed castes there are no specic drinks As to household implements there are different articles made of various materials for various purposes Miscellaneous necessities are always sufciently at hand Although cauldrons and big pots are used for cooking the rice steamer is unknown Cooking utensils are mostly made of earthenware with a few made of brass When taking a meal a person eats from one vessel in which all the ingredients are mixed together He takes the food with his ngers never using spoons or chopsticks the aged and the sick use copper spoons for eating food Gold silver brass white jade and crystal are local products which are amassed in large quantities Precious substances and rare treasures of different descriptions procured from overseas are commodities for trading For the exchange of goods gold and silver coins cowries and small pearls are used as the media of exchange The territories and boundaries of India have been described above and different local conditions have been briey related here I have made only a rough statement of what is common in all the regions of the country in a generalized manner As regards the particular political administrations and social customs of different regions I shall explain them separately under the heading of each country as follows The country of Lampā is over one thousand li in circuit with the Snow Mountains at its back in the north and the Black Range on the other three sides The capital city is more than ten li in circuit Several hundred years ago the royal family of this country ceased to exist and since then powerful families have competed with each other for superiority in the absence of a great monarch It has recently become a dependency of Kāpiśī The country produces non glutinous rice and much sugarcane There are many trees but little fruit The climate is temperate there is little frost and no snow The country is a rich and happy land and the people are fond of singing and chanting but they are timid and deceitful by nature They cheat and do not respect one another They are ugly and short in stature and are frivolous and impetuous in behavior They mostly wear white cotton and are nicely dressed There are more than ten monasteries with a few monks most of whom are students of the Mahayana teachings There are several tens of deva temples with many heretics From here going southeast for over one hundred li I crossed a high mountain and a large river and then arrived in the country of Nagarahāra in North India This country is over six hundred li from east to west and two hundred fty or sixty li from south to north It is surrounded by steep and dangerous precipices on all sides The capital city is more than twenty li in circuit There is no sovereign king to rule over the country and it belongs to Kāpiśī as a vassal state They do not value wealth but esteem learning and they venerate the buddhadharma though a few have faith in heretical religions There are many monasteries but few monks All the stupas are deserted and in dilapidated condition There are ve deva temples with over a hundred heretics Two li to the east of the capital city there is a stupa built by King Aśoka that is over three hundred feet high with piledup stones on which there are marvelous sculptures This was the place where ākya Bodhisattva once met Dīpaṃkara Buddha and spread a piece of deerskin and his own hair to cover the muddy ground  and received a prediction of buddhahood from him Although it has passed through a kalpa of destruction the ancient trace remains intact On fast days various kinds of owers descend on the spot and multitudes of the common people vie with one another in making offerings  In a monastery to the west of the stupa there are a few monks Further to the south a small stupa marks the spot where the Bodhisattva covered up the muddy ground in a former life It was erected by King Aśoka at a secluded place to avoid the highway Inside the capital city there are the old foundations of a great stupa I heard the local people say that it had formerly contained a tooth relic of the Buddha and that it was originally a tall and magnicent structure Now there is no more tooth relic and only the old foundations remain there Beside them there is a stupa more than thirty feet high whose origin is unknown according to local tradition The people said that it dropped down from the air and took root at the spot It was not built by human beings and it manifested many spiritual signs Over ten li to the southwest of the capital city there is a stupa that marks the spot where the Tathāgata once alighted during his ight from Central India on his travels to seek edication Moved by the event the people of the country built the base of this spiritual stupa out of admiration Not far away to the east there is a stupa marking the place where ākya Bodhisattva met Dīpaṃkara Buddha in a former life and purchased some owers to offer to the buddha More than twenty li to the southwest of the capital city one reaches a small range of rocky hills where there is a monastery with lofty halls and multistoried pavilions all constructed out of rocks The buildings were all quiet and silent and not a single monk was to be found Within the compound of the monastery there was a stupa more than two hundred feet high built by King Aśoka To the southwest of the monastery is a deep gully with overhanging rocks  from which water falls down the walllike precipices On the rocky wall at the east precipice is a large cave that was the dwelling place of the nāga Gopāla The entrance is small and narrow and it is dark inside the cave water drips from the rocks down to the mountain path Formerly there was a shadowy image of the Buddha resembling his true features with all the good physical marks just as if he were alive But in recent years it is not visible to everyone and even those who see it can only perceive an indistinct outline Those who pray with utmost sincerity may get a spiritual response and see a clear picture but only for a brief instant When the Tathāgata was living in the world the nāga was a cowherd whose duty was to supply the king with milk and cream Once he failed to fulll his task properly and was reprimanded by the king With a feeling of hatred and malice he purchased some owers to offer to the stupa of prediction in the hope that he might be reborn as an evil nāga to devastate the country and do harm to the king Then he went up to the rocky precipice and jumped down to kill himself Thus he became a nāga king and lived in this cave The moment he desired to go out of the cave to carry out his evil wishes the Tathāgata with a mind of compassion for the people of the country who would suffer havoc caused by the nāga arrived from Central India ying through his supernatural power At the sight of the Tathāgata the nāgas malignant mind ceased He accepted the rule of nonkilling and wished to protect the right Dharma So he requested that the Tathāgata dwell in the cave permanently and to always offer alms to all his saintly disciples The Tathāgata said to him I shall enter nirvana but I will leave my shadow behind for you and I will send ve arhats to always receive your offerings Even when the right Dharma has disappeared into oblivion this arrangement will not be altered If your malignant mind becomes agitated you should look at my shadow and on account of your compassion and benevolence your malignant mind will come to an end During this bhadra kalpa all the future Worldhonored Ones will have compassion for you and leave their shadows behind Outside the door of Shadow Cave there are two square rocks On one of the rocks is the trace of the Tathāgatas footprint with the wheel sign dimly visible and it sometimes emits a light On either side of Shadow Cave there are many other caves which are the places where the saintly disciples of the Tathāgata used to sit in meditation On a corner to the northwest of the Shadow Cave there is a stupa that marks the place where the Tathāgata once took a walk Beside it is another stupa in which are stored the relics of the Tathāgatas hair and nail parings Not far from here another stupa marks the spot where the Tathāgata preached on the true doctrine of the skandhas ve attributes of being the āyatanas  and the dhātus eighteen spheres consisting of the six sense organs the six sense objects and the six consciousnesses To the west of Shadow Cave there is a large at rock on which the Tathāgata once washed his robe the traces of the robe left on the rock are still dimly visible At more than thirty li to the southeast of the city one reaches the city of Hilo which is four or ve li in circuit is high precipitous and impregnable There are owers trees and pools with pure water as bright as a mirror The inhabitants of the city are simple and honest and they believe in the right Dharma There is a multistoried pavilion with colorfully painted beams and pillars On the second story is a small stupa made of the seven precious substances in which is preserved a piece of the Tathāgatas skull bone twelve inches in circumference with distinct hair pores yellowishwhite in color which is contained in a precious casket that has been placed inside the stupa Those who wish to tell their fortunes may prepare some fragrant plaster to make an impression of the skull bone and then read a clear written prediction according to the effects of their blessedness There is another small stupa made of the seven precious substances in which is stored the Tathāgatas cranial bone which has the shape of a lotus leaf and is of the same color as the skull bone It is also contained in a precious casket that has been sealed up and placed  There is another small stupa made of the seven precious substances in which is preserved an eyeball of the Tathāgata as large as a crabapple brilliant and transparent throughout It is also contained in a precious casket that has been sealed up and placed  The Tathāgatas upper robe made of ne cotton in a yellowishred color is placed in a precious casket It has lasted a long time and is slightly damaged The Tathāgatas pewter staff with rings made of pewter and a sandalwood handle is stored in a precious tube Recently a king heard that these relics belonged to the Tathāgata and he captured them by force These ve holy objects have shown many spiritual signs The king of Kāpiśī ordered ve attendants to take care of the relics by offering incense and owers and worshipers came to pay reverence to them without cease The attendants wishing to spend their time in quietude and thinking that people would value money more than anything else in order to stop the hubbub caused by visitors made a rule to the effect that one gold coin would be charged to see the skull bone and ve gold coins would be charged for making an impression This rule was also applicable in different grades to the other relics Even with these steep fees the number of worshipers increased To the northwest of the storied pavilion there is a stupa that is also very lofty and has shown many marvelous signs When it is touched with a nger it shakes down to the basement and its bells ring harmoniously From here going toward the southeast among mountains and valleys for over ve hundred li I reached the country of Gandhāra at former times incorrectly transcribed as Qiantuowei in the domain of North India The country of Gandhāra is more than one thousand li from east to west and over eight hundred li from south to north with the Indus on the east The capital city called Puruṣapura is more than forty li in circuit The royal family is extinct and the country is now under the domination of Kāpiśī The towns and villages are desolate and have few inhabitants In one corner of the palace city there are over one thousand families They produce abundant cereals and have owers and fruit in profusion The country grows much sugarcane and produces sugar candy The climate is mild and there is scarcely any frost or snow The people are shy and timid by nature and are fond of literature and the arts Most of them respect heretical religions only a few believe in the right Dharma Since ancient times masters who wrote commentaries and theoretical treatises in India such as Nārāyaṇadeva Asaṅga Vasubandhu Dharmatrāta Manoratha Pārśva and so on have been born in this country There were more than a thousand monasteries but they are now dilapidated and deserted in desolate condition Most of the stupas are also in ruins There are about a hundred deva temples inhabited by various heretics To the northeast inside the royal city there are the remains of the foundation of a precious terrace on which the Buddhas almsbowl was once placed After the Tathāgatas demise the bowl was brought to this country where it was venerated with formal rituals for several hundred years and then it was brought to various countries It is now in Persia At a distance of eight or nine li to the southeast outside the city there is a pipal tree more than one hundred feet tall with profuse branches and leaves that cast a dense shade on the ground The four past buddhas sat under this tree and now statues of the four buddhas are still to be seen there The remaining nine hundred and ninetysix buddhas of the bhadrakalpa will also sit under it divinely guarded and protected by gods and deities Once when ākya Tathāgata was sitting under this tree facing south he told nanda Four hundred years after my demise there will be a king named Kaniṣka who will erect a stupa not far south of here Most of my bodily remains will be collected in it To the south of the pipal tree there is a stupa constructed by King Kaniṣka In the four hundredth year after the Tathāgatas demise King Kaniṣka ascended the throne and ruled over Jambudvīpa He did not believe in the theory of retribution for good and evil deeds and contemptuously defamed the buddhadharma Once he was hunting in a marsh when a white hare appeared The king chased after the hare and it suddenly disappeared at this place In the woods he saw a young cowherd building a small stupa three feet high The king asked the boy What are you doing The boy replied Formerly ākya Buddha made a wise prediction A king will build a stupa at this auspicious place and most of my bodily remains will be collected in it Your Majestys holy virtues were cultivated in your previous lives and your name coincides with the one mentioned in the prediction Your divine merits and superior blessedness will be realized at this time Thus I am here as a preliminary sign to remind you of the prediction With these words the cowherd vanished Upon hearing these words the king was overjoyed and was proud to know that his name had been predicted by the Great Sage in his prophecy Thereafter he professed the right faith and deeply believed in the buddhadharma Around the small stupa he built a stone stupa wishing to encompass the smaller one through the power of his merit But no matter how tall he built the stone stupa the smaller one was always three feet higher until the larger stupa reached over four hundred feet in height standing on a base one and a half li in circuit with ve ights of steps leading up to a height of one hundred fty feet so that it then covered the small stupa Delighted the king also had gilded copper disks arranged in twentyve tiers on the top Then he placed one hu of the Tathāgatas relic bones in the stupa to which he piously made offerings When construction of the large stupa had just been completed the king saw that the small stupa was protruding with half of its structure sideways at the southeast corner of the base  Enraged the kinf threw the smaller stupa upward and it stayed there half of it appearing in the stone base under the second ight of steps of the stupa but another small stupa emerged at the original place The king then gave up and remarked with a sigh Human affairs are bewildering but the merits of deities are insuppressible What is the use of being angry with it if it is supported by the gods Ashamed and fearful the king apologized and returned home These two stupas still stand Those who are ill and wish to pray for recovery offer incense and owers to the stupas with pious minds and in most cases they are cured On the southern side of the ight of steps at the east of the great stupa there are two carved stupas one three and the other ve feet high in the same style and shape as the great stupa There are also two carved images of the Buddha one four and the other six feet in height resembling the Buddha sitting crosslegged under the bodhi tree In the sunshine these images are of a dazzling golden color and when they are gradually covered by shade the lines on the stone become bluishviolet in color Some local old people said that several hundred years ago there were goldencolored ants in the crevice of the stone the big ones were the size of a ngernail and the small ones were the size of a grain of wheat Following one another they gnawed at the surface of the stone and the lines they made on the stone looked like incised grooves that were lled with golden sand to delineate the images which are still in existence On the south side of the ight of steps leading up to the great stupa there is a painting of the Buddha sixteen feet in height with two busts above the chest but only one body below it Some old people said that there was formerly a poor man who sustained himself by working as a laborer Once he earned a gold coin and wished to make an image of the Buddha He came to the stupa and said to a painter I wish to make a portrait of the Tathāgatas excellent features but I have only one gold coin which is really insufcient for remuneration This has been my longcherished desire but I am poor and lack money In consideration of the poor mans sincerity the painter did not argue about the payment and promised to accomplish the job Another man under the same circumstances came with a gold coin to request the painter to draw a portrait of the Buddha Thus the painter accepted the money from both men and he asked another skillful painter to work together with him in drawing a single portrait When the two men came on the same day to worship the Buddha the two painters showed them the portrait pointing at it and saying This is the portrait you ordered The two men looked at each other bewildered The painters realized that they were doubtful about the matter and said to them Why are you pondering the matter for so long Whatever object we undertake to produce is done without the slightest fault If our words are not false the portrait will show miracles As soon as they had uttered these words the portrait manifested a wonder the body split into two busts while the shadows intermingled into one with the features shining brilliantly The two men were happily convinced and delightedly fostered faith More than a hundred paces to the southwest of the great stupa there is a standing image of the Buddha made of white stone eighteen feet high facing north It often worked miracles and frequently emitted light Sometimes people see it walking at night and circumambulating the great stupa Recently a band of robbers intended to enter the stupa to steal the contents The image came out to meet the robbers headon and the robbers withdrew in fear Then the image returned to its original place and stood there as usual Thereafter the robbers corrected their error and made a fresh start in life They walked about in towns and villages and related the event to all people far and near At the left and right sides of the great stupa there are hundreds of small stupas arranged as closely together as the scales of a sh The Buddhas images are magnicent having been made with perfect craftsmanship Unusual fragrances and strange sounds are sometimes perceived and spirits and genies as well as holy ones may be seen circumambulating the great stupa The Tathāgata predicted that when this stupa has burned down and been rebuilt seven times the buddhadharma will come to an end Previous sages have recorded that it has been destroyed and reconstructed three times When I rst came to this country the stupa had just suffered the disaster of conagration To the west of the great stupa there is an old monastery built by King Kaniṣka The multistoried pavilion and the houses built on terraces were constructed so that eminent monks could be invited in recognition of their distinguished merits Although the buildings are dilapidated they can still be regarded as wonderful constructions There are a few monks who study the Hinayana teachings Since the monastery was constructed it has produced extraordinary personages from time to time who were either writers of treatises or people who realized sainthood On the third story of the pavilion is the room used by Venerable Pārśva  It has been in ruins for a long time but its location is indicated with a mark The venerable monk was a brahmanical teacher but he became a Buddhist monk at the age of eighty Some young people in the city sneered at him saying You stupid old man why are you so ignorant A Buddhist monk has two duties rst to practice meditation and second to recite scriptures Now you are getting old and feeble and cannot make any more progress So you are trying to pass yourself off as a monk among the pure mendicants but you do nothing but eat your ll Having heard this reproach Venerable Pārśva apologized to the people and made a vow saying If I do not thoroughly master the teachings of the Tripiṭaka and do not cut off all desires of the three realms of the world so as to realize the six supernatural powers and possess the eight emancipations I shall not lie down to sleep with my ribs touching the mat He then worked hard and always meditated whether he was walking sitting or standing still In the daytime he studied theories and doctrines and at night he sat quietly in meditation with a concentrated mind In three years time he completely mastered the Tripiṭaka cut off the desires of the three realms of the world and obtained the wisdom of the three knowledges As the people respected him they called him Venerable Ribs  To the east of Venerable Pārśvas chamber there is an old room in which Vasubandhu Bodhisattva composed the Abhidharmakośaśāstra Out of respect for him the people had the room sealed and indicated by a mark On the second story of the pavilion at a place more than fty paces to the south of Vasubandhu Bodhisattvas room is the place where the śāstra master Manoratha composed the Vibhāṣāśāstra The śāstra master was born a thousand years after the nirvana of the Buddha When he was young he loved learning and was eloquent in speech His fame spread far and both clerics and laypeople had faith in him At that time the inuence of King Vikramāditya of rāvastī reached far and he brought the various parts of India under his domination Every day he distributed ve lakhs of gold coins as alms to paupers orphans and the solitary The state treasurer fearing that the national treasury would be exhausted ironically remonstrated with the king saying Your Majestys strong inuence extends to various peoples and your kindness benets even insects Pray spend ve more lakhs of gold coins to relieve the poor and needy of the four quarters When the treasury is exhausted we can levy more taxes and repeated taxation will arouse the peoples resentment and grievance everywhere but the monarch above may show off his kindness in bestowing charity upon the people and we subjects below will bear the blame of being disrespectful The king said We collect surplus money to give to those who are short of it it is not for ourselves that we squander the national wealth Thus ve lakhs of gold coins were added to the sum of money given to the poor and needy Later while out hunting the king lost the trace of a wild boar and a man who found the animal was granted a reward of one lakh of gold coins Now when the śāstra master Manoratha once had his hair shaved he paid the barber one lakh of gold coins and the state annalist accordingly put the event on record The king was ashamed to have been surpassed by a monk in lavishing money and intended to insult the śāstra master Manoratha in public Thus he summoned a hundred heretical teachers of high virtue and deep learning to whom he issued an order saying We wish to glean various views to nd out the truth but different schools have different theories so we do not know where to x our mind Now we wish to see which of your schools is superior and which is inferior so that we may know which way we should follow exclusively At the time the discussion was held the king issued another order saying These heretical śāstra masters are brilliant and talented scholars and the śramaṇas of the Dharma should master their own theories well If they win in the debate we shall venerate the buddhadharma otherwise we will slaughter the Buddhist monks Then Manoratha debated with the heretics and defeated ninetynine of the opponents who ed in retreat When he came to the subject of re and smoke the king and the heretic said aloud The śāstra master Manoratha has made a faulty statement It is common sense that smoke precedes re Although Manoratha wished to explain his viewpoint no one would listen to his argumentation Ashamed of being insulted in public he bit off his tongue and wrote a letter to his disciple Vasubandhu saying Among groups supported by factions one cannot hold a great principle in competition and in an assembly of ignorant people there is no way to argue for the right theory He died after having written these words Not long afterward King Vikramāditya lost his kingdom and was succeeded by another king who adored and respected people of eminence and wisdom Wishing to rehabilitate his teachers good name Vasubandhu Bodhisattva came to the new king and said to him Your Majesty rules the kingdom with your saintly virtues and you render support to all living beings My late teacher Manoratha was learned in abstruse and profound theories but the previous king held a grudge against him and besmirched his good name in public As I have studied under his instruction I wish to avenge the wrong done to my teacher The king knowing that Manoratha had been a wise man and appreciating Vasubandhus upright character summoned all the heretics who had debated with Manoratha to a meeting Vasubandhu then reiterated what his teacher had expounded and all the heretics were defeated and withdrew Going to the northeast for more than fty li from the monastery built by King Kaniṣka I crossed a large river and reached the city of Puṣkarāvatī which is fourteen or fteen li in circuit Outside the west gate of the city there is a deva temple in which the deva image is austere in appearance and often works miracles To the east of the city there is a stupa built by King Aśoka It marks the place where the four past buddhas preached the Dharma Ancient saints and sages coming from Central India to subdue divine beings and teach human mortals at this place were very numerous It was at this site that the śāstra master Vasumitra composed the Abhidharmaprakaraṇapādaśāstra Four or ve li to the north of the city there is an old monastery whose buildings are in desolation with a few resident monks who are followers of Hinayana teachings This is the place where the śāstra master Dharmatrāta known as Fajiu in Chinese and erroneously transcribed as Damoduoluo in olden times composed the Abhidharmatābhidharmahṛdayaśāstra Beside the monastery there is a stupa several hundred feet high built by King Aśoka The wood carvings and stone sculptures are quite different from work done by human artisans Formerly when ākya Buddha was a king he practiced the way of the bodhisattva at this place and gave alms tirelessly to all living beings according to their wishes He was the king of this land for one thousand lives and it was at this auspicious place where he surrendered his eyes in one thousand lives Not far east of where ākya Buddha forsook his eyes there are two stone stupas both more than one hundred feet high The one on the right was erected by Brahmā and the one on the left by Indra and both are beautifully decorated with wonderful jewels and gems After the demise of the Tathāgata the gems turned into stone Although the foundations have sunk the stupas still stand high and lofty More than fty li to the northwest of the stupas built by Brahmā and Indra there is a stupa that marks the place where ākya Tathāgata converted the goddess Hārītī to prevent her from doing harm to people Thus it became the custom of the country to pray to the goddess for offspring More than fty li to the north of the place where Hārītī was converted there is a stupa built at the spot where yāmaka Bodhisattva gathered fruit to offer to his blind parents in fulllment of his lial duty and he met the king who was hunting and who accidentally hit him with a poisoned arrow Indra moved by yāmakas mind of sincerity dressed the wound with medicine and his virtuous deed inspired the gods who restored him to life very quickly Going to the southeast for more than two hundred li from the place where yāmaka Bodhisattva was injured I reached the city of Varṣa To the north of the city there is a stupa built at the place where Prince Sudāna Good Tooth  said farewell to his countrymen at the city gate when he was banished from the city and apologized to the people for having given his fathers elephant as a gift to a brahman In the monastery beside the stupa there are more than fty monks all of whom are followers of the Hinayana teachings It was at this place that the śāstra master śvara composed the Abhidharmadīpaśāstra Outside the east gate of Varṣa there is a monastery with more than fty monks all of whom are followers of the Mahayana teachings There is a stupa built by King Aśoka Formerly when Prince Sudāna was living in exile at Daṇḍaloka Mountain  a brahman begged for his sons and wife and then sold them at this place At a place more than twenty li to the northeast from Varṣa one reaches Daṇḍaloka Mountain On the ridge there is a stupa built by King Aśoka to mark the place where Prince Sudāna once lived in seclusion Not far away there is another stupa built at the spot where the prince gave away his sons and wife to a brahman The brahman beat the princes sons and wife until their blood ran to the ground and stained the earth Even now the grass and plants still retain a reddish hue The cave on the cliff was the place where the prince and his wife practiced meditation The branches of the trees in the valley droop like curtains and the prince used to roam about here Nearby is a stone hermitage that was the abode of an ancient ṛṣi  At more than one hundred li to the northwest from the hermitage one crosses over a small hill and arrives at a large mountain On the south of the mountain there is a monastery in which lived a few monks who studied Mahayana teachings The stupa beside it was built by King Aśoka at the place where the ṛṣi Unicorn once lived This ṛṣi was ensnared by a lustful woman and lost his supernatural powers The lustful woman then rode on his shoulders and returned to the city At more than fty li to the northeast from Varṣa one reaches a lofty mountain on which there is a bluish stone image of Bhīmādevī wife of Maheśvara The local people said that this image of the goddess existed naturally It showed many marvels and many people came to give prayers In all parts of India people both noble and common who wish to pray for blessedness ock to this place from far and near Those who wish to see the physical form of the goddess may get a vision of her after fasting for seven days with a sincere and concentrated mind and in most cases their wishes will be fullled At the foot of the mountain there is a temple for Maheśvara in which the ashsmearing heretics perform ceremonies Going for a hundred fty li to the southeast from the Bhīmādevī temple I reached the city of Uḍakhand which is more than twenty li in circuit bordering the Indus River in the south The inhabitants are rich and happy Precious goods pile up high and most of the rare and valuable things of different places are collected here Going for more than twenty li to the northwest from Uḍakhand I reached the city of alātura the birthplace of the ṛṣi Pāṇini author of the abdavidyāśāstra At the beginning of antiquity the written language was rich and extensive in vocabulary but with the passage of the kalpa of destruction the world became empty and afterward the longlived deities descended to the earth to guide human beings Thereafter literary documents were produced and thenceforth the source of literature became a torrential ood Brahmā and Indra wrote model compositions as the time required and the ṛṣis of each of the heretical systems formed their own words The people studied what was taught by their predecessors and emulated what was handed down but the efforts of the students were wasted because it was difcult for them to master everything in detail At the time when the human life span was a hundred years the ṛṣi Pāṇini was born with innate knowledge of wide scope Feeling pity at the shallowness of learning in his time and wishing to expunge what was supercial and false and delete what was superuous he traveled about to make inquiries into the way of learning He met with Maheśvara and told the deity of his intention Maheśvara said How grand it is I shall render you assistance The ṛṣi withdrew after hearing these words and concentrated his mind to ponder the matter He collected all words and composed a text of one thousand stanzas each stanza consisting of thirtytwo syllables In this book he made a thorough study of the written and spoken language of both ancient and modern times and offered it to the king in a sealed envelope The king treasured it very much and ordered that all the people of the country should learn the text one who could recite it uently by heart would be rewarded with a thousand gold coins Thus this text was transmitted from teacher to pupil and became prevalent at that time Henceforth the brahmans in this city are great scholars of high talent with knowledge of wide scope In the city of alātura there is a stupa built at the place where an arhat converted a disciple of Pāṇini Five hundred years after the demise of the Tathāgata a great arhat came from Kaśmīra to this place in the course of his journey When he saw a brahman teacher beating a schoolboy he asked the brahman Why are you chastising the child The brahman said I asked him to learn the abdavidyāśāstra but he has not made progress with the passage of time The arhat smiled amiably and the old brahman said A śramaṇa should be compassionate and have sympathy for all living beings But you are now smiling and I would like to know why The arhat said in reply It is not easy for me to tell you for fear that it might cause you deep doubt Have you ever heard about the ṛṣi Pāṇini who composed the abda vidyāśāstra for the instruction of posterity The brahman said He was a scion of this city Out of admiration for his virtue his disciples have made an image of him which is still in existence The arhat said This son of yours is that ṛṣi On account of his rich knowledge he took delight in studying worldly books discussing only the heretical theories and never researching the truth He wasted his spirit and wisdom and is still involved in the wheel of rebirth By virtue of his surplus good deeds he has been reborn as your beloved son But he simply wasted his energy studying the diction and language of worldly books How can this be the same as the Tathā gatas holy teachings which give rise to bliss and wisdom in a mysterious way In olden times there was a decayed tree by the shore of the South Sea and ve hundred bats lived in the holes of the tree Once a caravan of merchants stayed under the tree As the season was windy and chilly and the merchants were hungry and cold they piled up rewood and built a re under the tree The smoke and ames gradually began to burn ercely and set the decayed tree on re One of the merchants recited the Abhidharma piṭaka after midnight and the bats even though scorched by the heat so loved to listen to the recitation of the Dharma that they would not leave the place they disregarded the intense heat and died in the tree According to their karmic force they were reborn as human beings and renounced their homes to learn and practice  As they had heard the recitation of the Dharma they were clever and intelligent and realized sainthood thus they became elds of blessedness for the world Recently King Kaniṣka and Venerable Pārśva summoned ve hundred holy persons in Kaśmīra to compile the Vibhāṣāśāstra and these ve hundred holy persons are the ve hundred bats that lived in that decayed tree Although I am an unworthy person I was one of them From this we may see that there is such a great difference between the superior and the inferior the virtuous and the vicious as that between those that y high in the air and those that crouch down on the ground Permit your beloved son to become a monk for the merits of becoming a monk are indescribable in words After having spoken these words the arhat performed miracles and disappeared all of a sudden The brahman cherished a deep feeling of awe and faith and exclaimed sādhu for a long time He related everything to the people of the neighborhood and permitted his son to become a monk to learn and practice  He then gained faith and honored the Triple Gem and his countrymen have accepted his edication with more and more earnestness up to this day Going from Uḍakhand to the north over mountains and across rivers for more than six hundred li I reached the country of Udyāna This means park as it was a pleasure garden of a previous wheel king Formerly it was transcribed as Wuchang or Wutu both erroneously It is in the domain of North India End of Fascicle II of The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions Eight Countries from Udyāna to Rājapura The country of Udyāna is over ve thousand li in circuit with mountains and valleys connecting each other and rivers and marshes linking together Although crops are planted the yield is poor owing to the infertility of the land There are many grapevines but sugarcane is scanty The country produces gold and iron and the soil is suitable for growing saffron The woods are exuberant and owers and fruit are abundant The climate is mild with timely wind and rain The people are timid and overcautious by nature and the practice of fraudulence is the common custom They enjoy learning but do not make profound studies and they take the recitation of spells as their profession They mostly wear white cotton and have few other garments Although they speak a different dialect it is roughly the same as that spoken in India and their written language and etiquette are closely related to those of India They hold Buddhism in high esteem and reverently believe in the Mahayana teachings Along the two sides of the ubhavastu River there were formerly one thousand four hundred monasteries but most of them are now in desolation In the old days there were eighteen thousand monks but the number has gradually decreased They all study Mahayana teachings and spend their time in silent meditation They can recite their books well but they do not make researches into the deep meanings They are pure in observing the disciplinary rules and are specially adept in reciting incantations There are ve traditions of the Vinaya rules namely the Dharmaguptaka the Mahīśāsaka the Kāśyapīya the Sarvāstivāda and the Mahāsāṃghika There are more than ten deva temples with heretics living together There are four or ve fortied cities and the king mostly rules over the country from the city of Maṅgala which is sixteen or seventeen li in circuit and is well populated Four or ve li to the east of Maṅgala there is a stupa that has shown a great number of spiritual signs This was the spot where the Buddha as the ṛṣi Patience in a previous life had his limbs mutilated by King Kali  Going to the northeast for two hundred and fty or sixty li from Maṅgala I came to a great mountain and reached Apalāla Dragon Spring which is the source of the ubhavastu River and has a tributary owing to the southwest Morning and evening the white spray falls like snowakes with all the colors of the rainbow shining upon all sides At the time of Kāśyapa Buddha the dragon was born a human being named Jingqi who was an expert in the art of exorcism and had restrained a malicious dragon from causing rainstorms It was because of his help that the people of the country had surplus grain to store at home Out of gratitude for the exorcists virtuous deeds each household of the inhabitants contributed one dou of grain as a gift to him As time passed some people neglected their duty and Jingqi became angry and wished to become a malignant dragon and cause storms to spoil the seedlings of the crops After his death he was reborn a dragon at this place and caused white water to ow from the spring and it damaged the fertility of the soil When ākya Tathāgata came to guide the world with a mind of great pity he had sympathy with the people of this country who alone suffered from the disaster and he sent a deity to the place to convert the ferocious dragon The deity Vajrapāṇi struck the mountain cliffs with his vajra and the shock terried the dragon king who came out and took refuge in the Buddha After hearing the Buddha preaching the Dharma for him the dragon puried his mind and had faith in enlightenment The Tathāgata then forbade him to destroy agricultural products The dragon said Whatever food I eat is collected from the elds cultivated by people Under your holy teachings I fear that I could not sustain my life I hope that I may be allowed to collect grain for storage once every twelve years The Tathāgata accepted the dragons request with compassion Thus the country suffers this white water calamity once every twelve years More than thirty li to the southwest of Apalāla Dragon Spring on the northern bank of the river there is a huge rock with a footprint of the Tathāgata which varies in size according to the power of the merits of the measurer It was left by the Tathāgata when he was going away after having converted the dragon Afterward people built a stone chamber in the rock and worshipers came here from far and near to offer owers and incense Going downstream for more than thirty li one reaches the rock on which the Tathāgata washed his robe The lines of the robe are still clearly visible as if they were carved into the rock More than four hundred li to the south of Maṅgala one reaches Hiḍḍa Mountain where the stream in the valley ows westward As one goes up to the east against the current of the stream there are various kinds of owers and strange fruit covering the gully and climbing the steeps The peaks and cliffs are precipitous and the brooks and ravines wind and meander The sound of loud talking and the echo of music are sometimes heard Lying linked together in the valley are square rocks that resemble bedsteads made by craftsmen This was the place where once in a former life the Tathāgata forsook his life to hear half a stanza of the Dharma The word stanza was formerly transcribed as jie an abbreviation of the original Sanskrit or as jieta a mispronunciation of the Sanskrit word The correct reading should be gāthā meaning a verse consisting of thirtytwo syllables More than two hundred li to the south of Maṅgala is Mahāvana Great Forest Monastery located beside a mountain This was the place where the Tathāgata when he was practicing the way of the bodhisattva in one of his previous lives as a king named Sarvadatta  came incognito after having abandoned his kingdom to avoid an enemy He met a poor brahman coming to beg for alms Since the king had lost his kingdom he had nothing to give as alms So he asked the brahman to bind him send him to the enemy king and claim a reward so that he might give the reward as alms to the brahman Going down the mountain for thirty or forty li from the northwest of Mahāvana Monastery one reaches Mayū Monastery There is a stupa over one hundred feet high beside which is a big square rock with a footprint of the Tathāgata In one of his previous lives the Buddha stood on the rock and emitted millions of rays of light to illumine Mahāvana Monastery while he related the Jātaka stories to human and divine beings Below the base of the stupa there is a stone yellowishwhite in color and which always exudes an oily substance This was the place where the Tathāgata when practicing the way of the bodhisattva wrote down scriptures with a splinter of his bone in order to hear the right Dharma Sixty or seventy li to the west of Mayū Monastery is a stupa built by King Aśoka This was the place where in order to acquire buddhahood when he was practicing the way of the bodhisattva the Tathāgata in a former life as a king named ivaka  cut his body to ransom a dove from a hawk More than two hundred li to the northwest of the place where the dove was ransomed one enters the Sanirāja Valley and reaches Sarpauṣadhi Monastery where there is a stupa over eighty feet high This was the place where a famine and pestilence occurred when the Tathāgata was Indra in a former life Medical treatment failed to cure the people who died one after another on the road With a mind of compassion Indra wished to save them so he transformed himself into a huge python lying dead in the valley and an announcement echoed in the air Those who heard it happily rushed to the spot to cut off pieces of esh which were immediately regenerated to satisfy their hunger and cure their disease Not far away there is the great Sūma Stupa marking the place where the Tathāgata as Indra in in one of his former lives pitied the people suffering during a year of famine He changed himself into a large sūma serpent and all those who ate its esh were cured Beside the cliff at the north of the Sanirāja River there is a stupa that often cures sick people who come to pray for the recovery of their health When in a former life the Tathāgata was a peacock king he came here with his ock As it was the hot season the peacocks were thirsty but they could not nd any water to drink The peacock king then pecked the cliff to let water ow out of the rock Now a pond has been formed there and its water is effective for healing illness There are traces of the peacocks still visible on the stone More than sixty or seventy li southwest from Maṅgala there is a stupa over sixty feet high built by King Uttarasena at the east side of a great river When the Tathāgata was about to enter nirvana he told the assembly of monks After my nirvana King Uttarasena of Udyāna should be given a portion of my relic bones The various other kings wished to share the relics equally among themselves and as King Uttarasena arrived later he was despised by the other kings At that time all the people heavenly beings and monks reiterated the Tathāgatas last words Thus King took part in sharing the relics and carried his portion back to his own country where he reverently constructed a stupa On the bank beside the great river there is a huge rock in the shape of an elephant Formerly when King Uttarasena used his great white elephant to carry the relics home it suddenly fell down and died at this place it was transformed into a rock and a stupa was erected beside it More than fty li to the west of Maṅgala and across a great river one reaches Rohitaka Stupa which is over fty feet in height and was built by King Aśoka Formerly when the Tathāgata was practicing the way of the bodhisattva as a king named Maitrībala he drew blood from his body to feed ve yakṣas  More than thirty li to the northwest of Maṅgala one reaches Ad bhuta Stupa which is over forty feet in height Formerly the Tathāgata preached the Dharma to instruct human and heavenly beings at this place When the Tathāgata had left the place this stupa emerged from the ground to which the people offered incense and owers reverently without cease Crossing the great river at the west of the stone stupa and going for thirty or forty li I reached a vihāra in which is enshrined an image of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva known as Guanzizai in Chinese When it is pronounced in connected syllables it reads as the abovementioned Sanskrit form and when it is read separately it is divided into avalokita translated as guan or observe and īśvara translated as zizai or master Formerly it was translated as Guangshiyin Guanshiyin or Guanshizizai all erroneously Its protective spiritual inuence is latent but its divine manifestations are apparent Both monks and laypeople come here one after another to make offerings to it without cease Going northwest for one hundred forty or fty li from the image of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva I reached Lanpolu Mountain on top of which is a dragon lake more than thirty li in circuit a vast expanse of green water as pure as a brilliant mirror Formerly when King Virūḍhaka went to attack the ākyas four men of the ākya clan resisted the army and their relatives were exiled to different places One of the four men came out of the capital city and feeling tired during the march he stopped midway At that time a wild goose came before him and as the bird was docile and friendly the man climbed onto its back The goose ew up and alighted beside the lake The ākya man having traveled through the air and arrived in a distant and strange land lost his way and took a nap under the shade of a tree The young daughter of the dragon in the lake was enjoying the scenery at the lakeside when she suddenly saw the ākya refugee Fearing that her shape was unt  she changed herself into a human being and stroked him The ākya man startled asked her I am a poor traveler why are you so intimate with me Then he tried to be affectionate with the girl and attempted to have illicit intercourse with her The girl said If I had my parents permission I would be glad to comply with your wishes But even though you show me favor without my parents consent The ākya said In this wilderness of mountains and valleys where is your home The girl said I am the daughter of the dragon in this lake I am lucky to have this opportunity to comfort you in your fatigue while on an excursion here A human being and an animal are beings of different ways and is unthinkable The ākya man said Once I get your consent my mind will be satised The dragon girl said Then I shall accept your orders and will do whatever you wish me to do The ākya man then made an oath in his mind I shall render the whole body of this dragon girl transformed into that of a human being by the power of whatever blessedness and virtue I have accumulated So the dragon girl actually changed her form through the power of the mans blessedness Having assumed the form of a human being the girl was overjoyed and thanked the ākya saying Due to my past evil deeds I was born in the cycle of the evil ways of existence I am lucky that your power of blessedness has transformed my wicked body in which I have been reborn for many kalpas in the past into a human gure in an instant I am so grateful to you that even if I were to smashed my body into pieces it would not be sufcient to express my thanks I am willing to be intimate with you but I fear peoples criticism I wish to tell my parents to arrange the rites in the proper way The dragon girl returned to the lake and said to her parents Today when on an excursion I met a ākya man who by the power of his blessedness transformed me into a human being As we wish to get married I venture to inform you of the fact The dragon king was pleased with human beings and had respect for the holyākya clan so he consented to his daughters request and came out of the lake to express his thanks to the man saying You condescend to marry my daughter despite her station as a nonhuman being Please come to my home and let her serve you At the dragon kings invitation the ākya man came in and stayed in his abode He lived in the dragon palace together after performing due ceremonies and the two of them shared a happy conjugal life with great pleasure But the ākya man always feared and loathed the sight of dragons so he wished to beg leave to depart The dragon king stopped him saying Please do not go far away but stay near us as neighbors I shall cause you to possess territory and have the grand title of king you will have ministers and subjects under your control and rule over the country for a long time The ākya declined saying What you have said is not my wish The dragon king then put a sword into a small chest and covered it with a piece of the best white cotton He said to the ākya man Take this white cotton and present it to the king He will certainly accept the gift with his own hands from a man coming from afar At that moment you can kill the king and wouldnt it be good to seize the kingdom in such a way Thus at the instigation of the dragon the ākya went to offer the gift When the king of Udyāna personally took up the white cotton the ākya got hold of his sleeve and stabbed him The ākya wielding the sword said to them This sword in my hand was given to me by a divine dragon to kill those who surrender after the others or who refuse to serve me Fearing his divine martial power they all supported him in his ascent to the throne Then he rectied the abuses of the government and implemented new policies eulogizing the sages and sympathizing with those who were in trouble He mobilized his retinue and rode in a carriage to return to the dragon palace to report on his mission as well as to welcome the dragon girl to the capital As the inuence of the dragon girls evil deeds done in the past was not yet completely wiped out she often assumed her dragon form with nine heads when in her private chamber The ākya man feared and abhorred the sight and did not know what to do about it He waited until the girl was asleep and approached to cut off her heads with a sharp knife The dragon girl startled from sleep said This will not be advantageous to our offspring Not only would I be slightly injured but your descendants will suffer from headache Thus the clanspeople of this country often suffer from this ailment Although it is not continuously painful it recurs from time to time After the death of the ākya man his son succeeded to the throne as King Uttarasena  After King Uttarasena had ascended the throne his mother lost her sight When the Tathāgata had subdued the Apalāla dragon and was on his return journey he descended from the air and alighted at the palace at a time when King Uttarasena was out hunting Having met the Holy One and heard the Dharma she regained her sight The Tathāgata asked her Your son is a clansman of mine Where is he now The kings mother said He went out in the morning on a hunting excursion He will return soon When the Tathāgata and his retinue of monks were about to resume their journey the kings mother said I am fortunate to have given birth to a son of the holy clan and you have had pity on us such that you condescended to visit us in person My son will return soonplease stay and wait for a moment The Worldhonored One said As this person is a clansman of mine he may become enlightened on hearing of my teachings so it is not necessary for him to receive my personal instruction for the development of his mind I am going now You may tell him when he returns that the Tathāgata has gone to Kuśinagara to enter nirvana between the śāla trees While King Uttarasena was hunting he saw from afar that his palace was shining brightly and he suspected that a re might have occurred He stopped hunting and returned to nd that his mother had regained her sight He asked delightedly What auspicious event happened during my brief absence that my kind mothers eyesight has been restored His mother said When you were out the Tathāgata came here After hearing the Buddhas Dharma I regained my sight The Tathāgata has gone from here to Kuśinagara to enter nirvana between the śāla trees He suggested that you go promptly to obtain a portion of his relic bones Upon hearing these words the king wailed piteously and fainted and recovered only after a long time He got into his carriage and hurried to the śāla trees but the Buddha had already entered nirvana The other kings despised him as a king from a vulgar borderland they valued the relic bones they did not wish to share them with him At that time the assembly of gods and people repeated the Buddhas last words Only when the other kings heard the Buddhas words did they share with him an equal portion of the relics Climbing over mountains and crossing valleys to the northwest from Maṅgala and going upstream along the Indus River the road is perilous and goes through gloomy gullies which are linked either by thick ropes or by iron chains with viaducts and bridges constructed at the precipices and wooden pegs installed on the rocks as steps for climbers to set foot on After a journey of over one thousand li I reached the plain of Darada the old capital of Udyāna where gold and saffron are produced in abundance Beside the great monastery at Darada there is a wooden statue of Maitreya Bodhisattva more than a hundred feet tall of golden hue and latent spiritual power It was made by the arhat Madhyāntika formerly transcribed and abridged incorrectly as Motiendi Through his supernatural powers the arhat brought a craftsman up to Tuṣita Heaven three times to observe the ne features of the bodhisattva and then completed the task The Dharma has been transmitted to the East since the time when this statue was made From here going to the east across mountains and valleys upstream of the Indus River over ying bridges and viaducts through perilous regions for more than ve hundred li I reached the country of Balūra in the domain of North India The country of Balūra is more than four thousand li in circuit Situated among the Great Snow Mountains it is long from east to west and narrow from south to north It yields much wheat and pulse and produces gold and silver Having the advantage of gold resources the country has ample means for state expenditures The climate is bitterly cold and the people are rude by nature lacking in kindness and righteousness and knowing nothing of politeness Their features are ugly and they wear coarse woolen garments Their writing is roughly the same as that of India but their spoken language diverges from those of other countries There are several hundred monasteries with several thousand monks who do not study the theories of any one specic school and they are mostly defective in observing the Vinaya rules From here I went back to Uḍakhand and crossed the Indus River to the south Flowing southwest the river is three or four li wide with pure and limpid rapidly moving water Poisonous dragons and evil animals make their dens in the river and often overturn the boats of those who are transporting precious objects seeds of rare owers and fruit or the Buddhas relic bones across the river The country of Takṣaśilā is more than two thousand li in circuit and its capital city is over ten li in circuit As the royal family is extinct the regional chieftains have competed with each other for sovereignty Formerly it belonged to the country of Kāpiśī but recently it became a dependency of the country of Kaśmīra The soil is fertile and the crops are rich with many springs and luxuriant vegetation The climate is mild and the people are reckless and brave by custom and they venerate the Triple Gem There are many monasteries but most of them are in desolation There are a few monks all of whom study Mahayana teachings More than seventy li to the northwest of the capital city is the pond of the dragon king Elāpattra which is about one hundred paces in circuit The water is lucid and has lotus owers of different colors growing in it This dragon was a monk who injured an elāpattra tree in the time of Kāśyapa Buddha Therefore when the people of this land approached the dragon to pray for rain or ne weather they had to invite a monk to go with them to the pond Going southeast for more than thirty li I entered a spot between two mountains where there is a stupa more than a hundred feet high built by King Aśoka This was the place where ākya Tathāgata predicted that when Maitreya appears in the world as a buddha four great treasures would naturally come into existence This auspicious spot is one of the four places I heard the local people say that during an earthquake all the mountains would shake but for about a hundred paces around this treasure place the earth does not quiver even a little Some foolish people once vainly attempted to dig up the treasure but the earth quaked and all the people toppled over onto the ground Beside this spot is a monastery in a very deserted condition having had no monks living in it for quite a long time Twelve or thirteen li to the north of the city is a stupa built by King Aśoka On fast days it sometimes emits a light amid divine owers and heavenly music I heard the local people say that recently a woman suffering from malignant leprosy secretly came to this stupa to make selfreproach and repent  When she saw that the compound was in a lthy condition she removed the dirt swept the place clean smeared incense paste and scattered owers on the ground and she plucked some blue lotus owers to scatter on the road By doing so she was cured of her malignant disease and became beautiful in appearance and a sweet smell as fragrant as blue lotus issued from her body This was also the place where the Tathāgata while practicing the Dharma in a former life as a great king named Candraprabha  cut off his head for almsgiving in the course of acquiring enlightenment He performed such almsgiving a thousand times in past lives Beside this stupa where the head was forsaken there is a desolate monastery with a few monks Formerly Kumāralāta known as Tongshou in Chinese a śāstra master of the Sautrāntika school wrote treatises at this monastery Outside the city to the southeast on the northern side of South Hill is a stupa over a hundred feet high built by King Aśoka at the place where his son Prince Kuṇāla had his eyes torn out due to the calumny of his stepmother Blind people prayed at this place and most of them recovered their eyesight Prince Kuṇāla who had been borne by the chief queen was a handsome man who was well known for his kindness After the death of the chief queen his stepmother a lascivious immoral woman tried to force the prince to have illicit relations with her The prince wept and blamed himself for his refusal and withdrew with an apology Having been rejected by the prince the stepmother was ashamed and became angry and having waited for the chance to speak to the king she said coolly Takṣaśilā is in a strategic position and who else but a royal descendant can be depended on for its protection Prince Kuṇāla is well known for his kindness and lial piety Because you do not employ sagacious persons the people are critical of you Deluded by these words the king was pleased with the intrigue and ordered the prince saying I succeeded to the throne handed down by our ancestors to rule over the country and I fear losing itour forerunners would be disappointed As Takṣaśilā is a strategic place I now appoint you to garrison that country State affairs are important and human relationships are treacherous You must not move about at will so as to jeopardize the foundation of the state Whenever there is a summons from me you should verify it by my teeth marks It was then dispatched to the prince to reprimand him When his assistants knelt down to read the order they looked at each other not knowing what to do The prince asked them What is it that makes you look so miserable They said The great king has issued an order to reprimand Your Highness stating that your eyes should be torn out and that you should be exiled to the valleys among mountains and left there to live or die with your wife However the order may be fraudulent and it would be better for you to go see the king face to face and hear his personal verdict The prince said How can I disobey my fathers order even if he asked me to die There is no mistake since the order is sealed with his teeth marks The prince then asked a caṇḍāla to tear out his eyes and having lost his eyesight he lived thereafter as a beggar wandering from place to place until he came to the capital city where the king lived His wife told him This is the royal city and we are now suffering from hunger and cold Formerly you were a prince but now you are a beggar I wish to report the matter to the king and ask him to reconsider the reprimand Then through some subterfuge they slipped into the royal stable where they wept in the cool breeze late into the night and sang piteously to the accompaniment of a konghou  On a lofty pavilion the king heard the melodious singing of melancholy and sorrowful words and feeling it strange he asked The voice of the singing accompanied by a konghou sounds like that of my son Why has he come here He inquired of the stableman as to who was singing in the stable So the man brought the blind singer into the kings presence Upon seeing the prince the king felt sorrowful and asked him Who disgured you into such a disastrous condition If I did not even know that my beloved son had lost his eyesight how can I see into the affairs of my people Oh good heavens How is it that my virtue has been corrupted to such an extent The prince wept piteously and apologetically said in reply It is because of my unliality that I incurred the blame of Heaven On suchandsuch day I suddenly received your compassionate edict I had no way to speak to you nor did I dare evade my responsibility to implement your edict Finding out that it had all been done illegally by his second wife the king inicted capital punishment upon her without further investigation At that time there was at the monastery near the bodhi tree a great arhat named Ghoṣa  who possessed the four kinds of unhindered eloquence and was complete with the three insights The king told him what his blind son had said and wished him to be so kind as to restore his sons eyesight At the kings request the arhat then made an announcement on that day to the people of the country saying On the day after tomorrow I shall speak on the sublime doctrine You may come listen to the Dharma and each of you should bring a vessel with you to hold your tears Thus men and women coming from far and near ocked to the place At that time the arhat spoke on the twelvefold causation None of those who heard the Dharma did not shed tears and they collected the tears in the vessels When the preaching was over the tears of everyone in the entire assembly were collected in a golden basin The arhat then made a pledge saying All that I have said is the Buddhas ultimate truth If it is untrue and if I have spoken wrongly I shall have nothing more to say Otherwise I wish to wash the blind mans eyes to restore his eyesight to what it was before Having said this he used the tears to wash the eyes of the prince whose eyesight was thus restored The king then reproached his ministers and denounced his assistants at court who were all dismissed banished relegated or executed and many powerful and wealthy families were deported to the desert to the northeast of the Snow Mountains From here going to the southeast across mountains and valleys for over seven hundred li I reached the country of Siṃhapura  The country of Siṃhapura is over three thousand ve hundred or six hundred li in circuit bordering on the Indus River on the west The capital city of the country is fourteen or fteen li in circuit and as it was built with a range of hills at the back it is an impregnable stronghold The farmers exert little effort but gain much prot from the land The climate is cold and the people are rude by nature They are valiant but deceitful by custom There is no king ruling over the country it is a dependency of the country of Kaśmīra Not far to the south of the city is a stupa built by King Aśoka Although some of its decorations are missing it continues to be effective in showing spiritual manifestations Beside it there is a monastery devoid of monks Forty or fty li to the southeast of the city there is a stone stupa more than two hundred feet high built by King Aśoka There are about ten ponds around the stupa The banks of the ponds are built with rocks carved in various strange shapes and clear water rushes into the ponds giving off spray Dragons sh and other aquatic creatures move about in the grottoes under the water Lotus owers of the four colors cover the surfaces of the clear ponds and all kinds of fruit trees blossom luxuriantly in different hues There is a monastery nearby but it has been deserted for a long time Not far from the stupa is where the founder of the whiteclothed realized the principles he was seeking and rst preached his doctrine Now there is a memorial of the event and beside it is a deva temple His disciples practice austerities persevering day and night without leisure to take rest The doctrine preached by the founder was mostly taken from the tenets of the Buddhist scriptures and he taught them according to the different inclinations of people and laid down disciplinary rules The senior disciples are called bhikṣus and the junior ones śrāmaṇeras Their manner of living and code of deportment are quite similar to those of the Buddhist monks except that they keep a tuft of hair on the head and go naked If they put on any clothing the special color is white which differentiates them from other sects The only difference is the costume the good features are exactly the same From here I returned to the northern part of the country of Takṣaśilā where I crossed the Indus River and after going southeast for more than two hundred li I came across a great rocky pass Formerly Prince Mahāsattva sacriced his body at this place to feed a starving tigress About one hundred and forty or fty paces to the south is a stone stupa built at the spot where the Mahāsattva had pity on the tigress When he came here he pricked himself with a dry bamboo splinter so as to give the tigress his blood The animal devoured him The soil and plants of this place are dark reddish in color as if stained by blood When people come to this spot they feel nervous and uneasy as if they had prickles hurting their backs and whether or not they believe the story of the hungry tigress they are moved to pity To the north of this stupa of the sacrice of the body there is a stone stupa more than two hundred feet high built by King Aśoka It is decorated with marvelous engravings and sometimes emits a divine light Smaller stupas and stone niches counted by the hundreds surround the sepulchral ground Those who are suffering from illness circumambulate this place and most of them are cured To the east of the stone stupa there is a monastery with more than a hundred monks all of whom study Mahayana teachings From here going east for more than fty li I reached an isolated hill where there is a monastery with over two hundred monks all of whom study Mahayana teachings There are luxuriant owers and fruit trees with ponds of spring water as lucid as a mirror Beside it is a stupa over two hundred feet high built at the spot where the Tathāgata in a former life converted an evil yakṣa and taught him not to eat meat From here going southeast for more than ve hundred li I reached the country of Uraśā  The country of Uraśā is more than two thousand li in circuit with mountains and hills connected together rendering the cultivated elds narrow and small The capital city of the country is seven or eight li in circuit it is without a sovereign king and the country is a dependency of the country of Kaśmīra The soil is suitable for growing cereals but the country has few owers and little fruit The climate is mild and there is not much frost or snow The people are rough and deceitful and lack the custom of observing the proprieties and they do not believe in Buddhism About four or ve li to the southwest of the capital city there is a stupa more than two hundred feet high built by King Aśoka Beside it is a monastery with few monks all of whom study Mahayana teachings From here going southeast for more than one thousand li over mountains along dangerous paths and across iron bridges I reached the country of Kaśmīra formerly transcribed erroneously as Jibin in the domain of North India The country of Kaśmīra is more than seven thousand li in circuit with precipitous mountains surrounding it on all sides The capital city with a great river on its west is twelve or thirteen li from south to north and four or ve li from east to west The soil is suitable for growing cereals and there are plenty of owers and fruit It produces horses of the dragon breed and also yields saffron repearls and medicinal herbs The climate is bitterly cold and there is much snow but little wind The people wear woolen or cotton clothes They are frivolous by custom and mostly timid As the country is protected by a dragon the people hold sway over the neighboring regions Their features are handsome but they are of deceitful dispositions They are fond of learning and have a wide scope of knowledge believing in both heretical teachings and the right teachings There are over one hundred monasteries with more than ve thousand monks There are four stupas all built by King Aśoka each containing about one sheng of the Tathāgatas relic bones In the National Record it is said that this country was originally a dragon lake Formerly when the Buddha the Worldhonored One had subdued an evil god in the country of Udyāna and was ying over this country on his way back to Central India he said to nanda After my nirvana the arhat Madhyāntika will establish a country at this place settle people and propagate the buddhadharma In the ftieth year after the Tathāgatas nirvana nandas disciple the arhat Madhyāntika who possessed the six supernatural powers and had attained the eight emancipations heard about the Buddhas prediction with a feeling of joy Upon seeing him the dragon had deep faith in him and asked him what he wanted The arhat said I want you to give me enough space to keep my knees in the lake Thereupon the dragon king withdrew some water from the lake to offer a bit of dry land to the monk Through his miraculous powers the arhat enlarged his body as the dragon did his utmost to draw away the water from the lake until it was completely exhausted so that the dragon had to ask for some place for himself The arhat reserved a lake more than a hundred li in circuit in the northwest for the dragon while the dragons relatives dwelled separately in a small lake The dragon king said Now that I have presented all the land of the lake to you please always accept my offerings Madhyāntika said As I shall enter parinirvāṇa very soon how will I be able to always accept your offerings though I would like to The dragon then requested that ve hundred arhats should always accept his offerings until the extinction of the Dharma and that after the extinction of the Dharma he should then retake this country as his dwelling lake After having obtained the land the arhat established ve hundred monasteries with his great supernatural powers and bought slaves from different countries to serve the monks After Madhyāntika entered extinction the slaves made themselves rulers The neighboring countries despise them as lowborn people and do not interact with them calling them the Krīta The Bought Now spring water is overowing at many places King Aśoka of Magadha ascended the throne in the hundredth year after the Tathāgatas nirvana and exerted his inuence in distant lands He deeply believed in the Triple Gem and fostered all creatures of the four forms of birth There were then ve hundred arhat monks and ve hundred ordinary monks whom the king respected and treated with equal hospitality There was a monk named Mahādeva  a person of extensive learning and great wisdom who had made profound studies of the categories of name and reality He wrote an elaborate treatise in exposition of theories contrary to the holy teachings  and all his friends and acquaintances followed his heterodox views Being unable to discern the arhats from the ordinary monks King Aśoka had sympathy with those whom he liked and supported those who were on intimate terms with him He summoned the monks to the Ganges River intending to drown them in the deep water and kill them all The arhats realizing that their lives were at stake employed their supernatural powers and ew through the air to this country  where they lived in the mountains and valleys Upon hearing this King Aśoka was afraid and repented he came in person to apologize and invited the arhats to return to his country but the arhats atly refused the invitation Thus King Aśoka built ve hundred monasteries for the arhats and offered the whole country as alms to the community of monks King Kaniṣka of the country of Gandhāra ascended the throne in the fourhundredth year after the Tathāgatas nirvana his inuence reached far and distant lands which then became afliated with him In his leisure hours he always studied Buddhist scriptures and each day he invited a monk to preach the Dharma in his palace As the monks belonged to different schools their views were at variance with each other and the king was greatly puzzled and could not get rid of his delusions At that time Venerable Pārśva explained In the long period of time since the Tathāgata passed away his disciples have adhered to different schools and the masters have held various views each grasping his own opinions and giving rise to contradictions The king was quite moved to hear this and after brooding in a sorrowful mood for a long time he said to the venerable monk By the remnant blessedness of my ancestors I am lucky enough to have succeeded to the exploits of my predecessors I venture to forget my vulgarity and incompetence and wish to propagate the Dharma by expounding the whole Tripiṭaka according to the tenets of different schools Venerable Pārśva said Your Majesty has planted the root of good deeds in the past and has accumulated much blessing It is my wish that Your Majesty should pay attention to the buddhadharma Then the king issued an order to summon holy and learned monks throughout the country from far and near Thus brilliant scholars and wise monks ocked to the assembly from great distances in the four quarters to be entertained with the four monastic requisites for seven days Since was for the discussion of the great Dharma havibg too many participants would be too chaotic Thus the king respectfully said to the monks Those who have attained sainthood may stay while those who are still under the bondage of rebirth may  The remaining number was still too many so the king declared again Those who have completed their learning may stay while those who are still in the course of learning may go back The remaining number was still too many and so he ordered again Those who possess the three insights and have the six supernatural powers may stay while the rest may go back But as the remaining number was still too many he again issued an order saying Only those who are well versed in the Tripiṭaka with its supramundane theories and who thoroughly understand the ve mundane branches of knowledge may remain while the others may go back Thereupon four hundred ninetynine persons were selected The king wished in his own country but the climate was too hot and humid for the purpose He also wished to go to the cave at Rājagṛha where Mahākāśyapa had convened his assembly Venerable Pārśva and others discussed the matter and said No there are many heretics who engage in debate holding divergent heterodox views We would get involved with them in disputations and then how could we have the time to write our treatises Thus the monks in the meeting all favored the country  Because the country was surrounded by mountains on the four sides and was strongly guarded by yakṣas and had fertile soil and rich products it was a place where sages and saints met and took up their lodgings and was frequented by spirits and genies The king and the arhats then came from their country to the country of Kaśmīra and constructed a monastery to collect and compile the Tripiṭaka with the intention of composing a Vibhāṣāśāstra At that time Venerable Vasumitra dressed in a monks patched robe was outside the door when the arhats said to him You have not gotten rid of the bondage of the passions and your arguments are absurd and erroneous You should go far away and not stay here Vasumitra said You sagacious monks have no doubts about the Dharma and you are spreading the Buddhas teachings in his place You are collecting the great doctrines with the intention of writing a standard treatise Although I am unintelligent I do know something of the subtle teachings I have made profound studies of the abstruse texts of the Tripiṭaka and the sublime principles of the ve branches of knowledge and I have mastered their essences The arhats said You must not speak in this manner Then it will not be too late for you to come and join us at the meeting Vasumitra said I deem the attainment of arhatship to be as insignicant as spittle But I can still attain the holy fruit of arhatship before a ball of thread falls down to the ground after I have thrown it up into the air The arhats again reproached him saying You are truly an arrogant man Arhatship is what all the buddhas have praised and you should quickly realize it so as to remove the monks doubts Vasumitra then tossed a ball of thread up into the air but the devas took hold of it and made an appeal to him saying You should now attain buddhahood and become the successor to Maitreya in the future to be specially honored by all the three realms and be someone on which all beings of the four forms of birth can depend Why should you wish to realize the small fruit here and now Upon witnessing this event the arhats apologized and elected him to be the elder of the meeting and all dubious points were settled by him First the ve hundred saintly and holy monks composed the Upadeśaśāstra in a hundred thousand stanzas for the exposition of the Sutra piṭaka formerly transcribed wrongly as Xiuduoluozang Then they wrote the Vinayavibhāṣāśāstra in one hundred thousand stanzas for the exposition of the Vinaya piṭaka formerly transcribed wrongly as Pinayezang Last they compiled the Abhidharmavibhāṣāśāstra in one hundred thousand stanzas for the exposition of the Abhidharma piṭaka  There are altogether three hundred thousand stanzas with nine million six hundred thousand words for the full explanation of the Tripiṭaka to be studied for all ages to come They probe into all branches and ramications whether shallow or deep The general meanings are repeatedly claried and the subtle sayings made apparent They are widely circulated for the guidance of posterity King Kaniṣka had these treatises incised on red copper plates and kept them in stone cases and a stupa was constructed for their preservation He ordered the yakṣa deities to be on guard all around the country to prevent heretics from taking the treatises out of the country Those who wished to study them might do so inside the country After having completed the task the king returned to his own capital with his army When he came out of the western gate of the capital city of the country  he knelt down facing the east to offer the whole country as alms to the monks But after the Kaniṣkas death the Krīta tribe resumed kingship expelled the monks and demolished the buddhadharma The king of Himatala in the country of Tukhāra a descendant of the ākya clan fully occupied his territory and ascended the throne in the sixhundredth year after the Tathāgatas nirvana He planted his mind in the earth of the Buddha and poured his sentiments into the sea of the Dharma When he heard that the Krīta tribesmen were destroying the buddhadharma he mustered three thousand brave warriors of his country and outtted them in the guise of merchants Carrying with them a large quantity of valuable goods they hid weapons secretly among the merchandise and came to this country From among the merchants ve hundred brave men who possessed tactical skill were selected Each was equipped with a sharp dagger hidden in his sleeves and they carried rare valuables to present to the lord in person At that moment the king of Himatala took off the hat of the lord and occupied his throne The king of the Krīta tribe was taken aback by the surprise attack and was beheaded right away The king of Himatala declared to the people I am the king of Himatala in the country of Tukhāra I was enraged by this lowborn tribesman who openly carried out cruel policies I have put him to death because he was guilty You innocent people are guiltless The chief ministers of the court were banished to a foreign land Once order was restored in the country the monks were invited back and monasteries were built as peacefully as before The king knelt down outside the western gate of the capital city with his face turned to the east to again offer the country as alms to the monks Because the Krīta tribesmen had lost power on account of Buddhist monks on several occasions they bore them a grudge for generations and hated the buddhadharma After a long period of time they resumed the kingship once again Therefore Buddhism is not much believed in by the people of the country while deva temples enjoy much attention More than ten li to the southeast of the new city at the south side of a great mountain to the north of the old city is a monastery with over three hundred monks In the stupa of the monastery there is a Buddhas tooth relic about one and a half inches long yellowishwhite in color On fast days it sometimes emits a light Formerly when the Krīta tribespeople persecuted the buddhadharma the monks scattered to various places and lived separately One of the śramaṇas went to India to visit and worship the sacred sites with utmost sincerity Later when he heard that order had been restored in his country he started on his return journey and on the way he met a herd of elephants running amok in the marsh trumpeting and rampaging wildly At the sight of the elephants the śramaṇa climbed up into a tree to avoid them At that moment the elephants rushed to a pond to get water to soak the roots of the tree then they pushed the tree until it fell down Having got hold of the śramaṇa the elephants carried him into a big forest where a sick elephant was lying on the ground with a painful sore They put the monks hand on the painful spot and he found that the wound had been made by a bamboo prickle After plucking out the bamboo prickle and applying medicine to the wound the śramaṇa tore off a piece of his robe to dress the sick elephants wounded foot One of the elephants took a golden casket to the sick elephant and the sick elephant handed it over to the śramaṇa Upon opening the casket the śramaṇa saw a Buddhas tooth relic in it The monk was surrounded by the elephants and could not get away from them At mealtime on the following day they brought him strange fruit for his midday meal After the meal was over they carried the monk out of the forest and having carried him for several hundred li they let him get down and knelt on the ground to worship him before they dispersed When the śramaṇa reached the western boundary of the country he boarded a ferryboat to cross a rapid river but in midstream the boat was almost overturned The other passengers in the boat said among themselves This śramaṇa must be the cause of our troublealmost getting drowned in the river He must have carried with him some relic bones of the Tathāgata which are greatly valued by dragons The boatman searched the passengers and in fact discovered the Buddhas tooth relic The śramaṇa then held the tooth relic high and lowered his head to say to the dragon  I now hand this over to you for safekeeping but I shall come soon to take it back He did not cross the river but disembarked and gazing at the river he said regretfully As I did not learn the craft of subduing dragons I am now bullied by this beast of a dragon So he went back to India to learn the magical craft of suppressing dragons After three years he started again on his return journey and when he reached the bank of the river and was preparing an altar for performing the rites the dragon handed over the casket containing the Buddhas tooth relic to the śramaṇa who took it back and enshrined it at this monastery Fourteen or fteen li to the south of the monastery there is a small monastery in which is enshrined a standing statue of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva If a worshiper decides to starve himself to death in case he cannot fulll his wish to see the bodhisattva in person the bodhisattva appears in his marvelous corporeal body out of the statue Over thirty li to the southeast of the small monastery I arrived at a great mountain on which there was an old monastery built on a magnicent scale but it is now mostly in ruins There is only one small storied pavilion at a corner of the monastery with more than thirty monks who study Mahayana teachings Formerly the śāstra master Saṃghabhadra known as Zhongxian in Chinese composed the Abhidharmanyāyānusāraśāstra here On the left and right sides of the monastery there are stupas containing relic bones of great arhats Monkeys and other wild animals pluck owers as offerings at all times of the year without interruption as if they were performing a duty under instruction There are many strange traces on this mountain such as rocky walls that are split crosswise or the hoofprints of horses left on the tops of the peaks All these traces have strange shapes They were drawn by arhats who were śrāmaṇeras with their ngers while they were riding to and fro on pleasure trips Such traces are so numerous that it is difcult to give a full account of them Over ten li to the east of the Buddha tooth monastery on the steep side of a northern mountain there is a small monastery where the great śāstra master Skandhila composed the Abhidharmaprakaraṇapādaśāstra in former times In the small monastery there is a stone stupa more than fty feet high containing the relic bones of an arhat Formerly there was an arhat a big and tall man who had the appetite of an elephant The people of the time sneered at him saying You know only how to satisfy yourself and have no sense of right and wrong When the arhat was about to enter nirvana he told the people I shall soon take up complete extinction I wish to tell you the wonderful Dharma I have personally realized On hearing this the people all jeered at him even more and they all gathered to see what would happen The arhat then said to them Now I shall tell you my personal karmic conditions Before my present existence I was born an elephant and I lived in the royal stable of a king of East India There was then in the country a śramaṇa who was making a long journey in India in search of sacred scriptures and commentaries The king presented me as a gift to the śramaṇa to carry the Buddhist scriptures for him to this country Soon afterward I died and by the merit of having carried scriptures I was reborn a human being With the surplus blessedness I was able to become a monk at an early age I worked hard to nd liberation from the cycle of rebirth without spending a single moment in idleness until I attained the six supernatural powers and cut off the passions of the three realms But my old habit of eating was still as before though I restricted myself to eating only onethird of my regular amount of food When he said this the people did not believe him so he rose into the air and entered the samādhi of relight Flames and smoke came from his body and he entered extinction while his remains dropped down over which a stupa was built Going northwest from the royal city for over two hundred li I reached Vikrītavana Monastery where the śāstra master Pūrṇa known as Yuanman in Chinese composed the Exposition of the Abhidharmaśāstra Going west from the city for one hundred forty or fty li I reached the north of a great river at the south side of a mountain and came to a monastery of the Mahāsāṃghika school with more than a hundred monks This was the place where the śāstra master Bodhila composed the Tattvasaṃcayaśāstra of the Mahāsāṃghika school Going southwest from here for more than seven hundred li over mountains and across dangerous rivers I reached the country of Parṇotsa in the domain of North India The country of Parṇotsa is more than two thousand li in circuit and has many mountains and rivers it has narrow strips of cultivated land The crops are sown in season and owers and fruit are luxuriant There is plenty of sugarcane but no grapes Trees bearing such fruit as āmra  uḍumbara  moca  and so on have been planted by householders in the woods near their dwelling places because the people enjoy the taste of these fruit The climate is humid and hot and the people are bold and ery by custom Their garments are mostly made of cotton cloth They

The country of Rājapura is over four thousand li in circuit the capital city which is more than ten li in circuit and has many hills and mounds around it is a strong fortress The valleys and plains are narrow and the soil is not productive The native products and climate are the same as those of Parṇotsa The people are bold and ery by custom and are brave and valiant by nature The country has no ruler and is a dependency of Kaśmīra There are ten monasteries with few monks There is one deva temple with many heretics From the country of Lampā up to this land all the inhabitants are coarse and vulgar in appearance and rustic and violent by nature They speak unrened dialects have little courtesy and lack the sense of righteousness Their lands do not belong to India proper but are uncivilized frontier regions From here proceeding southeast descending from a mountain crossing a river and going for more than seven hundred li I reached the country of akka  End of Fascicle III of The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions Fifteen Countries from akka to Kapitha The country of akka is more than ten thousand li in circuit with the Vipāśā River at its east and the Indus River at its west the capital city is over twenty li in circuit The soil is good for growing nonglutinous rice and there is plenty of winter wheat The country produces gold silver brass copper and iron The climate is hot and there is much violent wind The people are rude and illtempered and their language is base and vulgar They dress in white garments known as kauśeya clothes and morning glow costume Few of them believe in the buddhadharma and most of them serve the deities There are ten monasteries and several hundred deva temples In this country there were formerly many almshouses to render help to the poor and needy or give them free food and medicine and to provide travelers with meals so that they might dispel their fatigue Going fourteen or fteen li to the southwest from the capital city I reached the old city of ākala The city wall is dilapidated but the foundations are still tough and strong It is over twenty li in circuit inside which there is a smaller city six or seven li in circuit with rich and prosperous inhabitants This was the original capital city of the country Several hundred years ago there was a king named Mahirakula known as Dazu Great Clan in Chinese who reigned in this city over all parts of India He was a man of talent and intelligence with a bold and furious nature All the neighboring countries were his vassal states Wishing to learn about the buddhadharma in his leisure time he ordered the monks to recommend a learned monk of virtue  But none of the monks dared accept the offer as they had few desires in their quiet lives and did not seek fame or eminence while those who were erudite and prominent feared his majesty At that time there was a man who had been a servant of the royal household but he had also been a monk for a long time A man of rened speech and skillful in discussion he was chosen by the monks to accept the kings appointment King Mahirakula said Out of respect for the buddhadharma I tried to seek a monk of renown and you now recommend a slave to hold discussions with me I thought that there were many brilliant scholars in the community of monks but now I have come to know the actual condition What is there for me to respect Then he issued an order to all the ve parts of India to destroy whatever was connected with Buddhism and to expel all monks and not allow a single one to remain behind Now in the country of Magadha King Bālāditya respected the buddhadharma and loved his subjects Because King Mahirakula employed cruel punishment and practiced tyranny King Bālāditya defended his territory and refused to pay tribute to Mahirakula as his subordinate King Mahirakula mobilized his troops to punish Bālāditya but Bālāditya got news of the invasion and said to his ministers I have heard that the invaders are coming but I do not have the heart to injure the soldiers May you ofcials and commoners spare me of guilt and allow my humble self to hide in the grassy marshland Having said so he left the palace and went to the mountainous wilderness and several myriads of his admirers and followers accompanied him to take refuge on an island King Mahirakula then handed over his troops to his younger brother and sailed across the sea to attack the island King Bālāditya guarded the strategic points and sent his light cavalrymen to lure the enemy to war Amid the clamor of gongs and drums Bālādityas soldiers lying in ambush suddenly appeared in all quarters and captured Mahirakula alive who was then granted the favor of an audience Ashamed of his misbehavior King Mahirakula covered his face with his robes King Bālāditya seated on his lion seat and surrounded by his ofcials ordered his attendants to tell Mahirakula Uncover your face I wish to speak to you Mahirakula said in reply The vassal and the lord have changed positions We now face each other in grudges and enmity and since we are not on friendly terms what is the use of having a facetoface talk Despite repeated exhortation to he would not do so Then it was ordered to enumerate Mahirakulas faults The Triple Gem is the eld of blessedness it is that on which all creatures of the four forms of birth can depend If I had allowed you to act like a jackal or wolf you would have completely destroyed the causes of superior deeds Good luck is not on your side and so you have been captured by me Your crimes are unpardonable and you must be sentenced to death When the mother of King Bālāditya who was a woman of erudition and good memory and an expert physiognomist heard that Mahirakula was to be executed she promptly told King Bālāditya I have heard that Mahirakula is a person with marvelous features and great wisdom I wish to have a look at him King Bālāditya then had Mahirakula led to his mothers palace The queen mother said Alas Mahirakula You need not feel ashamed The world is impermanent and honor and disgrace replace each other alternately I am just as your mother and you my son You should remove the covering on your face so that we may talk face to face Mahirakula said I was the lord of a country hostile to you but I am now a captive at your court I have demolished the achievements of my forerunners and brought my ancestral line to an end Not only I am ashamed to face my forefathers but also I feel remorseful to my subjects I am ashamed to see heaven and earth so I regretfully cover my face with my clothes The kings mother said The rise and fall of a nation depends on circumstances and existence or extinction is predestined by fate If your mind looks at things with a view of equality then both gain and loss are forgotten If your mind is controlled by things there will then arise feelings of calumny and commendation You should believe in karmic retribution and change with the change of time If you remove your covering and speak to me face to face you may perhaps be able to keep your life Mahirakula said gratefully I am a man of no talent and attained the throne by mere chance For your great courtesy I thank you face to face with profuse gratitude Then he removed his robes from his face The kings mother said to him Take good care of yourself and you will live to the natural end of your life Then she told King Bālāditya It is laid down in the code of our ancestors that we should forgive other peoples faults and be kind to living beings Although King Mahirakula has done evil for a long time his personal blessedness has not yet been exhausted If you kill this man we will suffer famine for twelve years He has prognostic signs of reinstatement but he will not be the king of a great country he will occupy and possess a small country in the north Under the admonition of his compassionate mother King Bālāditya took pity on the lord who had lost his kingdom he married his young daughter to him and treated him with special hospitality Mahirakulas defeated soldiers were enrolled to reinforce his guards before was sent out of the island In the meantime King Mahirakulas younger brother had returned to his own country and established himself as king so Mahirakula had lost the throne and had to ee and hide himself in the mountainous wilderness He then went north to seek refuge in the country of Kaśmīra and the king of Kaśmīra accorded him deep courtesy and conferred feudal estates upon him After some years had passed  commanding the people of his efdom killed the king of Kaśmīra on some pretext and proclaimed himself king With the prestige of his success in the war he then attacked the country of Gandhāra in the west and he had his troops lie in ambush and killed the king The members of the royal clan and all the ministers were slaughtered and one thousand six hundred stupas and monasteries were demolished Apart from those killed in the war there were nine koṭis of people who remained alive and he intended to kill them all and not allow a single one to survive At that time his assistants at court admonished him saying Your Majestys prestige awed the strong enemies so much that their chiefs were executed even before the soldiers exchanged blows What guilt have the common people committed We wish to substitute our humble lives for their deaths The king said You believe in the buddhadharma and think highly of future blessedness Because you desire to achieve buddhahood you widely propagate the Jātaka stories Do you intend to hand down my evil repute to posterity Go back to your seats and say no more Three koṭis of people of the upper class were taken to the bank of the Indus River and put to death three koṭis of people of the middle class were drowned in the river and three koṭis of people of the lower class were granted to the soldiers  After that Mahirakula carried the loot he had taken from the conquered country and marched home in triumph But in less than a years time he died a sudden death and at that time clouds and mist darkened the sky and the earth quaked with a violent wind blowing vehemently A person who had realized sainthood had pity on him and remarked with a sigh of regret You unjustly killed innocent people and destroyed the buddhadharma You will fall into the deepest hell of incessant suffering and rotate without end In the old city of ākala there is a monastery with more than one hundred monks all of whom study Hinayana teachings Formerly Vasubandhu Bodhisattva composed the Paramārthasatyaśāstra at

temples When King Kaniṣka occupied the throne his fame reached neighboring countries and his prestige covered distant lands with dissimilar customs In fear of his inuence a vassal state to the west of the Yellow River sent a hostage to him King Kaniṣka received the hostage with municent hospitality provided him with three residences for the three seasons of the year and appointed four divisions of soldiers to serve as his guards The winter residence of the hostage was in this district and was called Cīnabhukti  which was also the name of the country where he had sojourned In this district and beyond it in the various parts of India there had been no pears or peaches it was the hostage who rst planted them Thus peaches are called cīnanī and pears are called cīnarājaputra  Therefore the

sole controller of all affairs connected with the Triple Gem in all of the ve parts of India made no distinction between different regions and forgetting his personal likes and dislikes he supervised
