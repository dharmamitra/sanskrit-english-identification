It does this in two waysFirst it provides a standard for judging those realizations Is there any stress remaining in the mindAt allIf there is then theyre not genuine AwakeningSecond the skills youve developed have sensitized you to all the doings in simply being which ensures that the subtlest levels of stress wont escape your gazeWithout this sensitivity you could easily mistake an infinitely luminous state of concentration for something moreBut when you really know what youre doing youll recognize freedom from doing when you finally encounter itAnd when you know that freedom youll know something further that the greatest gift you can give to others is to teach them the skills to encounter it for themselvesIn saying that kind and grateful people are rare the Buddha isnt simply stating a harsh truth about the human raceHes advising you to treasure these people when you find them and  more importantly  showing how you can become a rare person yourselfKindness and gratitude are virtues you can cultivate but they have to be cultivated togetherEach needs the other to be genuine  a point that becomes obvious when you think about the three things most likely to make gratitude heartfeltPoints one and two are lessons that gratitude teaches kindness If you want to be genuinely kind you have to be of actual benefit  nobody wants to be the recipient of help that isnt really helpful  and you have to provide that benefit in a way that shows respect and empathy for the other persons needsNo one likes to receive a gift given with calculating motives or in an offhand or disdainful wayPoints two and three are lessons that kindness teaches to gratitudeOnly if youve been kind to another person will you accept the idea that others can be kind to youAt the same time if youve been kind to another person you know the effort involvedKind impulses often have to do battle with unkind impulses in the heart so its not always easy to be helpfulSometimes it involves great sacrifice  a sacrifice possible only when you trust the recipient to make good use of your helpSo when youre on the receiving end of a sacrifice like that you realize youve incurred a debt an obligation to repay the other persons trustThis is why the Buddha always discusses gratitude as a response to kindness and doesnt equate it with appreciation in generalIts a special kind of appreciation inspiring a more demanding responseThe difference here is best illustrated by two passages in which the Buddha uses the image of carryingThe first passage concerns appreciation of a general sortThen the man having gathered grass twigs branches  leaves having bound them together to make a raft would cross over to safety on the far shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with his hands  feetHaving crossed over to the far shore he might think How useful this raft has been to meFor it was in dependence on this raft that making an effort with my hands  feet I have crossed over to safety on the far shoreWhy dont I having hoisted it on my head or carrying it on my back go wherever I like What do you think monksWould the man in doing that be doing what should be done with the raftNo lordAnd what should the man do in order to be doing what should be done with the raftThere is the case where the man having crossed over to the far shore would think How useful this raft has been to meFor it was in dependence on this raft that making an effort with my hands  feet I have crossed over to safety on the far shoreWhy dont I having dragged it on dry land or sinking it in the water go wherever I like In doing this he would be doing what should be done with the raftThe second passage concerns gratitude in particularI tell you monks there are two people who are not easy to repayWhich twoYour mother  fatherEven if you were to carry your mother on one shoulder  your father on the other shoulder for years and were to look after them by anointing massaging bathing  rubbing their limbs and they were to defecate  urinate right there you would not in that way pay or repay your parentsIf you were to establish your mother  father in absolute sovereignty over this great earth abounding in the seven treasures you would not in that way pay or repay your parentsWhy is thatMother  father do much for their childrenThey care for them they nourish them they introduce them to this worldBut anyone who rouses his unbelieving mother  father settles  establishes them in conviction rouses his unvirtuous mother  father settles  establishes them in virtue rouses his stingy mother  father settles  establishes them in generosity rouses his foolish mother  father settles  establishes them in discernment To this extent one pays  repays ones mother  fatherIn other words as the first passage shows its perfectly fine to appreciate the benefits youve received from rafts and other conveniences without feeling any need to repay themYou take care of them simply because that enables you to benefit from them moreThe same holds true for difficult people and situations that have forced you to develop strength of characterYou can appreciate that youve learned persistence from dealing with crabgrass in your lawn or equanimity from dealing with unreasonable neighbors without owing the crabgrass or neighbors any debt of gratitudeAfter all they didnt kindly go out of their way to help youAnd if you were to take them as models youd learn all the wrong lessons about kindness that simply following your natural impulses  or even worse behaving unreasonably  is the way to be kindDebts of gratitude apply only to parents teachers and other benefactors who have acted with your wellbeing in mindTheyve gone out of their way to help you and have taught you valuable lessons about kindness and empathy in the processIn the case of the raft youd do best to focus gratitude on the person who taught you how to make a raftIn the case of the crabgrass and the neighbors focus gratitude on the people who taught you how not to be overcome by adversityIf there are benefits youve received from things or situations you cant trace to a conscious agent in this lifetime feel gratitude to yourself for the good karma you did in the past that allowed those benefits to appearAnd be grateful for the good karma that allows you to receive and benefit from other peoples help in the first placeIf you had no good to your credit they wouldnt be able to reach youAs the Buddhas second passage shows the debt you owe to your benefactors neednt be tit for tat and shouldnt be directed solely to themNow the debt you owe your parents for giving birth to you and enabling you to live is immenseIn some passages the Buddha recommends expressing gratitude for their compassion with personal servicesHowever ANshows that the only true way to repay your parents is to strengthen them in four qualities conviction virtue generosity and discernmentTo do so of course you have to develop these qualities in yourself as well as learning how to employ great tact in being an example to your parentsAs it happens these four qualities are also those of an admirable friend which means that in repaying your parents in this way you become the sort of person whod be an admirable friend to others as wellYou become a person of integrity who  as the Buddha points out  has learned from gratitude how to be harmless in all your dealings and to give help with an empathetic heart respectfully in a timely way and with the sense that something good will come of itIn this way you repay your parents goodness many times over by allowing its influence to spread beyond the small circle of the family into the world at largeIn so doing you enlarge the circle of their goodness as wellThis principle also applies to your teachers as the Buddha told his disciplesSo this is what you think of me The Blessed One sympathetic seeking our wellbeing teaches the Dhamma out of sympathy Then you should train yourselves  harmoniously cordially and without dispute  in the qualities I have pointed out having known them directly the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors of Awakening the noble eightfold pathIn other words the way to repay a teachers compassion and sympathy in teaching you is to apply yourself to learning your lessons wellOnly then can you spread the good influence of those lessons to othersAs for the debts you owe yourself for your past good karma the best way to repay them is to use your benefits as opportunities to create further good karma and not simply enjoy the pleasure they offerHere again its important to remember the hardships that can be involved in acting skillfully and to honor your past skillful intentions by not allowing them to go to waste in the presentFor example as Ajaan Lee once said its not easy to attain a human mouth so bow down to your mouth every dayIn other words respect your ability to communicate and use it to say only whats timely beneficial and trueThese are some of the lessons about kindness and empathy that wellfocused gratitude can teach  lessons that teach you how to deal maturely and responsibly in the give and take of social lifeSmall wonder then that the Buddha cited gratitude as the quality defining what it means to be civilizedBut wellfocused gratitude can also teach lessons that apply further to the training of the mindFirst are the lessons touching on the nature of human action itselfThe sense that youve benefited from another persons action underscores the point that action does give results the importance you give to the other persons motives in helping you underscores the point that the quality of the action lies in the intention behind it and the sense that the other person went out of his or her way to help you underscores the sense that action isnt totally determined You feel indebted to the people who helped you because you sense how easily they might have denied that help and how difficult your life might have been if thats what they had chosen to doYour parents for instance didnt have to raise you or arrange for someone else to raise you they could have aborted you or left you to dieSo the fact that youre alive to read this means that somebody chose again and again to help you when you were helplessSensing that element of choice is what creates your sense of debtAll three of these points  the efficacy of action the importance of intention and the existence of choice  were distinctive elements in the Buddhas teaching on actionAnd the emotional resonance that gratitude and empathy give to these points may be the reason why when the Buddha introduced the basic outline of this teaching he cited topics connected with these emotions the value of giving and the debt owed to ones parentsHe couldnt offer his listeners proof for his three points  that would come only with their experience of Awakening  but by showing how his teaching on action allowed for generosity to be a meaningful action and gratitude a meaningful emotion he offered his listeners an emotionally satisfying reason for accepting his wordsGratitude also gives practice in developing qualities needed in meditationAs the Buddha noted the practice of concentration centers on the power of perceptionTraining in gratitude shows how powerful perception can be for it requires developing a particular set of perceptions about life and the worldIf you perceive help as demeaning then gratitude itself feels demeaning but if you perceive help as an expression of trust  the other person wouldnt want to help you unless he or she felt you would use the help well  then gratitude feels ennobling an aid to selfesteemSimilarly if you perceive life as a competition its hard to trust the motives of those who help you and you resent the need to repay their help as a gratuitous burdenIf however you perceive that the goodness in life is the result of cooperation then the give and take of kindness and gratitude become a much more pleasant exchangeSimilarly gratitude requires mindfulness in the Buddhas original sense of the word as keeping something in mindIn fact the connection between these two qualities extends to language itselfIn Pali the word for gratitude  kataññu  literally means to have a sense of what was doneIn SN the Buddha defines mindfulness as remembering  able to call to mind even things that were done  said long ago Our parents instructions to us when we were children  to remember the kindnesses of others  are among our first lessons in mindfulnessAs we develop our sense of gratitude we get practice in strengthening this quality of mindHowever not all the lessons taught by gratitude and empathy are of a heartwarming sortInstead they give rise to a sense of samvega  which can be translated as dismay or even terror  over how risky and precarious the goodness of the world can beTo begin with theres the fact that you cant choose beforehand whose kindness youll be indebted toTheres no telling what kind of parents youll getAs the Buddha rightly notes some parents are stingy immoral and foolishNot only are they abusive to their children but they also might not be content or even pleased with the type of repayment the Buddha says is best for themThey may demand an unreasonable level of repayment involving actions that are downright harmful for you themselves and othersAnd yet this doesnt cancel the debt you owe them for the simple fact that theyve enabled you to liveYouve probably heard of the passage in which the Buddha saysA being who has not been your mother at one time in the past is not easy to find A being who has not been your father your brother your sister your son your daughter at one time in the past is not easy to findWhy is thatFrom an inconceivable beginning comes transmigrationWhen you think about how difficult each of these relationships can be its no surprise that the Buddha didnt say this to make you feel warmhearted to all the beings you meetHe said it to induce samvegaLong have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be releasedEven the debts of gratitude you owe to yourself for the good actions youve done are enough to induce a sense of diseaseYou know that not all your past intentions have been skillful and yet these are the things that will shape the conditions of your life now and into the futureYoure in a precarious position  enough to make you want to find a way out even of the network of kindness and gratitude that sustains whatever goodness there is in the worldThis desire grows even stronger when you allow your empathy to spread to those who have had to make unwilling sacrifices to keep you aliveEvery day the Buddha advised you should reflect on the fact that life depends on the requisites of food clothing shelter and medicineMany are the beings who have had to die and suffer other hardships because of your need for these thingsContrary to the song that concludes Mahlers Fourth Symphony lambs dont gleefully jump into the stewpot to feed youAnd even if  when youre in the fortunate position to be able to decide what kind of food you eat  you adhere to a vegetarian diet you still owe an enormous debt to the farmers and workers who have had to slave under harsh conditions to provide the requisites you needThe sense of indebtedness that these reflections induce goes far beyond gratitude and is certainly not pleasant to think aboutThis may be why so many people try to deny that they owe anyone a debt of gratitude at allOr why those who do encourage the contemplation of gratitude as a source of happiness tend to reduce it to a generic sense of appreciation and contentment  in the words of one writer wanting what you have knowing that you have and are enough  devoid of any sense of debtGratitude of this sort tends to focus on things because gratitude to things is so much easier than gratitude to benefactorsThings dont make demandsThey dont suffer and they dont mix their kindness with abuseYet theres no getting around the fact that our very lives depend on the kindness and hardships of others and that we cant get out of the resulting debts by callously denying them or blithely wishing them awayIf we dont repay them now well have to repay them  sometimes at high interest  later for even death doesnt erase our debts or free us from coming back to incur moreSo to avoid these entanglements we need another way out  a way the Buddha found through training his mind to reach a happiness that no longer needs to depend on the kindness and sacrifices of othersAnd although this happiness provides an escape it isnt escapistIt settles your debts in a responsible and generous wayThis is because unconditional happiness allows you to abandon the cravings and attachments through which you repeatedly take on the identity of a beingTo identify yourself as a being means having to find food  both physical and mental  to keep that identity goingThis is why when youre a being you need to depend on a network of kindness gratitude and sacrificeBut when you can abandon the need for that identity the mind no longer has to feedIts no longer a burden to anyoneAs for the body as long as youre still alive those who provide for its needs reap merit many times over for the gifts they provideThis in fact is one of the motivations for gaining awakeningWe will undertake  practice those qualities that make one a contemplative so that the services of those whose robes almsfood lodging and medicinal requisites we use will bring them great fruit  great rewardAt the same time the example of your behavior and freedom of mind is a gift to others in that it shows how they too can free themselves from their debtsThis is why the Buddha said that only those who have attained full awakening eat the alms food of the country without incurring debtTheyve even paid off their debt to the Buddha for having taught the way to releaseAs he said the only homage he requested was that people practice the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma  ie to develop the disenchantment and dispassion that lead to release  so that the world will not be empty of awakened peopleIn this way attaining full release is not a selfish act instead its the highest expression of kindness and gratitudeOf course its a rare person who will take this route to freedom but that doesnt lessen its value or relevanceAs with gratitude and benefaction its an opportunity to become rare and distinctive thats open to anyone with the discernment to appreciate it and the determination to become truly kind and debtfreeThe Buddha was like a doctor treating the spiritual ills of the human raceThe path of practice he taught was like a course of therapy for suffering hearts and mindsThis way of understanding the Buddha and his teachings dates back to the earliest texts and yet is also very currentBuddhist meditation practice is often advertised as a form of healing and quite a few psychotherapists now recommend that their patients try meditation as part of their treatmentAfter several years of teaching and practicing meditation as therapy however many of us have found that meditation on its own is not enoughIn my own experience I have found that Western meditators tend to be afflicted more with a certain grimness and lack of selfesteem than any Asians I have ever taughtTheir psyches are so wounded by modern civilization that they lack the resilience and persistence needed before concentration and insight practices can be genuinely therapeuticOther teachers have noted this problem as well and as a result many of them have decided that the Buddhist path is insufficient for our particular needsTo make up for this insufficiency they have experimented with ways of supplementing meditation practice combining it with such things as myth poetry psychotherapy social activism sweat lodges mourning rituals and even drummingThe problem though may not be that there is anything lacking in the Buddhist path but that we simply havent been following the Buddhas full course of therapyThe Buddhas path consisted not only of mindfulness concentration and insight practices but also of virtue beginning with the five preceptsIn fact the precepts constitute the first step in the pathThere is a tendency in the West to dismiss the five precepts as Sundayschool rules bound to old cultural norms that no longer apply to our modern society but this misses the role that the Buddha intended for them They are part of a course of therapy for wounded mindsIn particular they are aimed at curing two ailments that underlie low selfesteem regret and denialWhen our actions dont measure up to certain standards of behavior we either regret the actions or engage in one of two kinds of denial either denying that our actions did in fact happen or denying that the standards of measurement are really validThese reactions are like wounds in the mindRegret is an open wound tender to the touch while denial is like hardened twisted scar tissue around a tender spotWhen the mind is wounded in these ways it cant settle down comfortably in the present for it finds itself resting on raw exposed flesh or calcified knotsEven when its forced to stay in the present its there only in a tensed contorted and partial way and so the insights it gains tend to be contorted and partial as wellOnly if the mind is free of wounds and scars can it be expected to settle down comfortably and freely in the present and to give rise to undistorted discernmentThis is where the five precepts come in They are designed to heal these wounds and scarsHealthy selfesteem comes from living up to a set of standards that are practical clearcut humane and worthy of respect the five precepts are formulated in such a way that they provide just such a set of standardsPractical The standards set by the precepts are simple  no intentional killing stealing having illicit sex lying or taking intoxicantsIts entirely possible to live in line with these standardsNot always easy or convenient but always possibleI have seen efforts to translate the precepts into standards that sound more lofty or noble  taking the second precept for example to mean no abuse of the planets resources  but even the people who reformulate the precepts in this way admit that it is impossible to live up to themAnyone who has dealt with psychologically damaged people knows that very often the damage comes from having been presented with impossible standards to live byIf you can give people standards that take a little effort and mindfulness but are possible to meet their selfesteem soars dramatically as they discover that they are actually capable of meeting those standardsThey can then face more demanding tasks with confidenceClearcut The precepts are formulated with no ifs ands or butsThis means that they give very clear guidance with no room for waffling or lessthanhonest rationalizationsAn action either fits in with the precepts or it doesntAgain standards of this sort are very healthy to live byAnyone who has raised children has found that although they may complain about hard and fast rules they actually feel more secure with them than with rules that are vague and always open to negotiationClearcut rules dont allow for unspoken agendas to come sneaking in the back door of the mindIf for example the precept against killing allowed you to kill living beings when their presence is inconvenient that would place your convenience on a higher level than your compassion for lifeConvenience would become your unspoken standard  and as we all know unspoken standards provide huge tracts of fertile ground for hypocrisy and denial to growIf however you stick by the standards of the precepts then as the Buddha says you are providing unlimited safety for the lives of allThere are no conditions under which you would take the lives of any living beings no matter how inconvenient they might beIn terms of the other precepts you are providing unlimited safety for their possessions and sexuality and unlimited truthfulness and mindfulness in your communication with themWhen you find that you can trust yourself in matters like these you gain an undeniably healthy sense of selfrespectHumane The precepts are humane both to the person who observes them and to the people affected by his or her actionsIf you observe them you are aligning yourself with the doctrine of karma which teaches that the most important powers shaping your experience of the world are the intentional thoughts words and deeds you choose in the present momentThis means that you are not insignificantEvery time you take a choice  at home at work at play  you are exercising your power in the ongoing fashioning of the worldAt the same time this principle allows you to measure yourself in terms that are entirely under your control your intentional actions in the present momentIn other words they dont force you to measure yourself in terms of your looks strength brains financial prowess or any other criteria that depend less on your present karma than they do on karma from the pastAlso they dont play on feelings of guilt or force you to bemoan your past lapsesInstead they focus your attention on the everpresent possibility of living up to your standards in the here and nowIf you are living with people who observe the precepts you find that your dealings with them are not a cause for mistrust or fearThey regard your desire for happiness as akin to theirsTheir worth as individuals does not depend on situations in which there have to be winners and losersWhen they talk about developing lovingkindness and mindfulness in their meditation you see it reflected in their actionsIn this way the precepts foster not only healthy individuals but also a healthy society  a society in which the selfrespect and mutual respect are not at oddsWorthy of respect When you adopt a set of standards it is important to know whose standards they are and to see where those standards come from for in effect you are joining their group looking for their approval and accepting their criteria for right and wrongIn this case you couldnt ask for a better group to join the Buddha and his noble disciplesThe five precepts are called standards appealing to the noble ones From what the texts tell us of the noble ones they are not people who accept standards simply on the basis of popularityThey have put their lives on the line to see what leads to true happiness and have seen for themselves for example that all lying is pathological and that any sex outside of a stable committed relationship is unsafe at any speedOther people may not respect you for living by the five precepts but noble ones do and their respect is worth more than that of anyone else in the worldNow many people find it cold comfort to join such an abstract group especially when they have not yet met any noble ones in personIts hard to be goodhearted and generous when the society immediately around you openly laughs at those qualities and values such things as sexual prowess or predatory business skills insteadThis is where Buddhist communities can come inIt would be very useful if Buddhist groups would openly part ways with the prevailing amoral tenor of our culture and let it be known in a kindly way that they value goodheartedness and restraint among their membersIn doing so they would provide a healthy environment for the fullscale adoption of the Buddhas course of therapy the practice of concentration and discernment in a life of virtuous actionWhere we have such environments we find that meditation needs no myth or makebelieve to support it because it is based on the reality of a welllived lifeYou can look at the standards by which you live and then breathe in and out comfortably  not as a flower or a mountain but as a fullfledged responsible human beingFor thats what you areWhen explaining meditation the Buddha often drew analogies with the skills of artists carpenters musicians archers and cooksFinding the right level of effort he said is like a musicians tuning of a luteReading the minds needs in the moment  to be gladdened steadied or inspired  is like a palace cooks ability to read and please the tastes of a princeCollectively these analogies make an important point Meditation is a skill and mastering it should be enjoyable in the same way that mastering any other rewarding skill can beThe Buddha said as much to his son Rahula When you see that youve acted spoken or thought in a skillful way  conducive to happiness while causing no harm to yourself or others  take joy in that fact and keep on trainingOf course saying that meditation should be enjoyable doesnt mean that it will always be easy or pleasantEvery meditator knows it requires serious discipline to sit with long unpleasant stretches and untangle all the minds difficult issuesBut if you can approach difficulties with the enthusiasm that an artist approaches challenges in her work the discipline becomes enjoyable Problems are solved through your own ingenuity and the mind is energized for even greater challengesThis joyful attitude is a useful antidote to the more pessimistic attitudes that people often bring to meditation which tend to fall into two extremesOn the one hand theres the belief that meditation is a series of dull and dreary exercises allowing no room for imagination and inquiry Simply grit your teeth and at the end of the long haul your mind will be processed into an awakened stateOn the other hand theres the belief that effort is counterproductive to happiness so meditation should involve no exertion at all Simply accept things as they are  its foolish to demand that they get any better  and relax into the momentWhile its true that both repetition and relaxation can bring results in meditation when either is pursued to the exclusion of the other it leads to a dead endIf however you can integrate them both into the larger skill of learning how to apply whatever level of effort the practice requires at any given moment they can take you farThis larger skill requires strong powers of mindfulness concentration and discernment but if you stick with it it can lead you all the way to the Buddhas ultimate aim in teaching meditation nirvana a happiness totally unconditioned free from the constraints of space and timeThats an inspiring aim but it requires workAnd the key to maintaining your inspiration in the daytoday work of meditation practice is to approach it as play a happy opportunity to master practical skills to raise questions experiment and exploreThis is precisely how the Buddha himself taught meditationInstead of formulating a cutanddried method he first trained his students in the personal qualities  such as honesty and patience  needed to make trustworthy observationsOnly then did he teach meditation techniques and even then he didnt spell everything outHe raised questions and suggested areas for exploration in hopes that his questions would capture his students imagination so theyd develop discernment and gain insights on their ownWe can see this in the way the Buddha taught Rahula how to meditateHe started with the issue of patienceMeditate he said so that your mind is like the earthDisgusting things get thrown on the earth but the earth isnt horrified by themWhen you make your mind like the earth neither agreeable nor disagreeable sensory impressions will take charge of itNow the Buddha wasnt telling Rahula to become a passive clod of dirtHe was teaching Rahula to be grounded to develop his powers of endurance so that hed be able to observe both pleasant and painful events in his body and mind without becoming engrossed in the pleasure or blown away by the painThis is what patience is forIt helps you sit with things until you understand them well enough to respond to them skillfullyTo develop honesty in meditation the Buddha taught Rahula a further exerciseLook at the inconstancy of events in body and mind he said so that you dont develop a sense of I am around themHere the Buddha was building on a lesson that he had taught Rahula when the latter was seven years oldLearn to look at your actions he had said before you do them while youre doing them and after theyre doneIf you see that youve acted unskillfully and caused harm resolve not to repeat the mistakeThen talk it over with someone you respectIn these lessons the Buddha was training Rahula to be honest with himself and with othersAnd the key to this honesty is to treat your actions as experimentsThen if you see the results arent good you are free to change your waysThis attitude is essential for developing honesty in your meditation as wellIf you regard every thing  good or bad  that arises in the meditation as a sign of the sort of person you are it will be hard to observe anything honestly at allIf an unskillful intention arises youre likely either to come down on yourself as a miserable meditator or to smother the intention under a cloak of denialIf a skillful intention arises youre likely to become proud and complacent reading it as a sign of your innate good natureAs a result you never get to see if these intentions are actually as skillful as they seemed at first glanceTo avoid these pitfalls you can learn to see events simply as events and not as signs of the innate Buddhaness or badness of who you areThen you can observe these events honestly to see where they come from and where they leadHonesty together with patience puts you in a better position to use the techniques of meditation to explore your own mindThe primary technique the Buddha taught Rahula was breath meditationThe Buddha recommended sixteen steps in dealing with the breathThe first two involve straightforward instructionsThe rest raise questions to be exploredIn this way the breath becomes a vehicle for exercising your ingenuity in solving the problems of the mind and exercising your sensitivity in gauging the resultsTo begin simply notice when the breath is long and when its shortIn the remaining steps though you train yourselfIn other words you have to figure out for yourself how to do what the Buddha recommendsThe first two trainings are to breathe in and out sensitive to the entire body then to calm the effect that the breath has on the bodyHow do you do thatYou experimentWhat rhythm of breathing what way of conceiving the breath calms its effect on the bodyTry thinking of the breath not as the air coming in and out of the lungs but as the energy flow throughout the body that draws the air in and outWhere do you feel that energy flowThink of it as flowing in and out the back of your neck in your feet and hands along the nerves and blood vessels in your bonesThink of it coming in and out every pore of your skinWhere is it blockedHow do you dissolve the blockagesBy breathing through themAround themStraight into themSee what worksAs you play around with the breath in this way youll make some mistakes  Ive sometimes given myself headaches by forcing the breath too much  but with the right attitude the mistakes become lessons in learning how the impact of your perceptions shapes the way you breatheYoull also catch yourself getting impatient or frustrated but then youll see that when you breathe through these emotions they go awayYoure beginning to see the impact of the breath on the mindThe next step is to breathe in and out with a sense of refreshing fullness and a sense of easeHere too youll need to experiment both with the way you breathe and with the way you conceive of the breathNotice how these feelings and conceptions have an impact on the mind and how you can calm that impact so that the mind feels most at easeThen when the breath is calm and youve been refreshed by feelings of ease and stillness youre ready to look at the mind itselfYou dont leave the breath thoughYou adjust your attention slightly so that youre watching the mind as it stays with the breathHere the Buddha recommends three areas for experimentation Notice how to gladden the mind when it needs gladdening how to steady it when it needs steadying and how to release it from its attachments and burdens when its ready for releaseSometimes the gladdening and steadying will require bringing in other topics for contemplationFor instance to gladden the mind you can develop an attitude of infinite good will or recollect the times in the past when youve been virtuous or generousTo steady the mind when its been knocked over by lust you can contemplate the unattractive side of the human bodyTo reestablish your focus when youre drowsy or complacent you can contemplate death  realizing that death could come at any time and you need to prepare your mind if youre going to face it with any finesseAt other times you can gladden or steady the mind simply by the way you focus on the breath itselfFor instance breathing down into your hands and feet can really anchor the mind when its concentration has become shakyWhen one spot in the body isnt enough to hold your interest try focusing on the breath in two spots at onceThe important point is that youve now put yourself in a position where you can experiment with the mind and read the results of your experiments with greater and greater accuracyYou can try exploring these skills off the cushion as well How do you gladden the mind when youre sickHow do you steady the mind when dealing with a difficult personAs for releasing the mind from its burdens you prepare for the ultimate freedom of nirvana first by releasing the mind from any awkwardness in its concentrationOnce the mind has settled down check to see if there are any ways you can refine the stillnessFor instance in the beginning stages of concentration you need to keep directing your thoughts to the breath evaluating and adjusting it to make it more agreeableBut eventually the mind grows so still that evaluating the breath is no longer necessarySo you figure out how to make the mind one with the breath and in that way you release the mind into a more intense and refreshing state of easeAs you expand your skills in this way the intentions that youve been using to shape your experience of body and mind become more and more transparentAt this point the Buddha suggests revisiting the theme of inconstancy learning to look for it in the effects of every intentionYou see that even the best states produced by skillful intentions  the most solid and refined states of concentration  waver and changeRealizing this induces a sense of disenchantment with and dispassion for all intentionsYou see that the only way to get beyond this changeability is to allow all intentions to ceaseYou watch as everything is relinquished including the pathWhats left is unconditioned the deathlessYour desire to explore the breath has taken you beyond desiring beyond the breath all the way to nirvanaBut the path doesnt save all its pleasures for the endIt takes the daunting prospect of reaching full Awakening and breaks it down into manageable interim goals  a series of intriguing challenges that as you meet them allow you to see progress in your practiceThis in and of itself makes the practice interesting and a source of joyAt the same time youre not engaged in busyworkYoure developing a sensitivity to cause and effect that helps make body and mind transparentOnly when theyre fully transparent can you let them goIn experiencing the full body of the breath in meditation youre sensitizing yourself to the area of your awareness where the deathless  when youre acute enough to see it  will appearSo even though the path requires effort its an effort that keeps opening up new possibilities for happiness and wellbeing in the present momentAnd even though the steps of breath meditation eventually lead to a sense of disenchantment and dispassion they dont do so in a joyless wayThe Buddha never asks anyone to adopt a worldnegating  or worldaffirming for that matter  frame of mindInstead he asks for a worldexploring attitude in which you use the inner world of fullbody breathing as a laboratory for exploring the harmless and clearminded pleasures the world as a whole can provideYou learn skills to calm the body to develop feelings of refreshment fullness and easeYou learn how to calm the mind to steady it gladden it and release it from its burdensOnly when you run up against the limits of these skills are you ready to drop them to explore what greater potential for happiness there may beIn this way disenchantment develops not from a narrow or pessimistic attitude but from an attitude of hope that there must be something betterThis is like the disenchantment a child senses when he has mastered a simple game and feels ready for something more challengingIts the attitude of a person who has maturedAnd as we all know you dont mature by shrinking from the world watching it passively or demanding that it entertain youYou mature by exploring it by expanding your range of usable skills through playWhen I first went to study with my teacher Ajaan Fuang he handed me a small booklet of meditation instructions and sent me up the hill behind the monastery to meditateThe booklet  written by his teacher Ajaan Lee  began with a breath meditation technique and concluded with a section showing how the technique was used to induce the first four levels of jhanaIn the following years I saw Ajaan Fuang hand the same booklet to each of his new students lay and ordainedYet despite the booklets detailed descriptions of jhana he himself rarely mentioned the word jhana in his conversations and never indicated to any of his students that they had reached a particular level of jhana in their practiceWhen a student told him of a recurring meditative experience he liked to discuss not what it was but what to do with it what to focus on what to drop what to change what to maintain the sameThen hed teach the student how to experiment with it  to make it even more stable and restful  and how to judge the results of the experimentsIf his students wanted to measure their progress against the descriptions of jhana in the booklet that was their business and none of hisHe never said this in so many words but given the way he taught the implicit message was clearAs were the implicit reasons for his attitudeHe had told me once about his own experiences as a young meditator Back in those days you didnt have books explaining everything the way we do nowWhen I first studied with Ajaan Lee he told me to bring my mind downSo I focused on getting it down down down but the more I brought it down the heavily and duller it gotI thought This cant be right So I turned around and focused on bringing it up up up until I found a balance and could figure out what he was talking about This incident was one of many that taught him some important lessons that you have to test things for yourself to see where the instructions had to be taken literally and where they had to be taken figuratively that you had to judge for yourself how well you were doing and that you had to be ingenious experimenting and taking risks to find ways to deal with problems as they aroseSo as a teacher he tried to instill in his students these qualities of selfreliance ingenuity and a willingness to take risks and test things for themselvesHe did that not only by talking about these qualities but also by forcing you into situations where youd have to develop themHad he always been there to confirm for you that Yes youve reached the third jhana or No thats only the second jhana he would have shortcircuited the qualities he was trying to instillHe rather than your own powers of observation would have been the authority on what was going on in your mind and you would have been absolved of any responsibility for correctly evaluating what you had experiencedAt the same time he would have been feeding your childish desire to please or impress him and undermining your ability to deal with the task at hand which was how to develop your own powers of sensitivity to put an end to suffering and stressAs he once told me If I have to explain everything youll get used to having things handed to you on a platterAnd then what will you do when problems come up in your meditation and you dont have any experience in figuring things out on your own So studying with him I had to learn to take risks in the midst of uncertaintiesIf something interesting came up in the practice Id have to stick with it observing it over time before reaching any conclusions about itEven then I learned the labels I applied to my experiences couldnt be chiseled in rockThey had to be more like postit notes convenient markers for my own reference that I might have to peel off and stick elsewhere as I became more familiar with the territory of my mindThis proved to be a valuable lesson that applied to all areas of my practiceStill Ajaan Fuang didnt leave me to reinvent the dharma wheel totally on my ownExperience had shown him that some approaches to concentration worked better than others for putting the mind in a position where it could exercise its ingenuity and accurately judge the results of its experiments and he was very explicit in recommending those approachesAmong the points he emphasized were theseStrong concentration is absolutely necessary for liberating insightWithout a firm basis in concentration he often said insight is just concepts To see clearly the connections between stress and its causes the mind has to be very steady and stillAnd to stay still it requires the strong sense of well being that only strong concentration can provideTo gain insight into a state of concentration you have to stick with it for a long timeIf you push impatiently from one level of concentration to the next or if you try to analyze a new state of concentration too quickly after youve attained it you never give it the chance to show its full potential and you dont give yourself the chance to familiarize yourself with itSo you have to keep working at it as a skill something you can tap into in all situationsThis enables you to see it from a variety of perspectives and to test it over time to see if it really is as totally blissful empty and effortless as it may have seemed on first sightThe best state of concentration for the sake of developing allaround insight is one that encompasses a wholebody awarenessThere were two exceptions to Ajaan Fuangs usual practice of not identifying the state you had attained in your practice and both involved states of wrong concentrationThe first was the state that comes when the breath gets so comfortable that your focus drifts from the breath to the sense of comfort itself your mindfulness begins to blur and your sense of the body and your surroundings gets lost in a pleasant hazeWhen you emerge you find it hard to identify where exactly you were focusedAjaan Fuang called this mohasamadhi or delusionconcentrationThe second state was one I happened to hit one night when my concentration was extremely onepointed and so refined that it refused settle on or label even the most fleeting mental objectsI dropped into a state in which I lost all sense of the body of any internalexternal sounds or of any thoughts or perceptions at all  although there was just enough tiny awareness to let me know when I emerged that I hadnt been asleepI found that I could stay there for many hours and yet time would pass very quicklyTwo hours would seem like two minutesI could also program myself to come out at a particular timeAfter hitting this state several nights in a row I told Ajaan Fuang about it and his first question was Do you like it My answer was No because I felt a little groggy the first time I came outGood he saidAs long as you dont like it youre safeSome people really like it and think its nibbana or cessationActually its the state of nonperceptionIts not even right concentration because theres no way you can investigate anything in there to gain any sort of discernmentBut it does have other uses He then told me of the time he had undergone kidney surgery and not trusting the anesthesiologist had put himself in that state for the duration of the operationIn both these states of wrong concentration the limited range of awareness was what made them wrongIf whole areas of your awareness are blocked off how can you gain allaround insightAnd as Ive noticed in years since people adept at blotting out large areas of awareness through powerful onepointedness also tend to be psychologically adept at dissociation and denialThis is why Ajaan Fuang following Ajaan Lee taught a form of breath meditation that aimed at an allaround awareness of the breath energy throughout the body playing with it to gain a sense of ease and then calming it so that it wouldnt interfere with a clear vision of the subtle movements of the mindThis allaround awareness helped to eliminate the blind spots where ignorance likes to lurkAn ideal state of concentration for giving rise to insight is one that you can analyze in terms of stress and the absence of stress even while youre in itOnce your mind was firmly established in a state of concentration Ajaan Fuang would recommend lifting it from its object but not so far that the concentration was destroyedFrom that perspective you could evaluate what levels of stress were still present in the concentration and let them goIn the initial stages this usually involved evaluating how you were relating to the breath and detecting more subtle levels of breath energy in the body that would provide a basis for deeper levels of stillnessOnce the breath was perfectly still and the sense of the body started dissolving into a formless mist this process would involve detecting the perceptions of space knowing oneness etc that would appear in place of the body and could be peeled away like the layers of an onion in the mindIn either case the basic pattern was the same detecting the level of perception or mental fabrication that was causing the unnecessary stress and dropping it for a more subtle level of perception or fabrication until there was nothing left to dropThis was why as long as your awareness was still and alert allaround it didnt matter whether you were in the first or the fourteenth jhana for the way you treated your state of concentration was always the sameBy directing your attention to issues of stress and its absence he was pointing you to terms by which to evaluate your state of mind for yourself without having to ask any outside authorityAnd as it turns out the terms you can evaluate for yourself  stress its cause its cessation and the path to its cessation  are the issues that define the four noble truths the right view that the Buddha says can lead to total liberationFor all the subtlety of his teachings the Buddha had a simple test for measuring wisdomYoure wise he said to the extent that you can get yourself to do things you dont like doing but know will result in happiness and to refrain from things you like doing but know will result in pain and harmHe derived this standard for wisdom from his insight into the radical importance of intentional action in shaping our experience of happiness and sorrow pleasure and painWith action so important and yet so frequently misguided wisdom has to be tactical strategic in fostering actions that are truly beneficialIt has to outwit shortsighted preferences to yield a happiness that lastsBecause the Buddha viewed all issues of experience from the gross to the subtle in terms of intentional actions and their results his tactical standard for wisdom applies to all levels as well from the wisdom of simple generosity to the wisdom of emptiness and ultimate AwakeningWisdom on all levels is wise because it worksIt makes a difference in what you do and the happiness that resultsAnd to work it requires integrity the willingness to look honestly at the results of your actions to admit when youve caused harm and to change your ways so that you wont make the same mistake againWhats striking about this standard for wisdom is how direct and down to earth it isThis might come as a surprise for most of us dont think of Buddhist wisdom as so commonsensical and straightforwardInstead the phrase Buddhist wisdom conjures up teachings more abstract and paradoxical flying in the face of common sense  emptiness being a prime exampleEmptiness were told means that nothing has any inherent existenceIn other words on an ultimate level things arent what we conventionally think of as things Theyre processes that are in no way separate from all the other processes on which they dependThis is a philosophically sophisticated idea thats fascinating to ponder but it doesnt provide much obvious help in getting you up early on a cold morning to meditate nor in convincing you to give up a destructive addictionFor example if youre addicted to alcohol its not because you feel that the alcohol has any inherent existenceIts because in your calculation the immediate pleasure derived from the alcohol outweighs the longterm damage its doing to your lifeThis is a general principle attachment and addiction are not metaphysical problemsTheyre tactical onesWere attached to things and actions not because of what we think they are but because of what we think they can do for our happinessIf we keep overestimating the pleasure and underestimating the pain they bring we stay attached to them regardless of what in an ultimate sense we understand them to beBecause the problem is tactical the solution has to be tactical as wellThe cure for addiction and attachment lies in retraining your imagination and your intentions through expanding your sense of the power of your actions and the possible happiness you can achieveThis means learning to become more honest and sensitive to your actions and their consequences at the same time allowing yourself to imagine and master alternative routes to greater happiness with fewer drawbacksMetaphysical views may sometimes enter into the equation but at most theyre only secondaryMany times theyre irrelevantEven if you were to see the alcohol and its pleasure as lacking inherent existence youd still go for the pleasure as long as you saw it as outweighing the damageSometimes ideas of metaphysical emptiness can actually be harmfulIf you start focusing on how the damage of drinking  and the people damaged by your drinking  are empty of inherent existence you could develop a rationale for continuing to drinkSo the teaching on metaphysical emptiness wouldnt seem to pass the Buddhas own test for wisdomThe irony here is that the idea of emptiness as lack of inherent existence has very little to do with what the Buddha himself said about emptinessHis teachings on emptiness  as reported in the earliest Buddhist texts the Pali Canon  deal directly with actions and their results with issues of pleasure and painTo understand and experience emptiness in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication but a personal integrity willing to admit the actual motivations behind your actions and the actual benefits and harm they causeFor these reasons this version of emptiness is very relevant in developing the sort of wisdom that would pass the Buddhas commonsensical test for measuring how wise you areThe Buddhas teachings on emptiness  contained in two major discourses and several smaller ones  define it in three distinct ways as an approach to meditation as an attribute of the senses and their objects and as a state of concentrationAlthough these forms of emptiness differ in their definitions they ultimately converge on the same route to release from sufferingTo see how this happens we will need to examine the three meanings of emptiness one by oneIn doing so well find that each of them applies the Buddhas commonsensical test for wisdom to subtle actions of the mindBut to understand how this test applies to this subtle level we first have to see how it applies to actions on a more obvious levelFor that theres no better introduction than the Buddhas advice to his son Rahula on how to cultivate wisdom while engaging in the activities of everyday lifeThe Buddha told Rahula  who was seven at the time  to use his thoughts words and deeds as a mirrorIn other words just as you would use a mirror to check for any dirt on your face Rahula was to use his actions as a means of learning where there was still anything impure in his mindBefore he acted he should try to anticipate the results of the actionIf he saw that theyd be harmful to himself or to others he shouldnt follow through with the actionIf he foresaw no harm he could go ahead and actIf in the course of doing the action he saw it causing unexpected harm he should stop the actionIf he didnt see any harm he could continue with itIf after he was done he saw any longterm harm resulting from the action he should consult with another person on the path to get some perspective on what he had done  and on how not to do it again  and then resolve not to repeat that mistakeIn other words he should not feel embarrassed or ashamed to reveal his mistakes to people he respected for if he started hiding his mistakes from them he would soon start hiding them from himselfIf on the other hand he saw no harm resulting from the action he should rejoice in his progress in the practice and continue with his trainingThe right name for this reflection is not selfpurification Its actionpurification You deflect judgments of good and bad away from your sense of self where they can tie you down with conceit and guiltInstead you focus directly on the actions themselves where the judgments can allow you to learn from your mistakes and to find a healthy joy in what you did rightWhen you keep reflecting in this way it serves many purposesFirst and foremost it forces you to be honest about your intentions and about the effects of your actionsHonesty here is a simple principle you dont add any afterthefact rationalizations to cover up what you actually did nor do you try to subtract from the actual facts through denialBecause youre applying this honesty to areas where the normal reaction is to be embarrassed about or afraid of the truth its more than a simple registering of the factsIt also requires moral integrityThis is why the Buddha stressed morality as a precondition for wisdom and declared the highest moral principle to be the precept against lyingIf you dont make a habit of admitting uncomfortable truths the truth as a whole will elude youThe second purpose of this reflection is to emphasize the power of your actionsYou see that your actions do make the difference between pleasure and painThird you gain practice in learning from your mistakes without shame or remorseFourth you realize that the more honest you are in evaluating your actions the more power you have to change your ways in a positive directionAnd finally you develop good will and compassion in that you resolve to act only on intentions that mean no harm to anyone and you continually focus on developing the skill of harmlessness as your top priorityAll of these lessons are necessary to develop the kind of wisdom measured by the Buddhas test for wisdom and as it turns out theyre directly related to the first meaning of emptiness as an approach to meditationIn fact this sort of emptiness simply takes the instructions Rahula received for observing everyday actions and extends them to the act of perception within the mindEmptiness as an approach to meditation is the most basic of the three kinds of emptinessIn the context of this approach emptiness means empty of disturbance  or to put it in other terms empty of stressYou bring the mind to concentration and then examine your state of concentration in order to detect the presence or absence of subtle disturbance or stress still inherent within that stateWhen you find a disturbance you follow it back to the perception  the mental label or act of recognition  on which the concentration is basedThen you drop that perception in favor of a more refined one one leading to a state of concentration with less inherent disturbanceIn the discourse explaining this meaning of emptiness the Buddha introduces his explanation with a simileHe and Ananda are dwelling in an abandoned palace that is now a quiet monasteryThe Buddha tells Ananda to notice and appreciate how the monastery is empty of the disturbances it contained when it was still used as a palace  the disturbances caused by gold and silver elephants and horses assemblies of women and menThe only disturbance remaining is that caused by the presence of the monks meditating in unityTaking this observation as a simile the Buddha launches into his description of emptiness as an approach to meditationHe describes a monk meditating in the wilderness who is simply noting to himself that he is now in the wildernessThe monk allows his mind to concentrate on and enjoy the perception wilderness He then steps back mentally to observe and appreciate that this mode of perception is empty of the disturbances that come with perceptions of the village life he has left behindThe only remaining disturbances are those associated with the perception wilderness  for example any emotional reactions to the dangers that wilderness might entailAs the Buddha says the monk sees accurately which disturbances are not present in that mode of perception as for those remaining he sees accurately There is this In other words he adds nothing to what is there and takes nothing awayThis is how he enters into a meditative emptiness that is pure and undistortedThen noting the disturbances inherent in the act of focusing on wilderness the monk drops that perception and replaces it with a more refined perception one with less potential for arousing disturbanceHe chooses the earth element banishing from his mind any details of the hills and ravines of the earth simply taking note of its earthnessHe repeats the process he applied to the perception of wilderness  settling into the perception of earth fully indulging in it and then stepping back to notice how the disturbances associated with wilderness are now gone while the only remaining disturbances are those associated with the singleness of mind based on the perception of earthHe then repeats the same process with ever more refined perceptions settling into the formless jhanas or meditative absorptions infinite space infinite consciousness nothingness neither perception nor nonperception and the objectless concentration of awarenessFinally seeing that even this objectless concentration of awareness is fabricated and willed he drops his desire to continue mentally fabricating anything at allIn this way he is released from the mental fermentations  sensual desire becoming views ignorance  that would bubble up into further becomingHe observes that this release still has the disturbances that come with the functioning of the six sense spheres but that its empty of all fermentation all potential for further suffering and stressThis concludes the Buddha is the entry into a pure and undistorted emptiness that is superior and unsurpassedIts the emptiness in which he himself dwells and that throughout time has never been nor ever will be excelledThroughout this description emptiness means one thing empty of disturbance or stressThe meditator is taught to appreciate the lack of disturbance as a positive accomplishment and to see any remaining disturbance created by the mind however subtle as a problem to be solvedWhen you understand disturbance as a subtle form of harm you see the connections between this description of emptiness and the Buddhas instructions to RahulaInstead of regarding his meditative states as a measure of selfidentity or selfworth  in having developed a self thats purer more expansive more at one with the ground of being  the monk views them simply in terms of actions and their consequencesAnd the same principles apply here on the meditative level as apply in the Buddhas comments to Rahula on action in generalHere the action is the perception that underlies your state of meditative concentrationYou settle into the state by repeating the action of perception continually until you are thoroughly familiar with itJust as Rahula discovered the consequences of his actions by observing the obvious harm done to himself or to others here you discover the consequences of concentrating on the perception by seeing how much disturbance arises from the mental actionAs you sense disturbance you can change your mental action moving your concentration to a more refined perception until ultimately you can stop the fabrication of mental states altogetherAt the core of this meditation practice are two important principles derived from the instructions to RahulaThe first is honesty the ability to be free of embellishment or denial adding no interpretation to the disturbance actually present while at the same time not trying to deny that its thereAn integral part of this honesty is the ability to see things simply as action and result without reading into them the conceit I amThe second principle is compassion  the desire to end suffering  in that you keep trying to abandon the causes of stress and disturbance wherever you find themThe effects of this compassion extend not only to yourself but to others as wellWhen you dont weigh yourself down with stress youre less likely to be a burden to others youre also in a better position to help shoulder their burdens when need beIn this way the principles of integrity and compassion underlie even the most subtle expressions of the wisdom leading to releaseThis process of developing emptiness of disturbance is not necessarily smooth and straightforwardIt keeps requiring the strength of will needed to give up any attachmentThis is because an essential step in getting to know the meditative perception as an action is learning to settle into it to indulge in it  in other words to enjoy it thoroughly even to the point of attachmentThis is one of the roles of tranquility in meditationIf you dont learn to enjoy the meditation enough to keep at it consistently you wont grow familiar with itIf you arent familiar with it insight into its consequences wont ariseHowever unless youve already had practice using the Rahula instructions to overcome grosser attachments then even if you gain insight into the disturbances caused by your attachment to concentration your insight will lack integrityBecause you havent had any practice with more blatant attachments you wont be able to pry loose your subtle attachments in a reliable wayYou first need to develop the moral habit of looking at your actions and their consequences believing firmly  through experience  in the worth of refraining from harm however subtleOnly then will you have the skill needed to develop emptiness as an approach to meditation in a pure and undistorted way that will carry you all the way to its intended goalEmptiness as an attribute when used as a departure point for practice leads to a similar process but by a different routeWhereas emptiness as an approach to meditation focuses on issues of disturbance and stress emptiness as an attribute focuses on issues of self and notselfAnd whereas emptiness as an approach to meditation starts with tranquility emptiness as an attribute starts with insightThe Buddha describes this kind of emptiness in a short discourseAgain Ananda is his interlocutor opening the discourse with a question In what way is the world emptyThe Buddha answers that each of the six senses and their objects are empty of ones self or anything pertaining to ones selfThe discourse gives no further explanation but related discourses show that this insight can be put into practice in one of two waysThe first is to reflect on what the Buddha says about self and how ideas of self can be understood as forms of mental activityThe second way which we will discuss in the next section is to develop the perception of all things being empty of ones self as a basis for a state of refined concentrationHowever as we shall see both of these tactics ultimately lead back to using the first form of emptiness as an approach to meditation to complete the path to AwakeningWhen talking about self the Buddha refused to say whether it exists or not but he gave a detailed description of how the mind develops the idea of self as a strategy based on cravingIn our desire for happiness we repeatedly engage in what the Buddha calls Imaking and mymaking as ways of trying to exercise control over pleasure and painBecause Imaking and mymaking are actions they fall under the purview of the Buddhas instructions to RahulaWhenever you engage in them you should check to see whether they lead to affliction if they do you should abandon themThis is a lesson that on a blatant level we learn even as childrenIf you lay claim to a piece of candy belonging to your sister youre going to get into a fightIf shes bigger than you youd do better not to claim the candy as yoursMuch of our practical education as we grow up lies in discovering where its beneficial to create a sense of self around something and where its notIf you learn to approach your Imaking and mymaking in the light of the Rahula instructions you greatly refine this aspect of your education as you find yourself forced to be more honest discerning and compassionate in seeing where an I is a liability and where its an assetOn a blatant level you discover that while there are many areas where I and mine lead only to useless conflicts there are others where theyre beneficialThe sense of I that leads you to be generous and principled in your actions is an I worth making worth mastering as a skillSo too is the sense of I that can assume responsibility for your actions and can be willing to sacrifice a small pleasure in the present for a greater happiness in the futureThis kind of I with practice leads away from affliction and toward increasing levels of happinessThis is the I that will eventually lead you to practice meditation for you see the longterm benefits that come from training your powers of mindfulness concentration and discernmentHowever as meditation refines your sensitivity you begin to notice the subtle levels of affliction and disturbance that Imaking and mymaking can create in the mindThey can get you attached to a state of calm so that you resent any intrusions on my calmThey can get you attached to your insights so that you develop pride around my insightsThis can block further progress for the sense of I and mine can blind you to the subtle stress on which the calm and insights are basedIf youve had training in following the Rahula instructions though youll come to appreciate the advantages of learning to see even the calm and the insights as empty of self or anything pertaining to selfThat is the essence of this second type of emptinessWhen you remove labels of I or mine even from your own insights and mental states how do you see themSimply as instances of stress arising and passing away  disturbance arising and passing away  with nothing else added or taken awayAs you pursue this mode of perception youre adopting the first form of emptiness as an approach to meditationThe third kind of emptiness taught by the Buddha  as a state of concentration  is essentially another way of using insight into emptiness as an attribute of the senses and their objects as a means to attain releaseOne discourse describes it as follows A monk goes to sit in a quiet place and intentionally perceives the six senses and their objects as empty of self or anything pertaining to selfAs he pursues this perception it brings his mind not directly to release but to the formless jhana of nothingness which is accompanied by strong equanimityAnother discourse pursues this topic further noting that the monk relishes the equanimityIf he simply keeps on relishing it his meditation goes no further than thatBut if he learns to see that equanimity as an action  fabricated willed  he can look for the subtle stress it engendersIf he can observe this stress as it arises and passes away simply on its own terms neither adding any other perceptions to it nor taking anything away hes again adopting emptiness as an approach to his meditationBy dropping the causes of stress wherever he finds them in his concentration he ultimately reaches the highest form of emptiness free from all mental fabricationThus the last two types of emptiness ultimately lead back to the first  emptiness as an approach to meditation  which means that all three types of emptiness ultimately lead to the same destinationWhether they interpret emptiness as meaning empty of disturbance or empty of self whether they encourage fostering insight through tranquility or tranquility through insight they all culminate in a practice that completes the tasks appropriate to the four noble truths comprehending stress abandoning its cause realizing its cessation and developing the path to that cessationCompleting these tasks leads to releaseWhats distinctive about this process is the way it grows out of the principles of actionpurification that the Buddha taught to Rahula applying these principles to every step of the practice from the most elementary to the most refinedAs the Buddha told Rahula these principles are the only possible means by which purity can be attainedAlthough most explanations of this statement define purity as purity of virtue the Buddhas discussion of emptiness as an approach to meditation shows that purity here means purity of mind and purity of wisdom as wellEvery aspect of the training is purified by viewing it in terms of actions and consequences which helps to develop the integrity thats willing to admit to unskillful actions and the mature goodwill that keeps aiming at consequences entailing ever less harm disturbance and stressThis is where this sort of emptiness differs from the metaphysical definition of emptiness as lack of inherent existence Whereas that view of emptiness doesnt necessarily involve integrity  its an attempt to describe the ultimate truth of the nature of things rather than to evaluate actions  this approach to emptiness requires honestly evaluating your mental actions and their resultsIntegrity is thus integral to its masteryIn this way the highest levels of wisdom and discernment grow primarily not from the type of knowledge fostered by debate and logical analysis nor from the type fostered by bare awareness or mere notingThey grow from the knowledge fostered by integrity devoid of conceit coupled with compassion and goodwillThe reason for this is so obvious that its often missed if youre going to put an end to suffering you need the compassion to see that this is a worthwhile goal and the integrity to admit the suffering youve heedlessly and needlessly caused throughout the pastThe ignorance that gives rise to suffering occurs not because you dont know enough or are not philosophically sophisticated enough to understand the true meaning of emptinessIt comes from being unwilling to admit that what youre obviously doing right before your very eyes is causing sufferingThis is why Awakening destroys conceit it awakens you to the full extent of the willful blindness that has kept you complicit in unskillful behavior all alongIts a chastening experienceThe only honest thing to do in response to this experience is to open to releaseThats the emptiness thats superior and unsurpassedIn building the path to this emptiness on the same principles that underlie the more elementary levels of actionpurification the Buddha managed to avoid creating artificial dichotomies between conventional and ultimate truths in the practiceFor this reason his approach to ultimate wisdom helps validate the more elementary levels as wellWhen you realize that an undistorted understanding of emptiness depends on the skills you develop in adopting a responsible honest and kind attitude toward all your actions youre more likely to bring this attitude to everything you do  gross or subtleYou give more importance to all your actions and their consequences you give more importance to your sense of integrity for you realize that these things are directly related to the skills leading to total releaseYou cant develop a throwaway attitude to your actions and their consequences for if you do youre throwing away your chances for a true and unconditional happinessThe skills you need to talk yourself into meditating on a cold dark morning or into resisting a drink on a lazy afternoon are the same ones that will eventually guarantee an undistorted realization of the highest peaceThis is how the Buddhas teachings on emptiness encourage you to exercise wisdom in everything you doThe brahmaviharas or sublime attitudes are the Buddhas primary heart teachings  the ones that connect most directly with our desire for true happinessThe term brahmavihara literally means dwelling place of brahmas Brahmas are gods who live in the higher heavens dwelling in an attitude of unlimited goodwill unlimited compassion unlimited empathetic joy and unlimited equanimityThese unlimited attitudes can be developed from the more limited versions of these emotions that we experience in the human heartOf these four emotions goodwill is the most fundamentalIts the wish for true happiness a wish you can direct to yourself or to othersGoodwill was the underlying motivation that led the Buddha to search for awakening and to teach the path to awakening to others after he had found itThe next two emotions in the list are essentially applications of goodwillCompassion is what goodwill feels when it encounters suffering It wants the suffering to stopEmpathetic joy is what goodwill feels when it encounters happiness It wants the happiness to continueEquanimity is a different emotion in that it acts as an aid to and a check on the other threeWhen you encounter suffering that you cant stop no matter how hard you try you need equanimity to avoid creating additional suffering and to channel your energies to areas where you can be of helpIn this way equanimity isnt cold hearted or indifferentIt simply makes your goodwill more focused and effectiveMaking these attitudes limitless requires workIts easy to feel goodwill compassion and empathetic joy for people you like and love but there are bound to be people you dislike  often for very good reasonsSimilarly there are many people for whom its easy to feel equanimity people you dont know or dont really care aboutBut its hard to feel equanimity when people you love are sufferingYet if you want to develop the brahmaviharas you have to include all of these people within the scope of your awareness so that you can apply the proper attitude no matter where or whenThis is where your heart needs the help of your headAll too often meditators believe that if they can simply add a little more heart juice a little more emotional oomph to their brahmavihara practice their attitudes can become limitlessBut if something inside you keeps churning up reasons for liking this person or hating that one your practice starts feeling hypocriticalYou wonder who youre trying to foolOr after a month devoted to the practice you still find yourself thinking black thoughts about people who cut you off in traffic  to say nothing of people whove done the world serious harmThis is where the head comes inIf we think of the heart as the side of the mind that wants happiness the head is the side that understands how cause and effect actually workIf your head and heart can learn to cooperate  that is if your head can give priority to finding the causes for true happiness and your heart can learn to embrace those causes  then the training of the mind can go farThis is why the Buddha taught the brahmaviharas in a context of head teachings the principle of causality as it plays out in karma and the process of fabrication that shapes emotions within the body and mindThe more we can get our heads around these teachings the easier it will be to put our whole heart into developing attitudes that truly are sublimeAn understanding of karma helps to explain what were doing as we develop the brahmaviharas and why we might want to do so in the first placeAn understanding of fabrication helps to explain how we can take our human heart and convert it into a place where brahmas could dwellThe teaching on karma starts with the principle that people experience happiness and sorrow based on a combination of their past and present intentionsIf we act with unskillful intentions either for ourselves or for others were going to sufferIf we act with skillful intentions well experience happinessSo if we want to be happy we have to train our intentions to always be skillfulThis is the first reason for developing the brahmaviharas so that we can make our intentions more trustworthySome people say that unlimited goodwill comes naturally to us that our Buddha nature is intrinsically compassionateBut the Buddha never said anything about BuddhanatureWhat he did say is that the mind is even more variegated than the animal worldWere capable of anythingSo what are we going to do with this capabilityWe could do  and have done  almost anything but the one thing the Buddha does assume across the board is that deep down inside we want to take this capability and devote it to happinessSo the first lesson of karma is that if you really want to be happy you cant trust that deep down you know the right thing to do because that would simply foster complacencyUnskillful intentions would take over and you wouldnt even know itInstead you have to be heedful to recognize unskillful intentions for what they are and to act only on skillful onesThe way to ensure that youll stay heedful is to take your desire for happiness and spread it aroundThe second lesson of karma is that just as youre the primary architect of your own happiness and suffering other people are the primary architects of theirsIf you really want them to be happy you dont just treat them nicelyYou also want them to learn how to create the causes for happinessIf you can you want to show them how to do thatThis is why the gift of dharma  lessons in how to give rise to true happiness  is the greatest giftIn the Buddhas most famous example of how to express an attitude of unlimited good will he doesnt just express the following wish for universal happinessHe immediately adds a wish that all beings avoid the causes that would lead them to unhappinessSo if youre using visualization as part of your goodwill practice dont visualize people simply as smiling surrounded willynilly by wealth and sensual pleasuresVisualize them acting speaking and thinking skillfullyIf theyre currently acting on unskillful intentions visualize them changing their waysThen act to realize those visualizations if you canA similar principle applies to compassion and empathetic joyLearn to feel compassion not only for people who are already suffering but also for those who are engaging in unskillful actions that will lead to future sufferingThis means if possible trying to stop them from doing those thingsAnd learn to feel empathetic joy not only for those who are already happy but also for those whose actions will lead to future happinessIf you have the opportunity give them encouragementBut you also have to realize that no matter how unlimited the scope of these positive emotions their effect is going to run into limitsIn other words regardless of how strong your goodwill or compassion may be there are bound to be people whose past actions are unskillful and who cannot or will not change their ways in the presentThis is why you need equanimity as your reality checkWhen you encounter areas where you cant be of help you learn not to get upsetThink about the universality of the principle of karma it applies to everyone regardless of whether you like them or notThat puts you in a position where you can see more clearly what can be changed where you can be of helpIn other words equanimity isnt a blanket acceptance of things as they areIts a tool for helping you to develop discernment as to which kinds of suffering you have to accept and which ones you dontFor example someone in your family may be suffering from AlzheimersIf you get upset about the fact of the disease youre limiting your ability to be genuinely helpfulTo be more effective you have to use equanimity as a means of letting go of what you want to change and focusing more on what can be changed in the presentA third lesson from the principle of karma is that developing the brahmaviharas can also help mitigate the results of your past bad actionsThe Buddha explains this point with an analogy If you put a lump of salt into a glass of water you cant drink the water in the glassBut if you put that lump of salt into a river you could then drink the water in the river because the river contains so much more water than saltWhen you develop the four brahmaviharas your mind is like the riverThe skillful karma of developing these attitudes in the present is so expansive that whatever results of past bad actions may arise you hardly notice themA proper understanding of karma also helps to correct the false idea that if people are suffering they deserve to suffer so you might as well just leave them aloneWhen you catch yourself thinking in those terms you have to keep four principles in mindFirst remember that when you look at people you cant see all the karmic seeds from their past actionsThey may be experiencing the results of past bad actions but you dont know when those seeds will stop sproutingAlso you have no idea what other seeds whatever wonderful latent potentials will sprout in their placeTheres a saying in some Buddhist circles that if you want to see a persons past actions you look at his present condition if you want to see his future condition you look at his present actionsThis principle however is based on a basic misperception that we each have a single karmic account and what we see in the present is the current running balance in each persons accountActually no ones karmic history is a single accountIts composed of the many different seeds planted in many places through the many different actions weve done in the past each seed maturing at its own rateSome of these seeds have already sprouted and disappeared some are sprouting now some will sprout in the futureThis means that a persons present condition reflects only a small portion of his or her past actionsAs for the other seeds you cant see them at allThis reflection helps you when developing compassion for it reminds you that you never know when the possibility to help somebody can have an effectThe seeds of the other persons past bad actions may be flowering right now but they could die at any timeYou may happen to be the person whos there to help when that person is ready to receive helpThe same pattern applies to empathetic joySuppose that your neighbor is wealthier than you areYou may resist feeling empathetic joy for him because you think Hes already welloff while Im still strugglingWhy should I wish him to be even happier than he is If you find yourself thinking in those terms remind yourself that you dont know what your karmic seeds are you dont know what his karmic seeds areMaybe his good karmic seeds are about to dieDo you want them to die any fasterDoes his happiness diminish yoursWhat kind of attitude is thatIts useful to think in these waysThe second principle to keep in mind is that in the Buddhas teaching theres no question of a persons deserving happiness or deserving painThe Buddha simply says that there are actions leading to pleasure and actions leading to painKarma is not a respecter of persons its simply an issue of actions and resultsGood people may have some bad actions squirreled away in their pastPeople who seem horrible may have done some wonderful thingsYou never knowSo theres no question of a persons deserving or not deserving pleasure or painTheres simply the principle that actions have results and that your present experience of pleasure or pain is the combined result of past and present actionsYou may have some very unskillful actions in your past but if you learn to think skillfully when those actions bear fruit in the present you dont have to sufferA third principle applies to the question of whether the person whos suffering deserves your compassionYou sometimes hear that everyone deserves your compassion because they all have BuddhanatureBut this ignores the primary reason for developing compassion as a brahmavihara in the first place You need to make your compassion universal so that you can trust your intentionsIf you regard your compassion as so precious that only Buddhas deserve it you wont be able to trust yourself when encountering people whose actions are consistently evilAt the same time you have to remember that no human being has a totally pure karmic past so you cant make a persons purity the basis for your compassionSome people resist the idea that say children born into a warzone suffering from brutality and starvation are there for a karmic reasonIt seems heartless they say to attribute these sufferings to karma from past livesThe only heartlessness here though is the insistence that people are worthy of compassion only if they are innocent of any wrongdoingRemember that you dont have to like or admire someone to feel compassion for that personAll you have to do is wish for that person to be happyThe more you can develop this attitude toward people you know have misbehaved the more youll be able to trust your intentions in any situationThe Buddha illustrates this point with a graphic analogy Even if bandits attack you and saw off your limbs with a twohandled saw you have to feel goodwill starting with them and then spreading to include the entire worldIf you keep this analogy in mind it helps to protect you from acting in unskillful ways no matter how badly provokedThe fourth principle to remember concerns the karma youre creating right now in reaction to other peoples pleasure and painIf youre resentful of somebody elses happiness someday when you get happy theres going to be somebody resentful of yoursDo you want thatOr if youre hardhearted toward somebody whos suffering right now someday you may face the same sort of sufferingDo you want people to be hardhearted toward youAlways remember that your reactions are a form of karma so be mindful to create the kind of karma that gives the results youd like to seeWhen you think in these ways you see that it really is in your interest to develop the brahmaviharas in all situationsSo the question is how do you do thatThis is where another aspect of the Buddhas teachings on causality plays a role his teaching on fabrication or the way you shape your experienceFabrication is of three kinds bodily verbal and mentalBodily fabrication is the way you breatheVerbal fabrications are thoughts and mental comments on things  your internal speechIn Pali these thoughts and comments are called vitakka  directed thought and vicara evaluationMental fabrications are perceptions and feelings the mental labels you apply to things and the feelings of pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain you feel about themAny desire or emotion is made up of these three types of fabricationIt starts with thoughts and perceptions and then it gets into your body through the way you breatheThis is why emotions seem so real so insistent so genuinely you But as the Buddha points out you identify with these things because you fabricate them in ignorance you dont know what youre doing and you suffer as a resultBut if you can fabricate your emotions with knowledge they can form a path to the end of sufferingAnd the breath is a good place to startIf for example youre feeling anger toward someone ask yourself How am I breathing right nowHow can I change the way I breathe so that my body can feel more comfortable Anger often engenders a sense of discomfort in the body and you feel youve got to get rid of itThe common ways of getting rid of it are two and theyre both unskillful either you bottle it up or you try to get it out of your system by letting it out in your words and deedsSo the Buddha provides a third more skillful alternative Breathe through your discomfort and dissolve it awayLet the breath create physical feelings of ease and fullness and allow those feelings to saturate your whole bodyThis physical ease helps put the mind at ease as wellWhen youre operating from a sense of ease its easier to fabricate skillful perceptions as you evaluate your response to the issue with which youre facedHere the analogy of the lump of salt is an important perception to keep in mind as it reminds you to perceive the situation in terms of your need for your own goodwill to protect yourself from bad karmaPart of this protection is to look for the good points of the person youre angry atAnd to help with this perception the Buddha provides an even more graphic analogy to remind you of why this approach is not mere sentimentality If you see someone whos been really nasty to you in his words and deeds but has moments of honesty and goodwill its as if youre walking through a desert  hot trembling thirsty  and you come across a cow footprint with a little bit of water in itNow what do you doYou cant scoop the water up with your hand because that would muddy itInstead you get down on your hands and knees and very carefully slurp it upNotice your position in this imageIt may seem demeaning to have your mouth to the ground like this but remember Youre trembling with thirstYou need waterIf you focus just on the bad points of other people youre going to feel even more oppressed with the heat and the thirstYoull get bitter about the human race and see no need to treat it wellBut if you can see the good in other people youll find it easier to treat them skillfullyTheir good points are like water for your heartYou need to focus on them to nourish your own goodness now and in the futureIf however the person youre angry about has no good qualities at all then the Buddha recommends another perception Think of that person as a sick stranger youve found on the side of the road far away from any helpYou have to feel compassion for him and do whatever you can to get him to the safety of skillful thoughts words and deedsWhat youve done here is to use skillful verbal fabrication  thinking about and evaluating the breath  to turn the breath into a skillful bodily fabricationThis in turn creates a healthy mental fabrication  the feeling of ease  that makes it easier to mentally fabricate perceptions that can deconstruct your unskillful reaction and construct a skillful emotion in its placeThis is how we use our knowledge of karma and fabrication to shape our emotions in the direction we want  which is why head teachings are needed even in matters of the heartAt the same time because weve sensitized ourselves to the role that the breath plays in shaping emotion we can make a genuine change in how we physically feel about these mattersWere not playing make believeOur change of heart becomes fully embodied genuinely feltThis helps undercut the feeling of hypocrisy that can sometimes envelop the practice of the brahmaviharasInstead of denying our original feelings of anger or distress in any given situation smothering them with a mass of cotton candy or marshmallow cream we actually get more closely in touch with them and learn to skillfully reshape themAll too often we think that getting in touch with our emotions is a means of tapping into who we really are  that weve been divorced from our true nature and that by getting back in touch with our emotions well reconnect with our true identityBut your emotions are not your true nature theyre just as fabricated as anything elseBecause theyre fabricated the real issue is to learn how to fabricate them skillfully so they dont lead to trouble and can instead lead to a trustworthy happinessRemember that emotions cause you to actTheyre paths leading to good or bad karmaWhen you see them as paths you can transform them into a path you can trustAs you learn how to deconstruct emotions of ill will hardheartedness resentment and distress and reconstruct the brahmaviharas in their place you dont simply attain an unlimited heartYou gain practice in mastering the processes of fabricationAs the Buddha says that mastery leads first to strong and blissful states of concentrationFrom there it can fabricate all the factors of the path leading to the goal of all the Buddhas teachings whether for head or for heart the total happiness of nirvana unconditionally trueWhich simply goes to show that if you get your head and your heart to respect each other they can take each other farYour heart needs the help of your head to generate and act on more skillful emotionsYour head needs your heart to remind you that whats really important in life is putting an end to sufferingWhen they learn how to work together they can make your human mind into an unlimited brahmamindAnd more They can master the causes of happiness to the point where they transcend themselves touching an uncaused dimension that the head cant encompass and a happiness so true that the heart has no further need for desireEmptiness is a mode of perception a way of looking at experienceIt adds nothing to and takes nothing away from the raw data of physical and mental eventsYou look at events in the mind and the senses with no thought of whether theres anything lying behind themThis mode is called emptiness because its empty of the presuppositions we usually add to experience to make sense of it the stories and worldviews we fashion to explain who we are and the world we live inAlthough these stories and views have their uses the Buddha found that some of the more abstract questions they raise  of our true identity and the reality of the world outside  pull attention away from a direct experience of how events influence one another in the immediate presentThus they get in the way when we try to understand and solve the problem of sufferingSay for instance that youre meditating and a feeling of anger toward your mother appearsImmediately the minds reaction is to identify the anger as my anger or to say that Im angryIt then elaborates on the feeling either working it into the story of your relationship to your mother or to your general views about when and where anger toward ones mother can be justifiedThe problem with all this from the Buddhas perspective is that these stories and views entail a lot of sufferingThe more you get involved in them the more you get distracted from seeing the actual cause of the suffering the labels of I and mine that set the whole process in motionAs a result you cant find the way to unravel that cause and bring the suffering to an endIf however you can adopt the emptiness mode  by not acting on or reacting to the anger but simply watching it as a series of events in and of themselves  you can see that the anger is empty of anything worth identifying with or possessingAs you master the emptiness mode more consistently you see that this truth holds not only for such gross emotions as anger but also for even the most subtle events in the realm of experienceThis is the sense in which all things are emptyWhen you see this you realize that labels of I and mine are inappropriate unnecessary and cause nothing but stress and painYou can then drop themWhen you drop them totally you discover a mode of experience that lies deeper still one thats totally freeTo master the emptiness mode of perception requires training in firm virtue concentration and discernmentWithout this training the mind tends to stay in the mode that keeps creating stories and world viewsAnd from the perspective of that mode the teaching of emptiness sounds simply like another story or world view with new ground rulesIn terms of the story of your relationship with your mother it seems to be saying that theres really no mother no youIn terms of your views about the world it seems to be saying either that the world doesnt really exist or else that emptiness is the great undifferentiated ground of being from which we all came to which someday well all returnThese interpretations not only miss the meaning of emptiness but also keep the mind from getting into the proper modeIf the world and the people in the story of your life dont really exist then all the actions and reactions in that story seem like a mathematics of zeros and you wonder why theres any point in practicing virtue at allIf on the other hand you see emptiness as the ground of being to which were all going to return then what need is there to train the mind in concentration and discernment since were all going to get there anywayAnd even if we need training to get back to our ground of being whats to keep us from coming out of it and suffering all over againSo in all these scenarios the whole idea of training the mind seems futile and pointlessBy focusing on the question of whether or not there really is something behind experience they entangle the mind in issues that keep it from getting into the present modeNow stories and world views do serve a purposeThe Buddha employed them when teaching people but he never used the word emptiness when speaking in these modesHe recounted the stories of peoples lives to show how suffering comes from the unskillful perceptions behind their actions and how freedom from suffering can come from being more perceptiveAnd he described the basic principles that underlie the round of rebirth to show how bad intentional actions lead to pain within that round good ones lead to pleasure while really skillful actions can take you beyond the round altogetherIn all these cases these teachings were aimed at getting people to focus on the quality of the perceptions and intentions in their minds in the present  in other words to get them into the emptiness modeOnce there they can use the teachings on emptiness for their intended purpose to loosen all attachments to views stories and assumptions leaving the mind empty of all greed anger and delusion and thus empty of suffering and stressAnd when you come right down to it thats the emptiness that really countsThe Buddha is famous for having refused to take a position on many of the controversial issues of his day such as whether the cosmos is finite or infinite eternal or notIn fact many people  both in his time and in ours  have assumed that he didnt take a firm position on any issue at allBased on this assumption some people have been exasperated with the Buddha accusing him of being wishywashy and indecisive while others have been pleased praising him for being tolerant and refreshingly free from ideas of right and wrongBoth reactions however are misinformedThe early texts report that a group of wanderers in a discussion with one of the Buddhas lay disciples once accused the Buddha of not taking a position on any issue and the disciple replied that they were mistakenThere was one issue on which the Buddhas position was very clear what kind of behavior is skillful and what kind of behavior is notWhen the disciple later reported the conversation to the Buddha the Buddha approved of what he had saidThe distinction between skillful and unskillful behavior lies at the basis of everything the Buddha taughtIn making this distinction the Buddha drew some very sharp linesWhat is unskillfulTaking life is unskillful taking what is not given sexual misconduct lying abusive speech divisive talebearing idle chatter is unskillfulCovetousness ill will wrong views are unskillfulThese things are called unskillfulAnd what is skillfulAbstaining from taking life is skillful abstaining from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from lying from abusive speech from divisive talebearing abstaining from idle chatter is skillfulLack of covetousness lack of ill will right views are skillfulThese things are called skillfulKilling is never skillfulStealing lying and everything else in the first list are never skillfulWhen asked if there was anything whose killing he approved of the Buddha answered that there was only one thing angerIn no recorded instance did he approve of killing any living being at allWhen one of his monks went to an executioner and told the man to kill his victims compassionately with one blow rather than torturing them the Buddha expelled the monk from the Sangha on the grounds that even the recommendation to kill compassionately is still a recommendation to kill  something he would never condoneIf a monk was physically attacked the Buddha allowed him to strike back in selfdefense but never with the intention to killAs he told the monksEven if bandits were to carve you up savagely limb by limb with a twohandled saw he among you who let his heart get angered even at that would not be doing my biddingEven then you should train yourselves Our minds will be unaffected and we will say no evil wordsWe will remain sympathetic with a mind of good will and with no inner hateWe will keep pervading these people with an awareness imbued with good will and beginning with them we will keep pervading the allencompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will Thats how you should train yourselvesWhen formulating lay precepts based on his distinction between skillful and unskillful the Buddha never made any allowances for ifs ands or butsWhen you promise yourself to abstain from killing or stealing the power of the promise lies in its universalityYou wont break your promise to yourself under any conditions at allThis is because this sort of unconditional promise is a powerful giftTake for instance the first precept against killingThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abandoning the taking of life abstains from taking lifeIn doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beingsIn giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppressionThis is the first gift the first great gift  original longstanding traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning  that is not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and is unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives  brahmansIf you make exceptions in your promise to yourself  trying to justify killing in cases where you feel endangered or inconvenienced by another beings existence  your gift of freedom is limited and you lose your share in limitless freedomThus the gift of freedom to be fully effective has to be unconditional with no room for exceptions no matter how noble they may sound of any kindThe dynamic of this kind of gift of course depends on an important principle the teaching of karma and rebirth If you act on unskillful motivations the act will result in your suffering now or in lives to come if you act on skillful intentions the act will result in your pleasure now or in lives to comeIf you dont kill anyone you are not creating the circumstances where anyone or anything will cut short your life spanYour past karma may still leave an opening for your murder or accidental death  you cant go back and undo what youve already done  but once you make and follow through with the promise not to kill again you are creating no new openings for having your life cut shortAs the Dhammapada saysThis is why the Buddha listed virtue as one of a persons greatest treasuresKings and thieves can steal your material belongings and even take your life but they cant take your virtueIf its uncompromising your virtue protects you from any true danger from now until you reach nirvanaEven if youre not ready to accept the teaching on karma and rebirth the Buddha still recommended an absolute standard of virtueAs he told the Kalamas if you decide to act skillfully at all times harming no one then even if it turned out that there was no life after death youd still come out ahead for you would have been able to live and die with a clear conscience  something that no amount of money or political influence can buySo the Buddhas position on the precepts was uncompromising and clearIf you want to follow his teachings theres absolutely no room for killing stealing or lying periodHowever in our current climate of terrorism and counterterrorism  where governments have claimed that its their moral duty to lie kill and torture in order to prevent others from lying killing and torturing  a number of Buddhist teachers have joined in the effort trying to find evidence that there were some occasions at least where the Buddha would condone killing or offer a rationale for a just warExactly why they would want to do this is up to them to say but theres a need to examine their arguments in order to set the record straightThe Buddha never taught a theory of just war no decision to wage war can legitimately be traced to his teachings no war veteran has ever had to agonize over memories of the people he killed because the Buddha said that war was okayThese facts are among the glories of the Buddhist tradition and its important for the human race that they not be muddied in an effort to recast the Buddha in our own less than glorious imageBecause the Pali Canon is such an unpromising place to look for the justification of killing most of the arguments for a Buddhist theory of just war look elsewhere for their evidence citing the words and behavior of people they take as surrogates for the BuddhaThese arguments are obviously on shaky ground and can be easily dismissed even by people who know nothing of the CanonFor example it has been argued that because Asian governments claiming to be Buddhist have engaged in war and torture the Buddhas teachings must condone such behaviorHowever weve had enough exposure to people claiming to be Christian whose behavior is very unChristian to realize that the same thing can probably happen in the Buddhist world as wellTo take killers and torturers as your guide to the Buddhas teaching is hardly a sign of good judgmentOn a somewhat higher note one writer has noted that his meditation teacher has told soldiers and policemen that if their duty is to kill they must perform their duty albeit compassionately and with mindfulnessThe writer then goes on to argue that because his teacher is the direct recipient of an oral tradition dating back to the Buddha we must take this as evidence that the Buddha would give similar advice as wellThis statement of course tells us more about the writers faith in his teacher than about the Buddha and when we reflect that the Buddha expelled from the Sangha a monk who gave advice of this sort to an executioner it casts serious doubts on his argumentThere are however writers who try to find evidence in the Pali Canon for a Buddhist theory of just war not in what the Buddha said but in what he didntThe arguments go like this When talking with kings the Buddha never told them not to engage in war or capital punishmentThis was his tacit admission that the king had a justifiable duty to engage in these activities and the kings would have understood his silence as suchBecause these arguments cite the Pali Canon and claim a historians knowledge of how silence was interpreted in the Buddhas day they seem to carry more authority than the othersBut when we actually look at the Pali record of the Buddhas conversations with kings we find that the arguments are bogusThe Buddha was able to communicate the message to kings that they shouldnt kill but because kings in general were not the most promising students of the Dhamma he had to bring them to this message in an indirect wayIts true that in the Pali Canon silence is sometimes interpreted as acquiescence but this principle holds only in response to a requestIf someone invited the Buddha to his house for a meal and the Buddha remained silent that was a sign of consentHowever there were many instances in which the Buddhas silence was a sign not of acquiescence but of tactA professional soldier once went to the Buddha and said that his teachers had taught the existence of a heaven awaiting soldiers who die in battleWhat did the Buddha have to say about thatAt first the Buddha declined to answer but when the soldier showed the sincerity of his question by pressing him three times for a response he finally repliedWhen a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle his mind is already seized debased  misdirected by the thought May these beings be struck down or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyedMay they not exist If others then strike him down  slay him while he is thus striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the hell called the realm of those slain in battleBut if he holds such a view as this When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle that is his wrong viewNow there are two destinations for a person with wrong view I tell you either hell or the animal wombThe soldier then broke down and cried  not because he felt that the Buddhas words were cruel but because he believed their truth and was upset at his earlier teachers for having lied to himIn this case the Buddhas reticence and tact helped to make his teaching effectiveA similar set of events happened when an actor asked the Buddha if there is a special heaven reserved for actorsThe Buddhas reticence and tact in informing the actor of a hell for actors who incite their audiences to greed anger and delusion inspired the actor to respond in the same way as the soldierIf the pride of soldiers and actors required special handling even more care was required in the handling of kings for their pride was often coupled with an unrestrained sense of powerA remarkable feature of the Pali Canon is that even though the Buddha was a member of the noble warrior caste the discourses generally show a low regard for the spiritual standing of kingsIn many passages kings are mentioned in the same breath with thieves They confiscate property and show little regard for the rule of lawThe Canon does recognize exceptions  King Bimbisara of Magadha achieves streamentry the first time he hears the Dhamma and he never engages in war  but for the most part kings are depicted as spiritually stuntedKing Ajatasattu on first seeing the Buddha sitting surrounded by monks cant tell which person in the assembly is the Buddha a sign of his spiritual blindness this blindness is later proven by his asking the Buddhas advice on how to defeat his innocent neighbors in warAs one of the discourses suggests this sort of blindness is an occupational hazard for rulers in that the unfair exercise of power can make a person unfit for learning the truthBecause of having wrongly inflicted suffering on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment I have powerI want power when told what is factual he denies it and doesnt acknowledge itWhen told what is unfactual he doesnt make an ardent effort to untangle it This is unfactualThis is baselessEven King Pasenadi of Kosala the king most closely associated with the Buddha comes across as wellmeaning but somewhat denseAn entire discourse MN is a satire of how his royal position has thwarted his ability to learn the DhammaHe cant phrase his questions properly has trouble following a discussion for more than a few sentences and is unable to come to any certain conclusions about the truthStill in other discourses he has his occasional moments of spiritual clarity and the Buddha uses those moments as opportunities to teach the DhammaThe Buddhas approach here is twofold to try to expand the kings perspective on life at times when the king is willing to be frank and to encourage the king when the latter gains insights on his ownFor example theres the famous discourse where Pasenadi comes to visit the Buddha in the middle of the dayThe Buddha asks him what hes been doing and the king replies  in a moment of rare and wonderful frankness  that hes been involved in the sort of activities typical of a king intoxicated with his powerThe Buddha takes this moment of frankness as an opportunity to teach the DhammaSuppose he says that four mountains were rolling in inexorably from the four directions crushing all life in their pathGiven that the human birth is so rare and hard to achieve what should be doneThe kings reply What else should be done but living in line with the DhammaThe Buddha then draws the lesson Aging and death are rolling in inexorablyGiven that the human birth is so rare and hard to achieve what should be doneThe king draws the obvious conclusion that again the only thing to be done is to live in line with the DhammaHe then goes on to make the observation that when aging and death are rolling in inexorably there is no role for armies wars clever advisors or great wealth to prevent their rolling inThe only thing to do is to live in line with the DhammaIn another discourse Pasenadi comes to the Buddha and reports his own independent observationThose who engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct leave themselves unprotectedEven though a squadron of elephant troops might protect them a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they leave themselves unprotectedWhy is thatBecause thats an external protection not an internal oneTherefore they leave themselves unprotectedBut those who engage in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct have themselves protectedEven though neither a squadron of elephant troops a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops nor a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they have themselves protectedWhy is thatBecause thats an internal protection not an external oneTherefore they have themselves protectedIts highly unlikely that Pasenadi would have come to this conclusion if he hadnt spent time in conversation with the BuddhaFrom that conversation he would have learned the meaning of good bodily verbal and mental conduct the ten forms of skillful actionAs a tactful teacher the Buddha simply concurred with the kings insightThe discourses suggest that this strategy encouraged the king to spend time in reflection of this sort for in other discourses the king reports many similar insights for the Buddha to confirmWe learn that the king did not always follow through with his insights but thats not because the Buddha encouraged him to view killing as his dutyIn fact there is one striking example where these insights had at least a partial effectAjatasattu once attacked Pasenadis kingdom and Pasenadi responded by raising an army to fight him offAfter an initial setback Pasenadi was able to capture AjatasattuHe could have killed him in revenge for that was allowable under the rules of engagement during his timeBut he chose not to and its hard not to see the Buddhas impact on this decisionWhen told of the battle the Buddha saidBenighted as he was Pasenadi still got the messageThe question is why cant weAn anthropologist once questioned an Alaskan shaman about his tribes belief systemAfter putting up with the anthropologists questions for a while the shaman finally told him LookWe dont believeWe fearHis words have intrigued me ever since I first heard themIve also been intrigued by the responses I get when I share his words with my friendsSome say that the shaman unconsciously put his finger on the line separating primitive religion from civilized religion primitive religion is founded on childish fear civilized religion on love trust and joyOthers maintain that the shaman cut through the pretensions and denials of civilized religion and pointed to the true source of all serious religious lifeIf we dig down to the assumptions underlying these two responses we find that the first response views fear itself as our greatest weaknessIf we can simply overcome fear we put ourselves in a position of strengthThe second sees fear as the most honest response to our greater weakness in the face of aging illness and death  a weakness that cant be overcome with a simple change in attitudeIf were not in touch with our honest fears we wont feel motivated to do whats needed to protect ourselves from genuine dangersSo  which attitude toward fear is childish and which is matureIs there an element of truth in bothIf so how can those elements best be combinedThese questions are best answered by rephrasing them To what extent is fear a useful emotionTo what extent is it notDoes it have a role in the practice that puts an end to fearThe Buddhist answer to these questions is complexThis is due partly to Buddhisms dual roots  both as a civilized and as a wilderness tradition  and also to the complexity of fear itself even in its most primal formsThink of a deer at night suddenly caught in a hunters headlightsIts confusedAngryIt senses danger and that its weak in the face of the dangerIt wants to escapeThese five elements  confusion aversion a sense of danger a sense of weakness and a desire to escape  are present to a greater or lesser extent in every fearThe confusion and aversion are the unskillful elementsEven if the deer has many openings to escape from the hunter its confusion and aversion might cause it to miss themThe same holds true for human beingsThe mistakes and evils we commit when finding ourselves weak in the face of danger come from confusion and aversionMaddeningly however there are also evils that we commit out of complacency when oblivious to actual dangers the callous things we do when we feel we can get away with themThus the last three elements of fear  the perception of weakness the perception of danger and the desire to escape it  are needed to avoid the evils coming from complacencyIf stripped of confusion and aversion these three elements become a positive quality heedfulness  something so essential to the practice that the Buddha devoted his last words to itThe dangers of life are realOur weaknesses are realIf we dont see them clearly dont take them to heart and dont try to find a way out theres no way we can put an end to the causes of our fearsJust like the deer if its complacent about the hunters headlights its going to end up strapped to the fender for sureSo to genuinely free the mind from fear we cant simply deny that theres any reason for fearWe have to overcome the cause of fear the minds weaknesses in the face of very real dangersThe elegance of the Buddhas approach to this problem though lies in his insight into the confusion  or to use the standard Buddhist term the delusion  that makes fear unskillfulDespite the complexity of fear delusion is the single factor that in itself is both the minds prime weakness and its greatest dangerThus the Buddha approaches the problem of fear by focusing on delusion and he attacks delusion in two ways getting us to think about its dangerous role in making fear unskillful and getting us to develop inner strengths leading to the insights that free the mind from the delusions that make it weakIn this way we not only overcome the factor that makes fear unskillfulWe ultimately put the mind in a position where it has no need for fearWhen we think about how delusion infects fear and incites us to do unskillful things we see that it can act in two waysFirst the delusions surrounding our fears can cause us to misapprehend the dangers we face seeing danger where there is none and no danger where there isIf we obsess over nonexistent or trivial dangers well squander time and energy building up useless defenses diverting our attention from genuine threatsIf on the other hand we put the genuine dangers of aging illness and death out of our minds we grow complacent in our actionsWe let ourselves cling to things  our bodies our loved ones our possessions our views  that leave us exposed to aging illness separation and death in the first placeWe allow our cravings to take charge of the mind sometimes to the point of doing evil with impunity thinking were immune to the results of our evil that those results will never return to harm usThe more complacent we are about the genuine dangers lying in wait all around us the more shocked and confused we become when they actually hitThis leads to the second way in which the delusions surrounding our fears promote unskillful actions we react to genuine dangers in ways that instead of ending the dangers actually create new onesWe amass wealth to provide security but wealth creates a high profile that excites jealousy in othersWe build walls to keep out dangerous people but those walls become our prisonsWe stockpile weapons but they can easily be turned against usThe most unskillful response to fear is when perceiving dangers to our own life or property we believe that we can gain strength and security by destroying the lives and property of othersThe delusion pervading our fear makes us lose perspectiveIf other people were to act in this way we would know they were wrongBut somehow when we feel threatened our standards change our perspective warps so that wrong seems right as long as were the ones doing itThis is probably the most disconcerting human weakness of all our inability to trust ourselves to do the right thing when the chips are downIf standards of right and wrong are meaningful only when we find them convenient they have no real meaning at allFortunately though the area of life posing the most danger and insecurity is the area where through training we can make the most changes and exercise the most controlAlthough aging illness and death follow inevitably on birth delusion doesntIt can be preventedIf through thought and contemplation we become heedful of the dangers it poses we can feel motivated to overcome itHowever the insights coming from simple thought and contemplation arent enough to fully understand and overthrow delusionIts the same as with any revolution no matter how much you may think about the matter you dont really know the tricks and strengths of entrenched powers until you amass your own troops and do battle with themAnd only when your own troops develop their own tricks and strengths can they come out on topSo it is with delusion only when you develop mental strengths can you see through the delusions that give fear its powerBeyond that these strengths can put you in a position where you are no longer exposed to dangers ever againThe Canon lists these mental strengths at five conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernmentIt also emphasizes the role that heedfulness plays in developing each for heedfulness is what enables each strength to counteract a particular delusion that makes fear unskillful and the mind weak in the face of its fearsWhat this means is that none of these strengths are mere brute forcesEach contains an element of wisdom and discernment which gets more penetrating as you progress along the listOf the five strengths conviction requires the longest explanation both because its one of the most misunderstood and underappreciated factors in the Buddhist path and because of the multiple delusions it has to counteractThe conviction here is conviction in the principle of karma that the pleasure and pain we experience depends on the quality of the intentions on which we actThis conviction counteracts the delusion that Its not in my best interest to stick to moral principles in the face of danger and it attacks this delusion in three waysFirst it insists on what might be called the boomerang or spitting into the wind principle of karmic cause and effectIf you act on harmful intentions regardless of the situation the harm will come back to youEven if unskillful actions such as killing stealing or lying might bring shortterm advantages these are more than offset by the longterm harm to which they leave you exposedConversely this same principle can make us brave in doing goodIf were convinced that the results of skillful intentions will have to return to us even if death intervenes we can more easily make the sacrifices demanded by longterm endeavors for our own good and that of othersWhether or not we live to see the results in this lifetime were convinced that the good we do is never lostIn this way we develop the courage needed to build a store of skillful actions  generous and virtuous  that forms our first line of defense against dangers and fearSecond conviction insists on giving priority to your state of mind above all else for thats what shapes your intentionsThis counteracts the corollary to the first delusion What if sticking to my principles makes it easier for people to do me harm This question is based ultimately on the delusion that life is our most precious possessionIf that were true it would be a pretty miserable possession for it heads inexorably to deathConviction views our life as precious only to the extent that its used to develop the mind for the mind  when developed  is something that no one not even death can harmQuality of life is measured by the quality and integrity of the intentions on which we act just as quality time is time devoted to the practiceOr in the Buddhas wordsThird conviction insists that the need for integrity is unconditionalEven though other people may throw away their most valuable possession  their integrity  its no excuse for us to throw away oursThe principle of karma isnt a traffic ordinance in effect only on certain hours of the day or certain days of the weekIts a law operating around the clock around the cycles of the cosmosSome people have argued that because the Buddha recognized the principle of conditionality he would have no problem with the idea that our virtues should depend on conditions as wellThis is a misunderstanding of the principleTo begin with conditionality doesnt simply mean that everything is changeable and contingentIts like the theory of relativityRelativity doesnt mean that all things are relativeIt simply replaces mass and time  which long were considered constants  with another unexpected constant the speed of lightMass and time may be relative to a particular inertial frame as the frame relates to the speed of light but the laws of physics are constant for all inertial frames regardless of speedIn the same way conditionality means that there are certain unchanging patterns to contingency and change  one of those patterns being that unskillful intentions based on craving and delusion invariably lead to unpleasant resultsIf we learn to accept this pattern rather than our feelings and opinions as absolute it requires us to become more ingenious in dealing with dangerInstead of following our unskillful kneejerk reactions we learn to think outside the box to find responses that best prevent harm of any kindThis gives our actions added precision and graceAt the same time we have to note that the Buddha didnt teach conditionality simply to encourage acceptance for the inevitability of changeHe taught it to show how the patterns underlying change can be mastered to create an opening that leads beyond conditionality and changeIf we want to reach the unconditioned  the truest security  our integrity has to be unconditional a gift of temporal security not only to those who treat us well but to everyone without exceptionAs the texts say when you abstain absolutely from doing harm you give a great gift  freedom from danger to limitless beings  and you yourself find a share in that limitless freedom as wellConviction and integrity of this sort make great demands on usUntil we gain our first taste of the unconditioned they can easily be shakenThis is why they have to be augmented with other mental strengthsThe three middle strengths  persistence mindfulness and concentration  act in concertPersistence in the form of right effort counteracts the delusion that were no match for our fears that once they arise we have to give into themRight effort gives us practice in eliminating milder unskillful qualities and developing skillful ones in their place so that when stronger unskillful qualities arise we can use our skillful qualities as allies in fending them offThe strength of mindfulness assists this process in two waysIt reminds us of the danger of giving in to fearIt teaches us to focus our attention not on the object of our fear but on the fear in and of itself as a mental event something we can watch from the outside rather jumping in and going along for a rideThe strength of concentration in providing the mind with a still center of wellbeing puts us in a solid position where we dont feel compelled to identify with fears as they come and where the comings and goings of internal and external dangers are less and less threatening to the mindEven then though the mind cant reach ultimate security until it uproots the causes of these comings and goings which is why the first four strengths require the strength of discernment to make them fully secureDiscernment is what sees that these comings and goings are ultimately rooted in our sense of I and mine and that I and mine are not built into experienceThey come from the repeated processes of Imaking and mymaking in which we impose these notions on experience and identify with things subject to aging illness and deathFurthermore discernment sees through our inner traitors and weaknesses the cravings that want us to make an I and mine the delusions that make us believe in them once theyre madeIt realizes that this level of delusion is precisely the factor that makes aging illness and death dangerous to begin withIf we didnt identify with things that age grow ill and die their aging illness and death wouldnt threaten the mindTotally unthreatened the mind would have no reason to do anything unskillful ever againWhen this level of discernment matures and bears the fruit of release our greatest insecurity  our inability to trust ourselves  has been eliminatedFreed from the attachments of I and mine we find that the component factors of fear  both skillful and unskillful  are goneTheres no remaining confusion or aversion the mind is no longer weak in the face of danger and so theres nothing from which we need to escapeThis is where the questions raised by the shamans remarks find their answersWe fear because we believe in we We believe in we because of the delusion in our fearParadoxically though if we love ourselves enough to fear the suffering that comes from unskillful actions and attachments and learn to believe in the way out well develop the strengths that allow us to cut through our cravings delusions and attachmentsThat way the entire complex  the we the fear the beliefs the attachments  dissolves awayThe freedom remaining is the only true security there isThis teaching may offer cold comfort to anyone who wants the impossible security for his or her attachmentsBut in trading away the hope for an impossible security you gain the reality of a happiness totally independent and conditionfreeOnce youve made this trade you know that the payoff is more than worth the priceAs one of the Buddhas students once reported Before when I was a householder maintaining the bliss of kingship I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments within and without the city within and without the countrysideBut even though I was thus guarded thus protected I dwelled in fear  agitated distrustful and afraidBut now on going alone to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling I dwell without fear unagitated confident and unafraid  unconcerned unruffled my wants satisfied with my mind like a wild deerThis is the meaning I have in mind that I repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat bliss His deer is obviously not the deer in the headlightsIts a deer safe in the wilderness at its ease wherever it goesWhat makes it more than a deer is that free from attachment its called a consciousness without surface Light goes right through itThe hunter cant shoot it for it cant be seenWhat is the mindThe mind isnt is anything Ajaan ChahThe mind is neither good nor evil but its what knows good and knows evilIts what does good and does evilAnd its what lets go of good and lets go of evil Ajaan LeeA brahman once asked the Buddha Will all the world reach release or half the world or a third But the Buddha didnt answerVenAnanda concerned that the brahman might misconstrue the Buddhas silence took the man aside and gave him an analogy Imagine a fortress with a single gateA wise gatekeeper would walk around the fortress and not see an opening in the wall big enough for even a cat to slip throughBecause hes wise he would realize that his knowledge didnt tell him how many people would come into the fortress but it did tell him that whoever came into the fortress would have to come in through the gateIn the same way the Buddha didnt focus on how many people would reach Awakening but he did know that anyone who reached Awakening would have to follow the path he had found abandoning the five hindrances establishing the four frames of reference and developing the seven factors for AwakeningWhats striking about the Buddhas knowledge is the implied if If people want to gain Awakening they will have to follow this path but the choice as to whether they want Awakening is theirsThe Buddhas knowledge of the future didnt mean that the future was preordained for people are free to chooseThey can take up a particular course of action and stick with it or not as they see fitThe Buddha thus based all his teaching on freedom of choiceAs he said if everything were predetermined by the past there would be no point in teaching a path to AwakeningThe number of people who would reach Awakening would already have been set a long time ago and they would have no need for a path or a teacherThose preordained to awaken would get there inevitably as a result of a longpast action or an essential nature already built into the mindThose preordained not to awaken wouldnt stand a chanceBut these things are not preordainedNo one is doomed never to awaken but  until youve had your first sight of the deathless at streamentry  neither is Awakening assuredIts contingent on intentional actions chosen in each present momentAnd even after streamentry youre constantly faced with choices that will speed up final Awakening or slow it downNibbana of course is independent and unconditioned but the act of awakening to nibbana depends on a path of practice that has to be willedIt happens only if you choose to give rise to its causesThis as the Buddha noted involves determining to do four things not to neglect discernment to preserve truth to develop relinquishment and to train for peaceTo stick with these four determinations the mind has to make some assumptions about itself its power to do the necessary work and to receive the anticipated benefitsBut one of the central features of the Buddhas strategy as a teacher was that even though his primary focus was on the mind he nowhere defined what the mind isAs he said if you define yourself you limit yourselfSo instead he focused his assumptions on what the mind can doTo begin with the mind can change quicklyNormally a master of the apt simile even the Buddha had to admit that he could find no adequate analogy for how quickly the mind can changeWe might say that it can change in the twinkling of an eye but its actually faster than thatAnd its capable of all sorts of thingsNeither inherently good nor inherently bad it can do a huge variety of good and bad actionsAs the Buddha said the mind is more variegated than the animal kingdomThink of the many species of fish in the sea birds in the sky animals on the land and under the ground whether extant or extinct All of these species are products of minds and the mind can take on a wider variety of forms than even thatThis variety comes from the many different choices the mind makes under the influence of ignorance and defilementBut the mind doesnt always have to be defiledPast kamma is not entirely deterministicEven though past kamma shapes the range of options open to the mind in the present it doesnt have to determine present kamma  the intentions by which the mind chooses to fabricate actual experiences from among those optionsThus present kamma can choose to continue creating the conditions for more ignorance or not because present choices are what keep ignorance aliveAlthough no one  not even a Buddha  can trace back to when the defilement of ignorance first began the continued existence of ignorance depends on conditions continually provided by unskillful kammaIf these conditions are removed ignorance will disbandThis is why the Buddha said that the mind is luminous stained with defilements that come and goTaken out of context this statement might be construed as implying that the mind is inherently awakenedBut in context the Buddha is simply saying that the mind once stained is not permanently stainedWhen the conditions for the stains are gone the mind becomes luminous againBut this luminosity is not an awakened natureAs the Buddha states this luminous mind can be developedIn the scheme of the four noble truths if something is to be developed its not the goal its part of the path to the goalAfter this luminosity has been developed in the advanced stages of concentration its abandoned once it has completed its work in helping to pierce through ignoranceThe fact that the minds own choices can pierce its own ignorance underlies the Buddhas most important assumption about the mind It can be trained to awaken to see the causes of ignorance and to bring them to an endThe primary step in this training is the first determination not to neglect discernmentThis phrase may sound strange  to what extent do we consciously neglect discernment but it points to an important truthDiscernment is insight into how the mind fabricates its experiencesThis process of fabrication is going on all the time right before our eyes  even nearer than our eyes  and yet part of the mind chooses to ignore itWe tend to be more interested in the experiences that result from the fabrication the physical mental and emotional states we want to savor and enjoyIts like watching a playWe enjoy entering into the makebelieve world on the stage and prefer to ignore the noises made by the backstage crew that would call the reality of that world into questionThis ignorance is willed which is why we need an act of the will to see through it to discern the backstage machinations of the mindDiscernment thus has two sides understanding and motivationYou have to understand the minds fabrications as fabrications looking less for the what  ie what they are  than for the how  how they happen as part of a causal processAnd you have to be motivated to develop this discernment to see why you want it to influence the mindOtherwise it wont have the conditions to growThe understanding comes down to the basic insight of the Buddhas Awakening seeing things as actions and events in a pattern of cause and effectIt also involves seeing how some actions are unskillful leading to stress and suffering while others are skillful bringing stress to an end and that we have the freedom to choose skillful actions or notThis understanding  which forms the basic framework of the four noble truths  is called appropriate attentionThe motivation to develop appropriate attention grows from combining good will with this understandingYou set your sights on a happiness totally harmlessYou see that if you make unskillful choices youre going to cause suffering if you make skillful ones you wontThis motivation thus combines good will with heedfulness the quality that underlies every step on the pathIn fact heedfulness lies at the root of all skillful qualities in the mindThus in encouraging people to awaken the Buddha never assumed that their Awakening would come from the innate goodness of their natureHe simply assumed something very blatant and ordinary that people like pleasure and hate pain and that they care about whether they can gain that pleasure and avoid that painIt was a mark of his genius that he could see the potential for Awakening in this very common desireWhen you stick with the understanding and motivation provided by this first determination it sets in motion the other threeFor instance the determination to preserve the truth grows from seeing the minds capacity to lie to itself about whether its actions are causing sufferingYou want to be honest and vigilant in looking for and admitting suffering even when youre attached to the actions that cause itThis truthfulness relates to the path in two stages first when looking for unskillful actions that keep you off the path and then as the path nears fruition looking for the subtle levels of stress caused even by skillful elements of the path  such as right concentration  once they have done their work and need to be let go for the sake of full liberationThe determination to develop relinquishment can then build on this truthful assessment of what needs to be doneRelinquishment requires discernment as well for not only do you need to see whats skillful and whats not you also need to keep reminding yourself that you have the freedom to choose and to be adept at talking yourself into doing skillful things youre afraid of and abandoning unskillful actions you likeThe determination to train for peace helps maintain your sense of direction in this process for it reminds you that the only true happiness is peace of mind and that you want to look for everincreasing levels of peace as they become possible through the practiceThis determination emulates the trait that the Buddha said was essential to his Awakening the unwillingness to rest content with lesser levels of stillness when higher levels could be attainedIn this way the stages of concentration instead of becoming obstacles or dangers on the path serve as steppingstones to greater sensitivity and through that sensitivity to the ultimate peace where all passion aversion and delusion grow stillThis peace thus grows from the simple choice to keep looking at the minds fabrications as processes as actions and resultsBut to fully achieve this peace your discernment has to be directed not only at the minds fabrication of the objects of its awareness but also at its fabrications about itself and about the path its creatingYour sense of who you are is a fabrication regardless of whether you see the mind as separate or interconnected finite or infinite good or badThe path is also a fabrication very subtle and sometimes seemingly effortless but fabricated nonethelessIf these layers of inner fabrication arent seen for what they are  if you regard them as innate or inevitable  they cant be deconstructed and full Awakening cant occurThis is why the Buddha never advocated attributing an innate nature of any kind to the mind  good bad or BuddhaThe idea of innate natures slipped into the Buddhist tradition in later centuries when the principle of freedom was forgottenPast bad kamma was seen as so totally deterministic that there seemed no way around it unless you assumed either an innate Buddha in the mind that could overpower it or an external Buddha who would save you from itBut when you understand the principle of freedom  that past kamma doesnt totally shape the present and that present kamma can always be free to choose the skillful alternative  you realize that the idea of innate natures is unnecessary excess baggage on the pathAnd it bogs you downIf you assume that the mind is basically bad you wont feel capable of following the path and will tend to look for outside help to do the work for youIf you assume that the mind is basically good youll feel capable but will easily get complacentThis stands in the way of the heedfulness needed to get you on the path and to keep you there when the path creates states of relative peace and ease that seem so trustworthy and realIf you assume a Buddha nature you not only risk complacency but you also entangle yourself in metaphysical thorn patches If something with an awakened nature can suffer what good is itHow could something innately awakened become defiledIf your original Buddha nature became deluded whats to prevent it from becoming deluded after its reawakenedThese points become especially important as you reach the subtle levels of fabrication on the more advanced stages of the pathIf youre primed to look for innate natures youll tend to see innate natures especially when you reach the luminous nondual stages of concentration called themeless emptiness and undirectedYoull get stuck on whichever stage matches your assumptions about what your awakened nature isBut if youre primed to look for the process of fabrication youll see these stages as forms of fabrication and this will enable you to deconstruct them to pacify them until you encounter the peace thats not fabricated at allSo instead of making assumptions about innate natures or inevitable outcomes the Buddha advised exploring the possibility of freedom as its immediately present each time you make a choiceFreedom is not a nature and you dont find it by looking for your hidden innate natureYou find freedom by looking at where its constantly showing itself in the fact that your present intentions are not totally conditioned by the pastYou catch your first glimmer of it as a range of possibilities from which you can choose and as your ability to act more skillfully  causing more pleasure and less pain  than you ordinarily mightYour sense of this freedom grows as you explore and exercise it each time you choose the most skillful course of action heading in the direction of discernment truthfulness relinquishment and peaceThe choice to keep making skillful choices may require assumptions but to keep the mind focused on the issue of fabrication the Buddha saw that these assumptions are best kept to a bare minimum that the mind wants happiness that it can choose courses of actions that promote happiness or thwart it that it can change its ways and that it can train itself to achieve the ultimate happiness where all fabrications fall awayThese assumptions are the Buddhas starter kit of skillful means to get you on the path of good will heedfulness and appropriate attentionAs with any journey you do best to take along only the bare essentials so that you dont weigh yourself downThis is especially true as you test the limits of freedom for the closer you come to ultimate freedom the more you find that things fall awayFirst the nouns of natures and identities fall away as you focus on the verbs of action and choiceThen the verbs fall away tooWhen the Buddha was asked who or what he was he didnt answer with a who or whatHe said simply Awakened a past participle a verb that has done its workSimilarly when the suttas describe the Awakening of an arahant they say that his or her mind is released from fermentationsBut when they describe how this release is experienced they simply say With release there is the knowledge Released No comment on what is releasedNot even as its sometimes translated It is released Theres no noun no pronoun just a past participle released Thats all but its enoughThe Buddha never used the word for bare attention in his meditation instructionsThats because he realized that attention never occurs in a bare pure or unconditioned formIts always colored by views and perceptions  the labels you tend to give to events  and by intentions your choice of what to attend to and your purpose in being attentiveIf you dont understand the conditioned nature of even simple acts of attention you might assume that a moment of nonreactive attention is a moment of AwakeningAnd in that way you miss one of the most crucial insights in Buddhist meditation how even the simplest events in the mind can form a condition for clinging and sufferingIf you assume a conditioned event to be unconditioned you close the door to the unconditionedSo its important to understand the conditioned nature of attention and the Buddhas recommendations for how to train it  as appropriate attention  to be a factor in the path leading beyond attention to total AwakeningThe Pali term for attention is manasikaraYou may have heard that the term for mindfulness  sati  means attention but thats not how the Buddha used the termMindfulness in his usage means keeping something in mindIts a function of memoryWhen you practice the establishings of mindfulness you remain focused on observing the object youve chosen as your frame of reference the body feelings mind or mental qualities in and of themselvesThis is called anupassanaMindfulness is one of three qualities you bring to anupassanaIts function is to keep your frame of reference in mind to keep remembering itAt the same time you have to be alert clearly aware of what youre doing to make sure that youre actually doing what youre trying to remember to do and ardent to do it skillfullyThe act of establishing mindfulness in this way  by being mindful alert and ardent  then forms the topic or theme of right concentrationFor instance if you focus on the breath in and of itself as your frame of reference anupassana means keeping continual watch over the breathMindfulness means simply remembering to stick with it keeping it in mind at all times whereas alertness means knowing what the breath is doing and how well youre staying with itArdency is the effort to do all of this skillfullyWhen all these activities stay fully coordinated they form the theme of your concentrationTo understand how appropriate attention functions in the context of this training though you first have to understand how attention ordinarily functions in an untrained mindIn the teaching on dependent coarising  the Buddhas explanation of how events interact to create the conditions for suffering  attention appears early in the sequence in the factor for mental events called name where it comes even prior to the sense media and sensory contactBut its not the first item in the listIt follows on ignorance fabrication and consciousnessIgnorance here doesnt mean a general lack of knowledgeIt means not viewing experience in terms of the four noble truths stress its cause its cessation and the path to its cessationAny other framework for viewing experience no matter how sophisticated would qualify as ignoranceTypical examples given in the Canon include seeing things through the framework of self and other or of existence and nonexistence What am IWhat am I notDo I existDo I not existDo things outside me existDo they notThese ignorant ways of seeing then condition the way we intentionally fabricate or manipulate bodily verbal and mental statesThe breath is the primary means for fabricating bodily states and practical experience shows that  in giving rise to feelings of comfort or discomfort  it has an impact on mental states as wellWhen colored by ignorance even your breathing can act as a cause of sufferingAs for verbal states directed thought and evaluation are the means for fabricating words and sentences whereas mental states are fabricated by feelings  pleasure pain neitherpleasurenorpain  and perceptions  the labels we apply to thingsSensory consciousness is colored by these fabricationsAnd then  based on the conditions of ignorance fabrication and sensory consciousness  the act of attention arises as one of a cluster of mental and physical events called name and formAs if the preconditions for attention werent already complex enough the coconditions in name and form add another level of complexityForm means of the form of the body  as experienced from within as properties of earth water wind and fire and as shaped by the activity of breathingName includes not only attention but also intention again feeling and perception again and contact which here apparently means contact among all the factors already listedAll of these conditions acting together under the influence of ignorance are what ordinarily color every act of attention to any of the six senses sight hearing smell taste the tactile sense and the sense of the mind that knows mental qualities and ideasEven before were aware of contact at the senses conditions in the mind are primed to create suffering and stress from that contactSo how can attention be trained in the other directionObviously it should be freed from the conditions of ignorance but that doesnt mean that it should  or even can  be freed from conditions entirelyAfter all that would require an act of will and that act of will would have to be formed by a correct and pragmatic understanding of suffering and its causesAlso that act of will and that understanding would have to be borne in mind continually so that attention could be effectively retrainedSo instead of being stripped from all conditions attention requires this new set of conditions to make it appropriateThis is why the Buddha said that the factors of the path corresponding to understanding will and memory  right view right effort and right mindfulness  hover around every step of the pathRight view provides the ability to see things in terms of the four noble truths right effort activates the desire and intent to act skillfully on those views while right mindfulness provides a solid basis for keeping that view and that effort in mindOf these three factors of the path right view comes first for its the direct antidote for the primary condition of ignoranceRight view is not simply knowledge about the four noble truths it sees things in terms of those truthsIn other words for a person aiming at the end of suffering and stress it points out the four salient factors to look for in any given momentAt the same time it sees the tasks or duties appropriate to each factor Stress is to be comprehended its cause abandoned its cessation realized and the path to its cessation developedAs the Buddha noted in his first sermon this knowledge of the appropriate tasks for each truth comes in two stagesThe first stage identifies the taskThe second realizes that it has been completedThis second stage is the knowledge of AwakeningBetween the first and the second lies the practice  which because it involves mastering the skills of each task has to be gradualThats why its called a pathAs with the development of any skill the path has its inevitable ups and downsIn other words the practice is marked by alternating periods of ignorance and knowledge with the knowledge gradually growing stronger and more refinedDuring these periods of knowledge the act of attention is informed by an understanding of suffering and its causesIt is also motivated by intentions  expressed through the way you relate to your breath your mental activity of directed thought and evaluation and your perceptions and feelings  that aim at bringing suffering to an endThis combination of wise understanding and compassionate intention is what turns the act of attention from a cause of suffering into a strategy for health a healing attentionThis healing attention is called appropriate because it looks at things in ways appropriate for advancing the tasks of the noble truths focusing on whichever task needs to be advanced at any particular momentFor instance when attention needs to be focused on comprehending suffering the role of appropriate attention is to view the aggregates  the components of our sense of self  in such a way as to induce dispassion for themTo attend to the aggregates in this way helps to advance the task of abandoning any craving for the aggregates that causes sufferingWhen attention needs to be focused on developing the path the role of appropriate attention is to feed the factors for Awakening and to starve the five hindrances that stand in their wayHere is where appropriate attention applies to the practice of establishing mindfulness in that mindfulness solidly established is the first factor for AwakeningThus one of the first roles of appropriate attention is to feed the development of mindfulnessThe image of feeding and starving here is directly related to the insight into conditionality that formed the essential message of the Buddhas AwakeningIn fact when he introduced the topic of conditionality to young novices he illustrated it with the act of feeding All beings he said subsist on foodIf their existence depends on eating then it ends when they are deprived of foodApplying this analogy to the problem of suffering leads to the conclusion that if suffering depends on conditions it can be brought to an end by starving it of its conditionsIn its most sophisticated expression though the Buddhas insight into causality implies that each moment is composed of three types of factors results of past intentions present intentions and the results of present intentionsBecause many past intentions can have an impact on any given moment this means that there can be many potential influences from the past  helpful or harmful  appearing in the body or mind at any given timeThe role of appropriate attention is to focus on whichever influence is potentially most helpful and to look at it in such a way as to promote skillful intentions in the presentThe Food Discourse indicates how appropriate attention can be applied to the potentials of the present to starve the hindrances and feed the factors for AwakeningWith regard to the hindrances it notes thatIn short each hindrance is starved by shifting both the focus and the quality of your attentionHowever with the factors for Awakening  mindfulness analysis of qualities persistence rapture serenity concentration and equanimity  the process of feeding consists primarily of changing the quality of your attentionThe discourse lists each factor with its potential basis saying that the factor is starved by inappropriate attention to that basis and fed by appropriate attention to the basisWith one exception the discourse doesnt say what each basis isApparently the purpose of this is to challenge the meditatorOnce youve received instructions in mindfulness and concentration you should try to identify in your own experience what the potential basis for each factor of Awakening isThe one exception however is illuminatingThe basis for the second factor for Awakening  analysis of mental qualities  is the presence of skillful and unskillful qualities in the mindTo pay appropriate attention to these qualities not only feeds the factor of analysis of mental qualities but also starves the hindrance of uncertainty at the same time providing the framework for identifying for yourself the bases for each of the remaining factors for AwakeningOf these factors equanimity is the closest to what is sometimes described as bare attention or nonreactive awarenessBut even equanimity is conditioned by views and intentionsFor instance the Buddha points out in MN that when encountering unskillful qualities in the mind youll observe that some of them go away only through concerted effort in other cases nothing more is required than onlooking equanimityBut even this equanimity is conditioned by an understanding of skillful and unskillful and is motivated to make the unskillful go awayIn fact equanimity has many levels and a crucial insight on the higher level of practice is to see that even the equanimity of refined jhanic states  in which awareness and its object seem totally one  is a fabrication conditioned and willedOn gaining this insight the mind inclines toward what is called nonfashioning in which you add nothing at all to the data of sensory experienceThe move from equanimity to nonfashioning is briefly described in a famous passageThen Bahiya you should train yourself thus In reference to the seen there will be only the seenIn reference to the heard only the heardIn reference to the sensed only the sensedIn reference to the cognized only the cognizedThat is how you should train yourselfWhen for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen only the heard in reference to the heard only the sensed in reference to the sensed only the cognized in reference to the cognized then Bahiya theres no you in thatWhen theres no you in that theres no you thereWhen theres no you there you are neither here nor yonder nor between the twoThis just this is the end of stressOn the surface these instructions might seem to be describing bare attention but a closer look shows that something more is going onTo begin with the instructions come in two parts advice on how to train attention and a promise of the results that will come from training attention in that wayIn other words the training is still operating on the conditioned level of cause and effectIts something to be doneThis means its shaped by an intention which in turn is shaped by a viewThe intention and view are informed by the result part of the passage The meditator wants to attain the end of stress and suffering and so is willing to follow the path to that endThus as with every other level of appropriate attention the attention developed here is conditioned by right view  the knowledge that your present intentions are ultimately the source of stress  and motivated by the desire to put an end to that stressThis is why you make the effort not to add anything at all to the potentials coming from the pastThe need for right view would seem to be belied by the circumstances surrounding these instructionsAfter all these are the first instructions Bahiya receives from the Buddha and he attains Awakening immediately afterward so they would appear to be complete in and of themselvesHowever in the leadup to this passage Bahiya is portrayed as unusually heedful and motivated to practiceHe already knows that Awakening is attained by doing and the instructions come in response to his request for a teaching that will show him what to do now for his longterm welfare and happiness  a question that MN identifies as the foundation for wisdom and discernmentSo his attitude contains all the seeds for right view and right intentionBecause he was wise  the Buddha later praised him as the foremost of his disciples in terms of the quickness of his discernment  he was able to bring those seeds to fruition immediatelyA verse from SN which the Buddha says expresses the meaning of the instructions to Bahiya  throws light on how Bahiya may have developed those seedsNotice two words in this verse mindfulness and dispassionedThe reference to mindfulness underlines the need to continually remind oneself of the intention not to add anything to any potentials from the pastThis again points to the willed nature of the attention being developed hereMN offers an alternative way of expressing this intention at the same time offering further analysis of the stages the mind goes through when it is kept in mindThe intention is this It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to meWhat is what has come to be that I abandon As the Buddha says in that discourse a person who pursues this intention will abandon passion for sights sounds etc and arrive at the equanimity of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionBut if discernment isnt yet sharp enough he or she will simply move the focus of passion from sensory and mental input to the equanimity itself and thus stay fixated on that levelThus the importance of the second word noted above  dispassion  which highlights the fact that passion is the crucial factor normally added to the seen heard sensed and cognized and thus the factor most needing to be undercut in every way possibleSome interpretations of the instructions to Bahiya identify the added factor as a metaphysical view about there being something behind the data of experience but this sort of metaphysical view  even though it can form a basis for passion  is only one of many such basesThe belief that there is something out there that can be grasped and possessed can obviously form a condition for passion but so can the belief that theres nothing there When theres nothing theres nothing to be harmed by giving in to desire an idea that can excuse all kinds of harmful passionsSo the meditator has to be careful not to add any assumptions to the data of experience that would foster passion in any way shape or formAnd this involves more than bare attentionIt requires right view about how passion works and whats necessary to thwart itAs SNand SNindicate our sense of who we are is defined by our passionsEven when we dont consciously think of self  as when were totally immersed in an activity at one with the action  there can be a passion for that oneness with a strong sense of being here being the doing or being the knowing which is identity in a subtle formBut when discernment is sharp enough to see that even this equanimity is fabricated and conditioned something thats done any passion for it can be undercut as wellWhen passion is consistently offered no place to land theres no nucleus for a place of any sort no here no there no nucleus for a sense of identity to be constructed around anything anywhere at allThis explains why the state of nonfashioning is expressed in terms devoid of place When theres no you in that theres no you thereWhen theres no you there you are neither here nor yonder nor between the twoWith the total fading of passion the final intention to undercut passion can thus be droppedWhen its dropped  with no need to replace it with any other  nothing more is constructedThis brings a true opening to the Deathless which lies beyond all conditions  even the conditions of right view mindfulness and appropriate attentionThe extraordinary nature of this experience is indicated by the verse that concludes the discourse on BahiyaWhen the awakened person emerges from this experience and resumes dealing with the conditions of time and space its with a totally new perspectiveBut even then heshe still has use for appropriate attentionAs VenSariputta notes in SNSo its important to understand that theres no such thing as bare attention in the practice of the Buddhas teachingsInstead of trying to create an unconditioned form of attention the practice tries to create a set of skillful conditions to shape and direct the act of attention to make it appropriate truly healing truly leading to the end of suffering and stressOnce these conditions are well developed the Buddha promises that they will serve you well  even past the moment of Awakening all the way to your very last deathThe Buddhas Awakening gave him among other things a new perspective on the uses and limitations of wordsHe had discovered a reality  the Deathless  that no words could describeAt the same time he discovered that the path to Awakening could be described although it involved a new way of seeing and conceptualizing the problem of suffering and stressBecause ordinary concepts were often poor tools for teaching the path he had to invent new concepts and to stretch preexisting words to encompass those concepts so that others could taste Awakening themselvesOne of the new concepts most central to his teaching was that of the khandhas which are most frequently translated into English as aggregates Prior to the Buddha the Pali word khandha had very ordinary meanings A khandha could be a pile a bundle a heap a massIt could also be the trunk of a treeIn his first sermon though the Buddha gave it a new psychological meaning introducing the term clingingkhandhas to summarize his analysis of the truth of stress and sufferingThroughout the remainder of his teaching career he referred to these psychological khandhas time and againTheir importance in his teachings has thus been obvious to every generation of Buddhists ever sinceLess obvious though has been the issue of how they are important How should a meditator make use of the concept of the psychological khandhasWhat questions are they meant to answerThe most common response to these questions is best exemplified by two recent scholarly books devoted to the subjectBoth treat the khandhas as the Buddhas answer to the question What is a person To quote from the jacket of the firstFrom the introduction of the otherThis understanding of the khandhas isnt confined to scholarsAlmost any modern Buddhist meditation teacher would explain the khandhas in a similar wayAnd it isnt a modern innovationIt was first proposed at the beginning of the common era in the commentaries to the early Buddhist canons  both the Theravadin and the Sarvastivadin which formed the basis for Mahayana scholasticismHowever once the commentaries used the khandhas to define what a person is they spawned many of the controversies that have plagued Buddhist thinking ever since If a person is just khandhas then what gets reborn If a person is just khandhas and the khandhas are annihilated on reaching total nibbana then isnt total nibbana the annihilation of the person If a person is khandhas and khandhas are interrelated with other khandhas how can one person enter nibbana without dragging everyone else alongA large part of the history of Buddhist thought has been the story of ingenious but unsuccessful attempts to settle these questionsIts instructive to note though that the Pali canon never quotes the Buddha as trying to answer themIn fact it never quotes him as trying to define what a person is at allInstead it quotes him as saying that to define yourself in any way is to limit yourself and that the question What am I is best ignoredThis suggests that he formulated the concept of the khandhas to answer other different questionsIf as meditators we want to make the best use of this concept we should look at what those original questions were and determine how they apply to our practiceThe canon depicts the Buddha as saying that he taught only two topics suffering and the end of sufferingA survey of the Pali discourses shows him using the concept of the khandhas to answer the primary questions related to those topics What is sufferingHow is it causedWhat can be done to bring those causes to an endThe Buddha introduced the concept of the khandhas in his first sermon in response to the first of these questionsHis short definition of suffering was the five clingingkhandhas This fairly cryptic phrase can be fleshed out by drawing on other passages in the canonThe five khandhas are bundles or piles of form feeling perception fabrications and consciousnessNone of the texts explain why the Buddha used the word khandha to describe these thingsThe meaning of tree trunk may be relevant to the pervasive fire imagery in the canon  nibbana being extinguishing of the fires of passion aversion and delusion  but none of the texts explicitly make this connectionThe common and explicit image is of the khandhas as burdensomeWe can think of them as piles of bricks we carry on our shouldersHowever these piles are best understood not as objects but as activities for an important passage defines them in terms of their functionsForm  which covers physical phenomena of all sorts both within and without the body  wears down or deforms Feeling feels pleasure pain and neither pleasure nor painPerception labels or identifies objectsConsciousness cognizes the six senses along with their objectsOf the five khandhas fabrication is the most complexPassages in the canon define it as intention but it includes a wide variety of activities such as attention evaluation and all the active processes of the mindIt is also the most fundamental khandha for its intentional activity underlies the experience of form feeling etcin the present momentThus intention is an integral part of our experience of all the khandhas  an important point for this means that there is an element of intention in all sufferingThis opens the possibility that suffering can be ended by changing our intentions  or abandoning them entirely  which is precisely the point of the Buddhas teachingsTo understand how this happens we have to look more closely at how suffering arises  or in other words how khandhas become clingingkhandhasWhen khandhas are experienced the process of fabrication normally doesnt simply stop thereIf attention focuses on the khandhas attractive features  beautiful forms pleasant feelings etc it can give rise to passion and delightThis passion and delight can take many forms but the most tenacious is the habitual act of fabricating a sense of me or mine identifying with a particular khandha or claiming possession of itThis sense of me and mine is rarely staticIt roams like an amoeba changing its contours as it changes locationSometimes expansive sometimes contracted it can view itself as identical with a khandha as possessing a khandha as existing within a khandha or as having a khandha existing within itselfAt times feeling finite at other times infinite whatever shape it takes its always unstable and insecure for the khandhas providing its food are simply activities and functions inconstant and insubstantialIn the words of the canon the khandhas are like foam like a mirage like the bubbles formed when rain falls on waterTheyre heavy only because the iron grip of trying to cling to them is burdensomeAs long as were addicted to passion and delight for these activities  as long as we cling to them  were bound to sufferThe Buddhist approach to ending this clinging however is not simply to drop itAs with any addiction the mind has to be gradually weaned awayBefore we can reach the point of no intention where were totally freed from the fabrication of khandhas we have to change our intentions toward the khandhas so as to change their functionsInstead of using them for the purpose of constructing a self we use them for the purpose of creating a path to the end of sufferingInstead of carrying piles of bricks on our shoulders we take them off and lay them along the ground as pavementThe first step in this process is to use the khandhas to construct the factors of the noble eightfold pathFor example Right Concentration we maintain a steady perception focused on an aspect of form such as the breath and use directed thought and evaluation  which count as fabrications  to create feelings of pleasure and refreshment which we spread through the bodyIn the beginning its normal that we experience passion and delight for these feelings and that consciousness follows along in line with themThis helps get us absorbed in mastering the skills of concentrationOnce weve gained the sense of strength and wellbeing that comes from mastering these skills we can proceed to the second step attending to the drawbacks of even the refined khandhas we experience in concentration so as to undercut the passion and delight we might feel for themSuppose that an archer or archers apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great massesIn the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perceptions fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration a void notselfThe various ways of fostering dispassion are also khandhas khandhas of perceptionA standard list includes the following the perception of inconstancy the perception of notself the perception of unattractiveness the perception of drawbacks the perception of abandoning the perception of distaste for every world the perception of the undesirability of all fabricationsOne of the most important of these perceptions is that of notselfWhen the Buddha first introduced the concept of notself in his second sermon he also introduced a way of strengthening its impact with a series of questions based around the khandhasTaking each khandha in turn he asked Is it constant or inconstant InconstantAnd is what is inconstant stressful or pleasurable StressfulAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I am NoThese questions show the complex role the khandhas play in this second step of the pathThe questions themselves are khandhas  of fabrication  and they use the concept of the khandhas to deconstruct any passion and delight that might center on the khandhas and create sufferingThus in this step we use khandhas that point out the drawbacks of the khandhasIf used unskillfully though these perceptions and fabrications can simply replace passion with its mirror image aversionThis is why they have to be based on the first step  the wellbeing constructed in jhana  and coupled with the third step the perceptions of dispassion and cessation that incline the mind to the deathless This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation UnbindingIn effect these are perceptionkhandhas that point the mind beyond all khandhasThe texts say that this threestep process can lead to one of two resultsIf after undercutting passion and delight for the khandhas the mind contains any residual passion for the perception of the deathless it will attain the third level of Awakening called nonreturnIf passion and delight are entirely eradicated though all clinging is entirely abandoned the intentions that fabricate khandhas are dropped and the mind totally releasedThe bricks of the pavement have turned into a runway and the mind has taken offInto whatThe authors of the discourses seem unwilling to say even to the extent of describing it as a state of existence nonexistence neither or bothAs one of the discourses states the freedom lying beyond the khandhas also lies beyond the realm to which language properly appliesThere is also the very real practical problem that any preconceived notions of that freedom if clung to as a perceptionkhandha could easily act as an obstacle to its attainmentStill there is also the possibility that if properly used such a perceptionkhandha might act as an aid on the pathSo the discourses provide hints in the form of similes referring to total freedom asOther passages mention a consciousness in this freedom  without feature or surface without end luminous all around  lying outside of time and space experienced when the six sense spheres stop functioningIn this it differs from the consciousnesskhandha which depends on the six sense spheres and can be described in such terms as near or far past present or futureConsciousness without feature is thus the awareness of AwakeningAnd the freedom of this awareness carries over even when the awakened person returns to ordinary consciousnessAs the Buddha said of himselfFreed dissociated  released from form the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awarenessFreed dissociated  released from feeling perception fabrications consciousness birth aging death suffering  stress defilement the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awareness This shows again the importance of bringing the right questions to the teachings on the khandhasIf you use them to define what you are as a person you tie yourself down to no purposeThe questions keep piling onBut if you use them to put an end to suffering your questions fall away and youre freeYou never again cling to the khandhas and no longer need to use them to end your selfcreated sufferingAs long as youre still alive you can employ the khandhas as needed for whatever skillful uses you see fitAfter that youre liberated from all uses and needs including the need to find words to describe that freedom to yourself or to anyone elseThe Buddha never placed unconditional demands on anyones faithAnd for anyone from a culture where the dominant religions do place such demands on ones faith this is one of Buddhisms most attractive featuresWe read his famous instructions to the Kalamas in which he advises testing things for oneself and we see it as an invitation to believe or not whatever we likeSome people go so far as to say that faith has no place in the Buddhist tradition that the proper Buddhist attitude is one of skepticismBut even though the Buddha recommends tolerance and a healthy skepticism toward matters of faith he also makes a conditional request about faith If you sincerely want to put an end to suffering  thats the condition  you should take certain things on faith as working hypotheses and then test them through following his path of practiceTheres a hint of this need for faith even in the discourse to the KalamasDont go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought This contemplative is our teacher When you know for yourselves that These mental qualities are skillful these mental qualities are blameless these mental qualities are praised by the wise these mental qualities when adopted  carried out lead to welfare and to happiness  then you should enter  remain in themThe first few phrases in this passage refuting the authority of scripture and tradition are so strikingly empirical that its easy to miss the phrase buried further on asserting that you have to take into account whats praised by the wiseThat phrase is important for it helps to make sense of the Buddhas teachings as a wholeIf he had simply wanted you to trust your own unaided sense of right and wrong why would he have left so many other teachingsSo the Buddhas advice to the Kalamas is balanced Just as you shouldnt give unreserved trust to outside authority you cant give unreserved trust to your own logic and feelings if they go against the genuine wisdom of othersAs other early discourses make clear wise people can be recognized by their words and behavior but the standards for wisdom are clearly measured against the Buddha and his noble disciples people whove already touched awakeningAnd the proper attitude toward those who meet these standards is faithFor a disciple who has conviction in the Teachers message  lives to penetrate it what accords with the Dhamma is this The Blessed One is the Teacher I am a discipleHe is the one who knows not I For a disciple who has conviction in the Teachers message  lives to penetrate it what accords with the Dhamma is this Gladly would I let the flesh  blood in my body dry up leaving just the skin tendons  bones but if I have not attained what can be reached through human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing my persistenceRepeatedly the Buddha stated that faith in a teacher is what leads you to learn from that teacherFaith in the Buddhas own Awakening is a requisite strength for anyone else who wants to attain AwakeningAs it fosters persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment this faith can take you all the way to the deathlessSo theres a tension in the Buddhas recommendations about faith and empiricismIve discussed this point with many Asian Buddhists and few of them find the tension uncomfortableBut Western Buddhists raised in a culture where religion and faith have long been at war with science and empiricism find the tension very disconcertingIn discussing the issue with them over the past several years Ive noticed that they often try to resolve it in the same ways that historically the tension between Christian faith and scientific empiricism has been resolved in our own cultureThree general positions stand out not only because they are the most common but also because they are so clearly WesternConsciously or not they attempt to understand the Buddhas position on faith and empiricism in a way that can be easily mapped onto the modern Western battle lines between religion and scienceThe first interpretation has its roots in the side of Western culture that totally rejects the legitimacy of faithIn this view the Buddha was an embodiment of the Victorian ideal of the heroic agnostic one who eschewed the childish consolations of faith and instead advocated a purely scientific method for training and strengthening ones own mindBecause his method focused entirely on the present moment questions of past and future were totally irrelevant to his messageThus any references to faith in such issues as past karma future rebirth or an unconditioned happiness separate from the immediate input of the senses are later interpolations in the texts which Buddhist agnostics following the Buddhas example should do their best to rejectThe second interpretation has roots in the side of Western culture that has rejected either the specifics of Christian faith or the authority of any organized religion but has appreciated the emotion of faith as an essential requirement for mental healthThis view presents the Buddha as a Romantic hero who appreciated the subjective value of faith in establishing a sense of wholeness within and interconnectedness withoutTolerant and opposed to dogmatism he saw the psychological fact of a living faith as more important than its objectIn other words it doesnt matter where faith is directed as long as its deeply felt and personally nourishingFaith in the Buddhas Awakening means simply believing that he found what worked for himselfThis carries no implications for what will work for youIf you find the teaching on karma and rebirth comforting fine Believe itIf not dontIf you want to include an allpowerful God or a Goddess in your worldview the Buddha wouldnt objectWhats important is that you relate to your faith in a way thats emotionally healing nourishing and empoweringBecause this second interpretation tends to be allembracing it sometimes leads to a third one that encompasses the first twoThis interpretation presents the Buddha as trapped in his historical situationMuch like us he was faced with the issue of finding a meaningful life in light of the worldview of his dayHis views on karma and rebirth were simply assumptions picked up from the crude science of ancient India while his path of practice was an attempt to negotiate a satisfying life within those assumptionsIf he were alive today he would try to reconcile his values with the discoveries of modern science in the same way that some Westerners have done with their faith in monotheismThe underlying assumption of this position is that science is concerned with facts religion with valuesScience provides the hard data to which religion should provide meaningThus each Buddhist would be performing the work of a Buddha by accepting the hard facts that have been scientifically proven for our generation and then searching the Buddhist tradition  as well as other traditions where appropriate  for myths and values to give meaning to those facts and in the process forging a new Buddhism for our timesEach of these three interpretations may make eminent sense from a Western point of view but none of them do justice to what we know of the Buddha or of his teaching on the role of faith and empiricism on the pathAll three are correct in emphasizing the Buddhas unwillingness to force his teachings on other people but  by forcing our own assumptions onto his teachings and actions  they misread what that unwillingness meansHe wasnt an agnostic he had strong reasons for declaring some ideas as worthy of faith and others as not and his teachings on karma rebirth and nirvana broke radically with the dominant worldview of his timeHe was neither a Victorian nor a Romantic hero nor was he a victim of his timesHe was a hero who among other things mastered the issue of faith and empiricism in his own wayBut to appreciate that way we first have to step back from the Western cultural battlefield and look at faith and empiricism in a more basic context simply as processes within the individual mindThere they play their major roles in the psychology of how we decide to actAlthough we like to think that we base our decisions on hard facts we actually use both faith and empiricism in every decision we makeEven in our most empirically based decisions our vision is hampered by our position in timeAs Kierkegaard noted we live forwards but understand backwardsAny hardheaded business entrepreneur will tell you that the future has to be taken on faith no matter how much we know of the pastWhats more were often forced into decisions where theres no time or opportunity to gather enough past facts for an informed choiceAt other times we have too many facts  as when a doctor is faced with many conflicting tests on a patients condition  and we have to go on faith in deciding which facts to focus on and which ones to ignoreHowever faith also plays a deeper role in many of our decisionsAs William James once observed there are two kinds of truths in life those whose validity has nothing to do with our actions and those whose reality depends on what we doTruths of the first sort  truths of the observer  include facts about the behavior of the physical world how atoms form molecules how stars explodeTruths of the second sort  truths of the will  include skills relationships business ventures anything that requires your effort to make it realWith truths of the observer its best to stay skeptical until reasonable evidence is inWith truths of the will though the truth wont happen without your faith in it often in the face of unpromising oddsIf you dont believe that democracy will work in your nation it wontIf you dont believe that becoming a pianist is worthwhile or that you have the makings of a good pianist it wont happenTruths of the will are the ones most relevant to our pursuit of true happinessMany of the most inspiring stories in life are of people who create truths of this sort when a mountain of empirical evidence is against themIn cases like this the truth requires that faith actively discount the immediate factsIf we dig even deeper into the psychology of decisionmaking we run into an area for which no scientific evidence can offer any proof Do we actually act or are actions an illusionAre our acts already predetermined by physical laws or an external intelligence or do we have free willAre the results of our acts illusoryAre causal relationships real or only a fictionEven the most carefully planned scientific experiment could never settle any of these issues and yet once we become aware of them we have to take a stand on them if we want to continue putting any energy into our thoughts words and deedsThese were the areas where the Buddha focused his teachings on empiricism and faithAlthough his first noble truth requires that we observe suffering until we comprehend it we have to take on faith his assertion that the facts we observe about suffering are the most important guide for making decisions moment by moment throughout lifeBecause his third noble truth the cessation of suffering is a truth of the will we have to take it on faith that its a possible goal a worthwhile goal and that were capable of attaining itAnd because the fourth noble truth  the path to the cessation of suffering  is a path of action and skill we have to take it on faith that our actions are real that we have free will and yet that theres a causal pattern to the workings of the mind from which we can learn in mastering that skillAs the Buddha said the path will lead to a direct experience of these truths but only if you bring faith to the practice will you know this for yourselfIn other words faith in the Buddhist context means faith in the ability of your actions to lead to a direct experience of the end of sufferingThe Buddha offered these teachings to people seeking advice on how to find true happinessThats why he was able to avoid any coercion of others His teachings assumed that his listeners were already involved in a searchWhen we understand his views on what it means to search  why people search and what theyre searching for  we can understand his advice on how to use faith and empiricism in a successful searchThe best way to do this is to examine five of his similes illustrating how a search should be conductedThe first simile illustrates search in its most raw and unfocused formTwo strong men have grabbed another man by the arms and are dragging him to a pit of burning embersThe Buddha notes Wouldnt the man twist his body this way and thatThe twisting of his body stands for the way we react to sufferingWe dont bother to ask if our suffering is predetermined or our actions have any hope of successWe simply put up a struggle and do what we can to escapeIts our natural reactionThe Buddha taught that this reaction is twofold Were bewildered  Why is this happening to me  and we search for a way to put an end to the sufferingWhen he stated that all he taught was suffering and the end of suffering he was responding to these two reactions providing an explanation of suffering and its end so as to do away with our bewilderment at the same time showing the way to the end of suffering as a way of satisfying our searchHe had no use for the idea  often advanced by later writers in the Buddhist tradition  that our suffering comes from our struggle to resist suffering that the search for an end to suffering is precisely what keeps us from seeing the peace already thereIn the light of the above simile simply relaxing into a total acceptance of the moment means relaxing into the prospect of being burned aliveThe present keeps morphing into the future and you cant turn a blind eye to where its taking youThis simile also explains why the idea of a Buddhism without faith holds little appeal for people suffering from serious illness oppression poverty or racism Their experience has shown that the only way to overcome these obstacles is to pursue truths of the will which require faith as their rocksolid foundationThe second simileA man searching for fruit climbs a tree to eat his fill and to stuff his garments with fruit to take homeWhile he is there another man searching for fruit comes alongThe second man cant climb the tree but he has an axe so he chops the tree downIf the first man doesnt quickly get out of the tree he may break an arm or a leg or even dieThis simile shows the perils of looking for true happiness in the wrong place in sensual pleasuresIf your happiness depends on anything other people can take away from you youre putting yourself in dangerAs the Buddha notes we hope for happiness in sensual pleasures not because theyve ever really satisfied us but because we cant imagine any other escape from pain and sufferingIf we allowed ourselves to believe that there is another alternative wed be more willing to question our strong faith in our cravings and attachments more willing to look for that alternative and give it a tryAnd as the third simile argues if we look in the right way well find itA person searching for milk tries to get milk out of a cow by twisting its hornAnother person searching for milk tries to get milk out of the cow by pulling at its udderThe Buddha taught this simile in response to an assertion that there is nothing a human being can do to attain release from sufferingWe can attain it he said as long as we follow the right method like the person pulling at the udder of the cowThe right method starts with right understanding and this is where faith in the Buddhas Awakening comes inAs the Buddha once stated he didnt tell us everything he awakened toWhat he told was like a handful of leaves what he learned was like the leaves in the forestStill the leaves in the handful contained all the lessons that would help others to awaken right understanding begins with learning what those specific lessons areThe most important lesson and the most important item of faith is simply the fact of the Awakening itselfThe Buddha achieved it through his own efforts and he did so not because he was more than human but because he developed mental qualities that we each have the potential to developTo have faith in his Awakening thus means having faith in your own potential for AwakeningHowever the specifics of what he learned in his Awakening are important as wellIts not simply the case that he found what worked for him while what works for you may be something else entirelyNo matter how much you twist a cows horn itll never produce milkThe Buddhas insights penetrated into how things work what it means for them to workThese insights apply to everyone throughout timeWhen summarizing his Awakening in the most condensed form the Buddha focused on a principle of causality that explains how we live in a world where patterns of causality fashion events and yet those events are not totally predetermined by the pastThe principle is actually a dual one for there are two kinds of causality interweaving in our livesThe first is that of a cause giving results in the immediate present When this is that is when this isnt that isntWhen you turn on a stereo for example the noise comes out when you turn it off the noise stopsThe second type of causality is that of a cause giving results over time From the arising of this comes the arising of that from the cessation of this comes the cessation of thatIf you study now youll have knowledge long into the futureIf you damage your brain the negative effects will be longterm as wellApplied to karma or intention the dual principle means this Any moment of experience consists of three things pleasures and pains resulting from past intentions present intentions and pleasures and pains resulting from present intentionsThus the present is not totally shaped by the pastIn fact the most important element shaping your present experience of pleasure or pain is how you fashion with your present intentions the raw material provided by past intentionsAnd your present intentions can be totally freeThis is how theres free will in the midst of causalityAt the same time the pattern in the way intentions lead to results allows us to learn from past mistakesThis freedom within a pattern opens the way to a path of mental training that can lead to the end of sufferingWe practice generosity virtue and meditation to learn the power of our intentions and in particular to see what happens as our intentions grow more skillful so skillful that present intentions actually stopOnly when they stop can you prove for yourself how powerful theyve beenAnd the spot where they stop is where the unconditioned  the end of suffering  is foundFrom there you can return to intentions but youre no longer their captive or slaveIn presenting his teachings on karma and suffering to his listeners the Buddha would offer empirical evidence to corroborate them  noting for instance how your reaction to another persons misery depends on how attached you are to that person  but he never attempted to back these teachings with fullscale empirical proofIn fact he heaped ridicule on his contemporaries the Jains who attempted to prove their more deterministic teaching on karma by claiming that all those who kill steal lie or engage in illicit sex will suffer from their actions here and nowHavent you seen the case the Buddha asked where a man is rewarded by a king for killing the kings enemy for stealing from the kings enemy for amusing the king with a clever lie for seducing the kings enemys wife Even though the basic principle of karma is simple enough  skillful intentions lead to pleasure unskillful intentions to pain  the dual principle of causality through which karma operates is so complex like a Mandelbrot set that you would go crazy trying to nail the whole thing down empiricallySo instead of an empirical proof for his teaching on karma the Buddha offered a pragmatic proof If you believe in his teachings on causality karma rebirth and the four noble truths how will you actWhat kind of life will you leadWont you tend to be more responsible and compassionateIf on the other hand you were to believe in any of the alternatives  such as a doctrine of an impersonal fate or a deity who determined the course of your pleasure and pain or a doctrine that all things were coincidental and without cause  what would those beliefs lead you to doWould they allow you to put an end to suffering through your own effortsWould they allow any purpose for knowledge at allIf on the other hand you refused to commit to a coherent idea of what human action can do would you be likely to see a demanding path of practice all the way through to the endThis was the kind of reasoning that the Buddha used to inspire faith in his Awakening and in its relevance to our own search for true happinessThe fourth simile stresses the importance of not settling for anything less than the genuine thingA man searching for heartwood goes into a forest and comes to a tree containing heartwood but instead of taking the heartwood he takes home some sapwood branches or barkFaith in the possibility of nirvana  the heartwood of the path  is what keeps you from getting waylaid by the pleasures of the sapwood and bark the gratification that comes from being generous and virtuous the sense of peace interconnectedness and oneness that comes with strong concentrationYet surprisingly modern discussions of the role of faith in the Buddhas teachings rarely mention this point and focus on faith in karma and rebirth insteadThis is surprising because nirvana is much less related to our everyday experience than either karma or rebirthWe see the fruits of our actions all around us we see people being born with distinct personalities and differing strengths and its only a short leap to the idea that theres some connection between these thingsNirvana however isnt connected to anything weve experienced at allIts already there but hidden by all our desires for physical and mental activityTo touch it we have to abandon our habitual attachment to activityTo believe that such a thing is possible and that its the ultimate happiness is to take a major leapMany in the Buddhas time were willing to take the leap while many others were not preferring to content themselves with the branches and sapwood wanting simply to learn how to live happily with their families in this life and go to heaven in the nextNirvana they said could waitFaced with this honest and gentle resistance to his teaching on nirvana the Buddha was happy to complyBut he was less tolerant of the stronger resistance he received from brahmas heavenly deities who complacently felt that their experience of limitless oneness and compassion in the midst of samsara  their sapwood  was superior to the heartwood of nirvanaIn cases like this he used all the psychic and intellectual powers at his disposal to humble their pride because he realized that their views totally closed the door to AwakeningIf you think that your sapwood is actually heartwood you wont look for anything betterWhen your sapwood breaks youll decide that heartwood is a lieBut if you realize that youre using bark and sapwood you leave open the possibility that someday youll go back and give the heartwood a tryOf course its even better if you can take the Buddhas teachings on nirvana as a direct challenge in this lifetime  as if he were saying Heres your chanceCan you prove me wrongThe fifth simileAn experienced elephant hunter searching for a big bull elephant comes across a large elephant footprint in the forestHowever he doesnt jump to the conclusion that its the footprint of a big bull elephantWhyBecause there are dwarf female elephants with big feetIt might be one of theirsHe follows along and sees some scratch marks and tusk marks high up on the trees but still doesnt jump to the conclusion that hes on the trail of a big bull elephantWhyBecause there are tall female elephants with tusksThe marks might be theirsHe follows along and finally sees a big bull elephant under a tree or in a clearingThats when he concludes that hes found his bull elephantIn explaining this simile the Buddha said that all the preliminary steps of the practice  going into the wilderness as a monastic adhering to the precepts developing restraint contentment and strong concentration seeing past lives and gaining vision of the beings of the cosmos dying and being reborn in line with their karma  are simply footprints and scratch marks of the Buddhas AwakeningOnly when you have your own first taste of Awakening having followed his path do you really know that your faith in his Awakening was well placedTouching the dimension where suffering ends you realize that the Buddhas teachings about it were not only true but also useful He knew what he was talking about and was able to point you there as wellWhats interesting about this simile is the way it combines healthy faith with honest skepticismTo act on this faith is to test it the way youd test a working hypothesisYou need faith to keep following the footprints but you also need the honesty to recognize where faith ends and knowledge beginsThis is why in the Buddhist context faith and empiricism are inseparableUnlike a monotheistic religion  where faith centers on the power of another  faith in the Buddhas Awakening keeps pointing back to the power of your own actions Do you have enough power over your intentions to make them harmlessDo harmless intentions then give you the freedom to drop intention entirelyThe only way you can answer these questions is by being scrupulously honest about your intentions to detect even the slightest traces of harm even the slightest movement of intention itselfOnly then will you know the deathless totally unconditioned by intention for sureBut if you claim to know things that you dont how can you trust yourself to detect any of these thingsYou need to make your honesty worthy of your faith testing its assumptions until you find true knowledge in the testThis is why science will never be able to pass valid judgment on the truths of Awakening for the path deals in matters that outside experimenters cant reachAlthough others may sympathize with your suffering the suffering itself is an experience you can share with no one elseThe honesty and skillfulness of your intentions is an affair of your internal dialogue something that is also purely your ownScientists can measure the neurological data indicating pain or intentional activity but theres no external measurement for how the pain feels or how honest your intentional dialogue may beAnd as for the deathless it has no physical correlates at allThe closest that outside empirical measurement can get is to pictures of the footprints on the ground and the marks in the treesTo get to the bull elephant you have to do what the Buddhas disciple Sariputta didHe kept following the path without jumping to dishonest conclusions until he saw the elephant withinThen when the Buddha asked him Do you take it on faith that these five strengths  faith persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment  lead to the deathless Sariputta could answer honestly No I dont take it on faithI knowAs Sariputta stated in another discourse his proof was experiential but so inward that it touched a dimension where not only the external senses but even the sense of the functioning of the mind cant reachIf you want to confirm his knowledge you have to touch that dimension in the only place you can access it inside yourselfThis is one of two ways in which the Buddhas method differs from that of modern empiricismThe other has to do with the integrity of the person attempting the proofAs in science faith in the Buddhas Awakening acts like a working hypothesis but the test of that hypothesis requires an honesty deeper and more radical than anything science requiresYou have to commit yourself  every variation on who you feel you are  totally to the testOnly when you take apart all clinging to your inner and outer senses can you prove whether the activity of clinging is what hides the deathlessThe Buddha never forced anyone to commit to this test both because you cant coerce people to be honest with themselves and because he saw that the pit of burning embers was coercion enoughThe Pali term for meditation is bhavana developmentIts a shorthand word for the development of skillful qualities in the mindBhavana is a type of karma  the intentional activity ultimately leading to the end of karma  but karma nonethelessThis point is underlined by another Pali term for meditation kammatthana the work at hand and by a Thai idiom for meditation to make an effort These terms are worth keeping in mind to counterbalance the common assumption that meditation is an exercise in inaction or in passive allencompassing acceptanceActually as described in the Pali texts meditation is a very proactive processIt has an agenda and works actively to bring it aboutThis can be seen in the Pali description of how right mindfulness is fostered through satipatthanaSatipatthana is often translated as foundation of mindfulness which gives the impression that it refers to an object of meditationThis impression is reinforced when you see the four satipatthanas listed as body feelings mind and mental qualitiesBut if you look at the texts you find that they teach satipatthana as a process a way of establishing mindfulness hence the compound termWhen the texts define the compound they give not a list of objects but four formulas describing an activityHeres the first formulaEach of the terms in this formula is importantRemaining focused can also be translated as keeping track This refers to the element of concentration in the practice as you hold to one particular theme or frame of reference amid the conflicting currents of experienceArdent refers to the effort you put into the practice trying to abandon unskillful states of mind and develop skillful ones in their stead all the while trying to discern the difference between the twoAlert means being clearly aware of whats happening in the presentMindful means being able to remember or recollectSometimes mindfulness is translated as nonreactive awareness free from agendas simply present with whatever arises but the formula for satipatthana doesnt support that translationNonreactive awareness is actually part of equanimity one of many qualities fostered in the course of satipatthana but the ardency involved in satipatthana definitely has an agenda a task to be done while the role of mindfulness is to keep your task in mindThe task here is twofold staying focused on your frame of reference and putting aside any greed and distress that would result from shifting your frame of reference back to the worldThis is the meaning of the body in and of itself In other words you try to stay with the experience of the body as its immediately felt without referring it to the narratives and views that make up your sense of the worldYou stay away from stories of how you have related to your body in the past and how you hope to relate to it in the futureYou drop any concern for how your body fits into the world in terms of its beauty agility or strengthYou simply tune into the body on its own terms  the direct experience of its breathing its movements its postures its elementary properties and its inevitable decayIn this way you learn how to strip away your assumptions about what does or doesnt lie behind your experience of the body and gain practice in referring everything to the experience itselfThe same approach applies to the remaining types of satipatthana focusing on feelings on mind states and on mental qualities in and of themselvesAt first glance these may look like new and different meditation exercises but the Buddha makes clear that they can all center on a single practice keeping the breath in mindWhen the mind is with the breath all four frames of reference are right thereThe difference lies simply in the subtlety of your focusSo when youve developed your skills with the first most blatant type of satipatthana you dont have to move far to take up the more subtle onesSimply stay with the breath and shift your focus to the feelings and mind states that arise from being mindful of the breath and the mental qualities that either get in the way of your focus or strengthen itOnce youve chosen your frame of reference you treat it the same way youve been treating the body taking it as your frame of reference in and of itself without referring it to stories about yourself or views about the worldYou separate feelings  of pleasure pain and neitherpleasurenorpain  from the stories you normally create around themYou separate states of greed anger and delusion from their focal points in the worldIn this way you can see them for what they areStill though you have an agenda based on the desire for Awakening  a desire that the Buddha classed not as a cause of suffering but as part of the path leading to its endThis becomes clearest in the satipatthana focused on mental qualities in and of themselvesYou acquaint yourself with the unskillful qualities that obstruct concentration  such as sensual desire ill will and restlessness  not simply to experience them but also to understand them so that you can cut them awaySimilarly you acquaint yourself with the skillful qualities that foster discernment so that you can develop them all the way to releaseThe texts call these skillful qualities the seven factors of Awakening and show that satipatthana practice is aimed at developing them all in orderThe first factor is mindfulnessThe second is called analysis of qualities the ability to distinguish skillful from unskillful qualities in the mind seeing what can be accepted and what needs to be changedThe third factor is persistence  persistence in abandoning unskillful qualities and fostering skillful ones in their placeThe texts describe a wide variety of methods to use in this endeavor but they all come down to two sortsIn some cases an unskillful quality will disappear simply when you watch it steadilyIn other cases you have to make a concerted effort actively doing what you can to counteract an unskillful quality and replace it with a more skillful oneAs skillful qualities take charge within you you see that while skillful thinking leads to no harmful actions long bouts of it can tire the mindSo you bring your thoughts to stillness which develops three more of the factors of Awakening rapture serenity and concentrationThese provide the mind with a foundation of wellbeingThe final factor is equanimity and its place in the list is significantIts nonreactivity is fully appropriate only when the more active factors have done what they canThis is true of all the lists in which equanimity is includedIts never listed on its own as sufficient for Awakening and it always comes last after the proactive factors in the listThis doesnt mean that it supplants them simply that it joins in their interactionInstead of replacing them it counterbalances them enabling you to step back and see subtle levels of stress and craving that the more proactive factors may have obscuredThen it makes room for the proactive factors to act on the newly discovered levelsOnly when all levels of stress and craving are gone is the work of both the proactive and nonreactive sides of meditation doneThats when the mind can be truly agendafreeIts like learning to play the pianoAs you get more proactive in playing proficiently you also become sensitive in listening nonreactively to discern ever more subtle levels in the musicThis allows you to play even more skillfullyIn the same way as you get more skilled in establishing mindfulness on your chosen frame of reference you gain greater sensitivity in peeling away ever more subtle layers of the present moment until nothing is left standing in the way of total releaseThe Atthaka Vagga is a set of sixteen poems on the theme of nonclingingThe poems cover all four types of clinging  clinging to sensuality to views to practices and precepts and to doctrines of the self  with a special emphasis on the first twoThey describe what constitutes the nature of the clinging in each particular case the drawbacks of the clinging the advantages of abandoning clinging ways to abandon clinging and the subtle paradoxes of what it means not to clingThis last point is touched on in many discourses in the Pali canon as the Buddhist teachings on nonclinging all contain a central paradox the objects of clinging that must ultimately be abandoned form part of the path to their abandoningA certain amount of sensual pleasure is needed in the path to go beyond sensual pleasure Right View is needed to overcome attachment to views a regimen of precepts and practices is needed to overcome attachment to precepts and practices a strong sense of selfresponsibility is needed to overcome attachment to doctrines of the selfOther passages in the Pali canon offer clear analogies to explain these paradoxes often in terms of movement toward a goal  taking a raft across a river walking to a park taking a series of relay coaches from one city to another  in which the motive and means of transport are abandoned on reaching the goalThe Atthaka however sometimes presents these paradoxes in as mystifying a manner as possibleIn fact some of the paradoxes  particularly in the discussions of abandoning clinging to views  are stated in terms so stark that on the surface they are hard to reconcile with teachings in other Pali discourses or with other passages in the Atthaka itselfThe question is thus whether these paradoxes should be taken at face value or further interpretedOr to put the question in terms used by the Buddha himself Is their meaning as stated already fully drawn out or does it have to be inferredReaders of the poems have offered arguments for both sidesThe argument for taking the paradoxes at face value is based on a major assumption that the Atthaka is historically prior to the rest of the Pali canonFrom this assumption the argument goes on to conclude that these poems contain the earliest recorded teachings of the Buddha and that if they conflict with other passages in the Canon that is simply because those other passages are less true to the Buddhas original messageThis argument however contains several weaknessesTo begin with only two pieces of evidence are offered for the relative age of these poems the Atthaka Vagga as a set is mentioned at three other points in the Canon at Ud V MvV and SN and the language of the poems is more archaic than that of the other discoursesHowever neither piece of evidence can carry the weight of what its supposed to proveThe first piece shows simply that an Atthaka Vagga predates the three passages in question not necessarily that the Atthaka Vagga as we have it predates the entire remainder of the CanonAs for the archaic nature of the language that is common to a great deal of the poetry throughout the Pali canonJust as Tennysons poetry contains more archaisms than Drydens prose the fact that a Pali poem uses archaic language is no proof of its actual ageThe arguments for taking the Atthakas paradoxes at face value contain other weaknesses as wellThey commonly state that the paradoxes teach a view of no views and a practice of no goals yet the people who advance this argument are the first to admit that such doctrines are totally impracticalThese doctrines are also inconsistent with other passages in the Atthaka itself such as the clearcut view explaining the sources of conflict presented in Sn and the frequent references to Unbinding as the goal of the practiceThus even if the Atthaka is appreciably older than the other Pali discourses we would have to assume gross inconsistencies in its message if we were to take its paradoxes at face valueThe argument that the meaning of the Atthakas paradoxes must be inferred  that they were intentionally stated in obscure terms  is based on firmer groundTo begin with this is the interpretation that Buddhist tradition has advanced from its earliest centuriesAn extended commentary entitled the Mahaniddesa reconciling the content of the poems with the teachings in the rest of the discourses was compiled early enough to be included in the Canon itselfAlthough some of the explanations given in the Mahaniddesa may seem a little too pat and pedantic they make clear the point that Buddhists near the time of the Buddha found many useful levels of meaning below the surface level of the poemsEven if we disregard arguments from tradition there are other good reasons for maintaining that the meaning of the Atthakas paradoxes was designed to be inferredTo begin with there is the question already mentioned of the internal consistency of the poems themselves they make better sense when taken as a whole if the paradoxes are explored for meanings not obvious on the surfaceA prime example is the passage toward the beginning of Sn in which the Buddha seems to be saying that an awakened person would regard purity as being found neither by means of views precepts and practices etc nor through lack of views precepts and practices etcMagandiya the Buddhas listener states understandably that such a teaching is confusedReaders who have acquired a taste for Mahayana nondualities and who would take the Buddhas statement at face value might scoff at Magandiyas narrowmindednessBut if the words are taken at face value Magandiya would be right for there are many passages in the Atthaka that recommend views precepts and practices as part of the path to purityHowever if we take the Buddhas statements as puns on the instrumental case  which can be interpreted not only as through or by means of but also as in terms of or in connection with the Buddhas statements to Magandiya make sense in and of themselves and fit with the rest of the Atthaka an awakened person would not define purity in terms of views precepts and practices etc but would also realize that purity cannot be attained through a lack of these thingsA second reason for regarding the paradoxes as requiring interpretation is that in their use of puns and grammatical wordplay they follow an ancient Indian genre  the philosophical enigma  that by its very nature called for extensive interpretationEvidence in the Rig Veda shows that ancient Vedic ritual included contests in which elder brahmans used puns and other wordplay to express philosophical teachings as riddles that contestants were then challenged to solveThe purpose of these contests was to teach the contestants  usually students studying to become ritual experts  to use their powers of ingenuity in thinking outside the box in the justified belief that the process of searching for inspiration and being illuminated by the answer would transform the mind in a much deeper way than would be achieved simply by absorbing informationAlthough the Atthaka poems advise against engaging in intellectual contests they imitate the Vedic enigmas in the way they use language to challenge the readerIndividual words  sometimes whole lines and stanzas  in the poems can be interpreted in a variety of ways and its up to the reader to explore and consider all the various meanings to decide which ones are most helpfulAlthough our culture associates wordplay with jokes the Atthaka stands at the head of a long line of Buddhist texts  both Theravada and not  that use wordplay with a serious purpose to teach the reader to think independently to see through the uncertainties of language and so to help loosen any clinging to the structures that language imposes on the mindThis type of rhetoric also rewards anyone who takes the text seriously enough to reread and rethink what it has to sayThus the obscurity of some of the Atthakas language can be regarded as a function not of the poems age but of the genre to which they belongThe proper reading of a text like this requires that you question your assumptions about its message and clarify the intention behind your efforts at reaching an understandingIn this way the act of reading is meant not only to inform but to transformThe more you give to it the more it opens up new possibilities in the mindTranslating wordplay of this sort presents enormous challenges even when those challenges are surmounted the act of reading such word games in translation can never be quite the same as reading them in the original language and cultural settingFortunately aside from the more controversial passages much of the Atthaka is perfectly straightforward  although VenMaha Kaccanas commentary on one of the simpler verses in should serve as warning that even the straightforward passages can contain hidden meaningsIn passages where I have detected multiple meanings Ive included all the detected meanings in the translation  although Im sure that there are instances of double meanings that I havent detectedWherever the Pali seems ambiguous Ive tried to use English equivalents that convey the same ambiguityWherever this has proven beyond my abilities Ive resorted to explanatory notesI have also used the notes to cite interpretations from the Mahaniddesa and other passages from earlier parts of the Canon that help explain paradoxes and other obscure points  both as an aid to the serious reader and as a way of showing that the gulf assumed to separate the Atthaka from the rest of the discourse collection is more imagined than realTwo final notes on reading the AtthakaAlthough these poems were originally composed for an audience of wandering homeless monks they offer valuable lessons for lay people as wellEven the passages referring directly to the homeless life can be read as symbolic of a state of mindVenMaha Kaccanas commentary mentioned above shows that this has been done ever since canonical timesAddressing a lay person and commenting on a verse describing the behavior of a sage who has abandoned home and society he interprets home as the khandhas and society as sense impressionsThus in his hands the verse develops an internal meaning that lay people can apply to their lives without necessarily leaving their external home and societyOther verses in the poems can be interpreted in similar waysThe poems center on descriptions of sages and enlightened people but these words dont have fixed meanings from verse to verseIn some contexts they denote arahants in others nothing more than intelligent runofthemill peopleSo be alert to context when reading descriptions about sages and enlightened people to see whether theyre describing people following the path or those who have already reached the goalA lifeaffirming Buddhism that teaches us to find happiness by opening to the richness of our everyday livesThats what we want  or so were told by the people who try to sell us a mainstreamlined BuddhismBut is it what we needAnd is it BuddhismThink back for a moment on the story of the young Prince Siddhartha and his first encounters with aging illness death and a wandering contemplativeIts one of the most accessible chapters in the Buddhist tradition largely because of the direct truetotheheart quality of the young princes emotionsHe saw aging illness and death as an absolute terror and pinned all his hopes on the contemplative forest life as his only escapeAs Asvaghosa the great Buddhist poet depicts the story the young prince had no lack of friends and family members who tried to talk him out of those perceptions and Asvaghosa was wise enough to show their lifeaffirming advice in a very appealing lightStill the prince realized that if he were to give in to their advice he would be betraying his heartOnly by remaining true to his honest emotions was he able to embark on the path that led away from the ordinary values of his society and toward an unsurpassed Awakening into the DeathlessThis is hardly a lifeaffirming story in the ordinary sense of the term but it does affirm something more important than life the truth of the heart when it aspires to a happiness absolutely pureThe power of this aspiration depends on two emotions called in Pali samvega and pasadaVery few of us have heard of them but theyre the emotions most basic to the Buddhist traditionNot only did they inspire the young prince in his quest for Awakening but even after he became the Buddha he advised his followers to cultivate them on a daily basisIn fact the way he handled these emotions is so distinctive that it may be one of the most important contributions his teachings have to offer to American culture todaySamvega was what the young Prince Siddhartha felt on his first exposure to aging illness and deathIts a hard word to translate because it covers such a complex range  at least three clusters of feelings at once the oppressive sense of shock dismay and alienation that come with realizing the futility and meaninglessness of life as its normally lived a chastening sense of our own complacency and foolishness in having let ourselves live so blindly and an anxious sense of urgency in trying to find a way out of the meaningless cycleThis is a cluster of feelings weve all experienced at one time or another in the process of growing up but I dont know of a single English term that adequately covers all threeIt would be useful to have such a term and maybe thats reason enough for simply adopting the word samvega into our languageBut more than providing a useful term Buddhism also offers an effective strategy for dealing with the feelings behind it  feelings that our own culture finds threatening and handles very poorlyOurs of course is not the only culture threatened by feelings of samvegaIn the Siddhartha story the fathers reaction to the young princes discovery stands for the way most cultures try to deal with these feelings He tried to convince the prince that his standards for happiness were impossibly high at the same time trying to distract him with relationships and every sensual pleasure imaginableTo put it simply the strategy was to get the prince to lower his aims and to find satisfaction in a happiness that was less than absolute and not especially pureIf the young prince were living in America today the father would have other tools for dealing with the princes dissatisfaction but the basic strategy would be essentially the sameWe can easily imagine him taking the prince to a religious counselor who would teach him to believe that Gods creation is basically good and not to focus on any aspects of life that would cast doubt on that beliefOr he might take him to a psychotherapist who would treat feelings of samvega as an inability to accept realityIf talking therapies didnt get results the therapist would probably prescribe moodaltering drugs to dull the feeling out of the young mans system so that he could become a productive welladjusted member of societyIf the father were really up on current trends he might find a Dharma teacher who would counsel the prince to find happiness in lifes little miraculous pleasures  a cup of tea a walk in the woods social activism easing another persons painNever mind that these forms of happiness would still be cut short by aging illness and death he would be toldThe present moment is all we have so we should try to appreciate the bittersweet opportunity of relishing but not holding on to brief joys as they passIts unlikely that the lionhearted prince we know from the story would take to any of this wellmeant adviceHed see it as propaganda for a life of quiet desperation asking him to be a traitor to his heartBut if he found no solace from these sources where in our society would he goUnlike the India of his time we dont have any wellestablished socially accepted alternatives to being economically productive members of societyEven our contemplative religious orders are prized for their ability to provide bread honey and wine for the marketplaceSo the prince would probably find no alternative but to join the drifters and dropouts the radicals and revolutionaries the subsistence hunters and survivalists consigned to the social fringeHed discover many fine minds and sensitive spirits in these groups but no accumulated body of proven and profound alternative wisdom to draw onSomeone might give him a book by Thoreau or Muir but their writings would offer him no satisfactory analysis of aging illness and death and no recommendations for how to go beyond themAnd because theres hardly any safety net for people on the fringe hed find himself putting an inordinate amount of his energy into issues of basic survival with little time or energy left over to find his own solution to the problem of samvegaHe would end up disappearing his Buddhahood aborted  perhaps in the Utah canyon country perhaps in a Yukon forest  without traceFortunately for us however the prince was born in a society that did provide support and respect for its dropoutsThis was what gave him the opportunity to find a solution to the problem of samvega that did justice to the truths of his heartThe first step in that solution is symbolized in the Siddhartha story by the princes reaction to the fourth person he saw on his travels outside of the palace the wandering forest contemplativeThe emotion he felt at this point is termed pasada another complex set of feelings usually translated as clarity and serene confidence Its what keeps samvega from turning into despairIn the princes case he gained a clear sense of his predicament and of the way out of it leading to something beyond aging illness and death at the same time feeling confident that the way would workAs the early Buddhist teachings freely admit the predicament is that the cycle of birth aging and death is meaninglessThey dont try to deny this fact and so dont ask us to be dishonest with ourselves or to close our eyes to realityAs one teacher has put it the Buddhist recognition of the reality of suffering  so important that suffering is honored as the first noble truth  is a gift in that it confirms our most sensitive and direct experience of things an experience that many other traditions try to denyFrom there the early teachings ask us to become even more sensitive to the point where we see that the true cause of suffering is not out there  in society or some outside being  but in here in the craving present in each individual mindThey then confirm that there is an end to suffering a release from the cycleAnd they show the way to that release through developing noble qualities already latent in the mind to the point where they cast craving aside and open onto DeathlessnessThus the predicament has a practical solution a solution within the powers of every human beingIts also a solution open to critical scrutiny and testing  an indication of how confident the Buddha was in the solution he found to the problem of samvegaThis is one of the aspects of authentic Buddhism that most attracts people who are tired of being told that they should try to deny the insights that inspired their sense of samvega in the first placeIn fact early Buddhism is not only confident that it can handle feelings of samvega but its also one of the few religions that actively cultivates them to a radical extentIts solution to the problems of life demand so much dedicated effort that only strong samvega will keep the practicing Buddhist from slipping back into his or her old waysHence the recommendation that all Buddhists both men and women lay or ordained should reflect daily on the facts of aging illness separation and death  to develop feelings of samvega  and on the power of ones own actions to take samvega one step further to pasadaFor people whose sense of samvega is so strong that they want to abandon any social ties that prevent them from following the path to the end of suffering Buddhism offers both a longproven body of wisdom for them to draw from as well as a safety net the monastic sangha an institution that enables them to leave lay society without having to waste time worrying about basic survivalFor those who cant leave their social ties Buddhist teaching offers a way to live in the world without being overcome by the world following a life of generosity virtue and meditation to strengthen the noble qualities of the mind that will lead to the end of sufferingThe symbiotic relationship designed for these two branches of the Buddhist parisa or community guarantees that each will benefit from contact with the otherThe support of the laity guarantees that the monastics will not need to be overly concerned about food clothing and shelter the gratitude that the monastics inevitably feel for the freelyoffered generosity of the laity helps to keep them from turning into misfits and misanthropesAt the same time contact with the monastics helps the laity foster the proper perspective on life that nurtures the energy of samvega and pasada they need to keep from becoming dulled and numbed by the materialistic propaganda of the mainstream economySo the Buddhist attitude toward life cultivates samvega  a clear acceptance of the meaninglessness of the cycle of birth aging and death  and develops it into pasada a confident path to the DeathlessThat path includes not only timeproven guidance but also a social institution that nurtures it and keeps it aliveThese are all things that our society desperately needsIts a shame that in our current efforts at mainstreaming Buddhism they are aspects of the Buddhist tradition usually ignoredWe keep forgetting that one source of Buddhisms strength is its ability to keep one foot out of the mainstream and that the traditional metaphor for the practice is that it crosses over the stream to the further shoreMy hope is that we will begin calling these things to mind and taking them to heart so that in our drive to find a Buddhism that sells we dont end up selling ourselves shortIf you have any friends or family members who are sick or dying I know of no one who would tell you to treat them in a hardhearted wayEveryone would agree that you should be as compassionate as you canThe problem is that theres little agreement on how compassion translates into specific actionsFor some people compassion means extending life as long as possible for others it means terminating life  through assisted suicide or euthanasia  when quality of life falls below a certain levelAnd neither of these two groups sees the other as compassionate at allThe first sees the second as criminal the second sees the first as heartless and cruelFor those of us trying to negotiate the murky territory between these two extremes theres not much reliable guidanceOurs is a culture that doesnt like to think about illness and death and as a result when faced with someone whos sick or dying were at a loss as to what to doSome people will advise you simply to do what feels right but feelings have a way of turning slippery and deviousSome things feel right simply because they make you feel good regardless of whether theyre genuinely right for the other personA desire to extend life may mask a deeper fear of your own death a desire to terminate a miserable illness may rationalize your distress at having to witness sufferingEven if youre told to act from a place of mindful presence you may find that what seem to be your spontaneous inspirations are actually conditioned by hidden unexamined assumptions about what life and death are all aboutThis is why the simple injunction to be compassionate or mindful in the presence of a sick or dying person isnt enoughWe need help in educating our compassion specific advice on how to think through the implications of our actions in the face of life and death and specific examples of how people who have contemplated these issues thoroughly have actually acted in the pastWith this thought in mind I searched through the Pali canon  the oldest extant record of the Buddhas teachings  to see what lessons could be drawn from the Buddhas exampleAfter all the Buddha often referred to himself as a doctor and to his Dharma as medicine for the sufferings of the worldFrom his point of view were all sick and dying on a subtle level so we all deserve continual compassionBut what sort of advice did this doctor give when facetoface with the flesh and blood suffering of illness and deathHow did he treat people who were physically sick or dyingYou probably know the story of how together with VenAnanda he once found an unattended sick monk lying in his own filthAfter washing the monk he assembled the other monks chided them for abandoning their brother and gave them strong incentive to follow his example Whoever would tend to me he said should tend to the sick He arranged that monks nursing their fellow monks should receive special allotments of food to encourage them in their work and help lighten their burdenBut he didnt subscribe to the notion that medical treatment should try to extend life at all costsThe Vinaya his monastic discipline imposes only a minor penalty on a monk who refuses to care for a fellow monk who is sick or dying or who totally abandons a sick monk before the latter recovers or diesAnd theres no penalty for withholding or discontinuing a specific medical treatmentSo the rules convey no message that the failure to keep life going is an offense of any kindAt the same time though a monk who deliberately ends the life of a patient even from compassionate motives is expelled from the monkhood and can never reordain in this life so theres no room for euthanasia or assisted suicideThis means that the middle ground is where true compassion can be exercisedThe Buddha sets out some guidelines for this area in his definition of the ideal nurseYoure qualified to tend to the sick if you know how to prepare medicines you know whats amenable to the patients cure taking away whatevers unamenable and providing things that are amenable youre motivated by compassion and not by material gain youre not squeamish about cleaning up urine excrement saliva or vomit and youre competent at encouraging the patient at the proper times with talk on DharmaOf these five qualifications the one most discussed in the Pali canon is the fifth What qualifies as a helpful and compassionate talk on Dharma to a person who is sick or dyingWhat doesntHere again the donts mark off the territory for the dosThe Vinaya cites cases where monks tell a sick person to focus his thoughts on dying in the belief that death would be better than the miserable state of his lifeThe sick person does as they advise he dies as a result and the Buddha expels the monks from the monkhoodThus from the Buddhas perspective encouraging a sick person to relax her grip on life or to give up the will to live would not count as an act of compassionInstead of trying to ease the patients transition to death the Buddha focused on easing his or her insight into suffering and its endThis is because he regarded every moment of life as an opportunity to practice and benefit from the DharmaIts a wellknown principle in all meditation traditions that a moments insight into the pain of the present is far more beneficial than viewing the present moment with disgust and placing ones hopes on a better futureThis principle applies as much at the end of life as it does anywhere in the middleIn fact the Buddha encouraged his monks to reflect constantly on the potential imminence of death at every moment even when in ordinary health so that they could bring a sense of urgency to their practice and give the present moment their full attentionIf you learn to treat all moments as potentially your last then when your last moment does come you will face it preparedMost often though a sick or dying person hasnt been living with this sort of urgent alertness so the first step in advising such a person is to aim at clearing away any emotional obstacles to learning from the presentThe Pali texts note two such obstacles worry over the responsibilities the person is leaving behind and fear of deathIn one poignant discourse a man appears to be dying and his wife consoles him not to worry Shell be able to provide for herself and their children in his absence she wont go looking for another husband and shell continue in her practice of the DharmaWith each reassurance she repeats the refrain So dont be worried as you dieDeath is painful for one who is worriedThe Blessed One has warned against being worried at the time of death The man recovers unexpectedly and while still frail goes to visit the Buddha telling him of his wifes reassurancesThe Buddha comments on how fortunate the man is for having such a wise and sympathetic wifeAs for fear of death the Buddha notes that one of the primary reasons for this fear is the remembrance of hurtful or cruel things youve done in the pastThus the Vinaya shows that monks would often console a fellow monk on his deathbed by asking him to call to mind something more positive  his highest meditative attainment  and to focus his thoughts thereIn a similar vein a common practice in Asian Buddhist countries is to remind a dying person of the acts of generosity or virtue he or she has performed in this lifeEven if the person is unable to muster the mindfulness and alertness needed to gain further insight into the present any Dharma talk that helps allay worries and forestall fears is an act of true compassionThe Buddha comments however that there are three additional reasons for fearing death attachment to the body attachment to sensual pleasures and a lack of direct insight into the unconditioned Dharma of the DeathlessHis more advanced instructions for sick and dying people thus focus on cutting these reasons for fear at the rootHe once visited a sick ward and told the monks there to approach the moment of death mindful and alertInstead of focusing on whether they would recover they should observe the movements of the feelings they were experiencing painful pleasant or neutralObserving a sensation of pain for instance they should notice how inconstant it is and then focus on the repeated dissolution of all painsThey could then apply the same focused alertness to pleasant and neutral feelings as wellThe steadiness of their focus would give rise to a sense of ease independent of sensory feelings and from this point of independence they could develop dispassion and relinquishment both for the body and for feelings of any sortWith relinquishment would come a genuine insight into the Dharma which being Deathless would end all fear of deathOn another occasion VenSariputta visited the famous supporter of the Buddha Anathapindika who was on his deathbedAfter learning that Anathapindikas disease was worsening he advised him to train himself I wont cling to the eye my consciousness wont be dependent on the eyeI wont cling to the ear my consciousness wont be dependent on the ear and so forth through all the six senses their objects and any mental events dependent on themAlthough Anathapindika was unable to develop this independent consciousness in line with Sariputtas instructions he asked that these instructions be given to other lay people as well for there would be those who would understand and benefit from themObviously these recommendations are all shaped by the Buddhas teachings on how the state of ones mind influences the process of death and rebirth but that doesnt mean that theyre appropriate only for those who would call themselves BuddhistRegardless of your religious beliefs when youre faced with obvious pain youre bound to see the value of any instructions that show you how to reduce suffering by investigating the pain in and of itselfIf you have the strength to follow through with the instructions youre bound to want to give them a tryAnd if you encounter the Deathless in the course of your efforts youre not going to quibble about whether to call it by a Buddhist or nonBuddhist nameThis point is illustrated by another story involving VenSariputtaVisiting an aged brahman on his deathbed Sariputta reflected that brahmans desire union with Brahma so he taught the man to develop the four attitudes of a Brahma  infinite good will compassion appreciation and equanimityAfter following these instructions the brahman was reborn as a Brahma after deathThe Buddha however later chided Sariputta for not teaching the brahman to focus instead on investigating pain for if he had the brahman would have experienced nirvana and been freed from rebirth altogetherWhats striking about all these instructions is that from the Buddhas point of view deathbed Dharma is no different from Dharma taught to people in ordinary healthThe cause of suffering is in every case the same and the path to the end of suffering is the same as well comprehend suffering abandon its cause realize its cessation and develop the qualities of mind that lead to its cessationThe only difference is that the obvious proximity of death makes teaching the Dharma both easier and harder  easier in that the patient is freed from extraneous responsibilities and can see clearly the need to understand and gain release from pain harder in that the patient may be too weakened physically or emotionally through fear or worry to put the instructions into practiceBut whatever the case its worth noting that up to the moment of death the Buddha would have you focus less on the limitations of the situation than on the potential opportunitiesEven one moment of insight in the midst of pain and suffering he said is worth more than one hundred years of good healthFrom my own personal experience  both in watching my teachers implement these instructions and in trying to implement them myself  Ive learned two major lessonsOne is that the patients best suited for making the most of the Dharma when sick or dying are those who are not tormented with memories of cruel or hurtful things they did in the past and who have already developed a meditative or contemplative practice prior to their illnessEven if that practice isnt Buddhist they intuitively respond to the Buddhas message on pain and are able to use it to alleviate their own sufferingsThe lesson here is that as long as you know youre going to die someday its a good idea to avoid cruel actions and to get started on a meditative practice of your own so that youll be prepared for illness and death when they comeAs my teacher Ajaan Fuang once said when you meditate youre gaining practice in how to die  how to be mindful and alert how to endure pain how to gain control over wayward thoughts and maybe even reach the Deathless  so that when the time comes to die youll do it with skillThe second lesson is that if you want to help other people overcome their fear of death you have to learn how to overcome your own fear of death as well by abandoning attachment to the body abandoning attachment to sensual pleasures avoiding cruel actions and gaining direct insight into the DeathlessWith your fears overcome youll be much more effective in teaching the Dharma to those on their deathbedYou wont be disturbed by the physical horrors of death youll be able to communicate directly to the needs of the dying person and your words will carry more weight for they come from direct experienceYour compassion will be educated not by books or feelings but by a clear insight into what dies and what doesntUltimately these two lessons boil down to one Meditate as an act of compassion both for yourself and for others even if death seems far awayWhen the time comes to die youll be less of a burden on those who are caring for youIn the meantime if youre called on to comfort those who are sick or dying your compassion will be more genuinely helpful and youll have a more effective message to teachAccording to the Buddhist monastic code monks and nuns are not allowed to accept money or even to engage in barter or trade with lay peopleThey live entirely in an economy of giftsLay supporters provide gifts of material requisites for the monastics while the monastics provide their supporters with the gift of the teachingIdeally  and to a great extent in actual practice  this is an exchange that comes from the heart something totally voluntaryThere are many stories in the texts that emphasize the point that returns in this economy  it might also be called an economy of merit  depend not on the material value of the object given but on the purity of heart of the donor and recipientYou give what is appropriate to the occasion and to your means when and wherever your heart feels inspiredFor the monastics this means that you teach out of compassion what should be taught regardless of whether it will sellFor the laity this means that you give what you have to spare and feel inclined to shareThere is no price for the teachings nor even a suggested donation Anyone who regards the act of teaching or the act of giving requisites as a repayment for a particular favor is ridiculed as mercenaryInstead you give because giving is good for the heart and because the survival of the Dhamma as a living principle depends on daily acts of generosityThe primary symbol of this economy is the alms bowlIf you are a monastic it represents your dependence on others your need to accept generosity no matter what form it takesYou may not get what you want in the bowl but you realize that you always get what you need even if its a hardearned lesson in doing withoutOne of my students in Thailand once went to the mountains in the northern part of the country to practice in solitudeHis hillside shack was an ideal place to meditate but he had to depend on a nearby hilltribe village for alms and the diet was mostly plain rice with some occasional boiled vegetablesAfter two months on this diet his meditation theme became the conflict in his mind over whether he should go or stayOne rainy morning as he was on his alms round he came to a shack just as the morning rice was readyThe wife of the house called out asking him to wait while she got some rice from the potAs he was waiting there in the pouring rain he couldnt help grumbling inwardly about the fact that there would be nothing to go with the riceIt so happened that the woman had an infant son who was sitting near the kitchen fire crying from hungerSo as she scooped some rice out of the pot she stuck a small lump of rice in his mouthImmediately the boy stopped crying and began to grinMy student saw this and it was like a light bulb turning on in his headHere you are complaining about what people are giving you for free he told himselfYoure no match for a little kidIf he can be happy with just a lump of rice why cant you As a result the lesson that came with his scoop of rice that day gave my student the strength he needed to stay on in the mountains for another three yearsFor a monastic the bowl also represents the opportunity you give others to practice the Dhamma in accordance with their meansIn Thailand this is reflected in one of the idioms used to describe going for alms proad sat doing a favor for living beingsThere were times on my alms round in rural Thailand when as I walked past a tiny grass shack someone would come running out to put rice in my bowlYears earlier as lay person my reaction on seeing such a bare tiny shack would have been to want to give monetary help to themBut now I was on the receiving end of their generosityIn my new position I may have been doing less for them in material terms than I could have done as a lay person but at least I was giving them the opportunity to have the dignity that comes with being a donorFor the donors the monks alms bowl becomes a symbol of the good they have doneOn several occasions in Thailand people would tell me that they had dreamed of a monk standing before them opening the lid to his bowlThe details would differ as to what the dreamer saw in the bowl but in each case the interpretation of the dream was the same the dreamers merit was about to bear fruit in an especially positive wayThe alms round itself is also a gift that goes both waysOn the one hand daily contact with lay donors reminds the monastics that their practice is not just an individual matter but a concern of the entire communityThey are indebted to others for the right and opportunity to practice and should do their best to practice diligently as a way of repaying that debtAt the same time the opportunity to walk through a village early in the morning passing by the houses of the rich and poor the happy and unhappy gives plenty of opportunities to reflect on the human condition and the need to find a way out of the grinding cycle of death and rebirthFor the donors the alms round is a reminder that the monetary economy is not the only way to happinessIt helps to keep a society sane when there are monastics infiltrating the towns every morning embodying an ethos very different from the dominant monetary economyThe gently subversive quality of this custom helps people to keep their values straightAbove all the economy of gifts symbolized by the alms bowl and the alms round allows for specialization a division of labor from which both sides benefitThose who are willing can give up many of the privileges of home life and in return receive the free time the basic support and the communal training needed to devote themselves fully to Dhamma practiceThose who stay at home can benefit from having fulltime Dhamma practitioners around on a daily basisI have always found it ironic that the modern world honors specialization in almost every area  even in things like running jumping and throwing a ball  but not in the Dhamma where it is denounced as dualism elitism or worseThe Buddha began the monastic order on the first day of his teaching career because he saw the benefits that come with specializationWithout it the practice tends to become limited and diluted negotiated into the demands of the monetary economyThe Dhamma becomes limited to what will sell and what will fit into a schedule dictated by the demands of family and jobIn this sort of situation everyone ends up poorer in things of the heartThe fact that tangible goods run only one way in the economy of gifts means that the exchange is open to all sorts of abusesThis is why there are so many rules in the monastic code to keep the monastics from taking unfair advantage of the generosity of lay donorsThere are rules against asking for donations in inappropriate circumstances from making claims as to ones spiritual attainments and even from covering up the good foods in ones bowl with rice in hopes that donors will then feel inclined to provide something more substantialMost of the rules in fact were instituted at the request of lay supporters or in response to their complaintsThey had made their investment in the merit economy and were interested in protecting their investmentThis observation applies not only to ancient India but also to the modernday WestOn their first contact with the Sangha most people tend to see little reason for the disciplinary rules and regard them as quaint holdovers from ancient Indian prejudicesWhen however they come to see the rules in the context of the economy of gifts and begin to participate in that economy themselves they also tend to become avid advocates of the rules and active protectors of their monasticsThe arrangement may limit the freedom of the monastics in certain ways but it means that the lay supporters take an active interest not only in what the monastic teaches but also in how the monastic lives  a useful safeguard to make sure that teachers walk their talkThis again insures that the practice remains a communal concernAs the Buddha saidMonks householders are very helpful to you as they provide you with the requisites of robes almsfood lodgings and medicineAnd you monks are very helpful to householders as you teach them the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle and admirable in the end as you expound the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely complete surpassingly pureIn this way the holy life is lived in mutual dependence for the purpose of crossing over the flood for making a right end to suffering and stressPeriodically throughout the history of Buddhism the economy of gifts has broken down usually when one side or the other gets fixated on the tangible side of the exchange and forgets the qualities of the heart that are its reason for beingAnd periodically it has been revived when people are sensitive to its rewards in terms of the living DhammaBy its very nature the economy of gifts is something of a hothouse creation that requires careful nurture and a sensitive discernment of its benefitsI find it amazing that such an economy has lasted for more than yearsIt will never be more than an alternative to the dominant monetary economy largely because its rewards are so intangible and require so much patience trust and discipline in order to be appreciatedThose who demand immediate return for specific services and goods will always require a monetary systemSincere Buddhist lay people however have the chance to play an amphibious role engaging in the monetary economy in order to maintain their livelihood and contributing to the economy of gifts whenever they feel so inclinedIn this way they can maintain direct contact with teachers insuring the best possible instruction for their own practice in an atmosphere where mutual compassion and concern are the medium of exchange and purity of heart the bottom lineChange is the focal point for Buddhist insight  a fact so well known that it has spawned a familiar sound bite Isnt change what Buddhism is all about Whats less well known is that this focus has a frame that change is neither where insight begins nor where it endsInsight begins with a question that evaluates change in light of the desire for true happinessIt ends with a happiness that lies beyond changeWhen this frame is forgotten people create their own contexts for the teaching and often assume that the Buddha was operating within those same contextsTwo of the contexts commonly attributed to the Buddha at present are theseInsight into change teaches us hopeBecause change is built into the nature of things nothing is inherently fixed not even our own identityNo matter how bad the situation anything is possibleWe can do whatever we want to do create whatever world we want to live in and become whatever we want to beThe first of these interpretations offers wisdom on how to consume the pleasures of immediate personal experience when youd rather they not change the second on how to produce change when you want itAlthough sometimes presented as complementary insights these interpretations contain a practical conflict If experiences are so fleeting and changeable are they worth the effort needed to produce themHow can we find genuine hope in the prospect of positive change if we cant fully rest in the results when they arriveArent we just setting ourselves up for disappointmentOr is this just one of the unavoidable paradoxes of lifeAncient folk wisdom from many cultures would suggest so advising us that we should approach change with cautious joy and stoic equanimity training ourselves to not to get attached to the results of our actions and accepting without question the need to keep on producing fleeting pleasures as best we can for the only alternative would be inaction and despairThis advice too is often attributed to the BuddhaBut the Buddha was not the sort of person to accept things without questionHis wisdom lay in realizing that the effort that goes into the production of happiness is worthwhile only if the processes of change can be skillfully managed to arrive at a happiness resistant to changeOtherwise were lifelong prisoners in a forcedlabor camp compelled to keep on producing pleasurable experiences to assuage our hunger and yet finding them so empty of any real essence that they can never leave us fullThese realizations are implicit in the question that according to the Buddha lies at the beginning of insightThis is a heartfelt question motivated by the desire behind all conscious action to attain levels of pleasure worthy of the effort that goes into themIt springs from the realization that life requires effort and that if we arent careful whole lifetimes can be lived in vainThis question together with the realizations and desires behind it provides the context for the Buddhas perspective on changeIf we examine it closely we find the seeds for all his insights into the production and consumption of changeThe first phrase in the question  What when I do it will lead to  focuses on the issues of production on the potential effects of human actionPrior to his Awakening the Buddha had left home and gone into the wilderness to explore precisely this issue to see how far human action could go and whether it could lead to a dimension beyond the reach of changeHis Awakening was confirmation that it could  if developed to the appropriate level of skillfulnessHe thus taught that there are four types of action corresponding to four levels of skill three that produce pleasant unpleasant and mixed experiences within the cycles of space and time and a fourth that leads beyond action to a level of happiness transcending the dimensions of space and time thus eliminating the need to produce any further happinessBecause the activities of producing and consuming require space and time a happiness transcending space and time by its very nature is neither produced nor consumedThus when the Buddha reached that happiness and stepped outside the modes of producing and consuming he was able to turn back and see exactly how pervasive a role these activities play in ordinary experience and how imprisoning they normally areHe saw that our experience of the present is an activity  something fabricated or produced moment to moment from the raw material provided by past actionsWe even fabricate our identity our sense of who we areAt the same time we try to consume any pleasure that can be found in what weve produced  although in our desire to consume pleasure we often gobble down painWith every moment production and consumption are intertwined We consume experiences as we produce them and produce them as we consumeThe way we consume our pleasures or pains can produce further pleasures or pains now and into the future depending on how skillful we areThe three parts of the latter phrase in the Buddhas question  my  longterm  wellbeing and happiness  provide standards for gauging the level of our skill in approaching true pleasure or happinessWe apply these standards to the experiences we consume if they arent longterm then no matter how pleasant they might be they arent true happinessIf theyre not true happiness theres no reason to claim them as mineThis insight forms the basis for the Three Characteristics that the Buddha taught for inducing a sense of dispassion for normal time and spacebound experienceAnicca the first of the three is pivotalAnicca applies to everything that changesOften translated as impermanent its actually the negative of nicca which means constant or dependableEverything that changes is inconstantNow the difference between impermanent and inconstant may seem semantic but its crucial to the way anicca functions in the Buddhas teachingsAs the early texts state repeatedly if something is anicca then the other two characteristics automatically follow its dukkha and anatta ie not worthy to be claimed as me or mineIf we translate anicca as impermanent the connection among these Three Characteristics might seem debatableBut if we translate it as inconstant and consider the Three Characteristics in light of the Buddhas original question the connection is clearIf youre seeking a dependable basis for longterm happiness and ease anything inconstant is obviously a stressful place to pin your hopes  like trying to relax in an unstable chair whose legs are liable to break at any timeIf you understand that your sense of self is something willed and fabricated  that you choose to create it  theres no compelling reason to keep creating a me or mine around any experience thats inconstant and stressfulYou want something betterYou dont want to make that experience the goal of your practiceSo what do you do with experiences that are inconstant and stressfulYou could treat them as worthless and throw them away but that would be wastefulAfter all you went to the trouble to fabricate them in the first place and as it turns out the only way you can reach the goal is by utilizing experiences of just this sortSo you can learn how to use them as means to the goal and the role they can play in serving that purpose is determined by the type of activity that went into producing them the type that produces a pleasure conducive to the goal or the type that doesntThose that do the Buddha labeled the path These activities include acts of generosity acts of virtue and the practice of mental absorption or concentrationEven though they fall under the Three Characteristics these activities produce a sense of pleasure relatively stable and secure more deeply gratifying and nourishing than the act of producing and consuming ordinary sensual pleasuresSo if youre aiming at happiness within the cycles of change you should look to generosity virtue and mental absorption to produce that happinessBut if youd rather aim for a happiness going beyond change these same activities can still help you by fostering the clarity of mind needed for AwakeningEither way theyre worth mastering as skillsTheyre your basic set of tools so you want to keep them in good shape and ready to handAs for other pleasures and pains  such as those involved in sensual pursuits and in simply having a body and mind  these can serve as the objects you fashion with your tools as raw materials for the discernment leading to AwakeningBy carefully examining them in light of their Three Characteristics  to see exactly how theyre inconstant stressful and notself  you become less inclined to keep on producing and consuming themYou see that your addictive compulsion to fabricate them comes entirely from the hunger and ignorance embodied in states of passion aversion and delusionWhen these realizations give rise to dispassion both for fabricated experiences and for the processes of fabrication you enter the path of the fourth kind of kamma leading to the DeathlessThis path contains two important turnsThe first comes when all passion and aversion for sensual pleasures and pains has been abandoned and your only remaining attachment is to the pleasure of concentrationAt this point you turn and examine the pleasure of concentration in terms of the same Three Characteristics you used to contemplate sensual experiencesThe difficulty here is that youve come to rely so strongly on the solidity of your concentration that youd rather not look for its drawbacksAt the same time the inconstancy of a concentrated mind is much more subtle than that of sensual experiencesBut once you overcome your unwillingness to look for that inconstancy the day is sure to come when you detect itAnd then the mind can be inclined to the DeathlessThats where the second turn occursAs the texts point out when the mind encounters the Deathless it can treat it as a mindobject  a dhamma  and then produce a feeling of passion and delight for itThe fabricated sense of the self thats producing and consuming this passion and delight thus gets in the way of full AwakeningSo at this point the logic of the Three Characteristics has to take a new turnTheir original logic  Whatever is inconstant is stressful whatever is stressful is notself  leaves open the possibility that whatever is constant could be easeful and selfThe first possibility is in fact the case whatever is constant is easeful the Deathless is actually the ultimate easeBut the second possibility isnt a skillful way of regarding whats constant if you latch onto whats constant as self youre stuck on your attachmentTo go beyond space and time you have to go beyond fabricating the producing and consuming self which is why the concluding insight of the path is All dhammas  constant or not  are notselfWhen this insight has done its work in overcoming any passion or delight for the Deathless full Awakening occursAnd at that point even the path is relinquished and the Deathless remains although no longer as an object of the mindIts simply there radically prior to and separate from the fabrication of space and timeAll consuming and producing for the sake of your own happiness comes to an end for a timeless wellbeing has been foundAnd because all mindobjects are abandoned in this happiness questions of constant or inconstant stress or ease self or notself are no longer an issueThis then is the context of Buddhist insight into change an approach that takes seriously both the potential effects of human effort and the basic human desire that effort not go to waste that change have the potential to lead to a happiness beyond the reach of changeThis insight is focused on developing the skills that lead to the production of genuine happinessIt employs the Three Characteristics  of inconstancy stress and notself  not as abstract statements about existence but as inducement for mastering those skills and as guidelines for measuring your progress along the wayWhen used in this way the Three Characteristics lead to a happiness transcending the Three Characteristics the activities of producing and consuming and space and time as a wholeWhen we understand this context for the Three Characteristics we can clearly see the halftruths contained in the insights on the production and consumption of change that are commonly misattributed to the BuddhaWith regard to production Although it may be true that with enough patience and persistence we can produce just about anything including an amazing array of selfidentities from the raw material of the present moment the question is whats worth producingWeve imprisoned ourselves with our obsession for producing and consuming changeable pleasures and changeable selves and yet theres the possibility of using change to escape from this prison to the freedom of a happiness transcending time and spaceDo we want to take advantage of that possibility or would we rather spend our spare time blowing bubbles in the sunlight coming through our prison windows and trying to derive happiness from their swirling patterns before they burstThis question ties in with wisdom on consumption Getting the most out of our changing experiences doesnt mean embracing them or milking them of their intensityInstead it means learning to approach the pleasures and pains they offer not as fleeting ends in themselves but as tools for AwakeningWith every moment were supplied with raw materials  some of them attractive some of them notInstead of embracing them in delight or throwing them away in disgust we can learn how to use them to produce the keys that will unlock our prison doorsAnd as for the wisdom of nonattachment to the results of our actions in the Buddhas context this notion can make sense only if we care deeply about the results of our actions and want to master the processes of cause and effect that lead to genuine freedomIn other words we dont demand childishly that our actions  skillful or not  always result in immediate happiness that everything we stick into the lock will automatically unlatch the doorIf what we have done has been unskillful and led to undesirable results we want to admit our mistakes and find out why they were mistakes so that we can learn how to correct them the next time aroundOnly when we have the patience to look objectively at the results of our actions will we be able to learn by studying the keys that dont unlock the doors how finally to make the right keys that doWith this attitude we can make the most of the processes of change to develop the skill that releases us from the prison of endless producing and consumingWith release we plunge into the freedom of a happiness so true that it transcends the terms of the original question that led us thereTheres nothing further we have to do our sense of my and mine is discarded and even the longterm which implies time is erased by the timelessThe happiness remaining lies radically beyond the range of our time and spacebound conceptions of happinessTotally independent of mindobjects its unadulterated and unalterable unlimited and pureAs the texts tell us it even lies beyond the range of totality and the AllAnd thats what Buddhist practice is all aboutPeace means letting go of mental objects so that nothing comes in to disturb the mindAll thats left is a nature devoid of fabricationEven the nibbana we want to reach is nothing other than a peace not fabricated by conditionsAs for the peace we develop through various techniques by which the mind gathers into concentration or gathers into stillness thats the peace of the mind gathering inIt stops fabricatingIt stops holding onto the aggregatesWe should view this sort of peace in which we let go of the aggregates as a strategyWhen the mind isnt at peace thats because it doesnt let goIt holds onto things as its self or belonging to its selfAs a result it suffersIt feels stressThe mind takes its stance in form in feelings in perceptions in consciousnessIt seizes hold of these things but these things are inconstantWhen they change they lead to disappointmentThe mind then thrashes around and piles on more stress and sufferingSo we have to view peace as our strategy  the peace we try to give rise to  seeing it as a high level of happinessAs for any lack of peace we should view that as sufferingThe mind lacks peace because defilements disturb itThis happens because the mind isnt skillful and the mind isnt skillful because of delusionSo we focus on peace and on the stress of disturbance as our strategiesPeace we regard as the goal for which were practicingStress we use as an object of contemplation as a means for destroying delusion intoxication heedlessness our hankering for thingsThe strategy by which we can bring the mind to peace requires that we see the stress and drawbacks inherent in the aggregatesAs long as we keep hankering after the aggregates as long as were deluded by sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas found in the aggregates the peace we want cant last for these things are inconstantThis inconstancy is what leads to the stress and suffering we see all around usWe take our stance in forms that are inconstantOr you could say that we seize hold of forms that are inconstantWe live in forms that are inconstantWe take a stance in feelingWe seize hold of feelingWhy do we seize hold of itBecause weve fabricated it into being from having seized hold of feeling in the pastThe cause from the past becomes the effect in the presentTo let go of the feeling in the present we have to examine things until we see the inconstancy the stress in form feeling perception fabrication and consciousnessThen the mind wont be deludedThis is our pathThis is the right view that fosters discernmentIn this way stress is the means for developing knowledge and visionIf there werent any stress or suffering what would we take as our focusActually stress and suffering are already there so why dont we see them for what they areBecause we havent heard the Dhamma  or we have heard it but weve listened in an aimless way with no truth in our listening our awareness our actionsSo we have to be certain earnest and true in our heartAfter all suffering is an earnest truthIf we just play at contemplation simply letting things happen on their own thats not meditationIt gives us no proof doesnt develop the mindIf youre going to focus on anything focus on it so that you comprehend it so that you see its truth so that you can grow disenchanted with stress and suffering and can abandon the origination of stress and suffering in line with its truthDont just go through the motionsWhen I went to stay with Ajaan Mun the first thing he spoke about was this being truthful earnestHe said Youve ordained in earnestnessYou didnt ordain in playYou ordained with conviction and did it properly with the Sangha and your preceptor admitting you to the community of monksEverything was done in line with the Buddhas instructionsSo you have your guarantee that youre a genuine monk on the conventional levelBut your status as a monk isnt yet completeYou need to be earnest in your practice to complete all three parts of the Triple Training  heightened virtue heightened mind heightened discernment  until you gain true knowledge of what the Buddha taughtYou have to practice all the way to the end so that you can gain true knowledge through proper discernment of the noble truthsStress for instance is a noble truthIts right there in front of youWhy dont you become disenchanted with itBecause you dont see it dont see the cause from which it comesOr when you see the cause you dont see its connection to stressWhy is thatBecause delusion gets in the wayYou see pretty sights hear lovely sounds smell nice aromas taste good flavors and then you fall for themYou get carried away and grasp after them thinking that youve acquired somethingAs for the things you dont yet have you want to acquire themOnce you acquire them you fall for them and get all attached and entangledThis is the origination of sufferingWhen these things are inconstant they stop being peacefulThey become a turmoil because theyre inconstant all the timeHave you ever acquired anything thats constant and lastingHas anyone ever acquired anything thats constant and lastingWhen you acquire money a home a car a boat whatever  a child or a grandchild  are these things constantStableDo they make the mind constant and stableYou have to contemplate suffering and stress down to the details and see all the way throughDont just go through the motionsFocus on sights and sounds in general  everything inside or outside where the mind takes up residenceTheyre all just like our body  theyre all based on formHair of the head is a form hair of the body nails teeth skin  every part  the bonesIf you took the bones out how could the rest of the body stayEven when you dont take them out theyre going to go on their ownEvery part is going to fall awayThey wont stay together like this foreverWhatever you acquire  good or bad pleasant or unpleasant  you have to investigate itAsk yourself All these things that you hold onto that you love and delight in that you have to keep caring for from fear of hunger heat cold difficulties pains and illnesses all these things that youve been caring for all along What have you gained from themAll youve got to show is that you cant meditate and bring the mind to peace radiance or purity all because youre so possessive of these thingsWhat Im saying here is a truth thats true for everyoneEach of these words applies to each one of usThis is the truthIts what the Buddha said when he was summarizing the basic principle of suffering and stressWe should use suffering and stress as our tool in destroying the origination of suffering so that we wont be deluded by cravingIf we dont make use of suffering and stress theres no other way we can destroy itWell keep falling for it delighting in itBut if we see how things are inconstant and stressful we wont fall for craving any longerWell see how weve been taking birth and dying dying and taking birth endlessly all because we see this thing as delicious that as delicious this as sweetsmelling that as sweetsmelling this as soft that as softAll of this is the origination of stressWere deluded about these things we get infatuated with themWe dont get infatuated with sufferingAs long as were infatuated with these things theres inconstancy instability separation leading to sorrow and despair always searching for moreWhat does this all come fromWe have to look for both the cause and the effect to see how theyre connected if we want to knowThats when well be discerning when we gain knowledge and vision seeing the long courseThe Buddha taught the Dhamma so as to broaden our mindfulness and discernment so that it can encompass more than just whats right in our faceFor instance he has us contemplate that were subject to aging subject to illness subject to deathEven though were not yet old he has us contemplate aging so as to prepare ourselves for the fact that this is the way things will have to goWere not yet ill were not yet dead but we have to contemplate these things every dayThis is what it means to be heedful preparedOnce we see this truth we wont want to give rise to anything unskillful in the mindWe wont be greedy angry or deluded for what do we gain from being greedyNothing but stressWhat do we gain from being angryNothing but stressWhat do we gain from being deludedNothing but stressWhen we see this well be able to live without greed anger or delusion caring for the body just enough to keep it going just enough to develop the discernment that will enable us to see the truthThis will put an end to the burden of falling for the cycle of death and rebirth without endOnce we cast off this burden we wont have to concern ourselves with these things any longerWe hear that nibbana is happiness so we want to go thereWe hear that meditating brings happiness so we want to meditate  but we do it without any skillful strategiesWe need skillful strategies in our listening skillful strategies in focusing our awareness skillful strategies in our practiceEverything requires strategies intelligence mindfulness and discernment within the mindThe intelligence of the mind is something really powerful you knowIts nothing to sneeze atBut for the most part we dont apply that power insideWe apply it outside to material thingsWhatever we put our minds to we can accomplishWe can build all kinds of things but we devote our power just to things outside to solving external problemsAs a result we stay deluded about ourselvesWe dont really look at ourselvesThe Buddha was the first to really turn around and look at himselfHe didnt build external powerHe didnt claim to be specialHe simply turned around to look at the mind asking himself If the mind is really special why does it have to depend on other thingsWhy does it have to keep building up other thingsThose things are inconstant so when they change whats leftIts all a waste of energyAll you have to do is turn around and straighten out the mind so that it doesnt fall for its fabricatingYou dont have to go building anything fabricating anythingWhen you see through the process of fabricating you put an end to itThats called the unfabricatedNibbana is the unfabricatedNo conditions can fabricate it or dress it up at allIt comes from turning around to know the heart without fabricating or seizing hold of anything outsideThis is the truthIf we dont reach this state of truth well just keep on circling aroundYou have to know what disbands and ceases in nibbanaYou have to know what youre still deluded about that keeps getting in the waySo be intent on your meditationPeace of mind is a strategy that we use to test the truth within ourselvesWe see that when the mind lets go of the aggregates its happyIf you dont yet believe this you can give it a tryWhen you sit in concentration try letting goTell yourself that youre not going to carry these aggregates around youre not going to get riled up about themWhatever pains there may be you dont have to pay them any mindPay attention to buddho or whatever your meditation topic may be until theres nothing left but the property of knowingAnd then keep watching watching watching letting go of anything else that comes along until the mind settles down and is peacefulA sense of ease and pleasure will appear as your evidence Youve been able to let go of the aggregates of form feeling perception and fabricationAs long as youre not involved with them the mind is peaceful and at easeBut as soon as you get involved with them the mind is immediately in a turmoilThis is your strategy for seeing stress for knowing stressWhen the mind isnt peaceful thats stressAs soon as we see this well grow disenchantedWhatever comes to disturb the mind theres stress in the process of fabrication which is conditioned by ignoranceSo we should focus on studying the mind developing the mindOnce youve brought the mind to peace you should use that peace as a strategy to contemplate stress so as to disband itSee the connection between stress and lack of peace in the mind along with their relationship to form to the aggregates to the origination of stressSee how the origination of stress is related to the eye seeing forms the ear hearing sounds the nose smelling aromas the tongue tasting flavorsWhen craving arises this is where its going to arise right here at these things but the only way to see this is through meditationIf you dont meditate you wont knowThe way to know is through the strategy of finding a peaceful place and making the mind peacefulThats how youll gain release from suffering and stressNow that you understand this focus on making the mind peaceful as a strategy for eliminating the stress and disturbanceBe circumspect in using your discernmentKeep on meditating until the end of the hourWhen we meditate were training the mind for we hold the mind to be very importantBut training the mind is really difficult if we dont develop the right character habitsWe have to depend on refined inner qualities for the training really to go straight to the heart because the heart itself is subtle and sensitiveWe have to make our character meticulous pliant tractable respectful inoffensiveWe have to be willing to follow the example already set by someone who knows whos already taken the path who  on examination  weve found to be above us in terms of his training in mindfulness and discernment above us in terms of the purity of his actionsWho is this personThe Buddha  someone to whom no one else can legitimately be comparedWe cant legitimately compare our views and opinions with him for he is someone who truly trained himself who sacrificed everything with no thought for his survivalThe fact that were still left hanging on in samsara after this long long time is all because of our character habitsIts because of our character habits that we keep missing the path falling off the path straying away from the path all the timeIts because of our habit of finding excuses for ourselves that we arent willing to follow the path set out by the BuddhaWhat sort of path has he set out for our actionsWhat sort has he set out for our wordsFor our mindHe set out standards for us to respect to obey to put into practiceSages have said that the Buddhas path is an easy one to follow correctly for it creates no dangersIt doesnt require that we do anything hurtful or hardWe have to examine the Buddhas teachings to see if theyre worthy of obedience or not to see if theyre worthy to be followed or notDo they have any defects that we should try to avoid that we shouldnt acceptCan we find any inconsistencies in the Buddha that would justify our giving more credence to our own opinions that would justify our disobeying his teachingsAnd what do we have thats so specialWhen you look carefully you cant find anything to fault him withSo what harm would it do to listen to him and to obey his teachingsWe have to study to see where our own defects lieIts as if were going on a journeyOur body may be in good shape but if the workings of our car are defective they can take us right off the roadSo we have to meditate to examine the workings of our car in other words the preoccupations that we create in the mind and that act as viewsThe Buddha gave a great deal of importance to the issue of views for our views can make us defectiveWhen our views are defective they can make our virtues defectiveThey can make our practice defective taking us off the pathOur views get defective when the mind is infected with delusionTheres very little alertnessThere may be a lot of knowledge a lot of information but very little alertnessWe may think that were knowledgeable that were intelligent but we dont know that our views are defectiveOnly those who know whove gotten past this stage can recognize whats defective in our viewsSo we have to make a point of training the aspect of our character related to our views to practice making our views straightOnly then will we free ourselves from defective views and replace them with impeccable onesIn order to do this we have to be scrupulous in being observantAnd we have to be scrupulous in reflecting on our past actions both the things weve done right and the things weve done wrongFor the most part we dont observe our actions carefullyWe make the same mistakes over and over againWe cause ourselves suffering but dont take it to heart to prevent it from happening againThis is why we keep spinning around endlessly in the cycles of samsaraWe keep making mistakes but we dont recognize them as mistakesWe do things right from time to time but dont recognize why theyre rightSo everything gets all confusedBut if we train ourselves to be observant to keep cleansing the heart so that we wont repeat our mistakes a second time wont cause ourselves to suffer in that way a second time well be able to make choices that really benefit usWhen we look at our past beliefs and actions and then compare them with the actions of those who are wise well see which things are useless and well stop doing themBut if we dont let go of our old views we wont be able to stop doing the things we should stopWe wont be able to give up the things we should give upAs long as we hold onto our old views the same old sufferings will keep shadowing usWell never be able to find the path leading to the end of sufferingThis is why the noble eightfold path begins with sammaditthi or right viewRight view correctly describes things right around us  within and without us  that have always been that way from time immemorialSo when you see the Dhamma  the truth of things as they already are  youll be willing to let go of your old opinions and follow the path taught by the BuddhaFor the Buddha taught these truths so that we could study and know the genuine truthIt doesnt hurt to believe the BuddhaIt can only help usHis Awakening was for the benefit and happiness of the beings of the world for the purification of the beings of the world who have the wisdom and discernment to follow the path that he followedThe arising of a Buddha leads to suffering only for those whose pride prevents them from following his pathTheyre the only ones who dont benefit from his AwakeningWe should be open and honest with ourselves about our pride our viewsWe shouldnt hide them from ourselvesWe should bring them out and flush them outDont keep feeding themFor the most part theyre not the sort of friends who will help make us bright clean and pureDont go thinking that the ideas we like will necessarily help make us bright clean and pureWe should pry them out unfurl them clean them out so that all our defective views can be cut awayWhen were free of defective views well be left with impeccable views views that are a treasure in terms of our thinkingWhen our views are impeccable our virtues will be impeccableAnd when our virtues form a good solid foundation training the mind becomes easy and free from difficultiesThe problem right now is that our views run contrary to the truth and are always ready to make false assumptionsWe see stressful things as pleasurable short things as long things that should be done as things not to be doneWe see things that are filthy that should be straightened out to put them in line with the truth and we simply leave them as they are at odds with the truthSo how can we hope to gain release from sufferingHow can we hope to reach purityThe mind is something subtle and sensitive easily misled by subtle misunderstandings to say nothing of blatant onesThis is why the Buddha set out a training regime for our character habits to make us compliant and respectful toward the truth even in the smallest matters seeing danger in even the slightest faultsIn other words he pointed out even the slightest faults that we should avoid should abandon but we feel that we cant do without themWe dont see them as faultsThis means we dont see the frightening dangers that will arise from our own wrong actionsSo were audacious in doing whats wrongAs for the things the Buddha told us to do were not willing to do them not willing to follow him all because of our views and our prideThis is why we cant reach the stream to nibbanaIf we want to practice so as to abandon our pride so as to enter the stream to the transcendent we have to straighten out our views  in particular selfidentity viewsThese are the very first doorIf we cant straighten out these sorts of wrong views we wont be able to find the door through the wall that separates us from the DeathlessWell simply circle around the outside perimeterNo matter how many lifetimes we practice well just keep walking around the perimeter of the wall if we cant straighten out these viewsSo we should train ourselves to examine our many subtle views in all their elaborationsWe should give rise to conviction thats stronger than what we already haveWe should make our respect stronger than what it already is and be willing to follow the Buddhas instructionsWhen he says to renounce something we should renounce it even if it means putting our life on the line even if it means dyingOnly then will we come out victorious making an opening in the wall of our viewsIf were not willing to make that level of sacrifice theres no way well succeedSo remember this If were not willing to make that level of sacrifice theres no way well succeedIf you want to get through the final wall so as to gain total release from dying and birth you have to stop circling around the outside perimeter like thisIf you keep acting the way you are youll never gain release from suffering and stressSo try to be observant try to evaluate the preoccupations that lie buried in your heartWhat are the obstacles the defilements you have to undo so that you can come out victoriousIf you cant overcome them using one method try other methods until you canDont let them become you Dont let them become your self making you engage in Imaking and mymaking and selfidentity viewsOnce there are selfidentity views the stupidity of the mind will lead to uncertainty so that you cant come to any clear and genuine conclusionsYoull grasp at external things  this is whats called grasping at precepts and practices  like the Jains in the time of the Buddha who thought they would succeed in gaining release through external practices without training the mind to give rise to discernmentThey felt that if they followed their practices external forces would come and save them some god would come and save themBut the purity of our external actions is something only we can knowAs the Buddha taught theres no one else who can come and save usOnly we can save ourselvesTheres no god greater than the help we give ourselvesSo dont let yourself be misledVanquish your wrong views so that you can be genuinely compliant toward the Buddha genuinely believing in his teachings with genuine respectKeep on meditatingWhen we meditate we let go of our present preoccupationsNormally the mind is always preoccupied with the various objects that the eye sees the ear hears the nose smells the tongue tastes and the body comes into contact withBut when we want peace of mind we have to see these objects as coarse and grossWe try to let go of things that are gross things that are sensualWe focus instead on things that are more refined and of more lasting value step by stepWe keep on getting the mind to gather in stillness keep on letting go of everything elseIts like when we go to sleep we have to let go of distracting thoughts we have to stop thinking have to cut those things away if were going to sleep in comfortAs long as the mind is in a turmoil over those things and cant let them go it wont be able to fall asleepItll have no sense of ease wont gain any strengthEven more so when we meditate we have to cut away all our other preoccupations let them all go leaving only buddhoAdjust your attitude so that you can find a sense of ease at the same time youre repeating buddho to yourselfDont let yourself get bored or tired of the meditationHow do you develop a sense of easeThrough your conviction in what youre doingNo matter what the job if you can do it with a sense of conviction a sense of respect for your work you can keep at it continuouslyEven if the sun is beating down and youre all tired and worn out you can keep on doing itIf you do it with a sense of desire for the results a sense of persistence intentness and circumspection you can keep on doing it without getting tiredWhen you do your work with this attitude you can keep at it alwaysThis is why our teachers were able to live with a sense of contentment even when they were out in the mountain wildsThey put effort into their meditation with a sense of ease and wellbeing in the peace of mind they were able to maintain through restraining the mind with mindfulnessIf their hearts were already inclined to stillness and seclusion then as soon as the mind had developed its foundation they were able to keep it going without any difficultiesIt became automatic and they were able to experience a sense of wellbeing  the stillness the fullness the brightness of the mindSo adjusting the mind properly in this way is something very important for anyone who wants peace of mindKeep reminding yourself to develop an attitude of conviction and this will give energy and encouragement to your effortsIf your conviction persistence and mindfulness are strong youll be able to win out over any restless anxious sleepy or lazy states of mindYoull be able to win out over these things through the qualities of mind you developThe qualities of mind were developing are like strategic weaponsWe develop mindfulnessWe develop alertnessWe pick out our one object of meditation  This is what Im going to fasten on  and then we both keep it in mind and stay aware of itWhen we refuse to let go of it when we hold on tight to a single object it becomes the quality called singleness of preoccupationWhen this singleness of mind arises it can cut through restlessness cut through anxietyIt includes both mindfulness and persistence and can keep the mind firmly gathered in one placeWhen this singleness of mind arises it turns into firm concentrationThe mind gets more refined and can let go of everything else step by stepThis singleness is the refined part that holds through all the levels of right concentrationIn the first level you have to have singleness of preoccupation in chargeEven though theres also directed thought evaluation rapture and pleasure singleness of preoccupation has to be thereDirected thought and evaluation are the coarser parts of the concentrationYoull know as the mind gets more refined because it lets go of them leaving just singleness of preoccupation rapture and pleasureRapture is the coarsest of these three so you let go of it leaving just pleasure and singleness of preoccupationPleasure is the coarser of these two so you let go of it leaving just singleness of preoccupation and equanimityWhen the mind has a sense of steady equanimity firm and unwavering If you want to call it tender its tender in that it doesnt put up any resistance to the Dhamma doesnt resist the truth of things as they areIt doesnt disputeIts willing to accept that truthBut if you want to call it tough its tough in that its firm and unwaveringNormally when things are soft and tender they waver and move when theyre struck by anythingBut when the mind is tender in this way it becomes tough insteadNo one can fool itIt doesnt waver its not affected by anythingThis is the nature of the mind in concentrationWhy doesnt it waverBecause its seen the truthIts fullIts not hungry in any way that could make it waver that could let it get temptedIt doesnt want anything elseWe human beings when we have a sense of enough were freeFor this reason meditators need a solid theme that they can hold toIf you dont know or havent studied much Dhamma you can simply remember in brief that this body of ours is DhammaEvery part of it is DhammaConventional Dhammas formulated Dhammas all the way up to absolute Dhammas all can be found in this bodySo we should pay attention to the body as its actually present right hereWhen we know our own body we wont have any doubts about other people other bodiesSo to give strength to the mind we should repeat to ourselves any of the meditation themes dealing with the body so that the mind will settle down and come to restIf repeating buddho buddho is too refined for you  if you cant find anything to hold to or dont know where to focus  you can focus on the breathIts blatant enough for you to fix your attention on it  when it comes in you know its coming in when it goes out you know its going outOr if thats too refined you can focus on the parts of the bodyIf you want to focus on hair of the head repeat kesa kesa to yourselfYouve seen head hairs you can remember them so fix the memory in your mind and then repeat kesa kesaFor hair of the body you can repeat loma loma and so onRepeat the names of any of the parts until your awareness gathers in with the repetition and settles down into stillnessIf you want you can focus on any one of the bonesRepeat atthi atthiWhere is the bone youre focusing onIts really right thereWhat kinds of features does it haveIt really has them  after all youve seen bones beforeYou can remember what the big bones and little bones are likeSo call them to mind focus on them and repeat their names so as to build a firm foundation for concentration and mindfulness in the mindOnce your foundation is firm and steady from the practice of repetition you move on to investigation to insight meditationYou analyze these things to see them as aniccam or inconstantWhy does the Buddha say theyre inconstantWe want them to be constantWe dont want them to changeThe Buddha teaches us to let go of them but we cant let them go  because our views run contrary to the DhammaThats why we cant let goThe word let go here means that we dont hold onto themEven though we still live with them we just live with them nothing moreEven though we make use of these things we simply use them nothing moreEven though we make the body move its just movementYou have to keep this understanding in mind so that wrong views dont overwhelm youSo that delusion doesnt overwhelm youAs long as these things exist we make use of themAfter all theyre here to useThe Buddha and his noble disciples all made use of these things without any thought of their being anything other than what they are  that they might be constant that they might give rise to true pleasure that they might be us or ours We use these things in line with our duties as long as theyre here for us to useWhen they change into something else they change in line with their duties in line with the laws of the DhammaThe Buddha thus taught us to familiarize ourselves with whats normal in life aging is normal illness is normal death is normal separation from the people and things we love is normalWhen we analyze them we realize that theyre all going to have to leave usThey wont stay with us foreverWhen even these five khandhas that were looking after all the time arent really ours how can our children really be oursHow can our parents really be oursHow can our possessions really be oursTheyre all anatta notselfWe train and exercise our minds in this way until theyre adept in the same way that we memorize our lessons in schoolOnce theyre firmly imbedded in the mind the mind wont go against the truth of the DhammaIt will believe the truth of the Dhamma be inclined to follow the truth of the DhammaIt wont suffer for it follows in line with the laws of truthWhen we dont struggle against the truth of the Dhamma there wont be any sorrow or distress when things change for weve come to know and accept the truthSo all we have to do is come and know the truthIt doesnt lie far awayThe things that will cure our sufferings the most important things that will help us cross over birth and becoming all come simply from making our knowledge of whats truly here firm and unwavering so that it can push the mind lift the mind over and above any influences that might come to make an impact on it  so that it will gain release from defilement release from sorrow release from distressThe meditation were practicing here is simply for the purpose of knowing the truth as it actually isAs long as we havent yet reached it we wont see itWhen we dont see it all we know about it is news what weve read in books or heard on tapes or heard our teachers describeThats simply newsThe mind hasnt seen itThe ears have simply received it the eyes have simply taken it in from books but theyre simply passive receptors holding it as labels and memories thats allThe reaching has to be done by the heartThe heart is what reaches the truthAnd once the heart has reached it you dont have to worryItll be the hearts own treasureSo we have to train the heart to be intelligent so that it will gain true happiness true release from danger from suffering and stressPractice so that your mind reaches it so that it will see itAt the moment it hasnt gotten there yetSo far its all only in your ears and eyesSo we all have to put our hearts into the meditationFocus on whats truly here so that the heart will reach the truth  the noble truthsWhatever suffering or stress is here in your body and mind is all part of the dukkha sacca the noble truth of stressWhatever delusion passion or delight that depends on delusion  however much whatever the object within or without  is all samudaya sacca the noble truth of the origination of stressAll the things that we like that give rise to desire to the point of clinging when we get them we latch onto themWhen we lose them we look for them againWhen we dont have them we sufferThis is what makes the mind travel through all the levels of being great and smallIn the teaching on dependent coarising the Buddha said that it all comes from not knowingWe dont discern contact dont discern feeling dont discern craving dont discern clinging dont discern becoming dont discern birth all of this is called avijja or unawarenessSo do you discern these things yet or notWhen sights strike the eye day in and day out is your mindfulness ready to handle them or notIs your discernment up on the tricks of the defilements or notIf not you have to be observant to gather and restrict all your attention to whats right here for when defilements arise they arise right hereIf discernment is to see the defilements to the point of giving rise to right view itll have to see and know right hereIf we gather and restrict our attention to whats right here were sure to know and seeIf we want to be mindful and alert we cant do it anywhere elseRemember this point well and put it into practiceWhen these words are spoken you hear them but when you get up you forget themThen when the time comes to meditate again you dont know what to pick as your theme of practiceYou forget everything throw it all awaySo theres nothing but you  no Dhamma to know no Dhamma to see no Dhamma to put into practiceIts all you and yours your body and when the body is yours feelings are yours perceptions are yours thought constructs are yours consciousness is yoursSo you get possessive of whats yours and theres nothing left to be DhammaThats why your practice doesnt progressAll progress has to come from a point of one Once one is firmly established then there can be two and three If one is lacking everything else will be lackingActually when we separate things out there is no two or three When we dont lump things together theres only one Even groups of ten or twenty people are all made up of one person  that one person this one person that one person over thereSo in our practice we first have to establish one  this body of oursWhats here in the bodyWe have mental events and physical phenomena thats twoThen theres feeling pleasure pain neither pleasure nor pain thats threeWhen we separate things out theres lots of them but its all this one person this one lump sitting here encased in skinBut when you analyze things out you have hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin Here its already a lotThen you can analyze the eye consciousness formsIts a lot of things but all one thing one mass of suffering and stressNothing elseJust know this one thing until its all clearYou dont have to know a lot of things just this one bodyOnce you really see the truth the mind will let go of its burdensWe suffer because we keep piling things on  Thats us thats ours thats them thats theirs  through the power of attachment clinging to things not wanting them to changeWhen the mind starts meditating by mentally repeating its theme it can let things go for a whileYou hold onto buddho or any of the other themesYou dont take refuge in the bodyYou take refuge in buddho buddho until the mind settles downThat gives you a greater sense of wellbeing than you could get from these other thingsWhen you can let go even of this level of wellbeing youll reach the real buddhaThats where theres purity thats where theres true wellbeing with no more need to go swimming through birth and death no more need to torment yourself by having to sit and meditate like this again  because there will be nothing to torment nothing to meditate on any moreWhen you let go of everything there are no more issuesSo we meditate to give rise to the discernment that sees the drawbacks of things and lets go of them allThats when there are no more burdens no more kammaIt sounds easy but you have to let go of everythingIf you havent let go of everything theres more kamma to do more work to doSo were taught cago  renunciation patinissaggo  relinquishment mutti  release analayo  no place for the defilements to dwellSoKeep on meditatingThe edicts of King Asoka are a remarkable record of one of the most remarkable events in human history One mans efforts to rule an empire with a policy based on DhammaAsokas policy had three prongs administration based on Dhamma instruction in Dhamma for the populace and personal practice of Dhamma by the rulerThe edicts are direct evidence of the second prong and for the most part present Dhamma as a series of moral principles and rational behavior that should be common to all religionsHowever a few of them are addressed to Buddhists in particular and one of them  the Bhabru Rock Edict  deals with themes that are of interest not only to historians but also to Buddhists of all times and placesIt deals with what may be done to keep the True Dhamma alive for a long time and Asokas recommendation is a list of passages from the Buddhist Canon that he says all Buddhists  ordained or not  should listen to and reflect on frequentlyHere is the text of the edictHis Gracious Majesty King of Magadha bows down to the Sangha and  hoping that they are free from disease and living in peace  addresses them as follows You know well the extent of my reverence and faith in the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaWhatever has been said by the Buddha has of course been wellsaidBut may I be permitted to point out the passages of scripture I have selected that the True Dhamma might last a long time Vinayasamukasa Aliyavasani Anagatabhayani Munigatha Mauneyasute Upatisapasine and the Instructions to Rahula beginning with falsehood as taught by the Blessed OneReverend Sirs I would like the reverend bhikkhus and bhikkhunis  as well as the laymen and laywomen  to listen to these passages frequently and to ponder on themFor this reason Reverend Sirs I am having this enscribed so that they may know of my intentionAs might be imagined this passage has given rise to a great deal of conjecture ever since it was deciphered inNot the least of the questions is precisely which passages from the Canon Asoka is referring to or indeed if he was referring to a Canon anything like what we have todayScholars have spilt a fair amount of ink sparring over the answer and have managed to reach a consensus on the identity of four of the passages the Aliyavasani is the Discourse on the Traditions of the Noble Ones the Anagatabhayani are the four discourses on Future Dangers the Munigatha is the Discourse on the Sage in the Sutta Nipata and the Instructions to Rahula are the CulaRahulovada SuttaThe other three passages have proven more intractableA number of scholars have favored the Nalaka Sutta as the Mauneyasute  this in spite of the fact that there is a Moneyya Sutta in the Anguttara NikayaThe Upatisapasine is problematic because there is no one passage of that name and because Sariputta asks so many questions in the CanonSome scholars have proposed the Sariputta Sutta in the Sutta Nipata but archaeological evidence  votive tablets produced beginning with the time of Asoka and originating in the Buddhist pilgrim sites  show that VenAssajis answer to Sariputtas first question about the doctrine the answer that sparked a vision of the Dhamma in Sariputta when he heard it has long been regarded as the ideal epitome of the Buddhas teachingsThis tradition may have connections with this very edictAsk any knowledgeable Buddhists today what Sariputtas most famous question was and they will in all likelihood answer with this oneAs for the Vinayasamukase this has sparked the most fanciful conjectures because the single reference to this word in the Canon is buried in a book hardly anyone reads the ParivaraThe reference itself says nothing more than that there are four vinayasamukkamsa  innate principles of the Vinaya  but the Commentary identifies them as the four Great Standards  most likely the four mentioned in the Mahavagga dealing specifically with Vinaya rather than the four in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta which deal with Dhamma and Vinaya togetherThis seems to settle the question of which passages Asoka was recommending but it raises another one Why theseAnd why in this orderPerhaps the best approach to answering these questions would be to read the passages and ponder on them as Asoka suggestedSo here they areMost of them are selfexplanatory except for the first on the innate principles of Vinaya and the poem on the sage which  being a poem  occasionally makes use of imagery that might be unfamiliar to a modern readerThus I include in the translation of The Sage a set of notes drawing mostly from the Commentary but also from other parts of the Canon and from works on ancient culture in generalAs for the Innate Principles of the Vinaya the passage itself contains nothing unremarkable and it seems so obvious on first reading that one might wonder why anyone would call attention to itActually it is a fine example of the Buddhas farsightedness in setting up a system of teachings and rulesThere are bound to be a number of things not touched on in the rules and this number is bound to grow as culture and technology changeAn unenlightened approach to these changes would say either that anything not allowed is forbidden or that anything not explicitly forbidden is allowedThe Innate Principles of the Vinaya set forth a system of interpretation that avoids both of these extremes helping to ensure the long life of the Buddhas doctrine and discipline by setting guidelines for expanding the rules to cover new objects and situations as they ariseOtherwise as CvVIIstates disagreements over what is and is not allowable can become grounds for a schism in the SanghaAnd as ANstates schism within the Sangha is a major cause for the True Dhammas decline and disappearanceThe Commentaries tell us that the Sangha became split during Asokas reign and his Sarnath edict gives detailed instructions on how to deal with potential schismatics in the SanghaGiven that Asoka  or his monastic advisers  saw schism as an immediate and present danger it is small wonder that he would begin his list of recommended passages with a pragmatic guide immediately applicable to promoting harmony in the Sangha and through that harmony to the long life of the True DhammaNow at that time uncertainty arose in the monks with regard to this and that item Now what is allowed by the Blessed OneWhat is not allowed They told this matter to the Blessed OneBhikkhus whatever I have not objected to saying This is not allowable if it fits in with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable this is not allowable for youWhatever I have not objected to saying This is not allowable if it fits in with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable this is allowable for youAnd whatever I have not permitted saying This is allowable if it fits in with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable this is not allowable for youAnd whatever I have not permitted saying This is allowable if it fits in with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable this is allowable for you MvVIThese four traditions of the Noble Ones  original

east conquers displeasure and is not conquered by displeasureIf he lives in the west the north the south he conquers displeasure and is not conquered by displeasureWhy is thatBecause the wise one endures both pleasure and displeasureThis is what the Blessed One saidHaving said this he said furtherMonks these five future dangers are just enough when considered for a monk living in the

sagacity verbal sagacity and mental sagacityAnd what is bodily sagacityThere is the case where a monk abstains from taking life abstains from theft abstains from unchastityThis is called bodily sagacityAnd what is verbal sagacityThere is the case where a monk abstains from lying abstains from divisive talebearing abstains from harsh language abstains from idle chatterThis is called verbal sagacityAnd what is mental sagacityThere is the case where a monk who  with the wasting away of the mental fermentations  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and nowThis is called mental sagacityThese monks are the three forms of sagacityNow at that time the wanderer Sanjaya was residing in Rajagaha with a large company of wanderers  in allAnd at that time Sariputta and Moggallana were practicing the holy life under SanjayaThey had made this agreement Whoever attains the Deathless first will inform the otherThen VenAssaji arising early in the morning taking his robe and bowl entered Rajagaha for alms Gracious in the way he approached and departed looked forward and behind drew in and stretched out his arm his eyes downcast his every movement consummateSariputta the wanderer saw VenAssaji going for alms in Rajagaha gracious his eyes downcast his every movement consummateOn seeing him the thought occurred to him Surely of those in this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship this is oneWhat if I were to approach him and question him On whose account have you gone forthWho is your teacherIn whose Dhamma do you delight But then the thought occurred to Sariputta the wanderer This is the wrong time to question himHe is going for alms in the townWhat if I were to follow behind this monk who has found the path for those who seek itThen VenAssaji having gone for alms in Rajagaha left taking the alms he had receivedSariputta the wanderer approached him and on arrival having exchanged friendly greetings and engaged in polite conversation stood to one sideAs he stood there he said Your faculties are bright my friend your complexion pure and clearOn whose account have you gone forthWho is your teacherIn whose Dhamma do you delightThere is my friend the Great Contemplative a son of the Sakyans gone forth from a Sakyan familyI have gone forth on account of that Blessed OneThat Blessed One is my teacherIt is in that Blessed Ones Dhamma that I delightBut what is your teachers teachingWhat does he proclaimI am new my friend not long gone forth only recently come to this doctrine and disciplineI cannot explain the doctrine in detail but I can give you the gist in briefThen Sariputta the wanderer spoke thus to the VenAssajiThen VenAssaji gave this Dhamma exposition to Sariputta the WandererThen to Sariputta the Wanderer as he heard this Dhamma exposition there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationThen Sariputta the wanderer went to where Moggallana the wanderer was stayingMoggallana the wanderer saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said Your faculties are bright my friend your complexion pure and clearCould it be that you have attained the DeathlessYes my friend I have attained the DeathlessBut how friend did you attain the DeathlessJust now friend I saw VenAssaji going for alms in Rajagaha gracious in the way he approached and departed looked forward and behind drew in and stretched out his arm his eyes downcast his every movement consummateOn seeing him the thought occurred to me Surely of those in this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship this is oneWhat if I were to approach him and question him On whose account have

exposition there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Rajagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Feeding GroundAt that time VenRahula was staying at the Mango StoneThen the Blessed One arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to where VenRahula was staying at the Mango StoneVenRahula saw him coming from afar and on seeing him set out a seat and water for washing the feetThe Blessed One sat down on the seat set out and having sat down washed his feetVenRahula bowing down to the Blessed One sat to one sideThen the Blessed One having left a little bit of water in the water dipper said to VenRahula Rahula do you see this little bit of leftover water remaining in the water dipperYes sirThats how little of a contemplative there is in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lieHaving tossed away the little bit of leftover water the Blessed One said to VenRahula Rahula do you see how this little bit of leftover water is tossed awayYes sirWhatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away just like thatHaving turned the water dipper upside down the Blessed One said to VenRahula Rahula do you see how this water dipper is turned upside downYes sirWhatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is turned upside down just like thatHaving turned the water dipper rightside up the Blessed One said to VenRahula Rahula do you see how empty and hollow this water dipper isYes sirWhatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is empty and hollow just like thatRahula its like a royal elephant immense pedigreed accustomed to battles its tusks like chariot polesHaving gone into battle it uses its forefeet and hind feet its forequarters and hindquarters its head and ears and tusks and tail but will simply hold back its trunkThe elephant trainer notices that and thinks This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king But when the royal elephant having gone into battle uses its forefeet and hind feet its forequarters and hindquarters its head and ears and tusks and tail and his trunk the trainer notices that and thinks This royal elephant has given up its life to the kingThere is nothing it will not doThe same holds true with anyone who feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie There is no evil I tell you he will not doThus Rahula you should train yourself I will not tell a deliberate lie even in jestWhat do you think Rahula What is a mirror forFor reflection sirIn the same way Rahula bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions are to be done with repeated reflectionWhenever you want to perform a bodily action you should reflect on it This bodily action I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an

in the course of the past who purified their bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions did it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions in just this wayAll those contemplatives and brahmans in the course of the future who will purify their bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions will do it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions in just this wayAll those contemplatives and brahmans at present who purify their bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions do it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions in just this wayTherefore Rahula you should train yourself I will purify my bodily actions through repeated reflectionI will purify my verbal actions through repeated reflectionI will purify my mental actions through repeated reflection That is how you should train yourselfThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified VenRahula delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsWhether King Asoka selected these texts on his own or had the advice of his mentor VenMoggaliputtatissa no one knowsStill it is possible to derive from them a conception of Dhamma of which Asoka approved whether or not it originated with himOne of the main points of this selection is that Dhamma is a quality of a person rather than of doctrines or ideasThe central passage in the selection and its only extended poem  The Sage  paints an idealized picture of the Dhamma as embodied in the deeds words and attitudes of the person who practices itOnly if the Dhamma finds concrete expression in peoples lives will it lastThe selection also shows something of the educational strategy Asoka might have had his Dhamma officials use in teaching his populace  Buddhist and nonBuddhist  to make the Dhamma a reality in their livesThe texts are not listed in random orderInstead they follow a pattern to impress on their listeners first that the ideals of the Dhamma are timeless and welltested and that there is a need to realize them as quickly as possibleThen they analyze the ideal present a picture of it in action and end with the basic principles for putting it into practiceThe title of the first passage  the Vinaya samukase  is explained in the Commentary as follows Samukase means that the principles are innately true established of their own accordWhether or not a Buddha arises to point them out they are true in and of themselvesThe second passage The Traditions of the Noble Ones brings in the perspective of time that is to provide a recurring theme throughout Asokas selectionsIt looks back to the past to show how venerable timetested and pure the traditions of the Dhamma areIt plays on the notion of the traditions of a noble family  unadulterated not open to criticism or suspicion  that were so important in ancient IndiaIt even plays on words The traditions of a family were supposed to enable those who followed them to conquer their enemies while the noble traditions taught by the Buddha enable one to overcome ones true enemy displeasure in the mindTurning from the past to look at the future the third set of selections  the four discourses on future dangers  presents a warningThe practice of the Dhamma should not be put off to a later date because there is no certainty that the future will provide any opportunities for practiceFirst there are the dangers of death aging illness famine and social turmoil in ones own lifeSecondly there are the dangers of degeneracy in the religion when those who are supposed to practice it ignore the noble traditions and teachings and instead do many unseemly inappropriate things simply for the sake of material comfortThe point of this set of passages of course is to give a sense of urgency to ones practice so that one will make the effort to take advantage of the teachings while one canThe Sage taking up the theme of danger goes on to present an ideal of inner safety in the present tense an ideal already embodied in the lives of those who have practiced the religion in fullIt shows the actions and attitudes of one who finds his happiness not in relationships  and the homebuilding and foodraising they entail  but instead in the peace that comes in living a solitary life subsisting on whatever food one may receive as alms free to meditate in the wildernessThe next passage  Sagacity  analyzes this ideal into three qualities of body speech and mind and the sixth passage shows the ideal in action VenAssaji simply by the graciousness of his manner inspires Sariputta the wanderer to follow him and with a few wellchosen words he enables Sariputta to gain a glimpse of the DeathlessThis is thus no empty idealThis passage also contains what has long been recognized as the most succinct expression of the Four Noble Truths  suffering its cause its cessation and the path to its cessation  just as the discourse on Sagacity contains one of the most succinct expressions of the goal of training ones actions in body speech and mindThe final passage shows how this goal may be brought about focusing on the development of two qualities  truthfulness and constant reflection  that underlie every stage of the practiceAlthough the earlier passages focus on the monk as the ideal this one shows that the practice builds on qualities that anyone  lay or monastic man woman or child  can develop withinIt also ends with a return to the theme of time and the timelessness of the Dhamma Whoever in the past future or present develops purity  or sagacity  in thought word or deed will have to do it in this way and this way onlyThere is no otherIt is possible to search in Asokas selection for passages that may have had personal meaning for him  the reference to the Deathless as the Sorrowless state the image of the peacock the emblem of his dynasty the image of the elephant who has given its life up to the king  but he himself would probably have preferred that Buddhists reflect on these selections to see what passages have meaning for themThe fact that the Dhamma is alive today is due in no small measure to his effortsBuddhists today can carry on his work by doing as he asked Reading and reflecting often on these selections and consistently applying the principles of truthfulness and selfexamination to their own lives Knowing the Dhamma means knowing the truthWhere does the Dhamma lieNot far off at allWhere are rupadhammasAre there any physical phenomena within usAre any namadhammas within usTheyre both within us but we dont know how to read them to decipher them because we havent yet studied themOr even when we have tried to study them we still cant decipher them in line with the standards set by the BuddhaSo lets try to decipher our body our actions in thought word and deedOur actions dont lie anywhere elseThey show themselves in the activity of the bodySo we use the body in line with the Dhamma abstaining from the activities that defile it killing stealing engaging in illicit sexWhen we abstain from these things weve begun practicing the DhammaWe abstain from telling lies from divisive speech from abusive speech from idle chatterWhen were mindful to show restraint in what we say we wont encounter any dangers coming from our speechThere are no dangers when we practice in line with the Buddhas wayAs for the mind we cleanse it by meditatingWe use mindfulness to look after the heart to make sure it doesnt get involved in anything defiling or uncleanWe keep it cheerful blooming and bright in its meditation in investigating the Dhamma knowing the Dhamma seeing the Dhamma until it settles down in the stillness that weve developed and kept composedWe keep it blooming and brightWherever you go this is how you should practiceMake your composure continuousThe mind will then gain strength so that it can let go of its external preoccupations and stay focused exclusively within at peace and at ease bright and clear staying right hereThen when you want to gain discernment you can investigateFocus mindfulness on keeping the body in mind and then investigate itThis is called dhammavicaya investigating phenomenaYou investigate the physical phenomena in the body to see them in line with the four noble truthsYou look at the arising of physical phenomena right hereYou look at the aging the illness the death of phenomena right here within youIf you really look for it youll see that the body is full of deathHow do we see death when the body is still breathing and able to walk aroundWe can see it if our discernment is subtle and preciseThe Buddha saw death with every inandout breath so why cant weHe once asked VenAnanda how often he paid attention to death in the course of a day and Ananda answered One hundred times The Buddhas response was Youre still too complacentYou should pay attention to death with every inandout breath What kind of death can you look at with every inandout breathWhatever fades away ends and disappears thats deathAs for the death of the whole body that comes closer every day closer with each inandout breathThis runs down that wears outWe have to keep creating things to replace what gets worn outAnd whatever we create keeps wearing out tooSo we should keep track of the wearing out  whats called vayadhamma degenerationThe Buddha saw this with every momentThis is the sort of seeing that allows us to see the noble truth that birth is stressful aging is stressfulTheres no ease in agingLook so that you see this clearlyPain and illness are stressful death is stressful all the affairs that come with birth create hardships turmoil and stressWhen you investigate in line with the Buddhas Dhamma youll see the truth for yourself in every way just as the Buddha didFor its all right hereYoull gain discernment and intelligence no longer deluded into grasping hold of suffering and making it your self no longer grasping hold of inconstant things and making them your selfWhatevers inconstant leave it as inconstant and dont make it youWhatevers stressful leave it as stressful and dont make it youTheres no you in any of those thingsWhen you aim your investigation in the direction of seeing this clearly the mind will let go and attain peace inner solitude free from clingingIts as when we carry something heavy on our shoulderWe know its heavy because its weighing on our shoulderBut when we put it down its no longer heavy on usIn the same way when we see that birth is stressful aging is stressful illness is stressful death is stressful then we should examine those things as they arise to see that theyre not usThen well be able to let them goWe should look after our mind to make sure that it doesnt give rise to the assumption that any of those things are us or ours or that they lie within usThose things are just objects elements and we leave them at thatStress then has no owner on the receiving endIts just like when you put down a burden theres nothing heavy about it at allSo stress is nothing more than things coming together to make contactSuppose that we have a big hunk of limestoneWhen we lift it up its heavyBut if we burn it in a fire pound it into dust and the wind blows it away then wheres the heavinessIts nowhere at allBefore when the limestone was still in the ground they had to use explosives to get it outIt was so heavy that they needed cranes to lift it upBut now that its pulverized the heaviness is goneIts the same with suffering and stressIf we investigate them down to the details so that we can see them clearly for what they truly are theres no self there at allWe get down to the basic elements of experience and we see that theyre not our self in the least little bitIf we look at the hair of the head its not selfFingernails and toenails are not selfLook at every part of the body in detailOr look at its elementary propertiesExactly where are you in any of those thingsTheres no you in there at allThe same is true when you look at feelingsTheres no you in there at allTheres simply contact the contact of objects against the senses thats allIf you let go so the mind can come to rest none of these things will touch it in a way that weighs on itOnly deluded people grab hold of these things which is why they feel weighed downIf we let them go we dont feel weighed down at allWhen we let go of the aggregates theyre not stressfulBut we dont know how to let them go because of birthLike the mental state youve given rise to here youve created it so that it will take birthOnce youve given rise to it then  unless youre given a good reason  theres no way youll be willing to let it goIts the same as when someone suddenly comes to chase us out of our homeWho would be willing to goWed go only if we were offered a better place to stay  a safer more comfortable place to stayIf we were offered such a place who would be willing to stayIf we had a better place to go we could abandon our old home with no problemIn the same way if were going to let go of the blatant aggregates we need a better place to stay a home for the mind a state of concentrationJust like the Buddha and his noble disciples when they let go of the blatant aggregates they entered cessation they entered jhanaWhen they fully let go of all aggregates they entered nibbanaWe however dont yet have anything else to depend on which is why we cant let goWe first have to create a refuge for ourselvesAt the very least we should try to keep buddho buddho in mindWhen we really reach buddho  when the mind is really a mind awake  then we can depend on itAt the moment though we havent reached the mind awakeWeve reached nothing but the demons of defilement and they keep haunting usWere embroiled with nothing but demons we lie under their powerFor instance maccumara the demon of death whose followers  aging and illness  we fear so muchKilesamara delusions and defilementsThese are all demonsKhandhamara our attachments to the five aggregates are all demonsAbhisankharamara the thoughts we create good or bad are all demons if we fall for them  meritorious creations demeritorious creations imperturbable creationsThese are the subtle demons the demons that bedeviled the Buddha on the way to Awakening dressing themselves up as this and thatIf were going to let go of these things we first need something better to hold ontoAt the very least we need jhana levels of mental stillness more refined than what we have at presentSo we should all try to give rise to the refined levels of peace and ease Ive mentioned hereWhen we get disenchanted with turmoil we can enter a state of stillnessWhen we get disenchanted with defilement we can cleanse the heart and make it bright with the DhammaWell have our home in the Dhamma in concentrationThe heart can then delight with rapture and ease as its foodWell have no desire for coarse foodWhen we let go of the blatant aggregates we enter the Brahma level of refined rapture and easeEven the sensual devas dont eat coarse food like oursAs for the Brahmas theyre even clearer than that more radiant within themselvesTheir jhana is pure and their concentration radiantThe food of this concentration is the rapture and ease they experienceEven here on the human level when we gain rapture from concentration we feel full and happyIf we abandon the blatant aggregates leaving just the mind in its attainment of concentration imagine how much pleasure and ease there will beWell no longer have to be involved in these heavy burdens of oursWe wont have to worry about the five or the eight precepts because well be in a pure state of jhana with no thought of getting stuck on anything defilingThe mind will be brightWhen you understand this focus back on your heartExamine it carefullyBe intent on practicing heedfully and youll meet with prosperity and easeIn general terms Right Concentration means establishing the mind rightlyOn one level this can apply to all the factors of the pathYou have to start out by setting the mind on Right ViewIn other words you use your discernment to gather together all the Dhamma youve heardThen when you set the mind on Right Resolve thats also a way of establishing it rightlyThen you set it on Right Speech speaking only things that are rightYou set it on Right Action examining your actions and then forcing yourself watching over yourself to keep your actions firmly in line with whats rightAs for Right Livelihood you set your mind on providing for your livelihood exclusively in a right wayYoure firm in not making a livelihood in ways that are wrong not acting in ways that are wrong not speaking in ways that are corrupt and wrongYou wont make any effort in ways that go off the path you wont be mindful in ways that lie outside the pathYoull keep being mindful in ways that stay on the pathYou make this vow to yourself as a firm determinationThis is one level of establishing the mind rightlyBut what I want to talk about today is Right Concentration in the area of meditation in other words Right Meditation both in the area of tranquillity meditation and in the area of insight meditationYou use the techniques of tranquillity meditation to bring the mind to stillnessWhen you make the mind still firm in skillful qualities thats one aspect of Right ConcentrationIf the mind isnt firmly established in skillful qualities it cant grow stillIf unskillful qualities arise in the mind it cant settle down and enter concentrationThis is why when the Buddha describes the mind entering concentration he says Vivicceva kamehi Quite secluded from sensual preoccupationsThe mind isnt involved doesnt incline itself toward sights that will give rise to infatuation and desireIt doesnt incline itself toward sounds that it likes toward aromas tastes or tactile sensations for which it feels infatuation through the power of desireAt the same time it doesnt incline itself toward desire for those thingsBefore the mind can settle into concentration it has to let go of these five types of preoccupationsThis is called vivicceva kamehi quite secluded from sensual preoccupationsVivicca akusalehi dhammehi quite secluded from the unskillful qualities called the five HindrancesFor example the first Hindrance is sensual desireWhen you sit in meditation and a defilement arises in the mind when you think of something and feel desire for an internal or an external form when you get infatuated with the things youve seen and known in the past thats called sensual desireOr if you think of something that makes you dissatisfied to the point of feeling ill will for certain people or objects thats the Hindrance of ill willThings from the past that upset you suddenly arise again in the present barge their way in to obstruct the stillness of your mindWhen the mind gets upset in this way thats an unskillful mental state acting as an obstacle to concentrationOr sloth and torpor a sense of laziness and inattentiveness when the mind isnt intent on its work and so lets go out of laziness and carelessnessIt gets drowsy so that it cant be intent on its meditationYou sit here thinking buddho buddho but instead of focusing the mind to get it firmly established so that it can gain knowledge and understanding from its buddho you throw buddho away to go play with something elseAs awareness gets more refined you get drowsy and fall asleep or else let delusion overcome the mindThis is an unskillful mental state called sloth and torporThen theres restlessness and anxiety when mindfulness isnt keeping control over things and the mind follows its preoccupations as they shoot out to things you like and dont likeThe normal state of peoples minds is that when mindfulness isnt in charge the mind cant sit stillIts bound to keep thinking about different kinds of thingsSo when youre practicing concentration you have to exercise restraint you have to be careful that the mind doesnt get scattered aboutYou have to be mindful of the present and alert to the present tooWhen you try to keep buddho in mind you have to be alert at the same time to watch over your buddhoOr if youre going to be mindful of the parts of the body  like hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin  you should focus on only one part at a time making sure that youre both mindful and alert to your mindfulness to make sure you dont go being mindful of other thingsThats how you can cut off restlessness and anxietyAs you keep being mindful of the same thing for a long time the body will gradually calm down and relaxThe preoccupations of the mind will calm down too so that the mind can grow stillIt grows still because you keep it under controlYou weaken its unruliness  as when you pull fuel away from a burning fireAs you keep pulling away the fuel the fire gradually grows weaker and weakerAnd whats the fuel for the minds unrulinessForgetfulnessInattentivenessThis inattentiveness is the fuel both for restlessness and anxiety and for sloth and torporWhen you keep mindfulness and alertness in charge you cut away forgetfulness and inattentivenessAs these forms of delusion are subdued they lose their powerThey gradually disband leaving nothing but awareness of buddho or whatever your meditation object isAs you keep looking after your meditation object firmly without growing inattentive restlessness will disappearDrowsiness will disappearThe mind will get firmly established in Right ConcentrationThis is how you enter Right ConcentrationYou have to depend on both mindfulness and alertness togetherRight Concentration cant simply arise on its ownIt needs supporting factorsThe first seven factors of the path are the supporters for Right Concentration or its requisites the things it needs to depend onIt needs Right View Right Resolve Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort and Right MindfulnessAs you keep developing the beginning factors of the path concentration becomes more and more refined step by stepWhen the mind is trained and suffused with these qualities its able to let go of sensual preoccupations able to let go of unskillful mental qualitiesVivicceva kamehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehiWhen its secluded from sensual preoccupations secluded from unskillful qualities it can enter concentrationIt experiences stillness rapture pleasure singleness of preoccupationBoth body and mind feel lightIn the first stage the mind isnt totally refined because it still has directed thought and evaluation in the factors of its concentrationIf your mindfulness is in good shape and can keep its object in mind without pulling away if your effort is right and alertness keeps watching over things the coarser parts of your concentration will drop away and the mind will grow more refined step by stepDirected thought and evaluation  the coarser parts  will drop away because they cant follow into that more refined stageAll thats left is rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupationAs you keep on meditating without letup things keep growing more refined step by stepRapture which is coarser than pleasure will drop away leaving the pleasurePleasure is coarser than equanimityAs you keep contemplating while the mind grows more refined the pleasure will disappear leaving just equanimityAs long as theres still pleasure equanimity cant ariseAs long as the mind is still feeding off pleasure its still engaged with something coarseBut as you keep up your persistent effort until you see that this pleasure still comes under the Three Characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself that its part of the aggregate of feeling the mind will let go of that coarser aspect and settle down with equanimityEven though equanimity too is part of the feeling aggregate its a feeling refined enough to cleanse the mind to the point where it can give rise to knowledge of refined levels of DhammaWhen the mind reaches this level its firm and unwavering because its totally neutralIt doesnt waver when the eye sees a form the ear hears a sound the nose smells an aroma the tongue tastes a flavor the body feels a tactile sensation or an idea comes to the mindNone of these things can make the mind waver when its in the factors of jhanaIt maintains a high level of purityThis is Right ConcentrationWe should all develop tranquillity meditation which can give temporary respite from suffering and stressBut in a state like this you simply have mindfulness in chargeDiscernment is still too weak to uproot the most refined levels of defilement and latent tendenciesThus for our Right Concentration to be complete were taught not to get carried away with the sense of pleasure it bringsWhen the mind has been still for an appropriate amount of time we should then apply the mind to contemplating the five aggregates for these aggregates are the basis for insight meditationYou cant develop insight meditation outside of the five aggregates  the aggregates of form feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousness  for these aggregates lie right within usTheyre right next to us with us at all timesSoHow do you develop the aggregate of form as a basis for insight meditationYou have to see it clearly in line with its truth that form is inconstantThis is how you beginAs you develop insight meditation you have to contemplate down to the detailsWhat is formForm covers hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin and all the four great elements that we can touch and seeAs for subsidiary forms they cant be seen with the eye but they can be touched and they depend on the four great elementsFor example sound is a type of form a type of subsidiary formAromas flavors tactile sensations are subsidiary forms that depend on the four great elementsThe sensory powers of the eye ear nose tongue and body are subsidiary forms  theyre physical events not mental events you knowThen there are masculinity and femininity which fashion the body to be male or female and create differences in male and female voices manners and other characteristicsThen theres the heart and then viññatirupa which allows for the body to move for speech to be spokenSo the Buddha taught that we should contemplate form in all its aspects so as to gain the insight enabling us to withdraw all our clinging assumptions that theyre us or oursHow does this happenWhen we contemplate well see that yam kiñci rupam atitanagatapaccuppannam all form  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is inconstant stressful and notselfIt all lies under the Three CharacteristicsWhen we remember this thats called pariyattidhamma the Dhamma of studyWhen we actually take things apart and contemplate them one by one to the point where we gain true knowledge and vision thats called the practice of insight meditation the discernment arising in line with the way things actually areThis is a short explanation of insight meditation focused just on the aggregate of formAs for feeling  the pleasures pains and feelings of neither pleasure nor pain within us  once weve truly seen form well see that the same things apply to feelingIts inconstantWhen its inconstant itll have to make us undergo suffering and stress because of that inconstancyWell be piling suffering on top of sufferingActually theres no reason why the mind should suffer from these things but we still manage to make ourselves suffer because of themEven though theyre notself theres suffering because we dont knowTheres inconstancy because we dont knowUnless we develop insight meditation to see clearly and know truly we wont be able to destroy the subtle latent tendency of ignorance the latent tendency of becoming the latent tendency of sensuality within ourselvesBut if were able to develop insight meditation to the point where we see form clearly in terms of the Three Characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself then disenchantment will ariseWhen the latent tendencies of ignorance and becoming are destroyed the latent tendency of sensuality will have no place to standTheres nothing it can fabricate for theres no delusionWhen ignorance disbands fabrications disbandWhen fabrications disband all the suffering that depends on fabrication will have to disband as wellThis is why we should practice meditation in line with the factors of the noble eightfold path as set down by the BuddhaTo condense it even further there are three trainings virtue concentration and discernmentVirtue  exercising restraint over our words and deeds  is part of the pathtranquillity meditation and insight meditation come under concentrationSo virtue concentration and discernment cover the pathOr if you want to condense things even further there are physical phenomena and mental phenomena  ie the body and mindWhen we correctly understand the characteristics of the body well see into the ways the body and mind are interrelatedThen well be able to separate them outWell see whats notself and what isnt notselfThings in and of themselves arent notself for they each have an inandofthemselvesIts not the case that theres nothing there at allIf there were nothing there at all how would there be contactThink about itTake the fire element who could destroy itEven though its notself its got an inandofitselfThe same holds true with the other elementsIn other words these things still exist simply that theres no more clingingSo I ask that you understand this and then put it correctly into practice so as to meet with happiness and progressThats enough explanation for nowKeep on meditating until the time is upSurvey your bodySurvey your mindYouve been practicing meditation continuously so even if your mind isnt yet quiet even though it hasnt reached a level of concentration as solid as youd like it to be meditation is still a skillful activity in terms of developing conviction developing persistenceAt the very least it will give results on the sensory level making you an intelligent person at the same time developing the perfections of your character on into the futureSo try not to get discouragedDont let yourself think that you havent seen any results from your meditationWhen you come right down to it what do you want from your meditationYou meditate to make the mind quiet and the mind becomes quiet from letting goThats what the meditation is letting goIf you meditate in order to get something thats craving the cause of sufferingMeditation isnt an affair of cravingThe Dhamma is already here so all we have to do is study it so that well know the truthThe truth isnt something newIts something thats been here from time immemorialAll the Buddhas of the past have awakened to this very same Dhamma this very same truthEven though the cosmos has changed from one aeon to another the Dhamma hasnt changed along with the cosmosNo matter which aeon a particular Buddha was born in he awakened to the same old truthHe taught the same old truthThe same Dhamma the same truth is always right here all the timeIts simply that we dont recognize itWe havent studied it down to its elemental propertiesAll I ask is that you be intent on studying itThe truth is always the truthIts always presentThe truth the Buddha taught starts with the principle that stressandsuffering is a truthDo you have any stress and sufferingExamine yourself carefullyIs there any stress and suffering within youOr is there none at allAs long as theres suffering within you the truth of the noble truths taught by the Buddha is still thereWhen youre mindful to keep your eye on the suffering appearing within you youre studying the truth in line with what it actually isBut in addition to pointing out the truth of suffering the Buddha also taught the path to the end of sufferingThis too is a truthThe Buddha has guaranteed that when we develop it in full measure well gain release from stress and sufferingIts not the case that suffering is the only truth that we have to lie buried in stress and sufferingThe Buddha found a way out of suffering like an intelligent doctor who not only understands diseases but also knows a miraculous medicine to cure themThis is why the truth of the path is so important for many many people who have put it into practice have gotten resultsThe truth of the path is something we put into practice to gain release from suffering  as we chanted just nowYe dukkham nappajanatiThose who dont discern sufferingAtho dukkhassa sambhavamSufferings causeTañca maggam na janatiWho dont understand the pathDukkhupasamagaminamThe way to the stilling of sufferingTe ve jatijarupagaTheyll return to birth and aging againIf we dont comprehend suffering and the way to the end of suffering well have to experience birth aging and death which are the causes not only of suffering but also of the craving leading to more sufferingWe should take joy in the fact that we have all the noble truths we needWe have suffering and the path to the end of suffering doesnt lie far awayWhen we look into the texts we find that the Buddha and his noble disciples didnt practice anything far awayThey purified the actions of their bodies and mindsThey did this by knowing their own bodies and minds in line with what they actually wereWhen we dont know our own bodies and minds as they actually are thats a cause of sufferingWhen we practice knowing our own bodies our own minds as they actually are thats the path to release from sufferingAside from this theres no path at allWe already have a bodyWe already have a mind  this knowing propertySo we take this knowing property and put it to use by studying the body in line with its three characteristics aniccata inconstancy dukkhata stressfulness and anattata notselfnessnessInconstancy and stressfulness lie on the side of suffering and its causeWe have to study things that are inconstant in order to see who they are whos responsible for them who really owns themThis issue of inconstancy is really importantRupam aniccam form is inconstantWho owns the formRupam dukkham form is stressfulWhos on the receiving end of the stressStress is something that has to depend on causes and conditions in order to ariseIt doesnt come on its ownJust like sound we have to depend on contact in order to hear itIf theres no contact we wont know where theres any soundIn the same way stress depends on contactIf theres no contact we wont know where theres any stressIf stress and suffering were able to burn us all on their own the Buddha would never have been able to gain release from themThere would be no way for us to practice for no matter what suffering would keep on burning us all on its ownBut the fact of the matter is that when we practice we can gain relief from suffering because suffering isnt built into the mind its not built into this knowing propertyIt has to depend on contact through the sense media in order for it to ariseThis is why sages study the truthAs when we chantAyam kho me kayoThis body of mineUddham padatalaFrom the soles of the feet on upAdho kesamatthakaFrom the crown of the head on downTacapariyantoSurrounded by skinWithin this body we have all five aggregates form feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousnessForm is the coarsest of the aggregates for we can touch it with our hand and see it with our eyesAs for feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousness theyre mental phenomenaEven though we cant touch them with the body we can still know them and experience themFor instance we constantly have feelings of pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor painPerception we remember things and label themThoughtfabrication creates thoughts and consciousness notices thingsWe all notice things label them fabricate thoughts about them and experience pleasure and pain because of themThe primary issue is the form of the bodyThe Buddha taught us to study it in order to know the noble truths in both form and mental phenomenaWhen he taught that birth is suffering aging is suffering death is suffering he was referring to the birth aging and death right here at the form where the five aggregates meet  this form we already haveAnd yet most of us dont like to reflect on the truth of these thingsWe think that birth is pleasurableWe get pleasure and stress all confusedIts because we dont realize the truth of these things that we dont search for a way outThe Buddha however knew this truth which was why he practiced contemplating itHe tested to see if birth is pleasurable by noticing if the mind could stay quiet with birth Are there any painsAnything disturbing the mindAnd whats paining and disturbing the mind aside from the birth the arising of things Its because of the birth of the body that we have to keep finding food for it requisites to keep it goingGreed anger and delusion arise because of birthAnd once theres birth theres aging deterioration wearing down wearing down all the timeWhatever we get runs out runs out every day wears down every dayThe Buddha awakened to the truth that birth isnt pleasurable at allThe only pleasure is when if we get hungry we eat enough to make the hunger go away for a little whileBut soon we get hungry againWhen we get hot out in the sun we take cover in the shade to cool down a bit but then we start feeling hot againWhen we get tired we restBut then if we lie down for a long time we start feeling stiffIf we walk for a long time we get wearyWhen this is the way things are the mind cant find any peace or restIt gets disturbed and gives rise to defilement because of birthAnd thats not the end of itOnce birth takes place its followed by aging and deteriorationNo matter how much you look after the body it wont stay with youIn the end it all falls apartAnd once it dies theres no one who can stay in charge of itIf we come to our senses only at that point and realize only when its already dead that it has to die its too late to do anything about itBut if we gain conviction in these truths now in the present before death comes we wont be complacent about our youth or lifeIf we can be mindful at all times that death is inevitable that  even though we may be as strong as a bull elephant  a disease could come along at any time and oppress us to the point where we cant even sit up cant do anything to help ourselves when we realize this were said not to be complacent in our healthThen we can act in ways truly benefiting ourselves providing us with the refuge well need when we can no longer take refuge in our youth health or lifeWherever you look in the body you see it wearing downWherever you look you see diseasesWherever you look you see things that are uncleanNothing at all in the body is really strong or lastingWhen you see this clearly youll no longer be fooled into clinging to itYou can analyze the body into its parts and see that theyre all inconstant stressful and notselfWhen you develop clear insight into notself youll be able to shake free of stress and inconstancyThats because inconstancy is a notself affair stress is a notself affairTheyre not our affairsSo what do we hope to gain by letting ourselves struggle and get defiled over themThis is why the noble ones when they see these truths call them the dangers in the cycles of samsaraYou have to understand whats meant by the term cycle Theres the cycle of defilement the cycle of action and the cycle of the results of actionThe cycle of defilement is the ignorance that makes the mind stupid and defiledThese defilements are the cause of stress suffering and dangerThen theres the cycle of actionAny actions we do under the influence of defilement keep us spinning in the cycle acting sometimes in skillful ways sometimes in unskillful onesEven skillful actions can lead to delusion you knowWhen we experience good sights sounds status or wealth as a result of our skillful actions we can turn unskillful careless and complacent because we get deluded into investing our sense of self in those thingsWhen they start changing against our desires we grow frustrated and start acting in evil waysWhen they leave us we act in unskillful waysThis causes the cycle of action in terms of both our physical and verbal actsWhen we act in ways that are unskillful this causes the cycle of results to be painfulWhen we experience this pain and suffering the mind becomes defiledOur vision gets obscured because the suffering overcomes usThis gives rise to anger as well as to greed for the things we want and this starts the cycle of defilement againFor this reason if we can comprehend suffering as part of this cycle we can block the cycle of defilement that would give rise to new cycles of action and resultsSo lets study the truth of suffering so that we can cut these cycles through discernment in the form of right view which is a factor of the noble pathLets foster and strengthen the path by knowing the suffering in birth aging illness and deathWhen we comprehend suffering for what it actually is we dont have to worry about the cause of suffering for how can it arise when we see the drawbacks of its resultsOnce true knowledge has arisen how can ignorance ariseIts as when were in the darknessIf we try to run around tearing down the darkness it cant be torn downIf we try to run around snatching away the darkness it cant be snatched awayThe darkness cant be dispersed by usIt has to be dispersed by lightWhen we light a fire the darkness disappears on its ownThe same with ignorance it cant be dispersed through our thinkingIt has to be dispersed through clearseeing discernmentOnce we give rise to discernment the cause of suffering disappears on its own without our having to get involved with itSo try to give rise to clearseeing discernment in full measure and youll gain release from suffering without a doubtBe really intentThats enough for nowKeep on meditatingThe practice of the Dharma is learning how to live and this is both hard and joyful workPractice makes extraordinary demands of usIt requires that we take nothing for granted that we accept nothing on faith aloneIf we practice with diligence and honesty then we must question everything about ourselves we must challenge our most basic beliefs and convictions even those we may have about the dharma itselfOf all the teachings of the Buddha the Kalama Sutta is one of my favorites precisely because it encourages such rigorous inquiry into our beliefsIndeed if Buddhism were not infused with the spirit of this sutta  a spirit of questioning of critical examination  Im quite sure I would not have a meditative practice todayI was raised in what you might call a tradition of skepticismMy father was the first to teach me the importance of asking questionsHe came from a line of fourteen rabbis but like his own exrabbi father he rejected that heritage  although rejected actually is too weak a termHe frequently expressed contempt not only for Orthodox Judaism bur for all religionsI remember that before Hebrew school my father would pull me aside and say things like Ask the rabbi just how Moses got that river to split Well I would go along with it but as you can imagine that never went over very wellRabbi Minkowitz was not particularly pleased to be questioned in this wayI think my father was the first in recorded history actually to pay a rabbi not to give a talk at his sons bar mitzvahMy father said PleaseHeres the moneyDont give a talk But the rabbi gave the talk anywayAnd my father was fumingSo my father believed in the necessity of thinking critically and he instilled this in meHis way of parenting was very similar to the scientific approachIf I got into trouble  I was usually very good at home but I got into a lot of mischief at school and in the neighborhood  Id be put on trial when my father came home from workHe had always wanted to be a lawyer or a judge but he drove a cab so he had to settle for a court made up of my mother and meHis court was very sensitive and reasonable He would hear the accused out and sometimes after listening to all sides he would drop the chargesOf course my mother would smile and they were both happy that I got offBut my father always explained to me why I should have acted differently When you did that your Aunt Clara got aggravated then she called up your mother and now I have to listen to itNext time just pick up the rye bread and bagels and come homeIts simple Hed always explain to me that my actions had consequencesAnd most important he taught me that we have the right to ask questions about anything and everythingBut with that right comes a responsibility If were going to question the actions of others we also have to be willing to question our ownThe Kalamas of the Kalama Sutta were like my father a skeptical but responsible bunchThey were quite alive to spiritual matters but they were overrun with teachers and teachings each teacher competing for an audience each propounding a different philosophy or pathTheir situation was not very different from ours nowWere inundated with possibilities Youre interested in religionWell what kindBuddhismWhat flavor would you likeTibetanOkay we have about ten flavors thereTheravadaOh youve tried thatA little too dry for youToo much talk about suffering and impermanencePerhaps youd prefer Dzogchen the innate perfection of the mindThat sounds much better doesnt itAnd they have more colorful outfitsMost Vipassana teachers arent Asian and arent even monks they just wear sweatpantsAt least the Tibetan teachers look like teachers you knowAnd then you get to Zen beautiful  those great stories that teach you and make you laughTheravada teachings go on and on but Zen is just hilarious oneliners So we have this great swirling spiritual marketplace with lots of claims being madeIts no wonder that many of us find it confusingWell like us the Kalamas were confusedThey went to the Buddha to hear his perspective So the Kalamas of Kesaputta approached the BuddhaOn arrival some of them bowed down to him and sat to one sideSome of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and sat to one sideSome raising their joined palms sat down to one sideSome announcing their name and clan sat to one sideSome of them sat to one side in silenceAs they were sitting there they said to the Buddha Lord some teachers come to Kesaputta expounding and glorifying their own doctrinesBut as for the doctrine of others they abuse them disparage them deprecate them and pull them to piecesOther teachers on coming to Kesaputta do the same thingWhen we listen to them we feel doubt and uncertainty as to which of these teachers are speaking truth and which are lyingThe Kalamas were overwhelmed by all these claims to exclusive truthAnd when the Buddha arrived despite his reputation as a great sage they were concerned that he might be just one more teacher with a competing point of viewActually I think their skepticism is very admirable and rather unusualThe history of the world reveals that people are drawn to those who provide a strong uncompromising teachingWere drawn to those who say This is it and everyone else is wrong Certainly we see this pattern in contemporary politics but we also see abuse of this sort within spiritual circlesIt makes you wonder Do we really want freedomCan we handle the responsibilityOr would we just prefer to have an impressive teacher someone who can give us the answers and do the hard work for usOf course foolishness exists within Buddhist circles as wellAfter all the problems that have come up in dharma centers in the past twenty years I still see Westerners who check their intelligence at the door who grovel at the feet of a teacher saying Just tell me how to live Well Ive been taken a few times myselfI dont know if you haveBut I deserved itI just wanted to have my special teacher someone with special access to the truthIt felt fantastic to be their studentMy spiritual life was taken care ofI didnt have to worry anymoreI was absolved of the responsibility that comes with exercising the right to ask questionsBut of course I wasnt freeAfter hearing the concerns of the Kalamas the Buddha replied Come KalamasDont go by reports by legend by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by consistency with your own laws by probability or by the thought This contemplative is our teacher When you know for yourselves that these mental qualities are unskillful these mental qualities are blameworthy these mental qualities are criticized by the wise these mental qualities when acted on lead to harm and suffering then abandon themWhen you know for yourselves that these mental qualities are skillful these mental qualities are blameless these mental qualities are praised by the wise these mental qualities when acted on lead to wellbeing and happiness then keep following themTheres a teaching story from China People came from far and wide to hear the dharma talks of a young teacherApparently he had some depthAnd one day an old master came to hear himHe sat in the back of the meditation hall while the young teacher was giving a dharma talkBut the young teacher saw him and out of respect knowing that he was a renowned teacher and also much older said Please come up here sit next to me while I give my talk So the old master rose and sat next to himThe young teacher resumed his talk and every other word was a quotation from a different sutra or Zen masterThe old master started to nod off in front of everyoneAnd the young teacher could see this out of the corner of his eye but he just continuedThe more authorities he cited the sleepier the old master becameFinally the young teacher couldnt stand it anymore so he asked Whats wrongIs my teaching so boring so awful so totally off At that point the old master leaned over and gave him a very hard pinch and the young teacher screamed Ouch The old master said AhThats what Ive come all this way forThis pure teachingThis ouch teachingLike the old master in this story the Buddha in his response to the Kalamas is trying to emphasize the importance of direct experienceHe acknowledges that people rely upon many different modes of authority sometimes internal sometimes externalSome of them are reliable and others are way off the markThe question is how do we tell which is whichHow do we balance internal authority with external authorityAs the Buddha says just because something is ancient doesnt mean its trueJust because its new doesnt mean its trueJust because its in the scriptures doesnt mean its trueJust because it seems reasonable or you like the person teaching it doesnt mean its rightWhats left thenWhere do we turn for authority in terms of knowing how to actIn the Kalama Sutta the Buddha is not saying that ancient teachings are irrelevant or that you have to reinvent the dharma wheel every time you thinkHes not saying not to accept the guidance of teachers or not to read the scripturesAfter all how else are you going to find out whats criticized and praised by the wiseNo what hes saying is Dont give final authority to these teachingsDont give final authority to your own ideasYou have to test the teachings and your ideas in the laboratory of your actionsWhen you put something to the test really to the test dont you find that it challenges that it stretches you tooThis has certainly been my experienceSome of these wonderful teachings are inspiringIt can be intellectually satisfying and emotionally nourishing just to hear themBut you cant stop thereIf you want to gain any real benefit from them you have to let them stretch your own lived experienceFor the dharma to become firsthand knowledge  to feel the ouch of it  you have to live intimately with it hold it up to scrutiny and let it hold you up to scrutinyIn the end the ball is always thrown back to you Be a lamp unto yourself says the BuddhaIn other words you must ultimately find the way on your own by putting your ideas of the truth to the testYour questions light the waySo what is the test of truthThe Buddha offers a simple formula Test things in terms of cause and effectWhatever is unskillful leading to harm and ill should be abandoned whatever is skillful leading to happiness and peace should be pursuedApply the test of skillfulness to all teachings in all your actionsWhere is this teaching taking youIs it moving you in a direction that is wise and kindOne quick test isnt enough you knowYou have to keep at it so that your sensitivity to the results of your actions grows more and more refined with practiceWhen youve done the hard work of asking these questions then you can decide for yourself whether a teaching or a teacher is worth followingAnd at the same time youve also taught yourself how to live  a learning that can bring with it joy and the energy to go even deeperWell now start meditating just as weve been doing every dayWe have to look at this as an important opportunityEven though our practice hasnt yet reached the Dhamma to our satisfaction at the very least its a beginning an important beginning in gathering the strength of the mind so that our mindfulness concentration and discernment will become healthy and matureWe should try to gather these qualities together so that they can reinforce one another in washing away the stains the defilements in our minds  for when defilements arise they dont lead to peace purity or respite for the mindJust the opposite they lead to suffering unrest and disturbanceThey block any discernment that would know or see the DhammaTheres no defilement that encourages us to practice the Dhamma to know or see the DhammaThey simply get in the way of our practiceSo whatever mental state gets in the way of our practice we should regard as a defilement  for defilements dont come floating along on their ownThey have to depend on the mindAny mental state thats sleepy or lazy any mental state thats restless angry or irritable these are all defilementsTheyre mental states under the influence of defilement overcome by defilementIf any of these mental states arise within us we should be aware of themWhen the mind is sleepy we should get it to keep buddho in mind so that it will wake up and shake off its sleepinessWhen the mind is restless and irritable we should use our discernment to reflect on things to see that these states of mind serve no purposeThen we should quickly turn back to our concentration practice planting the mind firmly in our meditation theme not letting the mind get restless and distracted againWe focus the mind on being aware of its meditation word buddho  whats aware whats awakeWe keep it in mind as if it were a post planted firmly in the groundDont let the mind wander from the foundation post on which youve focusedBut whatever your focus dont let your focus be tenseYou have to keep the mind in a good mood while its focusedDo this with an attitude of mindfulness and discernment not one of delusion wanting to know this or to see that or to force things to fall in line with your thoughtsIf thats the way you meditate your mood will grow tense and you wont be able to meditate for longIn no time at all youll start getting irritableSo if you want to meditate for a long time you have to be neutral with equanimity as your foundationIf you want knowledge focus firmly on what youre already aware ofKeep your mind firmly in placeFind an approach that will help you stay focused without slipping awayFor example make an effort to keep your mind firmly intent and apply your powers of observation and evaluation to the basis of your buddhoAll of these things have to be brought together at the same spot along with whatever thinking you need to do so that mindfulness wont lapse letting unskillful outside issues come barging in or leaving an opening for internal preoccupations to arise in the heart or letting yourself get disturbed by thoughts of the past  things you knew or saw or said or did earlier today or many days many months many years agoYou have to focus exclusively on the presentIf youve taken buddho as your meditation theme keep coming back to it over and over againBuddho stands for awarenessIf you can maintain awareness without lapse this will make an important differenceIf youve taken the breath as your theme you have to be aware each time the breath comes in and outYou cant let yourself wander offYou have to take nothing but the breath as the focal point for mindfulnessThe same principles hold in either caseYou do the same things the only difference is the theme of your awarenessWhy does the Buddha teach us to focus on the breathBecause we dont have to look for it dont have to guess about it dont have to think it into beingIts a present phenomenonTheres no such thing as a past breath or a future breathTheres simply the breath coming in and out in the presentThats why its appropriate for exercising our mindfulness for gathering our mindfulness and awareness in a single place for firmly establishing concentrationSo you can focus on either theme  whichever one youve already meditated on and found that mindfulness can quickly get established without lapsing and can quickly produce a sense of stillness and peaceSet that theme up as your foundationWhen youre starting out focus on keeping that theme in mindOnce the mind has had enough stillness if you simply want it to become more still the mind will get into a state where it isnt doing any work because its not distracted in any wayIf this happens you have to start contemplatingIn the foundations of mindfulness were taught to contemplate the various aspects of the body in and of themselvesWe dont have to contemplate anything elseIf you want to contemplate from the angle of inconstancy its here in this bodyIf you want to contemplate from the angle of stress its here in this bodyYou can contemplate it from any angle at allIf you want to contemplate from the angle of eliminating passion and craving you can look at things that are dirty and disgusting  and you find that they fill the bodyThis is something requiring you to use your own intelligenceWhatever angle you use you have to look into things so that they get more subtle and refinedContemplate them again and again until you see things clearly in a way that gives rise to nibbida or disenchantment so that you arent deluded into latching onto things and giving them meanings the way you used toTurn over a new mind turning your views into new viewsYou no longer want your old mistaken viewsTurning from your old views give rise to right viewsTurning from your old ways of thinking give rise to right resolves  to see the body as repulsive and unattractiveThis is nekkhammasankappa the resolve for renunciation the resolve to escape from sensual passionWe dont go thinking in other directions or roaming off in other directionsWe try to go in the direction of escaping from the view that the body is beautifulWhat the eye sees of the body is just the outer skinIts never seen the filthy things insideEven though it may have seen them from time to time as when someone dies in an accident or when a patient is opened for surgery theres something in the mind that keeps us from taking it to heart and giving rise to discernmentTheres something that keeps us from contemplating things down to a level more subtle than what the eye seesWe see these things and then pass right over themWe dont get to a level profound enough to give rise to disenchantmentSo contemplate the bodyIf the mind has developed a strong enough foundation it shouldnt stay stuck just at the level of stillnessBut if you havent yet reached that level of stillness you cant skip over itYou first have to make the mind still because a firm foundation of stillness is absolutely essentialIf you try to contemplate before the mind has grown still youll give rise to knowledge that lasts only as long as youre in meditationWhen you leave meditation and the mind is no longer firm your new understandings will disappearYour old understandings will come back just as if you had never meditatedWhatever way youve been deluded in the past thats how youll be deluded againWhatever views youve had before wont change into anything elseWhatever ways youve thought youll end up deluded just as before as long as your new ways of thinking arent based on a foundation of stillnessThis is why stillness is so essentialWe have to get the mind to gain strength from stillness and then let it contemplate the body in and of itself in terms of its partsYou can choose any one of the parts focusing on it until its clearOr you can focus on the parts in sets of fiveWhen you reach the liquid parts you can focus on them in sets of six for there are of them in allYou can contemplate them back and forth  if your mindfulness hasnt yet been exercised to the point were its firm contemplate these things back and forth just as a preceptor teaches a new ordinand kesa loma nakha danta taco and then turning them around to taco danta nakha loma kesaThen you can go onto the next set of five  mansam nharu atthi atthimiñjam vakkamThis is called contemplating them in sets of fiveThis is how we start out exercising mindfulnessIf while youre practicing mindfulness in this way a visual image of any of these five parts appears catch hold of it and contemplate it so that it grows deeper and more refinedContemplate it until you can divide the body into its parts seeing that each part is just like thisGet so that you know the body inside and out realizing that other living beings are just like this tooIf youre looking to see whats unclean youll find it hereIf youre looking to see whats notself youll find it hereTurn these things over in your mind and question yourself as to whether theyre constantWhat kind of pleasure is there in these thingsIs it worthwhile or notFocus on these issues often look at them often until youre adept and the mind will finally be willing to accept the truth changing from its old wrong ways of seeing things and seeing them instead in line with the Dhamma as taught by the BuddhaWhen your views change often in this way the mind will experience a new kind of stillness and peaceIt will turn away from the fevers of the fires of passion aversion and delusion and turn into mindfulness concentration and discernment insteadIts knowledge and views will become clearIt will no longer waverIt will become brave and no longer afraid in the way it used to be  for it has come to know the truth that nothing gets pained aside from the aggregates nothing dies aside from the elementsThe mind gets firmly plantedIt can meditate with a snug sense of confidence with no fear of pain or illness or anything at allYou can separate things out all the way downEven if death were to come at that point youd be content for even though death hasnt yet come these things have separated out of their own accordYouve contemplated them and seen them for what they are each and every oneSo I ask that we all have firm principles in our contemplationBe genuine in doing it  dont just go through the motions  for all these things are genuineIf we dont meditate defilements will inhabit our thoughts deceiving us so that we dont see things as they genuinely areIf we depend just on our eyes they can fool usThe eye can see only the outside of thingsIt sees skin and the skin can be made up to deceive usIt sees hair of the head and hair can be made up to deceive usIt sees hair of the body  things like eyebrows and beards which can be dressed to deceive usIt sees fingernails and toenails which can be made up to deceive usIt sees teeth which can be treated to deceive us so that we make all sorts of assumptions about themThe eye has no discernmentIt lets us get deceived  but it isnt what does the deceivingThe mind is what deceives itselfOnce it deceives itself it makes all sorts of assumptions about itself and falls for itselfWhen it makes itself suffer in this way theres no help for itThis is the genuine truthKnow clearly that the mind is what deceives itselfWhen it doesnt have a refuge it can deceive itself all the timeSo we have to develop qualities that the mind can hold to and take refuge in so that defilements wont be able to keep on deceiving itLook so that you can see more deeply through thingsTry to analyze things to see whats not genuine whats dressed and disguisedThen as soon as you look at anything youll see whats fake and made upYoull know The real thing doesnt have this color this smell this shape Youll see how things are always changingThis is called having the qualities of the Dhamma as your refuge as something to hold to as you look hear smell taste and make contact with thingsYoull have the qualities that know and see things as they actually are  so they wont be able to deceive youYou wont be able to deceive yourself for youd be ashamed toThe heart grows disenchanted with itself with its old ways  and why would it want to deceive itself any moreIts seen that it doesnt gain any benefit from that kind of behaviorInstead youll see how it really benefits from its new viewsThey make the mind stillClearSet free with a sense of wellbeingAll its heavy old burdens fall awayIt has no greed for gaining a lot of things for theres no more indulgingIt doesnt use anything to indulge itselfAll it needs is the four necessities to keep life going  thats enoughIt doesnt have to invest in anythingIt finds its happiness and wellbeing in the stillness that comes from meditatingThe things around it that it used to fall for and build up into ignorance without realizing it when it focuses on really knowing these things its delusions disbandIgnorance disappearsThe mind gains knowledge from these things in line with what they actually areIt wises up and doesnt fall for these things as it used to doesnt misunderstand them as it used toAnd thats the end of its problemsTranslators note Upasika Arun Abhivanna took notes during Ajaan Lees talk at Wat Asokaram on May and later wrote out this synopsis of the talkIt was printed with Ajaan Lees approval as part of the book Four Years SermonsIm now going to give a Dhamma talk discussing the teachings of the Buddha as an adornment to the mindfulness and discernment of all those gathered here to listen so that you will take the Dhamma and put it into practice as a way of achieving the benefits that are supposed to come from listening to the DhammaToday Visakha Puja is an extremely important day in the Buddhist tradition for it was on this day that the Buddha was born and years later awoke to the unexcelled right selfawakening and another years later passed away into total nibbanaIn each case these events took place on the fullmoon day in May when the moon is in the Visakha asterism which is why the day is called Visakha PujaEvery year when this important day comes around again we Buddhists take the opportunity to pay homage to the Buddha as a way of expressing our gratitude for his goodnessWe sacrifice our daily affairs to make merit in a skillful way by doing such things as practicing generosity observing the precepts and listening to the DhammaThis is called paying homage to the virtues of the Triple Gem the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaThe Buddha is like our father while the Dhamma is like our mother  in that its what gives birth to our knowledge of the Buddhas teachingsAt present our father has passed away leaving only our mother still aliveBoth of them have been protecting us looking after us so that weve been able to stay free and happy up to the presentWere thus greatly in their debt and should find a way of showing our gratitude in keeping with the fact that we are their childrenOrdinarily when peoples parents die they have to cry and lament wear black etc as a way of showing their mourningOn Visakha Puja  which is the anniversary of the day on which our father the Buddha passed away  we show our mourning too but we do it in a different wayInstead of crying we chant the passages reflecting on the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaInstead of dressing up in black we take off our pretty jewels go without perfume and cologne and dress very simplyAs for the comfortable beds and mattresses on which we normally lie we abstain from themInstead of eating three or four times a day as we normally like to do we cut back to only two times or oneWe have to give up our habitual pleasures if were going to show our mourning for the Buddha  our father  in a sincere and genuine wayIn addition to this we bring flowers candles and incense to offer in homage to the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaThis is called amisapuja or material homageThis is a form of practice on the external level  a matter of our words and deedsIt comes under the headings of generosity and virtue but doesnt count as the highest form of homageTheres still another level of homage  patipattipuja or homage through the practice  which the Buddha said was supreme ie meditation or the development of the mind so that it can stand firmly in its own inner goodness independent of any and all outside objectsThis is the crucial point that the Buddha wanted us to focus on as much as possible for this kind of practice was what enabled him to reach the highest attainment becoming a Rightly Selfawakened Buddha and enabled many of his noble disciples to become arahants as wellSo we should all take an interest and set our minds on following their example as a way of following the footsteps of our father and motherIn this way we can be called their grateful loyal heirs because we listen respectfully to our parents teachings and put them into practiceThe verse from the Mangala Sutta that I quoted at the beginning of the talk Puja ca pujaniyanam etammangalamuttamam means Homage to those deserving homage This is the highest blessing There are two kinds of homage as weve already mentioned material homage and homage through the practiceAnd along with these two kinds of homage people aim their hopes at two kinds of happinessSome of them practice for the sake of continuing in the cycle of death and rebirth for the sake of worldly happinessThis kind of practice is called vattagaminikusala or skillfulness leading into the cycleFor instance they observe the precepts so that theyll be reborn as beautiful or handsome human beings or as devas in the heavenly realmsThey practice generosity so that they wont have to be poor so that they can be reborn wealthy as bankers or kingsThis kind of skillfulness goes only as far as the qualifications for human or heavenly rebirthsIt keeps spinning around in the world without ever getting anywhere at allThe other reason that people can have for paying homage is so that they will gain release from sufferingThey dont want to keep spinning through death and rebirth in the worldThis is called vivattagaminikusala skillfulness leading out of the cycleIn both kinds of practice the aim is at happiness but one kind of happiness is the pleasure found in the world and the other is the happiness that lies above and beyond the worldWhen we pay homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha its not the case that we have to take the results of our practice and try to push the Triple Gem any higherActually what were doing is to give rise to goodness that will benefit ourselvesSo in searching for goodness for our own sakes we have to keep yet another point in mind as the Buddha taught us Asevana ca balanam panditanañca sevana which means Dont associate with foolsAssociate only with wise people Only then will we be safe and happyFools here means people whose minds and actions are shoddy and evilThey behave shoddily in their actions  killing stealing having illicit sex  and shoddily in their words telling lies creating disharmony deceiving other peopleIn other words they act as enemies to the society of good people at largeThats what we mean by foolsIf you associate with people of this sort its as if youre letting them pull you into a cave where theres nothing but darknessThe deeper you go the darker it gets to the point where you cant see any light at allTheres no way outThe more you associate with fools the stupider you get and you find yourself slipping into ways that lead to nothing but pain and sufferingBut if you associate with wise people and sages theyll bring you back out into the light so that youll be able to become more intelligentYoull have the eyes to see whats good whats bad whats right whats wrongYoull be able to help yourself gain freedom from suffering and turmoil and will meet with nothing but happiness progress and peaceThis is why were taught to associate only with good people and to avoid associating with badIf we associate with bad people well meet up with trouble and painIf we associate with good people well meet up with happinessThis is a way of giving a protective blessing to ourselvesThis sort of protective blessing is something we can provide for ourselves at any time at any place at allWell gain protection wherever whenever we provide itFor this reason we should provide a protective blessing for ourselves at all times and all places for the sake of our own security and wellbeingAs for things deserving homage whether theyre the sorts of things that deserve material homage or homage through the practice the act of homage provides a protective blessing in the same wayIt provides happiness in the same wayThe happiness that lies in the world that depends on people and external things has to suffer death and rebirth but the happiness of the Dhamma is an internal happiness that depends entirely on the mindIts a release from suffering and stress that doesnt require us to return to any more death and rebirth in the world ever againThese two forms of happiness come from material homage and homage through the practice things that can either make us come back to be reborn or free us from having to be rebornThe difference lies in one little thing whether we want to be reborn or notIf we create long drawnout causes the results will have to be long and drawnout as wellIf we create short causes the results will have to be short tooLong drawnout results are those that involve death and rebirth without endThis refers to the mind whose defilements havent been polished away the mind that has cravings and attachments fastened on the good and bad actions of people and things in the worldIf people die when their minds are like this they have to come back and be reborn in the worldTo create short causes though means to cut through and destroy the process of becoming and birth so as never to give rise to the process againThis refers to the mind whose inner defilements have been polished off and washed awayThis comes from examining the faults and forms of darkness that arise in our own hearts keeping in mind the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha or any of the meditation topics that are set out in the texts to the point where we can see through all mental fabrications in line with their nature as eventsIn other words we see them as arising remaining and then disintegratingWe keep the range of our awareness short and close to home  our own body from head to foot  without latching onto any of the good or bad actions of anyone or anything in the worldWe look for a solid foundation for the mind so that it can stay fixed and secure entirely within itself with no attachment at all even for the bodyWhen weve reached this state then when we die we wont have to come swimming back to be reborn in the world ever againWhether we give material homage or homage through the practice if we pull the focal point of the mind out and place it in our actions  ie if we get attached to our good actions as in practicing virtue generosity etc then thats called vattagaminikusala skillfulness leading into the cycleThe mind isnt freeIt has to become the slave of this or that thing this or that action this or that preoccupationThis is a long drawnout cause that will force us to come back and be rebornBut if we take the results of our good actions in terms of virtue generosity etc and bring them into the minds inner foundation so that theyre stashed away in the mind without letting the mind run out after external causes this is going to help cut down on our states of becoming and birth so that eventually we dont have to come back and be rebornThis is vivattagaminikusala skillfulness leading out of the cycleThis is the difference between these two forms of skillfulnessThe human mind is like a bael fruitWhen its fully ripe it can no longer stay on the treeIt has to fall off hit the ground and eventually decay into the soilThen when its been exposed to the right amount of air and water the seed gradually sprouts again into a trunk with branches flowers and fruit containing all its ancestry in the seedsEventually the fruit falls to the ground and sprouts as yet another treeIt keeps going around and around in this way without ever getting annihilatedIf we dont destroy the juices in the seeds that allow them to germinate theyll have to keep their genetic inheritance alive for an eonIf we want to gain release from suffering and stress we have to make our minds shoot out of the world instead of letting them fall back into the world the way bael fruits doWhen the mind shoots out of the world it will find its landing spot in a place that wont let it come back and be rebornIt will stay there aloft in total freedom free from attachment of any sortFreedom here means sovereigntyThe mind is sovereign within itselfIn charge of itselfIt doesnt have to depend on anyone and doesnt have to fall slave to anything at allWithin ourselves we find the mind paired with the bodyThe body isnt all that important because it doesnt lastWhen it dies the various elements  earth water wind and fire  fall apart and return to their original conditionThe mind though is very important because it lastsIts the truly elemental thing residing in the bodyIts what gives rise to states of becoming and birthIts what experiences pleasure and painIt doesnt disintegrate along with the bodyIt remains in existence but as something amazing that cant be seenIts like the flame of a lit candle When the candle goes out the fire element is still there but it doesnt give off any lightOnly when we light a new candle will the fire appear and give light againWhen we take the body  composed of elements aggregates sense media and its parts  and the mind  or awareness itself  and simplify them to their most basic terms were left with name and formForm is another term for the body made up of the four elementsName is a term for the mind residing in the body the element that creates the bodyIf we want to cut back on states of becoming and birth we should take as our frame of reference just these two things  name and form  as theyre experienced in the presentHow does form  the body  stay aliveIt stays alive because of the breathThus the breath is the most important thing in lifeAs soon as the breath stops the body has to dieIf the breath comes in without going out we have to dieIf it goes out without coming back in we have to dieSo think about the breath in this way with every moment at all times regardless of whether youre sitting standing walking or lying downDont let the body breathe without your mind getting some good use out of itA person who doesnt know his or her own breath is said to be deadHeedlessLacking in mindfulnessAs the Buddha said heedlessness is the path to danger to deathWe cant let our minds run out and get stuck on external preoccupations ie thoughts of past or future whether theyre good or badWe have to keep our awareness right in the present at the breath coming in and outThis is called singleness of preoccupationWe cant let the mind slip off into any other thoughts or preoccupations at allOur mindfulness has to be firmly established in our awareness of the presentThe mind will then be able to develop strength able to withstand any preoccupations that come striking against it giving rise to feelings of good bad liking and disliking  the hindrances that would defile the mindWe have to keep our awareness exclusively in the present alert and quick to sense the arising and passing away of preoccupations letting go of both good and bad preoccupations without getting attached to themWhen the mind stays firmly focused in its one preoccupation  the breath  it will give rise to concentration to the point where the eye of inner knowledge appearsFor example it might give rise to powers of clairvoyance or clairaudience enabling us to see events past and future near and farOr it might give rise to knowledge of previous lives so that we can know how we and other beings have been born died come and gone and how all these things have come about from good and bad actionsThis will give rise to a sense of dismay and disenchantment with states of becoming and birth and will dissuade us from ever wanting to create bad kamma ever againThis kind of disenchantment is something useful and good without any drawbacksIts not the same thing as its near cousin wearinessWeariness is what happens when a person say eats today to the point of getting so full that the thought of eating any more makes him wearyBut tomorrow his weariness will wear off and hell feel like eating againDisenchantment though doesnt wear offYoull never again see any pleasure in the objects of your disenchantmentYou see birth aging illness and death as stress and suffering and so you dont ever want to give rise to the conditions that will force you to come back and undergo birth aging illness and death ever againThe important factors for anyone practicing to gain release from all stress and suffering are persistence and endurance for every kind of goodness has to have obstacles blocking the way always ready to destroy itEven when the Buddha himself was putting his effort into the practice the armies of Mara were right on his heels pestering him all the time trying to keep him from attaining his goalStill he never wavered never got discouraged never abandoned his effortsHe took his perfection of truthfulness and used it to drive away the forces of Mara until they were utterly defeatedHe was willing to put his life on the line in order to do battle with the forces of Mara his heart solid unflinching and braveThis was why he was eventually able to attain a glorious victory realizing the unexcelled right selfawakening becoming our BuddhaThis is an important example that he as our father set for his descendants to see and to take to heartSo when were intent on training our minds to be good there are bound to be obstacles  the forces of Mara  just as in the case of the Buddha but we simply have to slash our way through them using our powers of endurance and the full extent of our abilities to fight them offIts only normal that when we have something good there are going to be other people who want what weve got in the same way that sweet fruit tends to have worms and insects trying to eat itA person walking along the road emptyhanded doesnt attract anyones attention but if were carrying something of value there are sure to be others who will want what weve got and will even try to steal it from usIf were carrying food in our hand dogs or cats will try to snatch itBut if we dont have any food in our hand they wont pounce on usIts the same way when we practiceWhen we do good we have to contend with obstacles if we want to succeedWe have to make our hearts hard and solid like diamond or rock which dont burn when you try to set them on fireEven when they get smashed the pieces maintain their hardness as diamond and rockThe Buddha made his heart so hard and solid that when his body was cremated parts of it didnt burn and still remain as relics for us to admire even todayThis was through the power of his purity and truthfulnessSo we should set our minds on purifying our bodies and minds until they become so truly elemental that fire wont burn them just like the Buddhas relicsEven if we cant get them to be that hard at least we should make them like tamarind seeds in their casing even if insects bore through the casing and eat all the flesh of the tamarind fruit they cant do anything to the seeds which maintain their hardness as alwaysSo to summarize Cutting down on states of becoming and birth means retracting our awareness inwardWe have to take the minds foundation and plant it firmly in the body without getting attached to any outside activity at allWe have to let go of every thing of every sort that follows the laws of events arising and passing away in line with its natureWe do good but dont let the mind go running out after the goodWe have to let the results of our goodness come running into the mindWe pull in every thing of every sort to stash it away in our mind and dont let the mind get scattered outside getting happy or sad over the results of its actions or anything else externalWe do this in the same way that the bael fruit keeps the trunk branches flowers and leaves of the bael tree curled up inside the seedIf we can then prevent outside conditions of soil and water from combining with the inside potential of the seed it wont be able to unfurl into a new bael treeWhoever practices in the way Ive discussed here is paying homage to our lord Buddha in the correct waySuch a person will be endowed with blessings providing happiness throughout timeHere Ive discussed some verses from the Mangala Sutta as a way of developing our discernment so that we will take these lessons and put them into practice as a way of paying homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha on this Visakha Puja dayThats enough for now so Ill stop hereWeve all come with a sense of conviction intent on studying and practicing the Dhamma so as to train our minds so that the Dhamma will appear within our minds and give them refugeEven though the Dhamma is always present it hasnt yet become the property of the heart and mindAs long as the Dhamma is simply the property of the eye ear nose tongue and body its a Dhamma that isnt genuine a Dhamma that isnt pure a Dhamma that isnt polished a Dhamma that can get in the way of our seeing the truthIt can let us get deceived by the preoccupations created by the process of fabrication from things the eye sees the ear hears and so onAfter all the knowledge that comes from what the eye sees or the ear hears almost everyone has eyes and earsIf the knowledge that comes just from these things were enough to give rise to the most significant benefit of the Dhamma then everyone would have already experienced that significant wellbeingThey would have experienced a happiness thats genuine certain and completeThis is because all living beings with eyes can see all those with ears can hear all those with a nose tongue and body can know through these thingsBut to know the skillful Dhamma taught by the Buddha requires more than just eyes and earsIt requires mindfulness  the ability to keep something in mind  along with a mind equipped with the right views that have come from training in the right principles of the Buddhas teachingsThis is because the Buddhas teachings are the welltaught Dhamma that people throughout the world have acknowledged as right and complete leading to peace leading to happiness leading to mental verbal and physical actions that are masterful seamless with nothing lackingEven the devas have acknowledged that the Buddhas Dhamma is well taughtCountless people with confidence in the Dhamma practicing it earnestly have attained the paths and fruitions leading to nibbanaTheyve gained release from suffering through the principles of the Dhamma that theyve studied and trained themselves inAll of us here are people of discernment just like them so we should take hold of these things and make them our hearts possession in a full and complete way just like themWe shouldnt content ourselves simply with hearing about or learning about the Dhamma for our knowledge on that level can still be deceived can still change so that our hearts can become uncertain and unsure so that we can make mistakes putting the heart in a position where it suffers from the impact of the things it sees or hears or from the wrong decisions it makesWeve made these mistakes and suffered from these things countless times alreadyThis is a fact we cant denyThis is why we cant win out over our moods and preoccupations as we would like toWe see the defects in our hearts  in our thoughts words and deeds  which is why we cant maintain our peace of mind as consistently as wed like toSo try to make use of the minds skillful qualitiesWhat are those qualitiesYou already know them virtue concentration and discernmentMaintain them so that they become clear and blatant in the heartCome to see clearly what sufferings virtue can drive out of the heart what obstacles to happiness and peace it can drive out of the heart  to see what sorts of benefits it can bringAsk yourself if you didnt observe this or that precept what would appear in your physical or verbal actionsA life composed of those actions in what direction would it pull youThis is something you have to see clearly you knowIf youre a Buddhist meditator youre a student of the Buddha one who knows  not one who is stupidThe Buddha was never heedless or careless with lifeHe never let time go to wasteYou should make up your mind that aside from when you sleep you want your every movement to serve a purpose you can depend onYou should live with awareness with right viewsYou shouldnt get infatuated with things coming in by way of the eye ear nose tongue or bodyWeve all been using these things for the purpose of delusion for a long time  its not that weve just started using them for that purpose recentlySo are we going to follow along in the same way foreverThis is an area where we should take responsibility and come to our senses to straighten ourselves outWe have to look after our words and deeds so that theyre perfectly blatant to usThis is called keeping the precepts in line with the principle silena sugatim yanti its through virtue that beings go to the good destinationsThe Buddha didnt say this without firm evidence or simply as propaganda for people to believe or put into practice in a deluded wayHe said this through right discernmentThose who practice have to understand with right discernment in just the same way so as to conform to the principle of ujupatipanno those who practice straight in line with the DhammaIf youre the sort of person who simply believes what people say right when theyre right wrong when theyre wrong then you can still be deceivedYou need to develop the mind to a solid level seeing the Dhamma in a way thats blatant clear and informedThats when youll be undeceivableThats virtueAs for concentration you have to see clearly what suffering it drives out of the heart what benefits it bringsThis is something you have to learn and understand so that youll really knowIf you understand concentration itll bring its benefits to youItll make the mind genuinely clear bright and pure because mindfulness will remember to choose only good preoccupations for the mindDiscernment will contemplate them and drive out from the mind any lack of stillness or peaceDiscernment on the level of concentration practice  when concentration has fostered a sense of wellbeing and seclusion in the mind  will drive out any disturbance that used to cause stress for the mindIt will see the dangers and drawbacks of those disturbancesThis sort of discernment will arise when weve practiced concentration correctly to the point of giving rise to peace and wellbeingConviction will arise when we see these results clearly in the mindWe wont have any doubtsWe wont have to ask anyone what concentration is like what a still mind is like what the rewards of concentration areWe wont have to ask for the mind knowsIt has entered into these thingsThis is what happens when we really practice using our mindfulness and persistence using our discernment correctly so as to serve a true purposeMeditation is simply a matter of looking at whats in the heart and mind for all good and evil come from the mindTheyre fabricated by the mindWhen we use right views to look at the mind when we keep right mindfulness right at the mind when we apply right effort continually in our mindfulness without lapse the mind will have to be firmly established in right concentration and wont go anywhere elseThats when well see how much rightness is arising right thereWhen we dont lose focus or look anywhere else when we keep on trying to be continuous in our gaze  in the same way we read a book  well be able to see the entire story of whats going onIf we forget and go looking elsewhere well lose whole chunks of the storyWe wont be able to connect the beginning with the endIt wont have any shapeBut when the mind stays firmly in place itll enter concentrationThe word concentration means the firm stillness that comes from training the mind with our Dhamma themeFor example buddho we have to stay right with the word buddhoOur effort is devoted to keeping buddho in mindDont let it slip away to other thingsKeep your efforts focused right thereKeep your mindfulness gathered right thereDont let it forget and go elsewhereWhen you keep trying to do this the counterfeit things in the mind  the defilements that deceive us  wont be able to arise for mindfulness is all there so the defilements cant establish themselves cant deceive usThis is because of the power of the mindfulness concentration and discernment that our mind has gathered together to chase away the enemies of our stillness the enemies of our happiness and wellbeingWe used to see these enemies as our friends and benefactorsBut once weve studied the Buddhas teachings we realize that theyre nothing but defilementsDefilements dont have any substance to themWhat do they come fromFrom the mindTheyre shadows of the mind that dwell in the mindWhen in any mental moment theres a thought that goes contrary to the Dhamma that gives rise to no true knowledge or intelligence that brings us danger and suffering that thought is called a defilementThoughts of this sort dont come from anywhere elseOf course there are aspects of defilement that take their inspiration from outside the mind but we shouldnt trace them back in that direction or send attention outside in that directionWere here simply for the sake of stillness for the sake of concentrationWe have to focus right here in front of usWe dont have to want to know anything else  for example where the defilements come from how they can arise or where they stayIts the same as when we come down with a sudden lethal diseaseIf we waste time asking the doctor where his medicine comes from or what it contains we could easily die firstWe have to trust the doctor and take the medicine as he prescribes it in line with the principles he has used with good results in the pastIn the same way when were training the mind to be still we dont have to track down where things come fromWe have to abstain from our desire to track things down to know in ways that will distract us from our stillnessWhen you want to center the mind on buddho you only have to be aware of buddhoDont let your awareness slip awayHave the mind hold onto buddho as its refuge at all timesThats your task the task you have to doThe same holds true when youre focusing on the breath or whatever the focus of your meditationTheyre all Dhamma themesHow is the breath a Dhamma themeIts a physical dhamma  the breath or wind element here in the bodyWithout the breath the body wouldnt lastThis isnt something we have to explain because were already aware of itWe understand it rightlyWe dont have to contemplate the ways in which the breath is importantWe simply use the breath to train the mindWere not here to train the breathWe use the breath to make the mind still which is why we dont have to analyze the body in any other wayWhen we want the mind to be still to settle down and rest or when we want mindfulness to work with full agility in overcoming delusion we have to exercise mindfulness fully in the duty at handWhen our effort is right our mindfulness is right and our concentration is right then they give crucial strength to the skillfulness of the mind so that it has the power and authority it needs to drive away the demons of defilement ie its own lack of skill and intelligence its delusions its tendency to float along after the preoccupations that deceive it thinking that it gains true happiness through the help of things outsideActually those things endanger the mindWhyBecause theyre nothing but fabrications that are inconstantTheres nothing constant about them at allVisual forms are inconstant sounds are inconstant all those phenomena are inconstantTheyre the Dhamma of Mara come to deceive usBut even when we understand this we shouldnt yet go thinking about themOnly when weve developed enough strength of mind to contend with them should we go out and fight with themWhen our mindfulness isnt yet firmly based in concentration we cant fight them offWere sure to get demolished by themWeve been demolished by them many many times before because our base of operations  our concentration  isnt solid enoughWe keep losing out to the enemyDo you want to keep on losing outWhen are you going to gather your forcesIn other words when are you going to make your conviction solid your persistence solid your mindfulness concentration and discernment all solidThese are the forces that will overcome the things that have been deceiving the mind as they likeSo I ask that we all be earnest in watching over this mind of oursAs were taught cittam dantam sukhavaham the mind when trained brings happinessThe Buddha has already done this has already succeeded in gaining this happinessHis many noble disciples have succeeded in the same way providing evidence for the truth of what he has taughtWhen we train ourselves so that our foundation is solid well have our own evidence the Dhamma that appears blatantly in our heartWell gain confidence accepting the fact that the Buddhas Dhamma is well taughtWell no longer have any doubts because it will have become blatant in the heartIts not simply that weve heard other people teach it or seen it in booksThe evidence has appeared clearly in the heart that has accepted the truth within itThe mind will become solid in a way that no defilement will be able to deceiveSo I ask that we all practice trulyWhen we practice truly the truth will truly appear to usPractice so that these things appear clearlyWhen weve made virtue blatantly clear concentration blatantly clear and discernment blatantly clear where will any ignorance or craving be able to fabricate more states of being or birth for usWell have had enoughWe wont want anything moreThere wont be any more craving because weve gained a sense of the word enough This is how we reach enough  not by struggling to amass material thingsThe world has tried to reach enough in that way for a long time now but theres never been enough of those thingsSo turn around and watch over your mind so that it all becomes blatantly clearNow that youve heard this try to remember itYou can always put it to use from this day forwardThe Buddhas teachings have never grown old or wornTheyre always brand new which is why we can put them to use at all times in all placesWhen we always keep them in mind well have a safe and secure refuge an auspicious refugeWhoever attains this refuge will gain release from all suffering and stressWeve all come with a sense of conviction intent on studying and practicing the Dhamma so as to train our minds so that the Dhamma will appear within our minds and give them refugeEven though the Dhamma is always present it hasnt yet become the property of the heart and mindAs long as the Dhamma is simply the property of the eye ear nose tongue and body its a Dhamma that isnt genuine a Dhamma that isnt pure a Dhamma that isnt polished a Dhamma that can get in the way of our seeing the truthIt can let us get deceived by the preoccupations created by the process of fabrication from things the eye sees the ear hears and so onAfter all the knowledge that comes from what the eye sees or the ear hears almost everyone has eyes and earsIf the knowledge that comes just from these things were enough to give rise to the most significant benefit of the Dhamma then everyone would have already experienced that significant wellbeingThey would have experienced a happiness thats genuine certain and completeThis is because all living beings with eyes can see all those with ears can hear all those with a nose tongue and body can know through these thingsBut to know the skillful Dhamma taught by the Buddha requires more than just eyes and earsIt requires mindfulness  the ability to keep something in mind  along with a mind equipped with the right views that have come from training in the right principles of the Buddhas teachingsThis is because the Buddhas teachings are the welltaught Dhamma that people throughout the world have acknowledged as right and complete leading to peace leading to happiness leading to mental verbal and physical actions that are masterful seamless with nothing lackingEven the devas have acknowledged that the Buddhas Dhamma is well taughtCountless people with confidence in the Dhamma practicing it earnestly have attained the paths and fruitions leading to nibbanaTheyve gained release from suffering through the principles of the Dhamma that theyve studied and trained themselves inAll of us here

all placesWhen we always keep them in mind well have a safe and secure refuge an auspicious refugeWhoever attains this refuge will gain release from all suffering and stressWhen we meditate were training the mind for we hold the mind to be very importantBut training the mind is really difficult if we dont develop the right character habitsWe have to depend on refined inner qualities for the training really to go straight to the heart because the heart itself is subtle and sensitiveWe have to make our character meticulous pliant tractable respectful inoffensiveWe have to be willing to follow the example already set by someone who knows whos already taken the path who  on examination  weve found to be above us in terms of his training in mindfulness and discernment above us in terms of the purity of his actionsWho is this personThe Buddha  someone to whom no one else can legitimately be comparedWe cant legitimately compare our views and opinions with him for he is someone who truly trained himself who sacrificed everything with no thought for his survivalThe fact that were still left hanging on in samsara after this long long time is all because of our character habitsIts because of our character habits that we keep missing the path falling off the path straying away from the path all the timeIts because of our habit of finding excuses for ourselves that we arent willing to follow the path set out by the BuddhaWhat sort of path has he set out for our actionsWhat sort has he set out for our wordsFor our mindHe set out standards for us to respect to obey to put into practiceSages have said that the Buddhas path is an easy one to follow correctly for it creates no dangersIt doesnt require that we do anything hurtful or hardWe have to examine the Buddhas teachings to see if theyre worthy of obedience or not to see if theyre worthy to be followed or notDo they have any defects that we should try to avoid that we shouldnt acceptCan we find any inconsistencies in the Buddha that would justify our giving more credence to our own opinions that would justify our disobeying his teachingsAnd what do we have thats so specialWhen you look carefully you cant find anything to fault him withSo what harm would it do to listen to him and to obey his teachingsWe have to study to see where our own defects lieIts as if were going on a journeyOur body may be in good shape but if the workings of our car are defective they can take us right off the roadSo we have to meditate to examine the workings of our car in other words the preoccupations that we create in the mind and that act as viewsThe Buddha gave a great deal of importance to the issue of views for our views can make us defectiveWhen our views are defective they can make our virtues defectiveThey can make our practice defective taking us off the pathOur views get defective when the mind is infected with delusionTheres very little alertnessThere may be a lot of knowledge a lot of information but very little alertnessWe may think that were knowledgeable that were intelligent but we dont know that our views are defectiveOnly those who know whove gotten past this stage can recognize whats defective in our viewsSo we have to make a point of training the aspect of our character related to our views to practice making our views straightOnly then will we free ourselves from defective views and replace them with impeccable onesIn order to do this we have to be scrupulous in being observantAnd we have to be scrupulous in reflecting on our past actions both the things weve done right and the things weve done wrongFor the most part we dont observe our actions carefullyWe make the same mistakes over and over againWe cause ourselves suffering but dont take it to heart to prevent it from happening againThis is why we keep spinning around endlessly in the cycles of samsaraWe keep making mistakes but we dont recognize them as mistakesWe do things right from time to time but dont recognize why theyre rightSo everything gets all confusedBut if we train ourselves to be observant to keep cleansing the heart so that we wont repeat our mistakes a second time wont cause ourselves to suffer in that way a second time well be able to make choices that really benefit usWhen we look at our past beliefs and actions and then compare them with the actions of those who are wise well see which things are useless and well stop doing themBut if we dont let go of our old views we wont be able to stop doing the things we should stopWe wont be able to give up the things we should give upAs long as we hold onto our old views the same old sufferings will keep shadowing usWell never be able to find the path leading to the end of sufferingThis is why the noble eightfold path begins with sammaditthi or right viewRight view correctly describes things right around us  within and without us  that have always been that way from time immemorialSo when you see the Dhamma  the truth of things as they already are  youll be willing to let go of your old opinions and follow the path taught by the BuddhaFor the Buddha taught these truths so that we could study and know the genuine truthIt doesnt hurt to believe the BuddhaIt can only help usHis Awakening was for the benefit and happiness of the beings of the world for the purification of the beings of the world who have the wisdom and discernment to follow the path that he followedThe arising of a Buddha leads to suffering only for those whose pride prevents them from following his pathTheyre the only ones who dont benefit from his AwakeningWe should be open and honest with ourselves about our pride our viewsWe shouldnt hide them from ourselvesWe should bring them out and flush them outDont keep feeding themFor the most part theyre not the sort of friends who will help make us bright clean and pureDont go thinking that the ideas we like will necessarily help make us bright clean and pureWe should pry them out unfurl them clean them out so that all our defective views can be cut awayWhen were free of defective views well be left with impeccable views views that are a treasure in terms of our thinkingWhen our views are impeccable our virtues will be impeccableAnd when our virtues form a good solid foundation training the mind becomes easy and free from difficultiesThe problem right now is that our views run contrary to the truth and are always ready to make false assumptionsWe see stressful things as pleasurable short things as long things that should be done as things not to be doneWe see things that are filthy that should be straightened out to put them in line with the truth and we simply leave them as they are at odds with the truthSo how can we hope to gain release from sufferingHow can we hope to reach purityThe mind is something subtle and sensitive easily misled by subtle misunderstandings to say nothing of blatant onesThis is why the Buddha set out a training regime for our character habits to make us compliant and respectful toward the truth even in the smallest matters seeing danger in even the slightest faultsIn other words he pointed out even the slightest faults that we should avoid should abandon but we feel that we cant do without themWe dont see them as faultsThis means we dont see the frightening dangers that will arise from our own wrong actionsSo were audacious in doing whats wrongAs for the things the Buddha told us to do were not willing to do them not willing to follow him all because of our views and our prideThis is why we cant reach the stream to nibbanaIf we want to practice so as to abandon our pride so as to enter the stream to the transcendent we have to straighten out our views  in particular selfidentity viewsThese are the very first doorIf we cant straighten out these sorts of wrong views we wont be able to find the door through the wall that separates us from the DeathlessWell simply circle around the outside perimeterNo matter how many lifetimes we practice well just keep walking around the perimeter of the wall if we cant straighten out these viewsSo we should train ourselves to examine our many subtle views in all their elaborationsWe should give rise to conviction thats stronger than what we already haveWe should make our respect stronger than what it already is and be willing to follow the Buddhas instructionsWhen he says to renounce something we should renounce it even if it means putting our life on the line even if it means dyingOnly then will we come out victorious making an opening in the wall of our viewsIf were not willing to make that level of sacrifice theres no way well succeedSo remember this If were not willing to make that level of sacrifice theres no way well succeedIf you want to get through the final wall so as to gain total release from dying and birth you have to stop circling around the outside perimeter like thisIf you keep acting the way you are youll never gain release from suffering and stressSo try to be observant try to evaluate the preoccupations that lie buried in your heartWhat are the obstacles the defilements you have to undo so that you can come out victoriousIf you cant overcome them using one method try other methods until you canDont let them become you Dont let them become your self making you engage in Imaking and mymaking and selfidentity viewsOnce there are selfidentity views the stupidity of the mind will lead to uncertainty so that you cant come to any clear and genuine conclusionsYoull grasp at external things  this is whats called grasping at precepts and practices  like the Jains in the time of the Buddha who thought they would succeed in gaining release through external practices without training the mind to give rise to discernmentThey felt that if they followed their practices external forces would come and save them some god would come and save themBut the purity of our external actions is something only we can knowAs the Buddha taught theres no one else who can come and save usOnly we can save ourselvesTheres no god greater than the help we give ourselvesSo dont let yourself be misledVanquish your wrong views so that you can be genuinely compliant toward the Buddha genuinely believing in his teachings with genuine respectKeep on meditatingWhen we meditate we let go of our present preoccupationsNormally the mind is always preoccupied with the various objects that the eye sees the ear hears the nose smells the tongue tastes and the body comes into contact withBut when we want peace of mind we have to see these objects as coarse and grossWe try to let go of things that are gross things that are sensualWe focus instead on things that are more refined and of more lasting value step by stepWe keep on getting the mind to gather in stillness keep on letting go of everything elseIts like when we go to sleep we have to let go of distracting thoughts we have to stop thinking have to cut those things away if were going to sleep in comfortAs long as the mind is in a turmoil over those things and cant let them go it wont be able to fall asleepItll have no sense of ease wont gain any strengthEven more so when we meditate we have to cut away all our other preoccupations let them all go leaving only buddhoAdjust your attitude so that you can find a sense of ease at the same time youre repeating buddho to yourselfDont let yourself get bored or tired of the meditationHow do you develop a sense of easeThrough your conviction in what youre doingNo matter what the job if you can do it with a sense of conviction a sense of respect for your work you can keep at it continuouslyEven if the sun is beating down and youre all tired and worn out you can keep on doing itIf you do it with a sense of desire for the results a sense of persistence intentness and circumspection you can keep on doing it without getting tiredWhen you do your work with this attitude you can keep at it alwaysThis is why our teachers were able to live with a sense of contentment even when they were out in the mountain wildsThey put effort into their meditation with a sense of ease and wellbeing in the peace of mind they were able to maintain through restraining the mind with mindfulnessIf their hearts were already inclined to stillness and seclusion then as soon as the mind had developed its foundation they were able to keep it going without any difficultiesIt became automatic and they were able to experience a sense of wellbeing  the stillness the fullness the brightness of the mindSo adjusting the mind properly in this way is something very important for anyone who wants peace of mindKeep reminding yourself to develop an attitude of conviction and this will give energy and encouragement to your effortsIf your conviction persistence and mindfulness are strong youll be able to win out over any restless anxious sleepy or lazy states of mindYoull be able to win out over these things through the qualities of mind you developThe qualities of mind were developing are like strategic weaponsWe develop mindfulnessWe develop alertnessWe pick out our one object of meditation  This is what Im going to fasten on  and then we both keep it in mind and stay aware of itWhen we refuse to let go of it when we hold on tight to a single object it becomes the quality called singleness of preoccupationWhen this singleness of mind arises it can cut through restlessness cut through anxietyIt includes both mindfulness and persistence and can keep the mind firmly gathered in one placeWhen this singleness of mind arises it turns into firm concentrationThe mind gets more refined and can let go of everything else step by stepThis singleness is the refined part that holds through all the levels of right concentrationIn the first level you have to have singleness of preoccupation in chargeEven though theres also directed thought evaluation rapture and pleasure singleness of preoccupation has to be thereDirected thought and evaluation are the coarser parts of the concentrationYoull know as the mind gets more refined because it lets go of them leaving just singleness of preoccupation rapture and pleasureRapture is the coarsest of these three so you let go of it leaving just pleasure and singleness of preoccupationPleasure is the coarser of these two so you let go of it leaving just singleness of preoccupation and equanimityWhen the mind has a sense of steady equanimity firm and unwavering If you want to call it tender its tender in that it doesnt put up any resistance to the Dhamma doesnt resist the truth of things as they areIt doesnt disputeIts willing to accept that truthBut if you want to call it tough its tough in that its firm and unwaveringNormally when things are soft and tender they waver and move when theyre struck by anythingBut when the mind is tender in this way it becomes tough insteadNo one can fool itIt doesnt waver its not affected by anythingThis is the nature of the mind in concentrationWhy doesnt it waverBecause its seen the truthIts fullIts not hungry in any way that could make it waver that could let it get temptedIt doesnt want anything elseWe human beings when we have a sense of enough were freeFor this reason meditators need a solid theme that they can hold toIf you dont know or havent studied much Dhamma you can simply remember in brief that this body of ours is DhammaEvery part of it is DhammaConventional Dhammas formulated Dhammas all the way up to absolute Dhammas all can be found in this bodySo we should pay attention to the body as its actually present right hereWhen we know our own body we wont have any doubts about other people other bodiesSo to give strength to the mind we should repeat to ourselves any of the meditation themes dealing with the body so that the mind will settle down and come to restIf repeating buddho buddho is too refined for you  if you cant find anything to hold to or dont know where to focus  you can focus on the breathIts blatant enough for you to fix your attention on it  when it comes in you know its coming in when it goes out you know its going outOr if thats too refined you can focus on the parts of the bodyIf you want to focus on hair of the head repeat kesa kesa to yourselfYouve seen head hairs you can remember them so fix the memory in your mind and then repeat kesa kesaFor hair of the body you can repeat loma loma and so onRepeat the names of any of the parts until your awareness gathers in with the repetition and settles down into stillnessIf you want you can focus on any one of the bonesRepeat atthi atthiWhere is the bone youre focusing onIts really right thereWhat kinds of features does it haveIt really has them  after all youve seen bones beforeYou can remember what the big bones and little bones are likeSo call them to mind focus on them and repeat their names so as to build a firm foundation for concentration and mindfulness in the mindOnce your foundation is firm and steady from the practice of repetition you move on to investigation to insight meditationYou analyze these things to see them as aniccam or inconstantWhy does the Buddha say theyre inconstantWe want them to be constantWe dont want them to changeThe Buddha teaches us to let go of them but we cant let them go  because our views run contrary to the DhammaThats why we cant let goThe word let go here means that we dont hold onto themEven though we still live with them we just live with them nothing moreEven though we make use of these things we simply use them nothing moreEven though we make the body move its just movementYou have to keep this understanding in mind so that wrong views dont overwhelm youSo that delusion doesnt overwhelm youAs long as these things exist we make use of themAfter all theyre here to useThe Buddha and his noble disciples all made use of these things without any thought of their being anything other than what they are  that they might be constant that they might give rise to true pleasure that they might be us or ours We use these things in line with our duties as long as theyre here for us to useWhen they change into something else they change in line with their duties in line with the laws of the DhammaThe Buddha thus taught us to familiarize ourselves with whats normal in life aging is normal illness is normal death is normal separation from the people and things we love is normalWhen we analyze them we realize that theyre all going to have to leave usThey wont stay with us foreverWhen even these five khandhas that were looking after all the time arent really ours how can our children really be oursHow can our parents really be oursHow can our possessions really be oursTheyre all anatta notselfWe train and exercise our minds in this way until theyre adept in the same way that we memorize our lessons in schoolOnce theyre firmly imbedded in the mind the mind wont go against the truth of the DhammaIt will believe the truth of the Dhamma be inclined to follow the truth of the DhammaIt wont suffer for it follows in line with the laws of truthWhen we dont struggle against the truth of the Dhamma there wont be any sorrow or distress when things change for weve come to know and accept the truthSo all we have to do is come and know the truthIt doesnt lie far awayThe things that will cure our sufferings the most important things that will help us cross over birth and becoming all come simply from making our knowledge of whats truly here firm and unwavering so that it can push the mind lift the mind over and above any influences that might come to make an impact on it  so that it will gain release from defilement release from sorrow release from distressThe meditation were practicing here is simply for the purpose of knowing the truth as it actually isAs long as we havent yet reached it we wont see itWhen we dont see it all we know about it is news what weve read in books or heard on tapes or heard our teachers describeThats simply newsThe mind hasnt seen itThe ears have simply received it the eyes have simply taken it in from books but theyre simply passive receptors holding it as labels and memories thats allThe reaching has to be done by the heartThe heart is what reaches the truthAnd once the heart has reached it you dont have to worryItll be the hearts own treasureSo we have to train the heart to be intelligent so that it will gain true happiness true release from danger from suffering and stressPractice so that your mind reaches it so that it will see itAt the moment it hasnt gotten there yetSo far its all only in your ears and eyesSo we all have to put our hearts into the meditationFocus on whats truly here so that the heart will reach the truth  the noble truthsWhatever suffering or stress is here in your body and mind is all part of the dukkha sacca the noble truth of stressWhatever delusion passion or delight that depends on delusion  however much whatever the object within or without  is all samudaya sacca the noble truth of the origination of stressAll the things that we like that give rise to desire to the point of clinging when we get them we latch onto themWhen we lose them we look for them againWhen we dont have them we sufferThis is what makes the mind travel through all the levels of being great and smallIn the teaching on dependent coarising the Buddha said that it all comes from not knowingWe dont discern contact dont discern feeling dont discern craving dont discern clinging dont discern becoming dont discern birth all of this is called avijja or unawarenessSo do you discern these things yet or notWhen sights strike the eye day in and day out is your mindfulness ready to handle them or notIs your discernment up on the tricks of the defilements or notIf not you have to be observant to gather and restrict all your attention to whats right here for when defilements arise they arise right hereIf discernment is to see the defilements to the point of giving rise to right view itll have to see and know right hereIf we gather and restrict our attention to whats right here were sure to know and seeIf we want to be mindful and alert we cant do it anywhere elseRemember this point well and put it into practiceWhen these words are spoken you hear them but when you get up you forget themThen when the time comes to meditate again you dont know what to pick as your theme of practiceYou forget everything throw it all awaySo theres nothing but you  no Dhamma to know no Dhamma to see no Dhamma to put into practiceIts all you and yours your body and when the body is yours feelings are yours perceptions are yours thought constructs are yours consciousness is yoursSo you get possessive of whats yours and theres nothing left to be DhammaThats why your practice doesnt progressAll progress has to come from a point of one Once one is firmly established then there can be two and three If one is lacking everything else will be lackingActually when we separate things out there is no two or three When we dont lump things together theres only one Even groups of ten or twenty people are all made up of one person  that one person this one person that one person over thereSo in our practice we first have to establish one  this body of oursWhats here in the bodyWe have mental events and physical phenomena thats twoThen theres feeling pleasure pain neither pleasure nor pain thats threeWhen we separate things out theres lots of them but its all this one person this one lump sitting here encased in skinBut when you analyze things out you have hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin Here its already a lotThen you can analyze the eye consciousness formsIts a lot of things but all one thing one mass of suffering and stressNothing elseJust know this one thing until its all clearYou dont have to know a lot of things just this one bodyOnce you really see the truth the mind will let go of its burdensWe suffer because we keep piling things on  Thats us thats ours thats them thats theirs  through the power of attachment clinging to things not wanting them to changeWhen the mind starts meditating by mentally repeating its theme it can let things go for a whileYou hold onto buddho or any of the other themesYou dont take refuge in the bodyYou take refuge in buddho buddho until the mind settles downThat gives you a greater sense of wellbeing than you could get from these other thingsWhen you can let go even of this level of wellbeing youll reach the real buddhaThats where theres purity thats where theres true wellbeing with no more need to go swimming through birth and death no more need to torment yourself by having to sit and meditate like this again  because there will be nothing to torment nothing to meditate on any moreWhen you let go of everything there are no more issuesSo we meditate to give rise to the discernment that sees the drawbacks of things and lets go of them allThats when there are no more burdens no more kammaIt sounds easy but you have to let go of everythingIf you havent let go of everything theres more kamma to do more work to doSo were taught cago  renunciation patinissaggo  relinquishment mutti  release analayo  no place for the defilements to dwellSoKeep on meditatingWell now start meditating just as weve been doing every dayWe have to look at this as an important opportunityEven though our practice hasnt yet reached the Dhamma to our satisfaction at the very least its a beginning an important beginning in gathering the strength of the mind so that our mindfulness concentration and discernment will become healthy and matureWe should try to gather these qualities together so that they can reinforce one another in washing away the stains the defilements in our minds  for when defilements arise they dont lead to peace purity or respite for the mindJust the opposite they lead to suffering unrest and disturbanceThey block any discernment that would know or see the DhammaTheres no defilement that encourages us to practice the Dhamma to know or see the DhammaThey simply get in the way of our practiceSo whatever mental state gets in the way of our practice we should regard as a defilement  for defilements dont come floating along on their ownThey have to depend on the mindAny mental state thats sleepy or lazy any mental state thats restless angry or irritable these are all defilementsTheyre mental states under the influence of defilement overcome by defilementIf any of these mental states arise within us we should be aware of themWhen the mind is sleepy we should get it to keep buddho in mind so that it will wake up and shake off its sleepinessWhen the mind is restless and irritable we should use our discernment to reflect on things to see that these states of mind serve no purposeThen we should quickly turn back to our concentration practice planting the mind firmly in our meditation theme not letting the mind get restless and distracted againWe focus the mind on being aware of its meditation word buddho  whats aware whats awakeWe keep it in mind as if it were a post planted firmly in the groundDont let the mind wander from the foundation post on which youve focusedBut whatever your focus dont let your focus be tenseYou have to keep the mind in a good mood while its focusedDo this with an attitude of mindfulness and discernment not one of delusion wanting to know this or to see that or to force things to fall in line with your thoughtsIf thats the way you meditate your mood will grow tense and you wont be able to meditate for longIn no time at all youll start getting irritableSo if you want to meditate for a long time you have to be neutral with equanimity as your foundationIf you want knowledge focus firmly on what youre already aware ofKeep your mind firmly in placeFind an approach that will help you stay focused without slipping awayFor example make an effort to keep your mind firmly intent and apply your powers of observation and evaluation to the basis of your buddhoAll of these things have to be brought together at the same spot along with whatever thinking you need to do so that mindfulness wont lapse letting unskillful outside issues come barging in or leaving an opening for internal preoccupations to arise in the heart or letting yourself get disturbed by thoughts of the past  things you knew or saw or said or did earlier today or many days many months many years agoYou have to focus exclusively on the presentIf youve taken buddho as your meditation theme keep coming back to it over and over againBuddho stands for awarenessIf you can maintain awareness without lapse this will make an important differenceIf youve taken the breath as your theme you have to be aware each time the breath comes in and outYou cant let yourself wander offYou have to take nothing but the breath as the focal point for mindfulnessThe same principles hold in either caseYou do the same things the only difference is the theme of your awarenessWhy does the Buddha teach us to focus on the breathBecause we dont have to look for it dont have to guess about it dont have to think it into beingIts a present phenomenonTheres no such thing as a past breath or a future breathTheres simply the breath coming in and out in the presentThats why its appropriate for exercising our mindfulness for gathering our mindfulness and awareness in a single place for firmly establishing concentrationSo you can focus on either theme  whichever one youve already meditated on and found that mindfulness can quickly get established without lapsing and can quickly produce a sense of stillness and peaceSet that theme up as your foundationWhen youre starting out focus on keeping that theme in mindOnce the mind has had enough stillness if you simply want it to become more still the mind will get into a state where it isnt doing any work because its not distracted in any wayIf this happens you have to start contemplatingIn the foundations of mindfulness were taught to contemplate the various aspects of the body in and of themselvesWe dont have to contemplate anything elseIf you want to contemplate from the angle of inconstancy its here in this bodyIf you want to contemplate from the angle of stress its here in this bodyYou can contemplate it from any angle at allIf you want to contemplate from the angle of eliminating passion and craving you can look at things that are dirty and disgusting  and you find that they fill the bodyThis is something requiring you to use your own intelligenceWhatever angle you use you have to look into things so that they get more subtle and refinedContemplate them again and again until you see things clearly in a way that gives rise to nibbida or disenchantment so that you arent deluded into latching onto things and giving them meanings the way you used toTurn over a new mind turning your views into new viewsYou no longer want your old mistaken viewsTurning from your old views give rise to right viewsTurning from your old ways of thinking give rise to right resolves  to see the body as repulsive and unattractiveThis is nekkhammasankappa the resolve for renunciation the resolve to escape from sensual passionWe dont go thinking in other directions or roaming off in other directionsWe try to go in the direction of escaping from the view that the body is beautifulWhat the eye sees of the body is just the outer skinIts never seen the filthy things insideEven though it may have seen them from time to time as when someone dies in an accident or when a patient is opened for surgery theres something in the mind that keeps us from taking it to heart and giving rise to discernmentTheres something that keeps us from contemplating things down to a level more subtle than what the eye seesWe see these things and then pass right over themWe dont get to a level profound enough to give rise to disenchantmentSo contemplate the bodyIf the mind has developed a strong enough foundation it shouldnt stay stuck just at the level of stillnessBut if you havent yet reached that level of stillness you cant skip over itYou first have to make the mind still because a firm foundation of stillness is absolutely essentialIf you try to contemplate before the mind has grown still youll give rise to knowledge that lasts only as long as youre in meditationWhen you leave meditation and the mind is no longer firm your new understandings will disappearYour old understandings will come back just as if you had never meditatedWhatever way youve been deluded in the past thats how youll be deluded againWhatever views youve had before wont change into anything elseWhatever ways youve thought youll end up deluded just as before as long as your new ways of thinking arent based on a foundation of stillnessThis is why stillness is so essentialWe have to get the mind to gain strength from stillness and then let it contemplate the body in and of itself in terms of its partsYou can choose any one of the parts focusing on it until its clearOr you can focus on the parts in sets of fiveWhen you reach the liquid parts you can focus on them in sets of six for there are of them in allYou can contemplate them back and forth  if your mindfulness hasnt yet been exercised to the point were its firm contemplate these things back and forth just as a preceptor teaches a new ordinand kesa loma nakha danta taco and then turning them around to taco danta nakha loma kesaThen you can go onto the next set of five  mansam nharu atthi atthimiñjam vakkamThis is called contemplating them in sets of fiveThis is how we start out exercising mindfulnessIf while youre practicing mindfulness in this way a visual image of any of these five parts appears catch hold of it and contemplate it so that it grows deeper and more refinedContemplate it until you can divide the body into its parts seeing that each part is just like thisGet so that you know the body inside and out realizing that other living beings are just like this tooIf youre looking to see whats unclean youll find it hereIf youre looking to see whats notself youll find it hereTurn these things over in your mind and question yourself as to whether theyre constantWhat kind of pleasure is there in these thingsIs it worthwhile or notFocus on these issues often look at them often until youre adept and the mind will finally be willing to accept the truth changing from its old wrong ways of seeing things and seeing them instead in line with the Dhamma as taught by the BuddhaWhen your views change often in this way the mind will experience a new kind of stillness and peaceIt will turn away from the fevers of the fires of passion aversion and delusion and turn into mindfulness concentration and discernment insteadIts knowledge and views will become clearIt will no longer waverIt will become brave and no longer afraid in the way it used to be  for it has come to know the truth that nothing gets pained aside from the aggregates nothing dies aside from the elementsThe mind gets firmly plantedIt can meditate with a snug sense of confidence with no fear of pain or illness or anything at allYou can separate things out all the way downEven if death were to come at that point youd be content for even though death hasnt yet come these things have separated out of their own accordYouve contemplated them and seen them for what they are each and every oneSo I ask that we all have firm principles in our contemplationBe genuine in doing it  dont just go through the motions  for all these things are genuineIf we dont meditate defilements will inhabit our thoughts deceiving us so that we dont see things as they genuinely areIf we depend just on our eyes they can fool usThe eye can see only the outside of thingsIt sees skin and the skin can be made up to deceive usIt sees hair of the head and hair can be made up to deceive usIt sees hair of the body  things like eyebrows and beards which can be dressed to deceive usIt sees fingernails and toenails which can be made up to deceive usIt sees teeth which can be treated to deceive us so that we make all sorts of assumptions about themThe eye has no discernmentIt lets us get deceived  but it isnt what does the deceivingThe mind is what deceives itselfOnce it deceives itself it makes all sorts of assumptions about itself and falls for itselfWhen it makes itself suffer in this way theres no help for itThis is the genuine truthKnow clearly that the mind is what deceives itselfWhen it doesnt have a refuge it can deceive itself all the timeSo we have to develop qualities that the mind can hold to and take refuge in so that defilements wont be able to keep on deceiving itLook so that you can see more deeply through thingsTry to analyze things to see whats not genuine whats dressed and disguisedThen as soon as you look at anything youll see whats fake and made upYoull know The real thing doesnt have this color this smell this shape Youll see how things are always changingThis is called having the qualities of the Dhamma as your refuge as something to hold to as you look hear smell taste and make contact with thingsYoull have the qualities that know and see things as they actually are  so they wont be able to deceive youYou wont be able to deceive yourself for youd be ashamed toThe heart grows disenchanted with itself with its old ways  and why would it want to deceive itself any moreIts seen that it doesnt gain any benefit from that kind of behaviorInstead youll see how it really benefits from its new viewsThey make the mind stillClearSet free with a sense of wellbeingAll its heavy old burdens fall awayIt has no greed for gaining a lot of things for theres no more indulgingIt doesnt use anything to indulge itselfAll it needs is the four necessities to keep life going  thats enoughIt doesnt have to invest in anythingIt finds its happiness and wellbeing in the stillness that comes from meditatingThe things around it that it used to fall for and build up into ignorance without realizing it when it focuses on really knowing these things its delusions disbandIgnorance disappearsThe mind gains knowledge from these things in line with what they actually areIt wises up and doesnt fall for these things as it used to doesnt misunderstand them as it used toAnd thats the end of its problems Knowing the Dhamma means knowing the truthWhere does the Dhamma lieNot far off at allWhere are rupadhammasAre there any physical phenomena within usAre any namadhammas within usTheyre both within us but we dont know how to read them to decipher them because we havent yet studied themOr even when we have tried to study them we still cant decipher them in line with the standards set by the BuddhaSo lets try to decipher our body our actions in thought word and deedOur actions dont lie anywhere elseThey show themselves in the activity of the bodySo we use the body in line with the Dhamma abstaining from the activities that defile it killing stealing engaging in illicit sexWhen we abstain from these things weve begun practicing the DhammaWe abstain from telling lies from divisive speech from abusive speech from idle chatterWhen were mindful to show restraint in what we say we wont encounter any dangers coming from our speechThere are no dangers when we practice in line with the Buddhas wayAs for the mind we cleanse it by meditatingWe use mindfulness to look after the heart to make sure it doesnt get involved in anything defiling or uncleanWe keep it cheerful blooming and bright in its meditation in investigating the Dhamma knowing the Dhamma seeing the Dhamma until it settles down in the stillness that weve developed and kept composedWe keep it blooming and brightWherever you go this is how you should practiceMake your composure continuousThe mind will then gain strength so that it can let go of its external preoccupations and stay focused exclusively within at peace and at ease bright and clear staying right hereThen when you want to gain discernment you can investigateFocus mindfulness on keeping the body in mind and then investigate itThis is called dhammavicaya investigating phenomenaYou investigate the physical phenomena in the body to see them in line with the four noble truthsYou look at the arising of physical phenomena right hereYou look at the aging the illness the death of phenomena right here within youIf you really look for it youll see that the body is full of deathHow do we see death when the body is still breathing and able to walk aroundWe can see it if our discernment is subtle and preciseThe Buddha saw death with every inandout breath so why cant weHe once asked VenAnanda how often he paid attention to death in the course of a day and Ananda answered One hundred times The Buddhas response was Youre still too complacentYou should pay attention to death with every inandout breath What kind of death can you look at with every inandout breathWhatever fades away ends and disappears thats deathAs for the death of the whole body that comes closer every day closer with each inandout breathThis runs down that wears outWe have to keep creating things to replace what gets worn outAnd whatever we create keeps wearing out tooSo we should keep track of the wearing out  whats called vayadhamma degenerationThe Buddha saw this with every momentThis is the sort of seeing that allows us to see the noble truth that birth is stressful aging is stressfulTheres no ease in agingLook so that you see this clearlyPain and illness are stressful death is stressful all the affairs that come with birth create hardships turmoil and stressWhen you investigate in line with the Buddhas Dhamma youll see the truth for yourself in every way just as the Buddha didFor its all right hereYoull gain discernment and intelligence no longer deluded into grasping hold of suffering and making it your self no longer grasping hold of inconstant things and making them your selfWhatevers inconstant leave it as inconstant and dont make it youWhatevers stressful leave it as stressful and dont make it youTheres no you in any of those thingsWhen you aim your investigation in the direction of seeing this clearly the mind will let go and attain peace inner solitude free from clingingIts as when we carry something heavy on our shoulderWe know its heavy because its weighing on our shoulderBut when we put it down its no longer heavy on usIn the same way when we see that birth is stressful aging is stressful illness is stressful death is stressful then we should examine those things as they arise to see that theyre not usThen well be able to let them goWe should look after our mind to make sure that it doesnt give rise to the assumption that any of those things are us or ours or that they lie within usThose things are just objects elements and we leave them at thatStress then has no owner on the receiving endIts just like when you put down a burden theres nothing heavy about it at allSo stress is nothing more than things coming together to make contactSuppose that we have a big hunk of limestoneWhen we lift it up its heavyBut if we burn it in a fire pound it into dust and the wind blows it away then wheres the heavinessIts nowhere at allBefore when the limestone was still in the ground they had to use explosives to get it outIt was so heavy that they needed cranes to lift it upBut now that its pulverized the heaviness is goneIts the same with suffering and stressIf we investigate them down to the details so that we can see them clearly for what they truly are theres no self there at allWe get down to the basic elements of experience and we see that theyre not our self in the least little bitIf we look at the hair of the head its not selfFingernails and toenails are not selfLook at every part of the body in detailOr look at its elementary propertiesExactly where are you in any of those thingsTheres no you in there at allThe same is true when you look at feelingsTheres no you in there at allTheres simply contact the contact of objects against the senses thats allIf you let go so the mind can come to rest none of these things will touch it in a way that weighs on itOnly deluded people grab hold of these things which is why they feel weighed downIf we let them go we dont feel weighed down at allWhen we let go of the aggregates theyre not stressfulBut we dont know how to let them go because of birthLike the mental state youve given rise to here youve created it so that it will take birthOnce youve given rise to it then  unless youre given a good reason  theres no way youll be willing to let it goIts the same as when someone suddenly comes to chase us out of our homeWho would be willing to goWed go only if we were offered a better place to stay  a safer more comfortable place to stayIf we were offered such a place who would be willing to stayIf we had a better place to go we could abandon our old home with no problemIn the same way if were going to let go of the blatant aggregates we need a better place to stay a home for the mind a state of concentrationJust like the Buddha and his noble disciples when they let go of the blatant aggregates they entered cessation they entered jhanaWhen they fully let go of all aggregates they entered nibbanaWe however dont yet have anything else to depend on which is why we cant let goWe first have to create a refuge for ourselvesAt the very least we should try to keep buddho buddho in mindWhen we really reach buddho  when the mind is really a mind awake  then we can depend on itAt the moment though we havent reached the mind awakeWeve reached nothing but the demons of defilement and they keep haunting usWere embroiled with nothing but demons we lie under their powerFor instance maccumara the demon of death whose followers  aging and illness  we fear so muchKilesamara delusions and defilementsThese are all demonsKhandhamara our attachments to the five aggregates are all demonsAbhisankharamara the thoughts we create good or bad are all demons if we fall for them  meritorious creations demeritorious creations imperturbable creationsThese are the subtle demons the demons that bedeviled the Buddha on the way to Awakening dressing themselves up as this and thatIf were going to let go of these things we first need something better to hold ontoAt the very least we need jhana levels of mental stillness more refined than what we have at presentSo we should all try to give rise to the refined levels of peace and ease Ive mentioned hereWhen we get disenchanted with turmoil we can enter a state of stillnessWhen we get disenchanted with defilement we can cleanse the heart and make it bright with the DhammaWell have our home in the Dhamma in concentrationThe heart can then delight with rapture and ease as its foodWell have no desire for coarse foodWhen we let go of the blatant aggregates we enter the Brahma level of refined rapture and easeEven the sensual devas dont eat coarse food like oursAs for the Brahmas theyre even clearer than that more radiant within themselvesTheir jhana is pure and their concentration radiantThe food of this concentration is the rapture and ease they experienceEven here on the human level when we gain rapture from concentration we feel full and happyIf we abandon the blatant aggregates leaving just the mind in its attainment of concentration imagine how much pleasure and ease there will beWell no longer have to be involved in these heavy burdens of oursWe wont have to worry about the five or the eight precepts because well be in a pure state of jhana with no thought of getting stuck on anything defilingThe mind will be brightWhen you understand this focus back on your heartExamine it carefullyBe intent on practicing heedfully and youll meet with prosperity and easeIn general terms Right Concentration means establishing the mind rightlyOn one level this can apply to all the factors of the pathYou have to start out by setting the mind on Right ViewIn other words you use your discernment to gather together all the Dhamma youve heardThen when you set the mind on Right Resolve thats also a way of establishing it rightlyThen you set it on Right Speech speaking only things that are rightYou set it on Right Action examining your actions and then forcing yourself watching over yourself to keep your actions firmly in line with whats rightAs for Right Livelihood you set your mind on providing for your livelihood exclusively in a right wayYoure firm in not making a livelihood in ways that are wrong not acting in ways that are wrong not speaking in ways that are corrupt and wrongYou wont make any effort in ways that go off the path you wont be mindful in ways that lie outside the pathYoull keep being mindful in ways that stay on the pathYou make this vow to yourself as a firm determinationThis is one level of establishing the mind rightlyBut what I want to talk about today is Right Concentration in the area of meditation in other words Right Meditation both in the area of tranquillity meditation and in the area of insight meditationYou use the techniques of tranquillity meditation to bring the mind to stillnessWhen you make the mind still firm in skillful qualities thats one aspect of Right ConcentrationIf the mind isnt firmly established in skillful qualities it cant grow stillIf unskillful qualities arise in the mind it cant settle down and enter concentrationThis is why when the Buddha describes the mind entering concentration he says Vivicceva kamehi Quite secluded from sensual preoccupationsThe mind isnt involved doesnt incline itself toward sights that will give rise to infatuation and desireIt doesnt incline itself toward sounds that it likes toward aromas tastes or tactile sensations for which it feels infatuation through the power of desireAt the same time it doesnt incline itself toward desire for those thingsBefore the mind can settle into concentration it has to let go of these five types of preoccupationsThis is called vivicceva kamehi quite secluded from sensual preoccupationsVivicca akusalehi dhammehi quite secluded from the unskillful qualities called the five HindrancesFor example the first Hindrance is sensual desireWhen you sit in meditation and a defilement arises in the mind when you think of something and feel desire for an internal or an external form when you get infatuated with the things youve seen and known in the past thats called sensual desireOr if you think of something that makes you dissatisfied to the point of feeling ill will for certain people or objects thats the Hindrance of ill willThings from the past that upset you suddenly arise again in the present barge their way in to obstruct the stillness of your mindWhen the mind gets upset in this way thats an unskillful mental state acting as an obstacle to concentrationOr sloth and torpor a sense of laziness and inattentiveness when the mind isnt intent on its work and so lets go out of laziness and carelessnessIt gets drowsy so that it cant be intent on its meditationYou sit here thinking buddho buddho but instead of focusing the mind to get it firmly established so that it can gain knowledge and understanding from its buddho you throw buddho away to go play with something elseAs awareness gets more refined you get drowsy and fall asleep or else let delusion overcome the mindThis is an unskillful mental state called sloth and torporThen theres restlessness and anxiety when mindfulness isnt keeping control over things and the mind follows its preoccupations as they shoot out to things you like and dont likeThe normal state of peoples minds is that when mindfulness isnt in charge the mind cant sit stillIts bound to keep thinking about different kinds of thingsSo when youre practicing concentration you have to exercise restraint you have to be careful that the mind doesnt get scattered aboutYou have to be mindful of the present and alert to the present tooWhen you try to keep buddho in mind you have to be alert at the same time to watch over your buddhoOr if youre going to be mindful of the parts of the body  like hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin  you should focus on only one part at a time making sure that youre both mindful and alert to your mindfulness to make sure you dont go being mindful of other thingsThats how you can cut off restlessness and anxietyAs you keep being mindful of the same thing for a long time the body will gradually calm down and relaxThe preoccupations of the mind will calm down too so that the mind can grow stillIt grows still because you keep it under controlYou weaken its unruliness  as when you pull fuel away from a burning fireAs you keep pulling away the fuel the fire gradually grows weaker and weakerAnd whats the fuel for the minds unrulinessForgetfulnessInattentivenessThis inattentiveness is the fuel both for restlessness and anxiety and for sloth and torporWhen you keep mindfulness and alertness in charge you cut away forgetfulness and inattentivenessAs these forms of delusion are subdued they lose their powerThey gradually disband leaving nothing but awareness of buddho or whatever your meditation object isAs you keep looking after your meditation object firmly without growing inattentive restlessness will disappearDrowsiness will disappearThe mind will get firmly established in Right ConcentrationThis is how you enter Right ConcentrationYou have to depend on both mindfulness and alertness togetherRight Concentration cant simply arise on its ownIt needs supporting factorsThe first seven factors of the path are the supporters for Right Concentration or its requisites the things it needs to depend onIt needs Right View Right Resolve Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort and Right MindfulnessAs you keep developing the beginning factors of the path concentration becomes more and more refined step by stepWhen the mind is trained and suffused with these qualities its able to let go of sensual preoccupations able to let go of unskillful mental qualitiesVivicceva kamehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehiWhen its secluded from sensual preoccupations secluded from unskillful qualities it can enter concentrationIt experiences stillness rapture pleasure singleness of preoccupationBoth body and mind feel lightIn the first stage the mind isnt totally refined because it still has directed thought and evaluation in the factors of its concentrationIf your mindfulness is in good shape and can keep its object in mind without pulling away if your effort is right and alertness keeps watching over things the coarser parts of your concentration will drop away and the mind will grow more refined step by stepDirected thought and evaluation  the coarser parts  will drop away because they cant follow into that more refined stageAll thats left is rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupationAs you keep on meditating without letup things keep growing more refined step by stepRapture which is coarser than pleasure will drop away leaving the pleasurePleasure is coarser than equanimityAs you keep contemplating while the mind grows more refined the pleasure will disappear leaving just equanimityAs long as theres still pleasure equanimity cant ariseAs long as the mind is still feeding off pleasure its still engaged with something coarseBut as you keep up your persistent effort until you see that this pleasure still comes under the Three Characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself that its part of the aggregate of feeling the mind will let go of that coarser aspect and settle down with equanimityEven though equanimity too is part of the feeling aggregate its a feeling refined enough to cleanse the mind to the point where it can give rise to knowledge of refined levels of DhammaWhen the mind reaches this level its firm and unwavering because its totally neutralIt doesnt waver when the eye sees a form the ear hears a sound the nose smells an aroma the tongue tastes a flavor the body feels a tactile sensation or an idea comes to the mindNone of these things can make the mind waver when its in the factors of jhanaIt maintains a high level of purityThis is Right ConcentrationWe should all develop tranquillity meditation which can give temporary respite from suffering and stressBut in a state like this you simply have mindfulness in chargeDiscernment is still too weak to uproot the most refined levels of defilement and latent tendenciesThus for our Right Concentration to be complete were taught not to get carried away with the sense of pleasure it bringsWhen the mind has been still for an appropriate amount of time we should then apply the mind to contemplating the five aggregates for these aggregates are the basis for insight meditationYou cant develop insight meditation outside of the five aggregates  the aggregates of form feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousness  for these aggregates lie right within usTheyre right next to us with us at all timesSoHow do you develop the aggregate of form as a basis for insight meditationYou have to see it clearly in line with its truth that form is inconstantThis is how you beginAs you develop insight meditation you have to contemplate down to the detailsWhat is formForm covers hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin and all the four great elements that we can touch and seeAs for subsidiary forms they cant be seen with the eye but they can be touched and they depend on the four great elementsFor example sound is a type of form a type of subsidiary formAromas flavors tactile sensations are subsidiary forms that depend on the four great elementsThe sensory powers of the eye ear nose tongue and body are subsidiary forms  theyre physical events not mental events you knowThen there are masculinity and femininity which fashion the body to be male or female and create differences in male and female voices manners and other characteristicsThen theres the heart and then viññatirupa which allows for the body to move for speech to be spokenSo the Buddha taught that we should contemplate form in all its aspects so as to gain the insight enabling us to withdraw all our clinging assumptions that theyre us or oursHow does this happenWhen we contemplate well see that yam kiñci rupam atitanagatapaccuppannam all form  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is inconstant stressful and notselfIt all lies under the Three CharacteristicsWhen we remember this thats called pariyattidhamma the Dhamma of studyWhen we actually take things apart and contemplate them one by one to the point where we gain true knowledge and vision thats called the practice of insight meditation the discernment arising in line with the way things actually areThis is a short explanation of insight meditation focused just on the aggregate of formAs for feeling  the pleasures pains and feelings of neither pleasure nor pain within us  once weve truly seen form well see that the same things apply to feelingIts inconstantWhen its inconstant itll have to make us undergo suffering and stress because of that inconstancyWell be piling suffering on top of sufferingActually theres no reason why the mind should suffer from these things but we still manage to make ourselves suffer because of themEven though theyre notself theres suffering because we dont knowTheres inconstancy because we dont knowUnless we develop insight meditation to see clearly and know truly we wont be able to destroy the subtle latent tendency of ignorance the latent tendency of becoming the latent tendency of sensuality within ourselvesBut if were able to develop insight meditation to the point where we see form clearly in terms of the Three Characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself then disenchantment will ariseWhen the latent tendencies of ignorance and becoming are destroyed the latent tendency of sensuality will have no place to standTheres nothing it can fabricate for theres no delusionWhen ignorance disbands fabrications disbandWhen fabrications disband all the suffering that depends on fabrication will have to disband as wellThis is why we should practice meditation in line with the factors of the noble eightfold path as set down by the BuddhaTo condense it even further there are three trainings virtue concentration and discernmentVirtue  exercising restraint over our words and deeds  is part of the pathtranquillity meditation and insight meditation come under concentrationSo virtue concentration and discernment cover the pathOr if you want to condense things even further there are physical phenomena and mental phenomena  ie the body and mindWhen we correctly understand the characteristics of the body well see into the ways the body and mind are interrelatedThen well be able to separate them outWell see whats notself and what isnt notselfThings in and of themselves arent notself for they each have an inandofthemselvesIts not the case that theres nothing there at allIf there were nothing there at all how would there be contactThink about itTake the fire element who could destroy itEven though its notself its got an inandofitselfThe same holds true with the other elementsIn other words these things still exist simply that theres no more clingingSo I ask that you understand this and then put it correctly into practice so as to meet with happiness and progressThats enough explanation for nowKeep on meditating until the time is upSurvey your bodySurvey your mindYouve been practicing meditation continuously so even if your mind isnt yet quiet even though it hasnt reached a level of concentration as solid as youd like it to be meditation is still a skillful activity in terms of developing conviction developing persistenceAt the very least it will give results on the sensory level making you an intelligent person at the same time developing the perfections of your character on into the futureSo try not to get discouragedDont let yourself think that you havent seen any results from your meditationWhen you come right down to it what do you want from your meditationYou meditate to make the mind quiet and the mind becomes quiet from letting goThats what the meditation is letting goIf you meditate in order to get something thats craving the cause of sufferingMeditation isnt an affair of cravingThe Dhamma is already here so all we have to do is study it so that well know the truthThe truth isnt something newIts something thats been here from time immemorialAll the Buddhas of the past have awakened to this very same Dhamma this very same truthEven though the cosmos has changed from one aeon to another the Dhamma hasnt changed along with the cosmosNo matter which aeon a particular Buddha was born in he awakened to the same old truthHe taught the same old truthThe same Dhamma the same truth is always right here all the timeIts simply that we dont recognize itWe havent studied it down to its elemental propertiesAll I ask is that you be intent on studying itThe truth is always the truthIts always presentThe truth the Buddha taught starts with the principle that stressandsuffering is a truthDo you have any stress and sufferingExamine yourself carefullyIs there any stress and suffering within youOr is there none at allAs long as theres suffering within you the truth of the noble truths taught by the Buddha is still thereWhen youre mindful to keep your eye on the suffering appearing within you youre studying the truth in line with what it actually isBut in addition to pointing out the truth of suffering the Buddha also taught the path to the end of sufferingThis too is a truthThe Buddha has guaranteed that when we develop it in full measure well gain release from stress and sufferingIts not the case that suffering is the only truth that we have to lie buried in stress and sufferingThe Buddha found a way out of suffering like an intelligent doctor who not only understands diseases but also knows a miraculous medicine to cure themThis is why the truth of the path is so important for many many people who have put it into practice have gotten resultsThe truth of the path is something we put into practice to gain release from suffering  as we chanted just nowYe dukkham nappajanatiThose who dont discern sufferingAtho dukkhassa sambhavamSufferings causeTañca maggam na janatiWho dont understand the pathDukkhupasamagaminamThe way to the stilling of sufferingTe ve jatijarupagaTheyll return to birth and aging againIf we dont comprehend suffering and the way to the end of suffering well have to experience birth aging and death which are the causes not only of suffering but also of the craving leading to more sufferingWe should take joy in the fact that we have all the noble truths we needWe have suffering and the path to the end of suffering doesnt lie far awayWhen we look into the texts we find that the Buddha and his noble disciples didnt practice anything far awayThey purified the actions of their bodies and mindsThey did this by knowing their own bodies and minds in line with what they actually wereWhen we dont know our own bodies and minds as they actually are thats a cause of sufferingWhen we practice knowing our own bodies our own minds as they actually are thats the path to release from sufferingAside from this theres no path at allWe already have a bodyWe already have a mind  this knowing propertySo we take this knowing property and put it to use by studying the body in line with its three characteristics aniccata inconstancy dukkhata stressfulness and anattata notselfnessnessInconstancy and stressfulness lie on the side of suffering and its causeWe have to study things that are inconstant in order to see who they are whos responsible for them who really owns themThis issue of inconstancy is really importantRupam aniccam form is inconstantWho owns the formRupam dukkham form is stressfulWhos on the receiving end of the stressStress is something that has to depend on causes and conditions in order to ariseIt doesnt come on its ownJust like sound we have to depend on contact in order to hear itIf theres no contact we wont know where theres any soundIn the same way stress depends on contactIf theres no contact we wont know where theres any stressIf stress and suffering were able to burn us all on their own the Buddha would never have been able to gain release from themThere would be no way for us to practice for no matter what suffering would keep on burning us all on its ownBut the fact of the matter is that when we practice we can gain relief from suffering because suffering isnt built into the mind its not built into this knowing propertyIt has to depend on contact through the sense media in order for it to ariseThis is why sages study the truthAs when we chantAyam kho me kayoThis body of mineUddham padatalaFrom the soles of the feet on upAdho kesamatthakaFrom the crown of the head on downTacapariyantoSurrounded by skinWithin this body we have all five aggregates form feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousnessForm is the coarsest of the aggregates for we can touch it with our hand and see it with our eyesAs for feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousness theyre mental phenomenaEven though we cant touch them with the body we can still know them and experience themFor instance we constantly have feelings of pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor painPerception we remember things and label themThoughtfabrication creates thoughts and consciousness notices thingsWe all notice things label them fabricate thoughts about them and experience pleasure and pain because of themThe primary issue is the form of the bodyThe Buddha taught us to study it in order to know the noble truths in both form and mental phenomenaWhen he taught that birth is suffering aging is suffering death is suffering he was referring to the birth aging and death right here at the form where the five aggregates meet  this form we already haveAnd yet most of us dont like to reflect on the truth of these thingsWe think that birth is pleasurableWe get pleasure and stress all confusedIts because we dont realize the truth of these things that we dont search for a way outThe Buddha however knew this truth which was why he practiced contemplating itHe tested to see if birth is pleasurable by noticing if the mind could stay quiet with birth Are there any painsAnything disturbing the mindAnd whats paining and disturbing the mind aside from the birth the arising of things Its because of the birth of the body that we have to keep finding food for it requisites to keep it goingGreed anger and delusion arise because of birthAnd once theres birth theres aging deterioration wearing down wearing down all the timeWhatever we get runs out runs out every day wears down every dayThe Buddha awakened to the truth that birth isnt pleasurable at allThe only pleasure is when if we get hungry we eat enough to make the hunger go away for a little whileBut soon we get hungry againWhen we get hot out in the sun we take cover in the shade to cool down a bit but then we start feeling hot againWhen we get tired we restBut then if we lie down for a long time we start feeling stiffIf we walk for a long time we get wearyWhen this is the way things are the mind cant find any peace or restIt gets disturbed and gives rise to defilement because of birthAnd thats not the end of itOnce birth takes place its followed by aging and deteriorationNo matter how much you look after the body it wont stay with youIn the end it all falls apartAnd once it dies theres no one who can stay in charge of itIf we come to our senses only at that point and realize only when its already dead that it has to die its too late to do anything about itBut if we gain conviction in these truths now in the present before death comes we wont be complacent about our youth or lifeIf we can be mindful at all times that death is inevitable that  even though we may be as strong as a bull elephant  a disease could come along at any time and oppress us to the point where we cant even sit up cant do anything to help ourselves when we realize this were said not to be complacent in our healthThen we can act in ways truly benefiting ourselves providing us with the refuge well need when we can no longer take refuge in our youth health or lifeWherever you look in the body you see it wearing downWherever you look you see diseasesWherever you look you see things that are uncleanNothing at all in the body is really strong or lastingWhen you see this clearly youll no longer be fooled into clinging to itYou can analyze the body into its parts and see that theyre all inconstant stressful and notselfWhen you develop clear insight into notself youll be able to shake free of stress and inconstancyThats because inconstancy is a notself affair stress is a notself affairTheyre not our affairsSo what do we hope to gain by letting ourselves struggle and get defiled over themThis is why the noble ones when they see these truths call them the dangers in the cycles of samsaraYou have to understand whats meant by the term cycle Theres the cycle of defilement the cycle of action and the cycle of the results of actionThe cycle of defilement is the ignorance that makes the mind stupid and defiledThese defilements are the cause of stress suffering and dangerThen theres the cycle of actionAny actions we do under the influence of defilement keep us spinning in the cycle acting sometimes in skillful ways sometimes in unskillful onesEven skillful actions can lead to delusion you knowWhen we experience good sights sounds status or wealth as a result of our skillful actions we can turn unskillful careless and complacent because we get deluded into investing our sense of self in those thingsWhen they start changing against our desires we grow frustrated and start acting in evil waysWhen they leave us we act in unskillful waysThis causes the cycle of action in terms of both our physical and verbal actsWhen we act in ways that are unskillful this causes the cycle of results to be painfulWhen we experience this pain and suffering the mind becomes defiledOur vision gets obscured because the suffering overcomes usThis gives rise to anger as well as to greed for the things we want and this starts the cycle of defilement againFor this reason if we can comprehend suffering as part of this cycle we can block the cycle of defilement that would give rise to new cycles of action and resultsSo lets study the truth of suffering so that we can cut these cycles through discernment in the form of right view which is a factor of the noble pathLets foster and strengthen the path by knowing the suffering in birth aging illness and deathWhen we comprehend suffering for what it actually is we dont have to worry about the cause of suffering for how can it arise when we see the drawbacks of its resultsOnce true knowledge has arisen how can ignorance ariseIts as when were in the darknessIf we try to run around tearing down the darkness it cant be torn downIf we try to run around snatching away the darkness it cant be snatched awayThe darkness cant be dispersed by usIt has to be dispersed by lightWhen we light a fire the darkness disappears on its ownThe same with ignorance it cant be dispersed through our thinkingIt has to be dispersed through clearseeing discernmentOnce we give rise to discernment the cause of suffering disappears on its own without our having to get involved with itSo try to give rise to clearseeing discernment in full measure and youll gain release from suffering without a doubtBe really intentThats enough for nowKeep on meditatingThe following selections are drawn from a collection of sermon fragments appended to the book A Heart Released as part of a commemorative volume distributed at Phra Ajaan Muns cremation inThe collection was drawn from notes of Ajaan Muns sermons taken by two of his students during the last two years of his life covering a wide range of topics including some standard accounts of the Buddhas lifeThe selections included here comprise all of the passages dealing directly with the practice of virtue and meditationSome of Ajaan Muns direct students have commented that the fragments would have been more subtle and insightful if the students who recorded them had been more advanced in their own meditation practiceAs a result we can only guess as to what the original sermons were likeStill what has been recorded is worth reading and putting into practice and so it has been translated and offered here as a gift of Dhamma for all who are interestedHas anyone ever been ordained in the Buddhas religion without having studied meditationWe can say categorically no  there hasntThere isnt a single preceptor who doesnt teach meditation to the ordinand before presenting him with his robesIf a preceptor doesnt teach meditation beforehand he can no longer continue being a preceptorSo every person who has been ordained can be said to have studied meditationThere is no reason to doubt thisThe preceptor teaches the five meditation themes kesa hair of the head loma hair of the body nakha nails danta teeth and taco skinThese five meditation themes end with the skinWhy are we taught only as far as the skinBecause the skin is an especially important part of the bodyEach and every one of us has to have skin as our wrappingIf we didnt have skin our headhairs bodyhairs nails and teeth wouldnt hold togetherTheyd have to scatterOur flesh bones tendons and all the other parts of the body wouldnt be able to stay together at allTheyd have to separate to fall apartWhen we get infatuated with the human body the skin is what we are infatuated withWhen we conceive of the body as being beautiful and attractive and develop love desire and longing for it its because of what we conceive of the skinWhen we see a body we suppose it to have a complexion  fair ruddy dark etc because of what we conceive the color of the skin to beIf the body didnt have skin who would conceive it to be beautiful or attractiveWho would love it like it or desire itWed regard it with nothing but hatred loathing and disgustIf it werent wrapped in skin the flesh tendons and other parts of the body wouldnt hold together and couldnt be used to accomplish anything at all  which is why we say the skin is especially importantThe fact that we can keep on living is because of the skinThe fact that we get deluded into seeing the body as beautiful and attractive is because it has skinThis is why preceptors teach only as far as the skinIf we set our minds on considering the skin until we see it as disgusting and gain a vision of its unloveliness appearing unmistakably to the heart we are bound to see the inherent truths of inconstancy stress and notselfnessThis will cure our delusions of beauty and attractiveness that are fixated on the skinWe will no longer focus any conceivings on it or find it appealing or desirable for we have seen it for what it isOnly when we heed our preceptors instructions and not take them lightly will we see these inherent truthsIf we dont heed our preceptors instructions we wont be able to cure our delusions and instead will fall into the snares of enticing preoccupations  into the wheels of the cycle of rebirthSo weve already been welltaught by our preceptors since the day of our ordinationThere is no reason to look for anything furtherIf were still unsure if were still looking for something more that shows that we are still confused and lostIf we werent confused what would we be looking forAn unconfused person doesnt have to look for anythingOnly a confused person has to go lookingThe more he goes looking the further he gets lostIf a person doesnt go looking but simply considers what is already present he will see clearly the reality that is inherently primal and unmoving free from the yokes and fermentations of defilementThis subject is not something thought up by the preceptors to be taught to the ordinand in line with anyones opinionIt comes from the word of the Lord Buddha who decreed that the preceptor should teach the ordinand these essential meditation themes for his constant considerationOtherwise our ordination wouldnt be in keeping with the fact that we have relinquished the life of home and family and have come out to practice renunciation for the sake of freedomOur ordination would be nothing more than a shamBut since the Buddha has decreed this matter every preceptor has continued this tradition down to the presentWhat our preceptors have taught us isnt wrongIts absolutely trueBut we simply havent taken their teachings to heartWeve stayed complacent and deluded of our own accord  for people of discretion have affirmed that these teachings are the genuine path to purityVirtue  normalcy  is like rock which is solid and forms the basis of the groundNo matter how much the wind may buffet and blow rock doesnt waver or flinchIf we simply hold to the word virtue though we can still go astrayWe need to know where virtue lies what it is and who maintains itIf we know the factor maintaining it we will see how that factor forms the essence of virtueIf we dont understand virtue well end up going astray and holding just to the externals of virtue believing that we have to look for virtue here or ask for the precepts there before we can have virtueIf we have to look for it and ask for it doesnt that show that were confused about itIsnt that a sign of attachment to the externals of precepts and practicesPeople who arent confused about virtue dont have to go looking or asking for it because they know that virtue exists within themselvesThey themselves are the ones who maintain their virtue by avoiding faults of various kindsIntention is what forms the essence of virtueWhat is intentionWe have to play with this word cetana in order to understand itChange the e to an i and add another t That gives us citta the mindA person without a mind cant be called a personIf we had only a body what could we accomplishThe body and mind have to rely on each otherIf the mind isnt virtuous the body will misbehave in all sorts of waysThis is why we say that there is only one virtue that of the mindThe precepts deal simply with the flaws we should avoidWhether you avoid the five flaws the eight the ten or the you succeed in maintaining the one and the same virtueIf you can maintain this one virtue your words and deeds will be flawlessThe mind will be at normalcy  simple solid and unwaveringThis sort of virtue isnt something you go looking or asking forWhen people go looking and asking its a sign theyre poor and destituteThey dont have anything so they have to go beggingThey keep requesting the precepts over and over againThe more they request them the more they lack themThe poorer they becomeWe are already endowed with body and mindOur body we have received from our parents our mind is already with us so we have everything we need in full measureIf we want to make the body and mind virtuous we should go right ahead and do itWe dont have to think that virtue lies here or there at this or that timeVirtue already lies right here with usAkaliko If we maintain it at all times we will reap its rewards at all timesThis point can be confirmed with reference to the time of the BuddhaWhen the five brethren VenYasa his parents and his former wife the Kassapa brothers and their disciples King Bimbisara and his following etc listened to the Buddhas teachings they didnt ask for the precepts beforehandThe Buddha started right in teaching themSo why were they able to attain the noble paths and fruitionsWhere did their virtue concentration and discernment come fromThe Buddha never told them to ask him for virtue concentration and discernmentOnce they had savored the taste of his teachings then virtue concentration and discernment developed within them of their own accord without any asking or giving taking placeNo one had to take the various factors of the path and put them together into a whole for in each case virtue concentration and discernment were qualities of one and the same heartSo only if we arent deluded into searching outside for virtue can we be ranked as truly discerningThe traits that people have carried over from the past differ in being good bad and neutralTheir potential follows along with their traits  ie higher than what they currently are lower or on a parSome people have developed a high potential to be good but if they associate with fools their potential will develop into that of a foolSome people are weak in terms of their potential but if they associate with sages their potential improves and they become sages tooSome people associate with friends who are neither good nor bad who lead them neither up nor down and so their potential stays on a mediocre levelFor this reason we should try to associate with sages and wise people so as to raise the level of our potential progressively higher and higher step by stepWe have all come here to study of our own accordNot one of us was invited to comeSo as we have come to study and practice we should really give ourselves to the practice in line with the example set by the Buddha and his arahant disciplesAt the very beginning you should contemplate all four truths  birth aging illness and death  that all the Noble Ones have contemplated before usBirth We have already been bornWhat is your body if not a heap of birthIllness aging and death are all an affair of this heapWhen we contemplate these things in all four positions  by practicing sitting meditation walking meditation meditation while standing or lying down  the mind will gather into concentrationIf it gathers briefly thats called momentary concentrationIn other words the mind gathers and reverts to its underlying level for a short while and then withdrawsIf you contemplate without retreating until an uggaha nimitta of a part of the body appears within or without contemplate that image until the mind lets go of it and reverts to its underlying level and stays there for a fair while before withdrawing againConcentration on this level is called threshold concentrationKeep on contemplating that image until the mind reverts to a firm stance on its underlying level reaching the singleness of the first level of jhanaWhen the mind withdraws keep contemplating that image over and over again until you can take it apart as a patibhaga nimittaIn other words contemplate what the body will be like after it diesItll have to disintegrate until only the bones are leftFocus on this truth within you  as it applies to your own body  as well as without  as it applies to the bodies of othersSee what the various parts of the body are This is hair These are nails These are teeth This is skin How many tendons are thereHow many bonesGet so that you can see these things clearlyVisualize the body coming together again  sitting standing walking and lying down  and then dying and reverting to its original state its original properties of earth water fire and windWhen you contemplate this way repeatedly both within and without visualizing the body newly dead and long dead with dogs and vultures fighting over it your mind will eventually come to gain intuitive insight in line with your potentialThe Buddha our foremost teacher taught about body speech and mindHe didnt teach anything elseHe taught us to practice to train our minds to use our minds to investigate the body This is called the contemplation of the body as a frame of referenceWe are taught to train our mindfulness thoroughly in the practice of investigating  this is called the analysis of phenomena  until it reaches a point of sufficiencyWhen we have investigated enough to make mindfulness itself a factor of Awakening the mind settles down into concentration of its own accordThere are three levels of concentrationIn momentary concentration the mind gathers and settles down to a firm stance and rests there for a moment before withdrawingIn threshold concentration the mind gathers and settles down to its underlying level and stays there a fair while before withdrawing to be aware of a nimitta of one sort or anotherIn fixed penetration the mind settles down to a firm stance on its underlying level and stops there in singleness perfectly still  aware that it is staying there  endowed with the five factors of jhana which then become gradually more and more refinedWhen we train the mind in this way we are said to be heightening the mind as in the Pali phraseThe contemplation of the body is a practice that sages  including the Lord Buddha  have described in many waysFor example in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta he calls it the contemplation of the body as a frame of referenceIn the root themes of meditation which a preceptor must teach at the beginning of the ordination ceremony he describes the contemplation of hairs of the head hairs of the body nails teeth and skinIn the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta he teaches that birth aging and death are stressfulWe have all taken birth now havent weWhen we practice so as to opanayiko  take these teachings inward and contemplate them by applying them to ourselves  we are not going wrong in the practice because the Dhamma is akaliko everpresent and aloko blatantly clear both by day and by night with nothing to obscure itPeople who have studied a lot of the Dhamma and Vinaya  who have learned a large number of approaches together with their many ramifications  when they then come to train their minds find that their minds dont settle down easily into concentrationThey need to realize that they must first take their learning and put it back on the shelf for the time beingThey need to train what knows  this very mind  developing their mindfulness until it is supermindfulness their discernment until it is superdiscernment so that they can see through the superdeceits of conventional truth and common assumptions that set things up naming them This is this and That is that  days nights months years earth sky sun moon constellations everything  all the things that thoughtformations the conditions or effects of the mind set up as being this or thatOnce the mind can see through these effects of the mind this is called knowing stress and its causeOnce you practice this theme and develop it repeatedly until you are quick at seeing through these things the mind will be able to gather and settle downTo focus in this way is called developing the pathAnd when the path reaches a point of sufficiency there is no need to speak of the cessation of stress It will appear of its own accord to the person who practices  because virtue concentration and discernment all exist in our very own body speech and mindThese things are said to be akaliko everpresentOpanayiko When meditators contemplate what already exists within them then  paccattam  they will know for themselvesIn other words we contemplate the body so as to see it as unattractive and visualize it as disintegrating back into its primary properties in terms of the primal Dhamma that is blatantly clear both by day and by nightWhen contemplating you should keep this analogy in mind When people grow rice they have to grow it in the earthThey have to go wading through the mud exposed to the sun and rain before they can get the rice grains the husked rice the cooked rice and can finally eat their fillWhen they do this they are getting their rice entirely from things that already existIn the same way meditators must develop virtue concentration and discernment which already exist in the body speech and mind of every personConcerning the principles of our practice there is no real problemOpanayiko Bring the mind inward to investigate body speech and mind  things that are akaliko everpresent aloko blatantly clear both by day and by night paccattam veditabbo viññuhi to be known by the wise for themselves  just as the sages of the past such as the Buddha and the Noble Disciples knew clearly for themselves after bringing their minds inward to contemplate what was already thereIts not the case that these things exist at some times and not at othersThey exist at all times in every eraThis is something we as meditators can know for ourselvesIn others words when we make a mistake we know itWhen we do things correctly we know it within ourselvesHow good or bad we are we are bound to know better than anyone else  as long as we are persistent in our contemplation and dont let ourselves grow complacent or heedlessAn example from the past is that of the sixteen young students of the Brahman teacher BavariThey had practiced jhana to the point where they were stuck on rupa jhana and arupa jhanaThe Buddha thus taught them to contemplate what was already inside them so as to see it clearly with discernment  to see the level of sensuality as lying below the level of formlessness as lying above and the level of form as in the middle to see the past as below the future as above and the present as in the middleThen he taught them to look inside themselves  from the feet below to the tips of the hair above and all around in betweenOnce they had contemplated in this way they came to know clearly for themselvesThis ended their doubts about how to practice and they no longer had to go to the trouble of looking anywhere elseAs a meditator you should use the strategy of listening to the Dhamma at all times even when you are living aloneIn other words contemplate the Dhamma both by day and by nightThe eye ear nose tongue and body are physical phenomena that are always presentSights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations are also present for you to see hear smell taste and touchThe mindIt too is presentYour thoughts and feelings about various topics  good and bad  are present as wellDevelopment and decay both within you and without are also presentThese things that occur naturally display the truth  inconstancy stress and notselfness  for you to see at all timesWhen a leaf grows yellow and falls from the tree for instance it is showing you the truth of inconstancySo when you continually use this approach to contemplate things with your mindfulness and discernment you are said to be listening to the Dhamma at all times both by day and by nightMerit is the intention that arises in the heart beginning with your first thought of doing something goodFor example today you decided that you wanted to come to the monasteryThat thought in and of itself was merit arising in the mindThen you came to the monastery received the precepts and listened to a sermon in line with your original intentionIn this way your original intention succeeded in producing more merit in line with its aimsBut if you think that you want to go to the monastery to receive the precepts and listen to the Dhamma but someone else happens to object or criticizes you in a way that spoils your mood the merit in your mind  the original intention  disappearsEven if someone else then invites you to come to the monastery you come here against your will and sit here like a stump with no merit arising in your mindThis is because the essence of merit in your mind has already diedThe meritorious things that you do arent the essence of meritFor example giving donations observing the precepts listening to sermons or sitting in meditation arent the essence of meritStill we have to keep doing these things so that our old merit can grow fat and healthy instead of dying awayFor this reason when you make up your mind to do something good hurry up and do it right awayWhen you want to give a donation go ahead and give a donationWhen you want to observe the precepts observe the preceptsWhen you want to listen to the Dhamma listen to the DhammaWhen you want to meditate meditateIn this way the results of your actions will grow full and complete in all three time periodsIn other words your mind will feel happy joyful and satisfied in your merit when you first think of doing it while youre doing it and when youre doneThe intention to do good  the first stage in your goodness  is the essence of meritIts like planting a treeWhen you give a donation its like putting fertilizer around the treeWhen you observe the precepts its like picking away the worms and caterpillars that will eat the flowers or leavesAs for meditating thats like watering the tree with clean clear cool waterIn this way your tree is sure to keep growing until it produces leaves and fruit that you can eat for your enjoyment in line with your original aimIf its a flowering tree the flowers will be bright and colorful with large petals and a refreshing scentIf its a fruit tree the fruits will be plentiful large and sweetThis is how generosity virtue and meditation are means of developing the merit of your original thoughtBut if your heart is in a sour mood then you wont get much fruit from making merit or giving donationsIts like giving fertilizer to a tree thats already diedEven if all you want is a single custard apple from the tree you wont be able to get what you want because the fertilizer you gave to the tree has all gone to nourish the grasses and herbs growing at the foot of the tree and hasnt done a thing for the custard apple you wantedIn the same way if you just go through the motions of making merit your original aim  to abandon greed aversion and delusion  wont bear fruitThe act of generosity is simply the fertilizer of meritWhen the essence of merit has died theres no way that you can eat the fertilizer for its nothing but filth  cow dung and chicken droppingsHow can you ask for filthy stuff like that to come and help you in any wayBut still youre better off than people who havent fertilized anything at all  ie who havent developed virtue concentration or discernment  for at the very least you can gather the grasses and herbs that have fed on your fertilizer to boil in a soup or fix as a saladSo whenever you do anything you have to check to see whether the essence of merit is in your heartSome people make merit when their hearts are evilTheyre like a stickyrice sweet roasted in bamboo where the rice on the top is soft and wellcooked but the rice at the bottom is raw or burnt to a crispWhen this is the case theres no way you can eat it for its not good all the way throughPeople by and large act in ways that arent in line with their mindsSome people make donations but their hearts are still greedy as when they give a gift because they want to become millionairesSome people give one dollar expecting to get ten thousand or a hundred thousand in returnSome people observe the precepts but their hearts are still angry jealous or hateful toward this person or thatSome people meditate so that they can be beautiful and shapely in their next birth or because they want to become devas up in heavenOther people want to be this or that  always looking for something in exchangeThis kind of merit is still wide of the markThe Buddha taught us to be generous for the sake of doing away with greed to observe the precepts to do away with anger and to meditate to do away with delusion not for the sake of feeding these defilementsSome people come here to meditate and sit here absolutely still  their eyes are closed their posture straight and unmoving everything on the outside just the way it should be  but their minds are running around all over the place to their orchards their fields some peoples minds go zooming abroad in search of their children or friends thinking about all kinds of thingsTheir minds arent sitting together with their bodiesThis is called a mind and a body not in line with each other  like a stickyrice sweet where the top is cooked but the bottom is still rawIf youre careful to keep the essence of merit with your heart then go ahead and do whatever goodness you wantDont come to the monastery behind the corpse of your meritIn other words if you originally want to come to the monastery but someone else yells at you so that you come here in a foul mood against your will this kind of meritmaking doesnt help you much at allThe reason we need to train our minds to be solid and strong in the Dhamma is because were sure to face the three dangers of the world suffering illness and poverty death and enemies and foolish friendsWe have to prepare ourselves so that when any of these things come our way our hearts will be strong enough to contend with them bravely and without fearNo matter what side they may attack from we have a strategy to fight them off in every wayThis is why the daily blessing says Icchitam patthitam tumham khippameva samijjhatu which means Whatever you want and desire may it succeed quickly In other words when the mind is strong and powerful whatever you think of doing is bound to succeedIf you let your original thoughts of merit die or disappear from the mind before you come to give a donation observe the precepts or meditate the results of the original intention wont develop but at least youre better off than people who dont come at allThe original thought of merit is like a treeIf your tree doesnt die then the more you fertilize it the bigger itll grow and the more itll branch outIn other words your actions will be lovely and quietWhatever your hands do will be meritWherever your feet step will be meritWhatever your mouth says will be meritWhatever your mind thinks will be meritYour whole body will be meritWhen this is the case youll meet with nothing but happinessVirtue in terms its wording consists of undertaking the five eight ten or preceptsIn terms of its meaning it consists of thinking speaking and acting in ways that harm no oneWhen you think you do it with a mind of good willWhen you speak you do it with a mind of good willWhen you act you do it with a mind of good willIn terms of its flavor virtue is coolnessFor this reason the act of undertaking the precepts isnt the essence of virtue its simply a way of fertilizing virtue  our original intention  so that itll grow fat and strongThe Pali word for virtue  sila  comes from sela or rock so when you develop virtue you have to make your heart large like an enormous rockWhats a rock likeIts solid stable and coolEven though the sun may burn it all day or rain may lash at it all night it doesnt tremble or shakeIn addition it keeps its coolness insideWhat kind of coolness is thatThe coolness of bravery quick reflexes and circumspectionThis kind of coolness is virtue  not the kind of coolness of a person whos slow and lackadaisicalIf youre cool you have to be cool from the virtue within youHaving virtue within you is like having a pool of water in your houseWhen your house has a pool of water how can fire burn it downWhen you have this kind of coolness looking after your heart how can anger hatred or ill will overcome itIn addition this cool rock of virtue holds fire within it  but not the fire of defilementIts a cool fire that you can put to all kinds of good usesWhen you strike one rock against another the spark can light a fire that you can use to cook your food or light your houseThese are some of the benefits of virtueWhen you practice concentration but your mind isnt firmly established in genuine merit Mara will come after you with a big grin on his faceWhat this means is the Maras of the aggregates there will be feelings of pain throughout your body your perceptions will be a turmoil your thoughtconstructs will think of different things your consciousness will be aware all over the placeWhen this happens your heart will be crushed and your merit snuffed outLike a stickyrice sweet thats not cooked all the way through if you eat it youll get indigestionWhen practicing concentration you have to be careful not to force or squeeze the mind too much but at the same time you cant let it run too looseForce it when you have to let it go when you have toThe important point is to keep directed thought and evaluation in charge at all timesIn this way the mind gains quality it wont play truant or go straying off the path of goodnessThe nature of goodness is that there are bound to be bad things sneaking in in the same way that when there are rich people there are bound to be thieves lying in wait to rob themWhen you make merit Mara in his different forms is sure to get in the waySo when you meditate be careful not to fall into wrong mindfulness or wrong concentrationWrong mindfulness is when your awareness leaves the four frames of reference  body feelings mind and mental qualitiesHere the body means the breath feelings are sensations of comfort or discomfort the mind is the awareness of the body and the mental quality we want is the quality of the presentWrong concentration is when youre forgetful or unaware as when youre unaware of how the body is sitting where the mind is wandering off to how it comes backThe mind lacks both mindfulness and alertnessBut when your concentration gets established the mind will grow higherAnd when the mind is up high nothing can reach up to destroy its goodnessLike the stars the moon or the sun that shine in the sky even though clouds may pass in front of them from time to time the clouds cant sneak up or seep up to make the brightness of the stars moon or sun grow murky or darkMerit is a noble treasureIts the source of all our inner wealthWhen it arises in the mind dont let anyone else touch itWhen you have a source of wealth like this its like having a raw diamond which is a hundred times better than having your wealth in property cattle or workers for those things lie far away and are hard to look afterIf you have a raw diamond all you have to do is wrap it in cotton and itll keep on growingJust make sure that you dont cut or polish itIf you turn it into a cut diamond then even if you keep it for years it wont grow any furtherIn the same way when concentration arises in the mind you have to look after itDont let any labels or concepts touch it at allThat way your concentration will develop step by stepYour mind will grow higher and higherHappiness and coolness will come flowing your wayEverything you aspire to will succeed and eventually youll attain the paths and fruitions leading to nibbanaWhen a person makes up his mind to do one thing but then turns around to do something else entirely the results of his first intention simply wont come aboutA person like this has to be classed as really stupid  an ingrate to himself a traitor to himselfLike a child who says goodbye to its parents telling them that its going to school but then goes wandering off to see a movie or a traveling showThe parents dont know whats going onThey think the child is at schoolBy the time theyve tracked down the truth they will have wasted a lot of timeIn this way the child harms itself in four ways theres the bad karma of having deceived its parents it throws away the money the parents paid for its tuition it stays ignorant and doesnt pick up any of the knowledge it would have gained at school and death keeps creeping closer day by day the child itself eventually becomes a parent and yet it cant even read or write three letters of the alphabetIn the same way when you arent really intent on the practice  you come and sit here meditating but your mind isnt with the body it goes wandering off to think about things unrelated to the Dhamma thinking about things at home thinking about your children or grandchildren thinking about this person or that thinking about things ahead or behind your mind isnt established in stillness your eyes are closed but your mind slips off to look for fun with different kinds of preoccupations sometimes you meet up with dogs and cats so you play with the dog and cats  when this happens you harm yourself in the same waysFirst theres the bad karma of deceiving your teacher telling him youre going to practice concentration but then not doing itThe teacher doesnt know whats going on and so teaches the Dhamma until his mouth runs out of saliva but with no results to show for itYou yourself stay ignorantYou sit and meditate for three years but dont get anything out of itIf people ask you about the practice they cant get any sense out of you which reflects badly on the teacherWhen death comes youll die with pain and hardship with no inner wealth to take along to the next lifeSo youll keep on spinning around in death and rebirth for who knows how many lives without ever getting to nibbanaAll of this comes from not really being intentIf youre really intent on practicing the Dhamma then no matter what youll have to get results  large or small  depending on the strength of what you can doIf youre going to meditate be intent on meditatingIf youre going to listen to the Dhamma be intent on listeningIf youre going to speak be intent on speakingWhatever you do be intent on what youre doingThat way youll get the results you want from your actionsTo get results your intent has to be composed of the four bases for successIn other words chanda Like what youre doingIf youre going to meditate be content to stay mindful of the breathViriya Be persistent and dont get discouragedEven though there may be pains in the body you endure themCitta Give your full mind to what youre doingDont just play aroundDont let your mind wander off to think of other thingsVimansa When you really do the meditation you contemplate to see what gives rise to a sense of peace and ease in the body and mindWhen your meditation is composed of these four factors in full its as if youre sitting on a chair with four good legsYou wont have to fear that the chair will start tilting or fall overThis is different from a person whos sitting on a chair with only two legs or oneIf anyone happens to brush past he may tip over or fall flat on his backBut if youre sitting on a chair with four good legs then even if someone runs into you or grabs hold of the chair to give it a shake you neednt be afraid of falling offEven if they pick up the chair and move it somewhere else youll still be able to sit on it in comfortYou dont have fear any danger at allThis is what its like when you make your mind fully solid and strong in the goodness of what youre doingYou can sit and lie down in easeWhether youre in the monastery or at home you can live at your easeYou can eat or go without food and still be at easeYou can handle a lot of work or only a little and still be at easeYou can have ten million billions in money or not even a single red cent and still be at easeWhen death comes you can die with ease free from suffering or hardshipWhen anyone can do this the devas clap their hands in joyWhen anyone cant the devas screw up their faces while Mara and his gang laugh and clap their hands because theyve beat another of the Buddhas disciplesThink about it do you really want to be one of Maras disciplesWe have to use skillfulness and merit to polish ourselves until were shining and brightIn other words we polish our actions with virtue concentration and discernmentWhen you train your mind with concentration until its fully tempered and strong itll be calm and cool bright and gleaming like still water in a deep well or like the stars in the skyThe hindrances wont be able to walk all over you for the level of the mind will keep growing higher and higher at all timesWhen its really up high it grows coolJust as when were sitting here we dont feel especially cool where were sitting but if we go up two or three kilometers off the surface of the earth well feel cold right awayIn addition to cooling off our eyes will be able to see things far far awayWell be able to see the condition of human beings and animals all the dangers and difficulties of life on the world beneath usWell start taking these dangers to heart so that we wont want to come back down againWhen we talk about the minds being on a high level we dont mean that its high up like an airplane simply that the quality of its awareness is heightened through training its concentration and discernmentWhen this happens youll be able to see the causes and effects of everything true and falseYoull see the dangers of wandering on through death and rebirth and gain a sense of disenchantment with birth aging illness and death seeing them as nothing but pain and troubleWhen you see things in this way youll lose all hankering for sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideasYoull be intent solely on developing the heart to gain release from all defilements and mental fermentations so that you wont have to come swimming around through death and rebirth in the world ever againWhen you sit in meditation focus your attention solely on a single preoccupationIf you slip off that preoccupation you fall into hellWhat does hell mean hereCakkhum adittam Any preoccupations that come in by way of the eye are said to be a ball of hellfireSotam adittam Any preoccupations that come in by way of the ear are a ball of fireAny preoccupations that come in by way of the nose tongue body and mind are all balls of fireIf you focus your attention on any of these preoccupations theyll make you as hot as if you had fallen into hell in this very lifetime Thats why you should cut away all perceptions of that sortDont let them get involved with your mind at allThe defilements are like salt water the Dhamma is like fresh water which benefits the world in three ways people can drink it it washes things clean and it helps plants to growAs for salt water you cant drink it you cant use it to wash things clean and if you use it to water plants theyll dieA person who sits fermenting in his defilements is like a salt water fishSalt water fish have a strong nasty smellOnce when I was in Chantaburi staying at the LotusPond Monastery a group of fishwives carried a batch of ocean fish past the monastery at a distance of about metersEven then the smell of the fish hit my nose and seemed really foulAs for freshwater fish even though they have some smell its not as foul as saltwater fishIn the same way people with a lot of defilements really smell no one wants them to come near and wherever they go theyre despisedOrdinarily saltwater fish like to stay only in salt waterIf you catch them and put them in fresh water theyll die in an instantThe same with freshwater fish if you catch them and put them in salt water theyll immediately dieBut modern scientists have found a way to turn saltwater fish into freshwater fishThey put saltwater fish in salt water and then gradually mix in fresh water little by littleThe fish gradually get more and more accustomed to fresh water until ultimately they can be released into a freshwater pond and they wont dieThe same with freshwater fish the scientists gradually mix salt water into the tanks where theyre keeping freshwater fish and the fish gradually get used to being in salty water until the scientists can throw them into the sea and they wont dieIn the same way people who are full of defilements are like saltwater fishWhen they first start coming to the monastery they bring all their defilements along with themThen  as they start tasting the flavor of the Dhamma as they chant and meditate  their hearts gradually get further and further away from their concentrated saltiness their greed anger and delusionGoodness seeps into their hearts little by little gradually diluting the evil of their defilements until their hearts are entirely fresh with the taste of the DhammaThe restlessness and turmoil in their hearts will vanish and theyll be content to stay with the Dhamma happily and at peace like a saltwater fish thats grown accustomed to fresh waterThere are four kinds of fresh water still flowing falling and shooting upStill water is the water in lakes and wellsFlowing water is the water in rivers canals and streamsFalling water is the water of waterfalls and rainSometimes this type of water is so heavy and cold that it turns into hailstones which can hurt as they hit you on the headShootingup water is the water of fountains and geysersIn the same way there are different kinds of Dhamma  so you can choose to stay with whichever of the types of meditation themes you likeWhen you stay mixed up with your defilements or like to run back and forth with your external concepts and perceptions youre no different from a person floating in a boat in the middle of a stormy seaYou cant sit or lie down to get any rest because the waves are constantly striking making you dizzy and nauseous all the timeYour heart is all stirred up and cant find any peaceAll you can do is cry out Im dyingIm dyingBut when you try to pull yourself out from the mass of defilement or the balls of hellfire  bringing your mind into the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and establishing it in concentration  you free yourself from the wind and wavesYoure like a person who has reached shore and is standing on firm groundA person on firm ground can sit lie down stand walk or jump around as he likesHes much more comfortable than a person out on the oceanFor this reason we should train our hearts to reach right concentration absolutely cutting off all our external concepts and perceptionsIn this way well all gain shelter and restThe flavor of the Dhamma is like ambrosia the nectar that  when you drink it  makes you immortalIf you live with the Dhamma then when you die youll go to a good destination as a visuddhideva a deva pure in body and mindThis sort of person doesnt die easily  and doesnt die at all in the same way as people in generalIf you aspire to the Deathless you should wash your thoughts and deeds with cool clean clear pure Dhamma so that theyre sparkling cleanThat way youll meet with the flavor of the Deathless and go beyond death reaching the transcendent and nibbana at lastPhra Ajaan Mun Bhuridatta Mahathera was by all accounts the most highly respected Buddhist monk in recent Thai historyOrdained in he spent the major part of his life wandering through Thailand Burma and Laos dwelling for the most part in the forest engaged in the practice of meditationHe attracted a large following of students and  together with his teacher Phra Ajaan Sao Kantasila Mahathera  was responsible for the establishment of the forest ascetic tradition that has now spread throughout Thailand and to several countries abroadDespite his fame as a teacher very few of his teachings were recorded for posterityOnly one slim book of passages drawn from his sermons Muttodaya was published during his lifetimeHis students generally believed that he himself never wrote down any of his teachings but at his death the following poem was found among the few papers he left behindAs he noted on the final page he composed it during one of his brief stays in Bangkok at Wat Srapatum probably in the early sHe was apparently inspired by an anonymous poem on the theme of meditation composed and printed in Bangkok during that period for both poems share virtually the same beginning  the lines in the following translation beginning with Once there was a man who loved himself Ajaan Muns poem however then develops in an entirely original direction and shows by far a deeper understanding of the training of the mindTranslating the poem has presented a number of difficulties not the least of which has been getting a definitive reading of the original manuscriptAjaan Mun wrote during the days before Thai spelling became standardized some of the passages were smudged with age and a few seem to have been corrected by a later handAnother difficulty has been the more general problem of finding the proper English style for translating Thai poetry which depends heavily on rhyme rhythm and a strippeddown syntax somewhat like that of telegrams and newspaper headlinesThis style gives Thai poetry a lightness of style combined with a richness of meaning but frustrates any attempt to pin down any one precise message for the sake of translation  an excellent lesson for anyone who feels that the truth is what is conveyed in wordsThe following translation is meant to be as literal as possible although I have fleshed the text out when it seemed necessary to make the English intelligibleBecause the original alternates between two poetic forms  klon and rai  I tried to create a similar effect in English by alternating blank verse and free verseThe result is probably too literal to be poetry but I felt that anyone reading it would be more interested in the meaning than in verbal effectsThe instances where I have taken the most liberty with the text have been included in square brackets as has one passage  ironically dealing with the error of being addicted to correcting things  where the reading of the original seems to have been doctoredThe reader will notice that in a few places the poem seems to jump abruptly from one topic to anotherIn some cases these shifts were dictated by the rhyme scheme but in others they are not really shifts at allKeep in mind that the poem operates on several levelsIn particular two parallel themes run throughout an analysis of the external error of focusing on the faults of other people instead of ones own and a discussion of the minds internal error of viewing the khandhas as somehow separate from its own efforts to know themStatements made directly about one level apply indirectly to the other as wellThus the poem covers a wider range of the practice than might appear at first glanceIts a work that rewards repeated readingsI would like to express my gratitude to Phra Ajaan Suwat Suvaco for the invaluable help he gave me in untangling some of the knottier passages in the poemAny mistakes that may remain of course are mineIn the summer of Larry Rosenberg  one of the guiding teachers at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre Massachusetts  invited Phra Ajaan Suwat Suvaco to lead a twoweek retreat at IMS the following springAjaan Suwat had been living in the United States for several years at that point founding monasteries for the Thai communities in the Seattle and Los Angeles areas but this was his first opportunity to teach large numbers of nonAsian AmericansThe retreat was held in the first two weeks of May with approximately people attendingI was brought from Thailand to serve as interpreterThe format of the retreat was simpleThe retreatants did sitting and walking meditation from early morning to late at nightThere had been a plan to encourage them to do walking meditation in the stately forest behind the center but the weather was so chilly and rainy throughout the retreat that everyone was confined to the buildingOne pleasant exception was the evening of Visakha Puja  the holiday celebrating the Buddhas birth Awakening and final passing awayThis occurred toward the beginning of the retreat and provided an opportunity for the retreatants to perform a candlelit circumambulation of the IMS complex as a full moon rose in the clear cold twilit sky over the pinesThroughout the retreat Ajaan Suwat led small group interviews in the afternoon and then met with all the gathered retreatants in the evening either to give a Dhamma talk or to answer questionsLarry meanwhile led individual interviews in the mornings and afternoonsSadly the taping of Ajaan Suwats teachings was rather haphazardNone of the afternoon sessions were taped and as for the evening sessions there were days when both the Thai and the English were recorded other days when only the English was and other days nothingThus our record of the retreat is fairly incompleteStill what was recorded is extremely valuable as this sort of opportunity  for a Thai ajaan to speak directly to Westerners in their own environment and for them to ask him questions  is rareA number of Ajaan Suwats students have transcribed the Thai portion of the tapes and this translation is taken from that transcriptionI havent gone back to listen to the English passages on the tapes  which are available for anyone who is interested  partly out of embarrassment at my own shortcomings as an interpreter but also because I wanted to present the retreat as it sounded to Ajaan Suwat himself what he heard in the questions as they were translated to him and what points he was trying to get acrossA few of the teachings he gave during the retreat are etched indelibly in my memory and yet didnt make it onto the tapes so Id like to record them hereOne was the comment he made to me after the second day of the retreat on how grim the retreatants were in their approach to the meditationHe admired their dedication but was worried that they werent finding any joy in the practiceHe attributed this to their coming directly to meditation without having first gained the sense of joyful confidence in the Buddhas teachings and in themselves that can come with a good foundation in generosity and moralityHis attempts to lighten the mood of the retreat are obvious in his talksTwo exchanges in the question and answer sessions also have remained vividly in my mindOne was from an afternoon sessionA man new to the practice commented You guys would have a good religion here with this Buddhism if only you had a GodThat way people would have some sense of support in their practice when things arent going well Ajaan Suwat responded If there were a God who could arrange that by my taking a mouthful of food all the beings in the world would become full Id bow down to that GodBut I havent yet found anyone like thatThe second exchange was during an evening sessionA woman who had sat several retreats complained to the effect Im finding myself frustrated in my practice of meditationNow that Ive gotten started I cant turn back and yet I dont seem to be getting anywhere Ajaan Suwats simple response Where are you trying to goAfter a brief moment of silence the woman laughed and said she was satisfied with the answerI hope that the talks and discussions translated here will provide satisfaction for you the reader as well Thanissaro BhikkhuWeve all come here through a sense of conviction intent on studying and practicing the Dhamma that will bring happiness and fulfillment to our heartsWe should understand that the Dhamma taught by the Lord Buddha doesnt lie anywhere far awayAs the Canon says skillful and unskillful dhammas arise right here in the heartIf we want to study the Dhamma we have to study our own heartWhen were well acquainted with the heart well be well acquainted with the DhammaWhen were well acquainted with the Dhamma well be well acquainted with the heartThere are times when the heart is in bad shapeBad mental qualities get mixed up with it making it even worse making us suffer both in body and mindThese bad mental qualities are said to be unskillfulThe Buddha teaches us to study these qualities so that we can abandon themThere are other times when the heart is in good shape at ease with a sense of well beingWe feel at ease whether were sitting or lying down whether were alone or associating with our friends and relativesWhen the heart gains a sense of ease in this way its said to be staying with the DhammaIn other words skillful mental qualities have appeared in the heartThe skillful heart is what gives us happinessThis is why the Buddha taught us to develop these skillful qualities to give rise to them within ourselvesIf you were to list these skillful qualities there would be lots of themBut even though there are lots of them they all arise in our one heartSo if we want to know and see the Dhamma we have to develop mindfulness and alertness keeping watch over our heartIf the heart isnt at peace if its distracted and turbulent we should realize that at that moment the heart is out of shapeUnskillful qualities have arisen within itSo we should try to be mindful and alert to put it back into good shapeWe have to keep watch over the heart to see whether at this moment in time its in good or bad shapeIf we see that the heart isnt yet in satisfactory shape we should let go of our unskillful preoccupations and make ourselves mindful of whats goodWe want to be happy so we dont want the things that will make us sufferWe should try to put the mind into good shape convinced in the practice of the Dhamma that will develop our mindfulnessWe have to look after the heart so that its confident and content in our practiceWe should remind ourselves that in following this practice were following in line with the Buddha one who knows who sees an arahant free from defilement released from suffering in the cycle of death and rebirthThe fact that were practicing in line with the Dhamma taught by the Buddha means that were studying in an institution of highest learning with the Buddha as our foremost teacherSo be mindful to keep your heart in good shapeBe mindful of your meditation word buddhoOr if you want you can focus on the inandout breathWhen the breath comes in keep your mind at easeWhen it goes out keep your mind at easeDont be tense dont force things dont get caught up in any desire to know or see beyond reasonable boundsIf we give rise to this kind of desire this kind of defilement itll distract the heartSo we should be careful to be mindful to look after the mind to meditate wellSimply be mindful of the breathWhen the breath comes in let it come in with easeWhen it goes out let it go out with easeLet the mind be at ease tooIf anything comes along to disturb you dont get involved with itJust keep that sense of ease goingIf your mindfulness can keep maintaining your sense of contentment your sense of confidence in the practice the mind will separate from its outside preoccupations and gather into a sense of stillnessThere will be a sense of lightnessComfortA feeling of contentment with that comfortIf it so happens that while were trying to maintain that sense of ease in the heart disturbances come in to interfere making the mind distracted and restless we should remember that we dont have to look for that lost sense of ease anywhere elseRemember wherever theres restlessness is where there is stillnessWe have to be alert to the preoccupations that have put the mind out of shape we dont want them so we shouldnt pay them any attentionWe should try to remember the good preoccupations that have given us a sense of peace and calm in the pastWhen we can put the mind at ease in this way the things disturbing that ease will disappear right there right where the bad preoccupation wasThis is like darkness no matter how long the darkness has reigned when we realize that its darkness and that we want light we dont have to look anywhere elseIf we have a lantern then as soon as weve lit it light will appear right where there was darkness beforeWe dont have to look anywhere elseThe darkness will disappear right there where theres lightIn the same way when the mind isnt at peace we dont have to look for peace anywhere elseRestlessness comes from an unskillful preoccupation peace comes from a skillful preoccupation right in the same placeWhen weve developed a good preoccupation that puts the mind at peace we should look after it and maintain it wellAs long as this sort of preoccupation is in charge of the heart the heart will maintain its sense of easeSo we dont have to look for goodness anywhere else for that would simply distract and deceive the heartWe have to keep looking at our own heart to see if its in good shape yet or notEveryone has a heart and every heart has skillful and unskillful qualitiesSo use the quality of dhammavicaya your powers of discriminating analysis to observe the heart this sense of awareness right here within yourselfWhile youre sitting here listening focus your attention exclusively on your own heartThe sound of the talk will come into the heart of its own accordYou dont have to focus your attention outside on the sound or to analyze whats being saidEstablish your mindfulness right at the heartWhen the person speaking mentions this or that quality the awareness of that quality will arise right in your own heartIf it doesnt arise immediately then give rise to itSay for example that the mind is in bad shapeWhen the person speaking mentions goodness try to give rise to a good mood within the heartMake yourself confident content in the practiceArouse your efforts to give rise to knowledge of things youve never before known to attain things youve never before attained to see the subtle things youve never before seen step by step within your own mindDuring his lifetime the Buddha taught the Dhamma fully knowing the capabilities of his listeners aware of the level of their intelligence and potential and of which aspect of the Dhamma theyd understand most easilyHe then would teach them that DhammaAs for his listeners they would focus their attention on their own hearts and minds and would understand in line with the practices they had done in the pastWhen the corresponding qualities appeared in their own hearts they were able to know in line with the truth appearing within themWhen the Dhamma appeared in their hearts they experienced peace and calm or gained an understanding into the truths that the Buddha taughtFor example when he taught about stress and suffering his listeners focused on the stress and suffering in their own heartsThey tried to understand to the point where they saw that things couldnt be otherwise than what the Buddha taughtThey really saw suffering and stressWhen the Buddha taught that the flaw called the origination of stress should be abandoned they saw the suffering that comes from cravingThey saw how these things are always relatedWhenever craving arises suffering always follows in its wakeAs a result they made an effort totally to abandon the origination of stressThe more they were able to abandon craving the weaker their suffering grewWhen they were able to cut craving totally away suffering and stress totally disappearedThey then knew clearly in line with the truthThe state of their minds didnt deteriorate or fall away because they had entered into the truthThey had listened to the Dhamma and focused on their own minds in the proper way so that they could see the basic principles of the truth with their own mindfulness and discernmentAs for those whose mental faculties werent yet fully strong who had developed their faculties only to a moderate level even though they didnt reach the Dhamma while they were sitting there listening to it the Buddha taught the noble eightfold path for them to put into practiceThis enabled them to gain knowledge and understanding step by step to the point where their mindfulness and discernment were strong enough to bring them to the Dhamma at a later point in line with the merit and potential they had developed on their ownAs for us even though we may not reach the Dhamma while listening to it the Buddha laid down the path to the cessation of stress for us to develop by putting it into practiceThis path is nothing other than the noble path right view right resolve right speech right activity right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationHaving taught about the right path that we should develop he also taught about the wrong path that should be avoidedIn other words he taught usFor this reason we should acquaint ourselves with both the right path and the wrong pathWhat sort of view ranks as the wrong view we should abandonWrong view starts with views about the body or physical form in generalIf we view physical form in line with what the Buddha taught  that rupam aniccam physical form is inconstant rupam dukkham physical form is stressful rupam anatta physical form is notself  thats called right viewBut if we see physical form as constant  or try to make it constant  thats wrong view and runs counter to the Buddhas teachingsIn other words if we see that rupam niccam physical form is constant rupam sukham physical form  the body  is easeful rupam atta physical form is our self or really our own thats wrong viewIf we really look at the body in line with its truth well see that it really is inconstantFrom the moment its born we can easily see the changes it undergoesIt ages and wears down every dayThis inconstancy is why we have to keep struggling under the desire to make it constant and lastingThe nature of the body is that its always lacking one thing or another  like a water tank thats continually leaking we have to keep adding water to it to keep it from running dry if we forget to add water itll dry out for sureIn the same way the body is genuinely inconstant genuinely stressfulIf it were constant we wouldnt have to struggle we wouldnt have to keep looking for things to keep it going we wouldnt have to workThe reason we work for money is so that we can nourish this body which is continually wasting awayThe Buddha saw clearly that this work and struggle is stressful that its intimately tied up with the inconstancy of the bodyWherever theres inconstancy theres stressAnd because of that stressfulness its inconstantThese qualities are dependent on each otherWhen weve contemplated so that we see this truth then we see the DhammaWe have right viewThe more the mind understands stress and suffering the more it can grow still and let down its burdensIts greed will decreaseIts anger will decreaseIts delusion about physical form will decreaseIts burdens will decreaseThis will make it brighter and more peaceful a skillful mental state arising in such a way that we can see it clearly when we contemplate the events appearing in the mind in line with their truthWhen the Buddha explained right view he started with stress and suffering jatipi dukkha  birth is stressful jarapi dukkha  aging is stressful maranampi dukkham  death is stressfulThese are truths found within each and every one of us  every person every living beingWhether or not we study the matter this is the way things are in actuality ever since who knows whenFor hundreds and thousands of years in the past wherever there has been birth there has had to be aging illness and death in its wakeThe same thing is true in the present and even on into the future every person who takes birth will have to meet with these thingsThis teaching is the genuine truthIt will never change into anything elseNo matter how many hundreds or thousands of people will be born they will all have to meet with illness will all have to age will all have to die each and every one of themNot one of them will remainNo matter what knowledge they attain what weapons they invent they wont be able to win out over this genuine truthSo once weve developed right view in this way we have to eliminate our defilements  in other words our intoxication with our youth our intoxication with being free from disease our intoxication with being aliveWell then be able to behave in a way that will be to our own true benefit as long as we are still aliveAs we develop mindfulness in contemplating the body in and of itself seeing its true nature and developing right view our heart will get more and more convinced of this reality and will grow farther and farther away from wrong viewWell be able to develop right view more continuallyThis is the path that will lead us to attain the Dhamma the ultimate peaceAs we develop right view then right resolve will be no problem because our resolve to meditate so as to develop right view is in and of itself right resolve the resolve to see the Dhamma to know the Dhamma in line with the truth that appears in our own body beginning with the truth of stress and sufferingOur body is composed of birth As soon as theres birth there has to be sufferingWe suffer because of birthHunger desire intense heat and cold all of these things come from birthAnd no matter how carefully and adequately we look after the body it has to keep on aging and wasting awayNo matter how much we plead with it it wont listen to usIt just keeps on agingAnd on top of that it has all kinds of diseasesIf you really look at the body youll see that diseases can arise at any time at allIts a home for diseasesIt has eyes and so there are eye diseasesIt has ears and so there are ear diseasesIt has a nose and so there are nose diseasesIt has a tongue and so there are tongue diseasesDiseases can arise in each and every one of its partsThis is a genuine truth  which is why there are doctors and hospitals in every countryAll people of all races have to depend on medicineEven the person telling you this has diseases just like everyone elseWhen we look to really see the truth well see that the Buddhas teachings arent in the least bit mistaken theyre right here in each and every one of usIf we develop our minds properly in line with the truth so that its views are right our restlessness and distraction will grow calmWell see that the greed weve felt in the past has served no real purposeWhen anger arises toward other people well see that it serves no real purpose that its nothing but stress and sufferingWell see that our only way out is to make the mind still this is the way to true happinessWell gain disenchantment seeing  given the true nature of things  that what weve busied ourselves with has served us no real purposeIts tired us out to no real purpose created difficulties to no real purpose and has left us with nothing at all that we can truly call our ownThink about all the things youve sought and amassed from your birth up to the present moment is there anything there that you can really depend onAnything you can really call your ownNothing at allNone of those things can really help youThey may help you a bit but not enough to give you any real happinessSo I ask that you all work at developing right viewMeditate on the four frames of reference so as to develop discernmentAs you meditate  sitting standing walking and lying down  stay mindful of the body which is filled with inconstancyNo matter where you look its inconstantIts also full of stressWherever you look you see that diseases and pains can arise at any timeIt can age at any timeTheres no part of it thats totally free of aches and painsIf you dont believe me take a sharp spike and stab any part of the body and youll see that it hurts wherever you stabYou can see clearly in line with the truth that the whole body is stressfulAs for buddho the awareness in the mind itll be aware that whats really important is not the body its the mindWhen you see the drawbacks and stresses of the body then discernment clarity and calm will arise in the heart freeing it from its burdens and karma debts related to the bodyIn this way we let go of our heavy burden nicchato parinibbuto free from hunger unbound reaching a bliss and peace that is lastingSo I ask all of you  who have conviction who want peace who want happiness in your daytoday life  to develop mindfulness to develop right viewLook at the body in and of itselfThe body in and of itself is mentioned in the Great Frames of Reference Discourse but its not in the wordsIts not there in the bookIts right hereWhen we practice we dont have to recite the wordsWe look right at our own body at whats already hereMindfulness is something we already have all we need to do is apply it to the bodyIf were not mindful of the body then its not right mindfulnessWhen were mindful of the body theres our mindfulness the mindfulness that will enable us to practice that will enable us to knowIf we keep observing the body were sure to see whats hereThe more we observe the more proficient well becomeWell understand clearly and correctlyThe more clearly we see the more effort  right effort  well put into knowing and seeing even more fullyRight mindfulness will be more continually mindful and right concentration more firmly establishedRight speech and right activity will follow in their wakeSo develop right view in your hearts by developing the frames of referenceKeep track of the body in and of itself train in line with the truth by day and by night whether youre sitting standing walking or lying downWhen you practice correctly no one with any true wisdom will be able to take issue with you for youre focused on the genuine truth the inconstancy the stress and suffering all four of the four noble truths that can be seen right here in this bodyThese things cant be seen anywhere elseIf we really develop right view with regard to these things results will arise within usWhen results arise the nature of the mind is that it will know on its ownIt wont have to be toldAll thats necessary is that you practice rightlyBegin trying from this moment onDont get distracted by this person saying that or that person saying thisTheres nowhere else you have to lookThe evidence is your own bodyHow inconstant it is youll know for yourselfIt wont lie to youHow stressful it is  how many diseases aches and pains  youll know for yourselfIt wont lie to youThe truth is always there for you to seePracticing to see in line with the truth in this way is called seeing the Dhamma the nature of reality in and of itselfWell come to see the truth all the way through and gain release from suffering and stressSo keep at itWhen you gain any understandings of any sort we can discuss them as they arise step by step until you gain genuine release from suffering and stressBut this will be enough for nowOne of the principles of the Dhamma is that if you visualize anything in your meditation you should visualize only things lying within you so that you see physical fabrication in the body and mental fabrication in the mind in line with their true natureFor example at present youre not yet old but youre taught to visualize yourself as growing old in the same way youve seen other people grow oldRemind yourself that as the years pass youll have to age in just the same wayAging is stressfulYour eyes wont be able to see as clearly as when you were youngYour ears wont be able to hear in the same way as when you were youngItll be painful to sit down to stand to walkThere will be all kinds of obstaclesSo now before you grow old you should accelerate your efforts at developing goodness so that it will be a refuge for the heart when old age comesIn other words accelerate your efforts at practicing the Dhamma and training the mind to find peaceOne of the Ten Recollections taught by the Buddha is recollection of death When you see other people dying other animals dying you should reflect on the fact that you will have to die just like everyone elseRepeat the word maranam maranam in the mind and look at yourself youre going to have to die for sureAs you reflect maranam maranam it may happen that as your mind grows still a vision of your own death will appear within youIf your mindfulness is good and you have your wits about you then the more clearly you see death in this way the more the mind will grow still with an even greater sense of well beingAs you watch death clearly seeing the body decay concentration grows even strongerIf you visualize death so that you can see it clearly youll realize that theres nothing to be gained by growing attached to the bodyWhen you see the truth in this way youll see that your past greed for things served no real purposeThe anger youve felt in the past what purpose did it serveYoull see that greed anger and delusion are stressful and serve no purpose  for ultimately well have to let go of everything that comes along with themYoull see that this sense of peace and ease in the mind is what serves a real purposeWhen the mind is at peace in this way it doesnt want anything elseAll it wants is peace and thats enoughIll tell you a storyIts time you listened to something light for a change so that you wont be so tense and grimIts important that you first let yourself relaxOnce Ajaan Funn my teacher was wandering through the forest in Baan Phyy district Udorn Thani province and stopped to spend the night not far from a certain villageHe saw that it was a congenial place and so stayed on there to practice meditationA woman living in the village would often come in the morning to give him alms and then again in the evening to hear his Dhamma talksAjaan Funn taught her to meditate something she had never done beforeIt so happened that she was afraid of ghostsWherever she went she was afraid of ghosts and so she never went anywhere aloneEspecially at night she was really afraidWhen Ajaan Funn taught her to meditate she didnt want to because she was afraid that shed see a corpse or a ghostOn following days Ajaan Funn asked her how her meditation was going and she couldnt answer him because she hadnt meditatedAfter a while she began to feel embarrassed He keeps teaching me to meditate and yet all I do is hold onto my fear of ghosts So she decided Whatever may happen Im going to meditate So she started to meditateAt first she simply focused on repeating the word buddho as she watched her breath come in and outAs her mind began to relax it began to drift a bit and a vision arose she saw a corpse lying stretched out in front of herWhen she saw the corpse she began to feel afraidThen the corpse moved in so that it was lying on her lapWith the corpse on her lap she couldnt get up to run awayAnd thats when she remembered her buddhoShe wanted buddho to come and help herSo she kept thinking buddho buddho more and more intenselyAs she was doing this one part of her mind was afraid the other part kept recollecting buddho buddho until the corpse disappeared from her lap and turned into herselfThat was when she had a vision of her chest bursting wide openHer heart was bright very brightIn the brightness of her heart she could see all kinds of thingsShe could see what other people were thinking what animals were thinkingShe knew all kinds of things and felt really amazedFrom that point on her fear of ghosts disappearedHer heart grew peaceful and at easeThe next day she went to see Ajaan FunnAjaan Funn was sick with a fever but he forced himself to get up to greet her and give her a Dhamma talk as he had on previous days just as if he wasnt sick at allAfter the talk she immediately said to him Than Ajaan your heart isnt bright and blooming at allIt looks withered and dryYou must be very sick Ajaan Funn was surprised How does she know the state of my mind But he had noticed that her manner was different from what it had been on previous daysShe was very composed and politeShe had bowed down very politely her words had been gentle and very respectfulWhen she commented on his heart that way he wondered Does she really know the state of my mind So when she returned to the village he forced himself to sit and meditate to the point where the fever broke and went awayHis heart grew peaceful bright and at easeThe next day when the time came that the woman would come he decided to play sick in order to test herWhen she arrived he didnt get up to greet her and stayed lying down as if he was sickAfter she bowed down she sat to meditate for a moment and then said Why your lotus  meaning his heart  your lotus is really blooming That was when Ajaan Funn realized that she was really meditating wellFrom that point on she could come in the evening without the slightest fear of ghosts or spiritsAnd she continued to meditate wellHer mind never deterioratedTo tell the truth she had never studied in school and didnt know much of the Dhamma but because of her respect for Ajaan Funn when he taught her to meditate she followed his instructionsWhether it was because of her past merit or what I dont know but she gained peace of mind developed her discernment and was able to know her own heart and the hearts of other peopleSo those of you who have come here to meditate dont underestimate yourselves thinking that you wont gain anything or come to any insightsDont be so sureIf you keep up your efforts and practice correctly it might very well happen that youll gain insightIf things come together properly the day will come when you know when you see the DhammaIt could very well happenSo keep up your effortsAfter the retreat is over when you go back home keep using your mindfulness to keep watch over yourselfIn your comings and goings keep training your mindfulness as you do while youre here as a means of maintaining the state of your mind through practicing restraint of the sensesThis will develop your mindfulness and give it powerThat way youll find that things go more smoothly when the time comes to train the mind to be stillAre there any other questionsYou can compare it to a nation at peace with no war no strife no conflicts no crimeThat nation will have the sense of ease that comes with being at peaceIf a family lives in harmony with no quarreling that family will have the sense of ease that comes with being at peaceIf the body is free from disease strong enough to be used for whatever work you want to do its called a body at peace and has the sense of ease that comes with being at peaceIf the mind isnt disturbed by the defilements that would put it into a turmoil its at peace in line with its natureEven nibbana is peace  a peace that lasts and can never be disturbedThats why nibbana is the ultimate easeOur job at present is to know the process of fabrication as it appears in the body and mindWe shouldnt let ourselves be deluded by the fabrications of the bodyWe should know their true natureThe same holds true with the mental fabrications issues of good and bad that affect the mind we shouldnt be deluded by them shouldnt fall for themWhen were wise to them and cant be fooled by them well gain the discernment that puts an end to suffering and stress because were no longer misled by what fabrication keeps telling usFor instance when the eye sees a beautiful form a form that weve liked in the past we tend to fall for itWe want itThis greed of ours creates a disturbance defiles the mind all over againWhen the ear hears a beautiful sound weve liked that weve fallen for in the past the process of fabrication will make us like it againGreed arises desire arises the mind gets disturbed all over againWhen a good smell comes into the nose we fall for itWhen the tongue touches a flavor we like we fall for it againWhen our mindfulness and alertness arent up on whats happening we like these thingsWe fall for themWe search for themThis is what gives rise to craving in the mind the origination of suffering and stressAnd so we sufferFor this reason our discernment has to be fully aware of this aspect of fabrication as wellOnce discernment is trained then when we see a form hear a sound smell an aroma taste a flavor we can recall that these things are fabricationsTheyre inconstantWhen fabrication is inconstant the pleasure that comes from fabrication is undependableWe shouldnt get carried away by the pleasures that come from those fabricationsOtherwise when they change well keep experiencing pain again and again until those fabrications have disappearedWhen they disappear we struggle to gain them again come into conflict with other people again fall out with them quarrel with them develop animosities develop bad kamma with them  all because weve fallen for fabricationsSo we have to reflect on the fact that fabrications are inconstantWe shouldnt latch onto them grow attached to them or fall for them so muchSo we should keep making an effort at training the mind using various techniques to look after it so that itll settle down and be stillThat way well gain the strength that will help us when pain and discomfort arise in the heartWell have our hideout  for when we stay with this sense of stillness well have an excellent hideout from dangerWhen meditators go wandering through the forest their teachers usually have them stay in places that are scaryIf theres a place where tigers are known to frequent the teachers will have their students go stay thereThere are cases where meditators have gained mindfulness gained concentration gained rapture and ease all from their fear of being eaten by tigersBut you have to be braveEven though you may be afraid you have to be brave at the same timeIf youre simply afraid and run away instead of meditating it wont accomplish anythingThere are quite a few meditation masters who when they heard tigers closing in on them at night grew so afraid that they couldnt bear itThere was no way for them to escape because it was nighttime and they were staying in a place where In the frames of reference that were practicing were taught to reflect on the food we eat the other necessities of life we use to see that theyre simply things for us to depend on for a short whileDont grow attached to themYou can choose the things you buy and store up for your use but the mind should keep reflecting that they fall under the Three CharacteristicsTheyre uncertainWhen we want to use these things for our benefit we should look after them but we shouldnt let ourselves suffer when they deteriorate and changeTell yourself this is a task you have to do with mindfulness discernment and correct awarenessYou dont have to depend on desireWhen you do the work correctly the results will come on their ownEven if people with no religion were to take over the government or were to gain the power to oppress the monks and people at large theyd be able to hold power only temporarily  because the type of power that knows no religion or morality that would govern in an unfair way cant really maintain peace and order in a countryThere are ideologies that when they take over the government give no freedom to the people dont allow them to practice religion or to hold other beliefsAnd as weve seen they can stay in power only temporarilyAs time passes the people get rid of them push them outWe can see this clearly at present in almost every country where unfair ideologies are in power people are demanding the freedoms that we have here in America where the government gives weight to human rights and where the people are pleased with this systemSuppose that some groups were to try to change this systemThe vast majority of the people wouldnt go along with them for sureIn the same way ninety percent of the people in Thailand are BuddhistIf the government showed no respect for Buddhism the people wouldnt go along with it for sureThere have been times in the past when the government thought somewhat along those lines but they never succeeded because the majority of the people didnt go along with themThe current king is widely loved and respected because of his reputation for developing the country and helping the people in the proper wayHe holds fast to Buddhist principles both in his own personal behavior and in his dealings with the peopleFor this reason the power of the Buddhas teachings is still deeply embedded in the hearts of the Thai peopleThey are deeply appreciative of the fact that the king respects the Buddhas teachings and practices in line with them strictly observing the precepts and staying firmly established in the practice of meditationThis is why the Buddha started out teaching these basic principles  the five precepts  to lay people so as to release them from this sort of thingIts like walking up the stairs to your houseThe stairs have five steps the five levels of jhanaThe first time the mind reaches a subtle level of stillness is the first stepWhen you havent yet started climbing the stairs you should content yourself with getting to the first stepBut when youve reached the first step you shouldnt content yourself simply with the fact that youve gotten up off the ground and stop right there  for the first step isnt your houseSo you should remind yourself of the fact that its not your house you havent yet reached shelter and then look for the second stepWhen youve reached the second step you should remind yourself that you still havent reached shelter so you have to take the next stepIn the same way when youve reached a subtle level of stillness and experienced just this level of pleasure and ease you should ponder this ease to see that its not yet constantIt can still changeThere are still higher levels of easeToday youve gotten this far the next step will be to keep moving up until you reach genuine easeWhat Ive explained so far should be enough for todayTalking a lot can get you confused for youre still new to this trainingYour memory can handle only so muchLike students just beginning their studies if they study a lot of advanced material and stuff it into their brains it wont all stay thereIts the same when we practice meditationYour mindfulness and discernment can take only so muchListen to just a little bit and then put it into practice so as to strengthen your mindfulness and discernment so as to strengthen your concentrationIn that way youll be able to take in more refined levels of DhammaAt this stage I want you to stop listening and to go back to look at your mind is it willing to accept the trainingIs it able to follow itOr is it still stubbornIf the mind isnt yet willing to accept and follow the training reason with it until it isGet the mind to reach what youve been hearing about so that it sees the results clearly within itselfYour knowledge on this level isnt knowledge from the mindIts knowledge from conceptsAs for the mind it hasnt yet taken these things inIf when you meditate you find that your mind is still restless and distracted unwilling to do what you want it to do thats a sign that it hasnt yet accepted the teachingsSo you have to reason with it over and over againIf on the other hand you can remember only one concept but can train the mind so that it can take in the truth of that concept then learning about concepts serves a purposeIf the mind isnt willing to take in the truth of that concept then knowing concepts doesnt serve any purposeSo Ill ask to stop todays questionandanswer session hereThe word inconstancy for the most part is used in connection with fabrications sankhara anicca  fabrications are inconstantThe word fabrications here carries a very broad meaning on the level of theoretical Dhamma but in terms of the practice for giving rise to discernment fabrications means the body and mindSo while you listen to this talk on inconstancy focus your attention on your own body for its something easy to know and to seeThen Ill explain the changes and inconstancy in itWhat is the purpose of studying inconstancyThis is something we should look intoStudying inconstancy has many benefitsIn particular the Buddha taught us to be mindful of the body mindful of the fact that once the body is born it has to keep changing day in and day outThe happiness and pleasures we get from the body on a daily basis are inconstantIf they were constant we wouldnt have to look for happiness and pleasure anywhere elseBut the fact is that the pleasure we have as soon as weve experienced it for a while gives out  regardless of what kind of pleasure it isThis is why the Buddha says its inconstant it requires us to stir ourselves to search to store things upThe things we stir ourselves to search for if we gain things that are good that we like we get possessiveAnd when there are things we love and like other people like them tooMany people who see what we have will want it as wellThis gives rise to competition to cheating and swindling as people try to get what they wantFrom this comes hatred animosity and vengeanceThis shows the inconstancy within the body the constant changes in the happiness we wantThe mind suffers negative impacts from the pleasure and pain that are such a confusing turmoil within itWhen we realize this truth the Buddha taught us to develop the discernment needed to comprehend itAnd he laid down another principle Natthi santi param sukham  there is no happiness higher than peaceThe peace here is peace in the Dhamma the peace that comes from practicing the DhammaHe pointed out that peace is the highest happiness and showed us the path to that peace which were practicing right now developing tranquillity and insight exercising restraint over our words and deeds and training our mindSo we should turn in to look at ourselvesWhen we understand that the body and the pleasures we experience are inconstant the mind state that used to feel attachment that used to deceive itself into thinking that it was in possession of happiness We try to change things so that our pleasure will be constantWe dont see the drawbacks of the suffering weve been throughDelusion and misunderstanding thus arise in the mind that hasnt seen the peace offering a happiness more subtle and refined than what were generally used toThis is why we have to depend on the Dhamma depend on our conviction in the BuddhaIf we look at the fabrications that the Buddha said are inconstant and stressful well see that what he said is really trueThe pleasures weve experienced dont really sufficeWe have to study to look for knowledge to find a refuge more dependable than what weve knownThis is why we have to depend on the teachings of the BuddhaWhen weve heard them we train our minds to be still to let goWe have to give ourselves the opportunity to make our minds empty and stillWhen we say the mind is empty that means that its disengagedIts not restless and distractedIt doesnt have a lot of preoccupationsThe same as when we do demanding work if we keep at it a lot the body gets tiredWhen its tired we disengage it from the workWe sit down or lie down to restWhen it has rested at normalcy the tiredness goes awayWe regain our strengthWhen weve regained our strength we can resume our workWe see that working uses up energyWhen our energy is used up resting gathers energyThe resting is part of the pleasure and ease that comes when the body is empty in other words disengaged from its workIts the same with the mindWe look for happiness all the time because we want precisely this sense of easeWhen the mind isnt empty and disengaged we keep lookingWe should train the mind to be stillWhen the mind is still here in this sense of awareness itself its empty and disengagedIts not thinking about anythingIts empty through its stillnessBut we cant keep it empty and still like this all the timeWe still have our clingingaggregatesWe still have our eyes and the mind wants to see thingsWe still have our ears nose tongue and bodyThere are still sounds smells tastes and tactile sensationsWe still have feelings of pleasure and painThese things are always disturbing usSo this is why the Buddha teaches us once weve gotten the mind to settle down and be still to contemplate the inconstancy of the bodyThat way well come to understand that the body is really inconstant and stressfulAs long as were still attached to the body as me or mine well have to suffer from aging illness and death at all timesSo we should let go of these things and hold onto the Dhamma making the mind stillThat way well give rise to stillness and easeWell see that the body is inconstant aging and wasting away that stress and suffering arise because of this inconstancyUltimately the whole body falls apartWhen it falls apart what is it likeIt grows putrid and decaysIt doesnt belong to anyoneThis is why the Buddha taught us to yathabhutam sammappaññaya datthabbam to see things as they are with right discernment to let them go to have no attachment to the aggregates not to view them as selfWhen this is the case the mind wont feel any greed for it sees that greed serves no purposeWhen weve seen this truth the angers weve felt in the past will grow weakerKnowledge will arise in the place of our past delusionsWhen the mind contemplates and develops discernment to the point where its able once and for all to make itself pure totally abandoning the defilements of greed anger and delusion  or passion aversion and delusion  then thats called a mind truly empty empty of defilement empty of greed anger and delusion because its no longer carrying anything aroundIf you carry things theyre heavyThey defile the mindIf you dont hold on and carry them the mind is emptyPureIt doesnt have to look for anything ever againThis emptiness of the mind comes from our understanding inconstancySo if you aspire to this emptiness you should contemplate inconstancy to see it clearly to make your discernment alert and wise to the truthThe mind  whose defilements depend on inconstant things to give rise to greed anger and delusion  wont be able to give rise to them any more because its grown disenchantedIt doesnt want themIt will grow empty and enter into stillnessThe mind is empty because its defilements are goneTo summarize the three characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself exist only in the mind with defilementsWhen the mind has the discernment to kill off the defilements for good theres nothing inconstant stressful or notself within itThats why its emptyAs for our minds at present theyre not empty because they havent been able to chase the defilements all outEven though were able to develop mindfulness and meditate to the point where we experience stillness and ease thats only a little bit of temporary emptinessAs soon as mindfulness lapses things come in to disturb us all over againThats because were not empty of defilementThe ultimate defilement is unawarenessEvery defilement whether blatant moderate or subtle has unawareness mixed in with itThis is why the Buddha taught us to train our minds to give rise to awareness the opponent of unawarenessWhichever side is stronger will win out and hold power over the mindIf awareness wins out the defilements have no place to stayIf unawareness wins out theres no peace and easeNo purityThe mind isnt emptyStress and suffering ariseTo know the unawareness already in the mind is awfully difficultIts like using darkness to illuminate darkness you cant see anythingOr like two blind people leading each other along theyll have a hard time escaping from dangers and reaching their goalThis is why we have to depend on people with good eyes in other words mindfulness and discernmentThese are the crucial factors that will lead us to the end of the pathAn example of how we can put mindfulness to use suppose we arent yet acquainted with aniccaWe dont know where it isWhen we hear that anicca refers to the inconstancy of the five aggregates beginning with physical form we apply mindfulness to keeping these things in mind to see if they really are inconstantOr suppose we feel that we gain pleasure from holding onto the body as our self we keep on providing for it and fixing it so that we dont see its stress and inconstancyIn this way weve gone astray from the Buddhas teachingsSo we use mindfulness to keep the body in mindFor example were mindful of hairIs our hair constantDoes it always stay the same or notThink of the first strand of hair that grew on your headIt was cut off long agoThe hair we have now is new hairIt keeps changingThe first strand of hair no longer serves us any purposeWe dont even know where its goneThis is one way of contemplating inconstancyAs for anatta or notself The hair that in the past we thought was ours  where is it nowIf we think in this way well come to understand the teaching on notselfIf we contemplate the things that the Buddha said are notself well see that what he said is absolutely trueWell see the truth and our own mind is what sees the truth in line with what the Buddha said our body doesnt have any essence it just keeps sloughing awayAnd as for what he said about the bodys being unclean when it dies no one can dress it up to make it really cleanAs soon as it falls down dead everyone detests itWhen we reflect more and more profoundly on this the mind will come to accept that what the Buddha taught is the genuine truthWhen the mind accepts this its ignorance will gradually disappearDiscernment  knowledge in line with the Buddhas teachings  will gradually take shape in our mindsSo when the mind contemplates hair profoundly until it knows the truth and its ignorance disappears knowledge  beginning with knowledge about the true nature of our hair  will ariseThe unawareness with which we clung to the hair as us or ours seeing it as beautiful dressing it up with perfumes making it lovely and attractive well see that all that was an act of selfdelusionIf the true nature of these things was really good we wouldnt have to do any of that for it would already be goodIts because its not good that we have to make it goodThats one way in which our own views have deluded usThe Buddha told us to know the truth of this matter so that the mind will be able to let goWhen the mind lets go all its defilements lighten and disappear because our views are rightDefilements arise because of wrong views because of ignorance or unawareness of the truthIgnorance gives rise to delusion and mistaken assumptions which turn into wrong viewsThis is why we have to make an effort to give rise to awarenessFor example suppose we arent aware that the hair nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones in our body are composed of the properties of earth water wind and fireActually this physical form of ours is nothing more than the four propertiesThe water property includes all the liquid parts of the body such as bile phlegm lymph mucus urine blood fat oilThe earth property includes all the hard and solid parts such as hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow etcThe wind property includes the breath the breath energy in the stomach the energy that rises up in the body the energy that goes down the energy that flows all over the bodyThe fire property includes the warmth that keeps the body from decaying the warmth that helps with the digestion and the warmth that keeps the body alive at the right temperatureAltogether the body is nothing but these four propertiesWhen we dont realize this thats called unawarenessWe arent acquainted with the body the aggregatesWhen we learn about this awareness can begin to ariseThis is why were taught to contemplate the parts of the body kesa hair of the head loma hair of the body nakha nails danta teeth taco skinNew monks are taught these things from the very day of their ordination so that they can eliminate unawareness and give rise to awareness through the light of mindfulness and discernmentI ask that you develop a lot of mindfulness and discernment in this area so that your minds will reach the emptiness and freedom you wantDiscernment here means the awareness that comes from studying the five aggregatesNo other knowledge can destroy this defilement of unawarenessSo when you want to destroy the defilement of unawareness you have to carefully study the five aggregates beginning with the body until you see the four noble truths right here in the five aggregatesActually the five aggregates are things whose true nature is well within our power to study and knowFirst theres the aggregate of form or the physical bodyThen there are the mental aggregates feeling perception mental fabrications and consciousnessThese are things we can knowWe have to study and practice so that we can know all four of these mental aggregates in line with their true natureEach of these aggregates covers a lot of aspectsFor instance physical form yankinci rupam atitanagatapaccuppannam ajjhattam va bahiddha va  there are all kinds of forms that can fool and delude us internal and external blatant and subtle past present and futureBut when insight arises in full strength itll show us the way to see without much difficultyAll thats needed is that you first start with the basic meditation themes such as the hair of the head and see them clearly in line with their natureThen discernment will gradually ariseDo you understand thisYou can say that the Dhamma is subtle but you can also say that its right here within us within our own bodiesAll the things Ive discussed here when you havent yet put them into practice but would like to see these truths you shouldnt let mindfulness wander outside the bodyContemplate things in line with their true natureDont let prejudice get in the wayRemind yourself that this is the DhammaThats enough explanation for nowWhen you study things but dont put them into practice your knowledge doesnt get you anywhereSo now that you know the path Id like you to focus your intention on practicing a lotIll ask to stop here so that you can put your knowledge into practice and benefit from itMay you all meet with well beingWhen meditators minds have reached genuine happiness in the Dhamma through their mindfulness and discernment clearly seeing the four noble truths none of them  not one  will revert to looking for happiness in the world or in material thingsThats because happiness in the Dhamma is a lasting happiness solid refined and genuinely pureIf you compare worldly happiness with the happiness of the Dhamma youll see that theres not even the least real happiness to itIt offers nothing but stress nothing but drawbacksSo why do we think its happinessBecause were burning with painWe look to worldly happiness and pleasures to relieve the pain which then goes away for a while but then comes back againFor instance the Buddha said that birth is stress but ordinary people regard it as something happyWe dont see the stress and pain involvedYet once the mind has reached the happiness of the Dhamma it can see that birth is really stressful just as the Buddha saidThe reason we have to look after ourselves take care of ourselves and still cant find any peace is because these things that have been born come to disturb usWe sit down and get some pleasure and ease from sitting down but after a while it becomes painfulWe say that its pleasant to lie down but thats true only at the very beginningAfter weve lain down for a long time it begins to get unpleasantSo we have to keep changing postures in order to gain pleasureWe look for this thing or that but as soon as weve gained just a little pleasure from them stress and pain come in their wakeIf we have a family and home to live pleasantly together there are only little pleasures which have us fooled and deceived while there are hundreds and thousands of unpleasant thingsThe happiness and pleasure that come from external things material things is never enoughIt keeps wearing away wearing away and wearing us out to no purpose at allThis is why those who have reached the Dhamma dont return to this world so filled with sorrows and turmoilAnd this is why I want you to put an effort into meditating contemplating in line with the DhammaEven if you arent yet convinced of the Dhamma at least take the teachings of the Buddha as your working principlesFor example when the Buddha teaches about the Three Characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself we should train our minds to see in line with what he saidGive him a tryFor example he says that this body of ours is filled with all sorts of unclean thingsWe may not agree but at least give it a try to see what happens when you look at things in line with what he saysHe says its not cleanAtthi imasmim kaye  in this body there is hair of the head and its not clean hair of the body and its unclean nails and theyre not cleanDont be in a hurry to reject the Buddhas teachingsTake a look to see whether these things really are unclean or notWhen the mind focuses on these things more and more steadily and begins to feel quiet and at ease the truth of these things will gradually appear more and more clearlyConviction in the Dhamma in the practice will ariseEnergy will arise as we want to see moreAs this awareness grows greater the mind will grow more luminous and stillThis is the way of the practiceWhen you go back home remember this simple principle practice meditation by observing your body observing your mindUse your mindfulness to keep track of the body in and of itself so as to know it in line with its truthIf you dont look at the body then look at the mind in and of itselfWhen you observe the movements of the body and mind the pleasures and pains that arise so often youll develop awareness and skillYoull learn how to handle things in line with the Buddhas teachingsYoull gain the discernment that sees and knows the truthYoull see things more and more clearlyThe more clearly you see things the stronger and more quiet the mind will growYoull see the body as stressful and unclean but youll have to look after the mind keeping yourself wise to the fact that the stress and uncleanliness are an affair of the body not of the mindThe body has been unclean all alongWeve lived with it all this time so theres no need to be afraid of seeing these things no need to reject themWe should contemplate the body so as to give rise to a sense of chastened dispassionWhen you let go of the body let go in a discerning wayDont let go in a way in which delusion and misunderstanding overcome the mindDont get disgusted with the body so that the mind becomes restless and agitated and stops meditatingThat kind of dislike is wrongWhen we look at things we dont like  such as the inconstancy the stressfulness and the unattractiveness of the body  remember that theyre part of the noble truthsThe Buddha said that theyre very beneficialContemplating the unattractiveness of the body is very beneficial because it serves an important purposeIf we see the body properly in this way it helps the mind grow still with a sense of disenchantmentAnd thats what will cure our delusions and misunderstandingsThis is why when ordaining a monk the very first step is to teach him the five meditation themes  kesa hair of the head loma hair of the body nakha nails danta teeth taco skin  as a way of developing discernment and knowledge of the truthSo hold onto these themes and keep contemplating them regardless of whether the mind is still or notWhenever you have any free time contemplate themYou can contemplate them even while youre workingContemplate them until you get down to the minute details in a way that gives rise to a sense of stillness and easeIts similar to when we do physical workWe get wages for each hour we workThe more hours we work the higher our payBut if you get greedy and keep working without rest then the body wears out the mind grows weak and you cant work any moreSo you have to rest and eat to regain the strength of your body and nervesEven though you dont get paid for the time you rest youre willing to take the loss for the sake of your strength of body and mind so that you can contend with the work after youve restedIts the same when you meditate if you just keep contemplating and investigating it wont be long before the mind gets restless and agitatedSo you have to bring the mind to stillness to avoid its getting restlessIf it gets restless itll have no peaceItll get all tied up in knots and will grow weary of the meditationSo contemplate for a while until you can sense that the mind wants to stop and rest then focus back on the inandout breath or anything else that will serve as a gathering point for the mindGradually let go of your contemplation gradually let the mind settle down so as to gain strength from the sense of pleasure and ease that come in this wayDont worry about how long you should stay thereEven though the mind doesnt seem to be gaining any knowledge dont worry about itIts as when youre resting from physical labor even though your boss doesnt give you anything for the hour you rest youre willing for the sake of gaining energy  in this case strength of mindThis is why the Noble Disciples constantly practice concentration constantly get the mind to settle downAfter theyve contemplated to the point where the mind gets weary they let the mind grow stillAfter its had enough stillness they go back to their contemplationThis is how we should practiceIf we practice in this way the mind will gain energy and strength will gain discernment to the end point of all suffering and stress seeing things for what they actually areThe question asked the other day  how to practice when you go back home  was a very good questionThe answer is keep looking after your mind in the way Ive described herePractice exercising your own mindfulness and discernmentWhen the Buddha spoke about karma after his Awakening to the truth he was referring to actionTheres physical karma ie the actions of the body verbal karma the actions of speech and mental karma the actions of the mindAll human beings all living beings experience good things and bad pleasure and pain from karma  their own actionsKarma is something very subtleWhen you ask about rebirth and how youll experience pleasure and pain in future lives you should first study karma in your present life your actions in your present lifeUnderstand your actions in the present life clearlyOnce you understand them once you know the truth of action in the present then when you train the mind further youll gradually come to the end of your doubtsTheres no one who has ever resolved doubts about rebirth simply through reading or hearing the spoken wordEven among those whove practiced a long time if their discernment isnt up to the task theyll still have their same old doubtsThe texts tell us that doubt is ended only with the attainment of the first of the noble paths called streamentryStreamenterers have cut away three defilements selfidentity views doubt and attachment to precepts and practicesWhen the discernment of the noble path arises knowledge of birth and death rebirth and redeath arises together with itAs for our current level of discernment if we want to know about these things we need to do the preliminary workWe need to study the nature of action in the presentSo today I wont speak of future lifetimesIll teach about the three kinds of action  physical action verbal action and mental action  in the presentThese three kinds of action are divided into two sorts good and badBad actions give rise to sufferingGood actions give rise to good results happiness prosperity mindfulness and discernment both in the present and on into future days future months future yearsBad actions are called unskillful karmaThe Buddha taught that we should abandon this kind of karmaIn the area of physical action that includes tormenting and killing living beings whether large or smallThis kind of action is unskillful because it lacks good will and compassionAll living beings love their lifeIf we kill them its unskillful because we have no compassion no pity no regard for their livesThis is why the Buddha told us not to do itIf we kill other human beings we get punished in the present both by the civil law and by the DhammaThese three things  killing stealing and illicit sex  are all called unskillful physical karmaWe should contemplate them to see why the Buddha told us not to do themWhen weve contemplated them well see that they really arent good things to do because we wouldnt want anyone to do them to usFor example the wealth that weve earned is something were possessive ofIts something we want to use as we likeIf someone were to steal it from us or cheat us out of it then even if that person used to be our friend thats the end of the friendshipWe cant live with that person any longerWere sure to have a quarrel and a falling outThat person might even have to go to jail for the theftThis is crude karma the kind whose results are visible in the immediate presentThe same holds true with the third preceptOnce weve decided to get married to live with another person then if that person cheats on us think of how much suffering there will be for both sidesPeople who want peace or who are established in morality wont praise the other person as being a good personAll of these things are unskillful physical actions that the Buddha taught us to abandonAs for verbal karma there are four kinds of unskillful action lying divisive speech harsh speech and idle chatterAnd in the area of mental karma there are three greed ill will and wrong viewsWhoever does any of these ten kinds of unskillful actions  the three kinds of unskillful physical karma the four kinds of unskillful verbal karma and the three kinds of unskillful mental karma  is an unskillful personThis is why were taught that were the owners of our actionsIf we act in these mistaken ways we become mistaken peopleWere the ones who are defiled by those actions no one else is defiled by what we doThis is why were taught to reflect every day that were the owner of our actionsIf we do something bad we become bad people and we have to reap the bad results the suffering that arises from that actionThats why were taught that were the heirs to our actionsIf we dont abandon those actions if we keep doing them often the results of those actions will follow us wherever we goTheres no way we can be regarded as good peopleThis is why were taught that were followed by our actionsWherever we go if we dont give up that kind of behavior well be mistrusted by societyThe reason the Buddha has us reflect on these things  that were the owners of our actions heirs to our actions followed by our actions  is so that well pay attention to our actions every day so that well see them clearly for what they areIf we dont clearly see the nature and results of our actions we should contemplate them further Why does killing result in sufferingWhen a person kills why is that person a bad personThe same holds true with stealing and illicit sexIf we examine these actions carefully making our minds impartial and fair well see that these actions really are badThey really result in sufferingWell see for ourselves in line with what the Buddha taughtWe dont have to look at anyone elseWe just look at ourselvesIf we see that what were doing isnt good then when other people do the same things the same holds true for themWhoever does these things is a bad personIf a lot of people do these things then theres trouble for a lot of peopleIf everyone in the world were to do these things the whole world would be troubledThe peace and happiness the world does experience comes totally from the good actions of good peopleThe ten things weve been talking about are karma on the unskillful side but there are also ten kinds of skillful karma  three physical four verbal and three mental  in just the same wayThese are the actions that bring us happiness and prosperityIn terms of the three kinds of skillful physical karma we use our discernment and compassion to consider thingsWe have compassion for animals that are about to be killedIf we see something belonging to someone else that wed like we have compassion for them so that we wouldnt want to steal that thing or cheat the other person out of itIf we see an opportunity for some illicit sex we reflect on the fact that were already married and should have only one heart one loveWe should have compassion for the person we live withIf we cheat on that person well create suffering for him or herHaving only one heart one love is meritorious for it allows us to live together for lifeSo if we learn to abandon the pleasures that come from taking life stealing and illicit sex we benefitWe become good peopleSociety doesnt mistrust usThe society of good people recognizes us as good people as clean people pure in body because our virtues are pureThis is where purity comes fromTo save time Ill condense the remainder of the discussionThe ten kinds of skillful actions are the opposite of the ten kinds of unskillful onesIn terms of the three kinds of skillful physical karma we abstain from the three kinds of unskillful karmaWe resolve not to do them and we follow through absolutely in line with that resolveThe same holds for the four kinds of skillful verbal karmaWe resolve firmly not to lie not to engage in divisive speech in harsh speech or idle chatterWe also resolve not to be greedy not to feel ill will for anyone and to straighten out our views  ie to hold to the principle of karma seeing that if we do good well become good if we do bad well become badWhen we see things in this way our views are right in line with the truthUnskillful actions comes from the minds being affected by the defilements of greed anger and delusionPeople kill and steal out of greed engage in illicit sex out of greed steal or kill out of angerSometimes they engage in illicit sex out of anger as a way of getting evenSometimes they do these things out of delusion as when theyre tricked into doing them along with other peopleThats why these three defilements  greed anger and delusion  are so importantAnd this is why we develop mindfulness so that well see how these three defilements are the root of unskillfulnessIf they arise they can cause us to misbehave in various ways to engage in unskillful karmaSo when they arise we have to use our discernment to hold them in checkAs for skillful mental states When we understand how unskillfulness comes from these three defilements  when weve heard these teachings and considered them on our own  the mind comes to feel shame at the idea of misbehaving in any of those waysIt realizes why they shouldnt be doneIt also develops a sense of moral dread realizing that if we do those things well become bad peopleOur friends  anyone who knows us  will criticize us wont want to associate with us will despise usWhen we feel this kind of dread we can abandon those thingsSo when our discernment reaches the stage where we have this sense of shame and moral dread when we resolve not to do wrong in terms of our physical verbal and mental karma then skillful mental states have arisen within usThese states will then lead us to do all sorts of goodWell feel compassion for othersWell want to help themThis in turn becomes one of our perfections causing other people other beings to love us in returnThe happiness that comes from this goodness is called meritWhen we have a sense of shame and moral dread we exercise restraint over our physical actions so that we dont do anything wrongThis means that our body is pureWe exercise restraint over our speech not breaking our precepts and in this way our speech is pureWe exercise restraint over the mind an in this way our mind is pureWhen we exercise restraint and dont do anything wrong well know for ourselves that were good people  good because what we do is goodAs for the good things that come from doing good our friends will love us people trust us we pose no threat to anyone anywherePeople are happy to welcome us into their societyWhen we act in this way were not mistrusted wherever we goThus when we do good that good karma is oursWell be skillful peopleIf other people do good that good karma is theirsAs for people who dont restrain themselves in this way they dont have a share in that goodnessThis is why the Buddha said that were the owners of our actionsIf we do good well experience good resultsIf we keep doing good that goodness will keep following us wherever we goFor example if a monk observes his precepts exercises restraint over his words and deeds in Thailand the people there recognize him as a good personWhen he comes to America we see that hes a good person who poses no danger to usThe same holds true with usIf we behave in a skillful way were good peopleIf we go to Thailand the people there will welcome usWherever we go people will welcome usIts when we do evil that people want to keep us outSo we can see clearly in line with what the Buddha said Living beings are what they are in line with their actionsIf we do good were good people and experience happinessSociety welcomes usWe help bring pleasure to the worldWhen we see the good weve done well feel happy with ourselvesEsteem for ourselvesWe can guarantee our own purityWherever we go we can go with confidence for there are no hidden weak points in our behavior or heartsWere not afraid of being found out for anything for we have nothing to hideIts because of our purity that we can be confident and braveWherever we go we know that good people will welcome usMoreover we can help them become better people tooThey can take us as an example and in this way we serve a beneficial purposeThe activities of good people are much more beneficial than those of people who arent goodThis is because their minds tend toward selfsacrifice for the sake of the world the sake of the common goodIn this way they win honor praise wealth and happinessSociety spreads their name far and wide for the goodness theyve doneNow that youve heard about the pleasure and pain that come in the present from good and bad karma weve done do you understand what Ive saidDo you agreeMindfulness at the point of death though is related to present karmaIts a form of skillful karmaIf weve done good then our mindfulness will have the strength to recollect the goodness weve doneNormally when people are about to die two kinds of signs can appearThe first is a karmasign dealing with actions theyve done in the pastIf a person has done evil then there may be a sign making him relive that actionWhen I was a child there was a man in the village who had slaughtered a lot of cattleWhen he was about to die he started screaming and sounded just like a cow being slaughteredThis is called a sign of unskillful karmaThe person relives the karma he did although this time its being done to him in the case of the man who slaughtered cattle he sees someone coming to kill himWhen that sort of vision appears the mind will fall in line with it and be reborn in a state of deprivation to suffer the consequences of its evil deedsThe second kind of sign is a destinationsignYou see where youre goingYou may see hell the realm of the hungry ghosts  everywhere you look you see things corresponding to the bad things youve doneIf you die at that point the mind will go to that sort of destinationEnough of these bad thingsLets talk about some good ones all rightIf youve done good things and skillful things then when youre about to die Especially if youve practiced meditation and attained jhana then when youre about to die the mind can enter one of the rupa jhanas and be reborn on the level of the rupa brahmasIf youve attained any of the arupa jhanas then you can enter jhana and reach the levels of the arupa brahmas in line with the minds strengthAs for more ordinary levels of skillfulness  called kamavacarakusala skillfulness on the sensual level  as when you practice generosity observe the precepts and meditate abstaining from the ten forms of unskillful karma weve mentioned when youre about to die a karmasign will arise and youll remember meditating in the pastYoull find yourself meditating again being mindful gaining the same sense of ease you had beforeThe mind then holds onto its concentration and experiences rebirth in a pleasurable direction in one of the good destinationsOr you may remember the happiness you felt in doing good  paying respect to the Buddha lighting candles and incense giving donations in one way or anotherYou may get a karmasign that youre doing those things again together with your friends in the same way as were meditating together here paying respect to the Buddha sitting in meditation doing walking meditationIf you pass away at that moment the mind will experience birth in one of the good destinationsIn this way whatever actions you did in the course of your life will appear to you  as if youre doing them again  as youre about dieAs for the good destinationsigns you may see gold and silver palaces riches things that delight you and give you pleasure things corresponding to the skillful things youve doneIf you die at that point youll go to a good destinationTheres a story in the Dhammapada Commentary about a very virtuous lay disciple who liked to listen to the Dhamma and made a practice of generosity virtue and meditationAs he grew older and was on his deathbed he asked his children to invite some monks to come recite some suttas to himAs the monks were chanting  most likely the Mangala Sutta the Girimananda Sutta or the Satipatthana Sutta  devas from all the various directions came with their royal chariots to take the lay disciple back to their different heavensThis one said Come with me That one said No come with me So the devas started fighting over himThe lay disciple seeing this said Stop As soon as he said that the monks  who didnt see the devas  stopped chanting and went back to their monasterySoon after the lay man asked his children What happened to all the monks The children answered Well you told them to stop so they stopped chanting and went back to the monastery No the lay disciple said I didnt tell them to stopI told the devas to stop fighting The children didnt believe him that any devas had comeAll they could think was that he was losing his mindHe insisted though that the devas had come to welcome him to their heavensIf you dont believe me take that garland and throw it in the air So they threw the garland in the air and it caught on the edge of one of the devas chariots as it was about to leaveThe children didnt see the chariot all they could see was the garland whizzing through the airThe only person who could see the devas was their fatherThis is one of the rewards of acting skillfully or serving a useful purpose in lifeWhen youre about to die the devas come to take you to their heavensThey want you to join them  for theres happiness in living with wise people in associating with people who are goodIn short the three types of skillfulness that lead to a good destination are danamaya generosity helping other people to live in pleasure and happiness silamaya virtue observing the five precepts and ten forms of skillful action and bhavanamaya meditation developing the mindI ask that you have conviction in meditation that you set your minds on doing itWhether or not your minds settle down doesnt really matterEven if you dont gain release from suffering in this lifetime youre developing good habits that will act as supporting conditions in future lifetimesThe reward of your meditation is that youll be mindful discerning and intelligentYoull live long and feel mental wellbeingIf you get to hear the Dhamma in the future youll more easily gain AwakeningThese are some of the rewards of meditatingSo dont let yourselves grow weary of the meditationDont tell yourselves that you dont get anything from doing itAt the very least you gain skillfulness on the sensual level you develop awareness understanding and intelligence as supporting conditions for your future happiness both in this life and on into the nextThats enough explanation for nowMay each and every one of you meet with peace and prosperityOrdination is a ceremony that the Buddha laid down both for the Bhikkhu Sangha and for the Bhikkhuni SanghaWhen he had allowed women to ordain there were many women who on practicing the Dhamma reached arahantship some of them with special abilities like the Buddhas famous male disciplesFor example the Buddha praised Sister Khema as foremost among the bhikkhunis in terms of her discernment just as he praised Sariputta as foremost in discernment among the bhikkhusHe praised Sister Uppalavanna as foremost among the bhikkhunis in terms of her psychic powers just as he praised Moggallana as the foremost bhikkhu in terms of his psychic powersFor a long time afterwards women continued ordaining and practicing the Dhamma but for what reason I dont know they werent able to maintain their lineage all the way up to the presentNow the Buddha decreed that any man who wants to ordain must have a preceptor and that there must be at least five members of the Sangha sitting in on the ordinationOne of the Sangha members is agreed upon by the group as the person who will question the candidate concerning his qualifications to see if he will be able to practice the Buddhas teachings on becoming ordainedWhen all the Sangha members see that the candidate is qualified they make a public announcement of his ordinationThe same requirements were laid down for the Bhikkhuni SanghaThe candidate has to have a bhikkhuni as her preceptor and the Bhikkhuni Sangha has to question her concerning her qualificationsWhen they see that she is qualified they admit her into the Bhikkhuni SanghaTo govern the life of both Sanghas the Buddha laid down rules and requirements called the vinayaIn laying down these rules it wasnt the case that the Buddha called a meeting and laid them down all in advanceOnly when an individual bhikkhu had misbehaved did the Buddha call a meeting of the Sangha to question the offender about what he had doneWhen the offender admitted his wrongdoing the Buddha would lay down a training rule one at a timeIf someone else misbehaved in another way the Buddha would call another meeting and add another ruleHe continued doing this in response to the actual misdeeds of the bhikkhusThe same held true for the bhikkhunisIf an individual bhikkhuni misbehaved the Buddha would call a meeting of the Sangha over which he would presideWhen he had questioned the offender and she had admitted to her wrongdoing he would lay down a rule to prevent that kind of behavior from being repeated in the futureAs this happened many times  as members of the Sangha misbehaved in various ways causing trouble in the Sangha  the Buddha kept adding more and more rulesAfter he passed away no one knows why but theres no report of the Bhikkhuni Sangha in the account of the First and Second CouncilsThe account of the Third Council reports that bhikkhunis were involved at that time and some of them were sent to Sri LankaThe bhikkhunis continued their ordination lineage for centuries after that but for some unknown reason the lineage no longer exists in the presentNow that there are no longer any bhikkhunis theres no way that women can simply become bhikkhunis on their own for no one would dare certify that theyd be acting in line with the Buddhas promulgationsThere are no preceptors to train them no Bhikkhuni Sangha to joinThe requirements set down for women to ordain are that there must be a bhikkhuni to act as preceptor there must be a bhikkhuni to question the candidate as to her qualifications and there must be a quorum of bhikkhunis who agree to admit the candidate into the SanghaThen they send someone to inform the Bhikkhu Sangha that the woman of thisandthis name has been ordainedWhen the bhikkhus are formally informed then the candidate would count as a bhikkhuni on an equal footing in the training with all the other bhikkhunisIts right here that I would like to express my sympathyWhy werent the bhikkhunis able to maintain their lineageIf they had maintained their lineage then women would be able to ordain just like menNo one would be able to stop themAfter all the Buddha gave his permission for women to ordainThis is why I feel sympathy for those who would like to ordainWhat Ive said so far applies to the Theravadan traditionThe Theravadan Bhikkhuni Sangha no longer existsThe Mahayanists say that their bhikkhuni lineages still exist but if you look at their behavior and practices theyve strayed very far from the vinayaThis is why the Theravadan tradition doesnt recognize them as bhikkhunisThe Mahayanists say their way is right but we dont get involved in that discussionIf on studying the matter you feel conviction in the practice of the Mahayana bhikkhunis thats one opportunity for ordinationActually ordination is simply a formality a customary procedure in line with the rules of the SanghaIn the area of meditation the Buddha didnt forbid anyone  man or woman  from practicingIf youre really convinced of the value of the practice you dont have to put on ochre robes in line with monastic customsOnce youve developed a correct understanding of the Buddhas teachings  when you have strong conviction and want to practice the noble eightfold path in full  Im thoroughly convinced that you can practice without having to put on monastic robesYou can go off on your own and practice to the point of developing the mindfulness and discernment needed to gain release from sufferingIts said that if lay people reach arahantship they can simply start wearing white observing the eight precepts and live apart from lay people in generalIn this way they can live out their full life span without any difficultyLay people can attain arahantship if theyre really firmly convinced and courageousThere was once a person who asked the Buddha Do those who are able to reach nibbana exist only in the Buddhas monastic Sangha or are other groups of people able to reach arahantship as well The Buddha answered Anyone  no matter what group he or she belongs to  who practices correctly in line with the noble eightfold is able to reach nibbana This shows that lay people if they practice correctly can reach nibbana as wellSo you can rest assured that the Buddha wasnt prejudiced in any wayOnce when the Buddha had come to a river he picked up a fistful of sand and asked the monks who were following him Which is greater this fistful of sand or the sand in all the rivers and oceans The monks answered The sand in the Blessed Ones fist is a small amount lordThe sand in all the rivers and oceans is far moreThe Buddha then responded In the same way monks those things that I have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are like the sand in all the rivers and oceansThe things I have taught are like this fistful of sandAny teaching that was true but wouldnt serve a purpose  in other words things that his listeners couldnt confirm for themselves  the Buddha wouldnt teachAnd he wouldnt deceive the world by teaching anything useless or untrueHe taught only the genuine truth that his listeners could understand and confirm for themselves through the practiceIve explained quite a lot alreadyWhen theres a lot of speaking theres simply a lot of breathMy hope is that you all will learn from listening in line with your mindfulness and then take what youve learned and put it into practice so that it will serve a purposeEven though it may not be much my hope is that its enough to serve a purposeYouve sacrificed a lot  your work all kinds of things  in coming here to practiceComing together like this doesnt happen easilyOur interpreter has sacrificed his time too inspired by his sense that you want to practiceThe organizer Larry Rosenberg has given a lot of his time and energy to the arrangements that have enabled us to come together to practice out of a similar desire the desire that all of you learn and practice the correct way to lead your lives so that youll reach purity in line with the principles of the Buddhas teachings  the same teachings he taught his disciples in the past so that they too were able to reach purityThe teachings of the Buddha are still with usThose of us in the present should listen to them and put them into practice so as to serve a purpose just like the people in the pastThat way well find happiness and prosperity in our livesSo I ask that you remember what youve learned here contemplate it and put it into practice so that all of you  each and every one  will benefit in line with your aimsThats enough for now so Ill ask to stop hereThe rewards of good will are it purifies the virtues of the person who develops it and it brings the mind to Right ConcentrationThis is why its included in the classical forty topics of concentrationOur Lord Buddha from the time before he gained Awakening until he entered total nibbana practiced good will in his deeds good will in his words and good will in his thoughts at all timesThe fact that we human beings have lived in peace through the virtues of the Triple Gem up to the present day is because of the power of the Buddhas great good will and compassionFor this reason we too should develop good will for all beings in line with his exampleThe power of good will can bring peace and security to the world in countless waysTheres a brief story from the time of the Buddha that illustrates this pointOnce a king was returning home with his troops after having engaged in a battleOn the way they stopped off in a cool quiet forest to rest and to find water to drink and to bathe in and there in the forest they happened to come across a group of around monks practicing goodwill concentrationThe monks quiet manner  they werent even making a sound  astonished the kingHe said to himself Even in a single household of two or three people there are bound to be quarrels and commotionBut here these contemplatives are living together by the hundreds without any commotion at allIf our country could be at peace like this there probably wouldnt need to be any battles or warImpressed he went to the head monk bowed down and asked to be taught their contemplative practiceAfter listening to the head monks advice he sent his troops back to his capital while he stayed there in the forest practicing goodwill meditation for twelve years to the point where he had mastered the jhanasOnly then did he return to his capitalImmediately on his return he made a practice of spreading thoughts of good will in every direction throughout his kingdom and to the neighboring kingdoms as wellHis people came thronging around him happy joyful and filled with respect for himWhen he conversed with them to learn of their hardships and joys he taught them to develop good will compassion appreciation and equanimity for one anotherCaptivated by his words his people listened to him with trust and respect and followed his instructionsFrom that point on love and kindness spread through every home and village giving rise to a sense of friendship fellowship and cooperation that spread throughout the kingdomThere were no more wars with neighboring kingdoms and the people lived in happiness and peaceThis story shows what the power of goodness in a single persons heart can accomplish it brings security and wellbeing to people throughout an entire nationThis is why the Buddha teaches us to develop inner goodness by meditating on good willBut you have to be earnest in really doing it if you want to get real resultsEven if its only for a short time  the wiggle of an elephants ears or the flicker of a snakes tongue  it can give rise to amazing power like the power of an elephant or a snake in being able to kill off people or other animals in the twinkling of an eyeBut if youre not truly earnest in what you do the power of truth wont appear in the mind and you wont be able to use it to get any results  like the ear of a dog or a cat It can wiggle all day long and yet it wont cause anyone any fearWith an elephant though all it has to do is wiggle his ears just once and people trip all over themselves trying to run away so fast that their legs practically fall offOr a cobra all it has to do is wiggle its tongue once and people fall over in a faintThe power of the minds true earnestness has the same sort of potencyThe worldly crown of a king embellished with all the nine auspicious gems even though its dazzling and priceless is still no match for a meditators Dhammacrown embellished with the Buddha Gem the Dhamma Gem and the Sangha GemIf we let evil come flowing into the heart goodness will have no chance to come in and take chargeEvil will seize power and take control while goodness will have to go running out to stand shivering outside the wallsTranslators note This talk is unusual in that we have two reconstructions of it a longer one by Mae Chii Arun Abhivanna and a shorter one by an unknown handComparing the two reconstructions is a sobering experience giving a hint of what can sometimes get lost in the process of reconstructing a talkStill we owe a great deal to those who went to the trouble of taking notes while Ajaan Lee explained the DhammaWithout them we would have nothing of his spoken teachings at allSome passages in II have already been translated in Food for Thought and The Skill of ReleasePutting them in the context of the original talk shows how they function in Ajaan Lees teaching styleAs Ajaan Fuang one of his students once said Ajaan Lee could talk on three levels at onceThis talk has a little something for everyonePleasure and purity mean two different thingsTheyre not one and the samePleasure is the physical and mental ease that comes from material objects but its not purity because the mind is still soaked and saturated with various preoccupations which defile itAs for purity thats a kind of pleasure independent of material objectsIts a pleasure that comes from the stillness and ease of the mindPleasure is a lower form of goodnessIts mundanePurity is a higher form of goodness the transcendentIn concentration practice Right Effort is a supporting factor while Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration are supervising factorsThese two types of factors are the basic principles of tranquillityTheyre the factors that oversee and protect the mind from falling into Wrong ConcentrationSome people say that tranquillity and insight are two separate things but actually theyre one and the sameTranquillity gives rise to insightInsight gives rise to purityAnd so purity comes this plain old stillness of mindWhat can we do to reach purityFor the mind to become pure we have to train itIf you were to say its easy its easyIf you were to say its hard its hardIf youre true in what you do youll get results easilyIf you arent the results will be hardTranquillity is like a lit candleIf its well protected from the wind the flame will stand straight and give off a bright lightYoull be able to see anything clearlyIf the candle tips over the flame will go out and youll have to grope around with your handsYou may mistake a cat for a dog or a dog for a cat because you cant see clearlyIn the same way we have to make an effort to use mindfulness to protect the mind from the windDont let the Hindrances blow in and overcome the mindPleasure and the goodness of purity are two separate things not one and the samePleasure is the physical and mental ease that comes from ordinary things eating living and sleeping comfortably without any illness having plenty of wealth at your disposal and so forthAs for the goodness of purity that comes from a pleasure apart from the ordinaryIt comes from your own mind without having to depend on the support of external thingsThis kind of pleasure takes its support from the DhammaAnd when it arises its stable unchanging and lastingAs for ordinary pleasure its undependableIt tends by and large to leave people disappointedThis is why weve come to look for pleasure in the area of the Dhamma which is a pleasure that wont let us downThe Dhamma is like the thatch or tiles that people put on their roofs to protect them from the sun and rainWhen people are born into the world its as if theyre left out in the open without any shelterTheyre sure to suffer from the sun and rain and stormy windsOnly if they have the Dhamma ensconced in their hearts will they escape from these dangersThis is why were taught to find shelter for the heart  ie the Dhamma  to give us protectionThe Dhamma here is virtue concentration and discernmentThere are four types of virtue restraint of the senses restraint in terms of the Patimokkha purity of livelihood and contemplation of the requisitesThese four types of virtue are like walls on all four sides which will protect us from stormy windsConcentration  the four levels of jhana  is like a foursided roof that will protect us from the sun and rainDiscernment  transcendent discernment  is like a solid floor that will protect us from the danger of falling into the states of deprivationWhen youve provided yourself with these three types of protection you have a sense of security and dont have to fear any of the sufferings that might come in this world or the nextThe precepts are shelter for the body concentration is shelter for the mindThis shelter for the mind is composed of tranquillity and insightTranquillity means making the mind quiet and firm free from the HindrancesInsight means using your discernment to investigate the causes and effects of all fabricated things within you so that you can see their truth to the point where you can let go of defilements level by levelWhen you can let go of them all your mind will gain release from mental fermentations reaching the goodness of puritySome people say that tranquillity and insight are two separate things but actually theyre one and the sameTranquillity is making the mind stillWhen the mind is still it gives rise to a glowAs the glow gets brighter and brighter it turns into the light of insightWhen insight arises you enter into the goodness of purityAnd so this goodness this purity comes from tranquillity this plain old stillness of mindThe mind that isnt still is the mind that doesnt stay with the bodyWhen this happens youll meet with nothing but suffering and defilementIts like a house in which no one is living its bound to get dusty and messyYou dont have to look very far for an example take this meditation hall were sitting inSuppose all the monks novices and lay people were to go off and leave it for just a dayOn your return youd see that it was covered with dust and cobwebs simply from having no one to do the sweeping and dustingIn the same way when the mind goes off and leaves the body both the body and mind get dusty and defiledAnd when the body is dusty how can the mind stay with itIts like a dusty dirty house the owners cant live there and nobody else can eitherMonks wont want to visit themSuppose you lay people were to invite me into your homeIf your home were messy and filthy filled with chicken droppings and duck droppings I wouldnt want to go in I wouldnt want to sit down Id scarcely be able to breatheSo keep this comparison in mind if the mind doesnt have concentration isnt developing skillful qualities its like a filthy houseWhere would you find monks who would like to visit your house when its like thatAnd when monks wont visit you where will you gain any blessingsWhen the mind is outside of the body its the worldWhen its inside the body its DhammaIf its the world it has to be as hot as fireIf its Dhamma its as cooling as waterSkillfulness on the sensual plane is goodness on the conventional social levelIt has to involve people and things outsideTranscendent skillfulness is goodness above and beyond the social level you learn to depend on yourself and can handle your problems on your ownThe mind of an ordinary person can go forward and back and so its not dependableSometimes after winning it turns around and losesIt wins today and loses tomorrowAs for the mind of a noble disciple when it wins it doesnt then loseIt goes forward and doesnt slide backIt keeps forging straight aheadWhen the mind is undependable when it doesnt have firm principles its a Communist mind ie one without any religionA mind with a religion has to have principles so that it can depend on itselfIts a mind that can be its own personWhen the mind isnt its own person it doesnt have complete authorityIt cant give orders or exercise complete control over anythingFor instance if you order the body to come and listen to a Dhamma talk it wont be willing to comeIf you order it to sit in concentration it wont be willing to sitLike being a parent only if youre the childs parent  will you have full authority over itIf youre just  its parent and its  your child you cant exercise full control with any confidenceSo the mind is like a parent the body like a childThats why we have to train the mind to be its own person so that we can have full control over the bodyWhen the mind has full control we can overcome any pains that arise from the body and any defilements that arise from the mindThats when you can say that youre really your own personEach of us is like a longplaying recordWhen we do good that goodness gets recorded within usWhen we do bad that badness gets recorded within us  just like a record thats been used to record good and bad soundsWhatever type of kamma we do it stays within us  it doesnt go off anywhere elseSo ask yourself whether you want to keep goodness or badness within youThe mind is neither good nor bad but its what knows good and knows badIts what does good and does badAnd its what lets go of good and lets go of whats badThe body is something that wears down and disintegrates into nothingThe mind is something that doesnt disintegrate doesnt dieSo were like a rice grain with one part that takes birth and another that doesnt take birthThe part that doesnt take birth is the plain rice flourThe part that takes birth is the white spot on its tipIf we dont want that rice grain to take birth as a plant all we have to do is demolish the little white spot and it wont be able to sproutThe same with us the body is like the plain rice flour the mind the little white spot that sproutsIf the mind contains defilements  its attachments to good and bad  without demolishing them it will cause us to sprout in new planes of being and birthThis is why were taught to let go of our attachments to good and bad to put them both downWhen the mind has nothing more to sprout it can then gain release from birth and deathWhen the mind leaves the body at death it vanishes in the same way that an extinguished candle flame doesnt have a shape for our physical eyes to seeBut that doesnt mean that flame fire has disappeared from the worldIt simply gets diffused into its property like the fire of electricity in a copper wireIf we simply look at the wire we wont see any fire in itBut if we touch it with our hand well immediately feel the heatIn the same way when the mind leaves the body it reappears in other places just like the fire that diffuses into its propertyTo hold onto the body is to hold onto old kammaTo let go of the body is to let go of old kammaAnd when we can let go in this way there will be no more kamma in the bodyIts the same as with a piece of propertyIf we take possession of it with a deed and the boundaries staked out there tend to be problems with trespassing swindling boundary disputes and cases in courtBut if we dont take possession of it and simply let it be public property there will be no troubles or quarrelsThis way the heart can be at its easeThe body is like a boat the river is our skillful intentionsMindfulness is the wind that moves us alongThe defilements are like sand barsIf you develop mindfulness at all times youll be able to take your bodyboat to the other shore without running aground on the sandDefilements are like sand bars or stumps in a river that will keep our boat from getting to shoreIn other words passion is something that snags us anger is something that bumps into us and delusion is something that makes us spin around and sinkTheres a story they tell of two men who were hired to row a boat along the rivers and canals to sell plowshares shovels and hoesIf they sold all the wares in the boat their employer would give them their full wages of one kahapana which was equal to about four dollars a dayThe first day their employer went out with them and they sold all their waresAfter that he didnt go with them so the two of them went out to sell their wares on their ownOne day as they were out rowing along calling out Plowshares shovels and hoes their minds wandered and they started getting drowsyAll of a sudden they crashed smack into a stump and ran aground on a sandbarEven after they got free they were so shaken up that instead of calling out Plowshares shovels and hoes they started calling out Sandbars and stumpsSandbars and stumps all along the river but nobody wanted to buyWhen evening came they rowed back to their employers house their boat still full of plowshares shovels and hoesThey hadnt been able to sell a thingSo the employer gave them each only a dollar for their days wagesOne of the men took the money back to his wife who was surprised to see that she was getting only one dollar instead of the usual fourMaybe hes given the rest of the money to another woman she thought so she gave him a piece of her mindNo matter how much he tried to explain things she wouldnt listenSo he told her to go ask the employerIf what he said wasnt true hed be willing to let her hit him once on the headThe wife impatient because she was so angry said No let me hit you first and then Ill go ask As she said this she reached for a shovel handle but all she could grab was the stick they used to drive the dog out of the house so she used that to bash her husband three times on the headLater of course she found out the truth but by that time it was too late for the husband had already gotten three free hits on the headThis story shows the harm that can come from not being mindfulIf you let your mind wander away from what youre doing you can end up getting yourself into troubleIf we were to make a comparison the man at the prow of the boat stands for the monksThe man at the tail of the boat stands for the lay peopleThe stumps are passion aversion and delusion while the sandbar is the HindrancesIf were not careful to be mindful if we let our minds get entangled in defilements and covered with the five Hindrances our Dhamma practice will have a hard time succeedingSkillfulness on the sensual plane is like a truck running along a road or a boat running along a river but in either case its not as good as a truck stopped still at a warehouse or a boat stopped still at a dockNow there are benefits that come when a truck runs along a road or a boat runs along a riverIt can carry freight or passengersIt can collect fare from the passengers or shipping charges for the freightBut when our truck stops at the warehouse or our boat stops at the dock we get greater benefits many times overWe get time to rest our weary bonesWe get to unload all our old freight and pick up new freightIf we keep stopping at the same dock often enough well get more and more familiar with the person who runs the dock and the people native to the areaUltimately well get so that theyll share food with us without our having to pay for our dinner or let us spend the night without having to pay for our roomThis is because we get more intimate and familiar with one another so that they come to like usUltimately theyll trust us so much that we can share the same bedWhen this happens we may get to ask them their family secrets how many wives and children they have how they make their money where they keep the family treasuresTheyll tell us everythingIn the same way if our mind stops running after its preoccupations and stays still at its dock  the body  well reap the same three kinds of benefitsThe mind will get to rest and recover from its wearinessIt will pick up a sense of peace pleasure and easeIt will become more familiar and intimate with the four properties which are like the natives in this areaWell come to know thoroughly the workings of the body and mindWhen we stay with the earth property well know the affairs of the earth propertyWhen we stay with the water property well know the affairs of the water propertyWhen we stay with the wind property well know the affairs of the wind propertyWhen we stay with the fire property well know the affairs of the fire propertyWell give rise to the three and the eight cognitive skillsWell know all the affairs of the body to the point where we have no more doubtsThat will enable us to let the body goKnowing in line with labels in line with books or with what people say is imitation knowing not the real thingIts like the shadow of knowingReal knowing is the knowing that arises within yourselfIts paccattam entirely personalIts the kind of knowing that cant be taught and cant be toldIt has to arise within youOnly then will you know whats inconstant stressful and notself and whats constant easeful and selfChangeoflineage knowledge sees both sides and lets go of bothThe truth of the Dhamma is Dhammathiti the aspect of mind that stays in place without changingThe movements and characteristics of the mind are simply shadows or imitations of knowingIn practicing the Dhamma you want true knowingIf you dont really practice youll meet up only with the shadows of the DhammaFor this reason we should practice so that true knowing will appear within usThis body of ours has parts that are constant and those that are inconstant both ease and stress both self and notselfFor example the properties of earth water wind and fire are constant in that theyve never turned into anything elseThe earth property has never turned into water the water property has never turned into wind the wind property has never turned into fireWhatever theyve been since the beginning of the world thats what theyll be until the world falls to piecesTake water as an example even if people freeze it until its hard or put green yellow or red dye into it itll still be water just the sameTheres even a constant aspect to the parts of our body our hand has never turned into a foot our arm has never turned into a leg our eye has never turned into an ear our lower lip has never pushed its way up to being the upper lipThese are the aspects that are constant and selfAs for the inconstant parts those are just the characteristics of these things not what they really areThe properties of earth water wind and fire are like four peopleIf you keep trying to acquaint yourself with them after a while theyll become your friendsIn the beginning they arent too familiar with you they dont trust you so theyll want to test you firstFor instance when you start sitting in meditation theyll take a stick and poke you in your legs and shins so that your legs hurt or grow numbIf you lie down theyll poke you in the backIf you lie on your side theyll poke you in the waistIf you get up and sit again theyll test you againOr they may whisper to you to give upIf you give in to them the King of Death will grin until his cheeks hurtWhat you have to do is smile against the odds and endure everything to the end pointKeep talking with all four propertiesEven though they dont respond at first you have to keep talking with them asking them this and thatAfter a while theyll give you a oneword answerSo you keep talking and then their answers will start getting longer until you eventually become acquaintances and can have real conversationsFrom that point they become your intimates and friendsTheyll love you and help you and tell you their secretsYoull be a person with friends and wont have to be lonelyYoull eat together sleep together and wherever you go youll go togetherYoull feel secureNo matter how long you sit you wont acheNo matter how long you walk you wont feel tired  because you have friends to talk with as you walk along so that you enjoy yourself and reach your destination before you realize itThis is why were taught to practice meditation by keeping mindfulness immersed firmly in the bodyUse directed thought and evaluation with your meditation themes  body feelings mind and mental qualities  without letting your mind wander astray in outside thoughts and preoccupationsContemplate the body so as to know how all four properties are getting along where it feels pleasant painful or neutralNotice how the mind moves around in the various things you know until you reach the mental quality thats still solid and trueThis way its like having friends go with you wherever you go and whatever you doIn other words when the body walks the mind walks with itWhen the body lies down the mind lies down with itWhen the body sits the mind sits with itWherever the body stops the mind stops tooBut most of us arent like thisThe body takes two steps but the mind takes four or five  so how can it not get tiredThe body lies in a mosquito net surrounded by a railing and seven thick walls but the mind can still go running outside the houseWhen this is the case where will it get any happinessIf it doesnt stay in its house itll have to wander around exposed to the sun wind rain and all sorts of dangers because it has no roof no protectionIf theres no concentration to act as a shelter for the heart itll always have to meet with misery and painFor this reason you should train your heart to stay firm in concentration and to develop full authority within yourself so that you can be your own personThis way youll be bound to meet with the goodness of purity as mentioned aboveWhile we meditate here on the word buddho we have to make up our minds that were going to stay right here with someone venerable in the same way that wed be a monks attendantWell follow after him and watch out for him and not run off anywhere elseIf we abandon our monk hes going to abandon us and well be put to all sorts of hardshipsAs for the monk hell be put to hardships as well as in the story they tellOnce in the time of the Buddha there was a rich moneylender couple who had been married a long time but without any childrenBoth of them really wanted a son who could carry on the family line and receive their inheritanceSo they talked the matter over and decided to invite a monk to their home to inform him of their predicament to see if he could use his meditative powers to help intercede with the devas so that they could have a childWhen they had made their decision they told one of their male servants to go into a nearby forest to invite a meditating monk to come have a meal in their homeThe next morning before dawn the servant got ready to go into the forest to a hut where a meditating monk had taken up residenceNow this servant had once been a hunter and still had all his old hunting instinctsHe had even kept his crossbow and arrows and other hunting equipment and maintained them in good shapeWhen his master had sent him to invite the monk which would require going into the forest he was happy to go for it would give him a chance to do a little hunting on the sideSo he snuck his crossbow and arrows out of the house under his shirtWhen he got halfway to the monks hut he realized that it wouldnt be proper to approach a monk while armed so he decided to hide his weapons on the side of the pathOn the way back hed be able to pick them upSo he stashed the crossbow and arrows behind a bush near the pathThen he went on his way emptyhanded until he came across an old monk sitting in front of a hutAfter bowing down to the monk he said to him Venerable sir my master the moneylender and his wife have asked me to come invite you to a meal in their house this morning and have told me to take you thereWould you please be so kind as to accept their invitationThe old monk on hearing this decided to acceptNow it so happened that he didnt have an attendant of his own so he had the servant carry his bowl and shoulder bagThen he picked up his cane and headed out in unsteady steps toward the moneylenders houseAs they walked along he asked the servant Where is your masters houseHow far is it from hereHow do you get there The servant answered all his questionsAfter they had walked on a little further the servant remembered the crossbow and arrows hidden behind the bush on the side of the pathThe thought occurred to him that hed like to abandon the old monk pick up his weapons and sneak off to do a little hunting in the forestAfter all he told himself he had already given explicit directions to the old monk so hed be able to find his way on his ownThen he came up with a planHe told the old monk Ive got to go to the bathroom really bad so let me head into the woods for a momentYou can walk on aheadWhen Im finished Ill catch up with youThe old monk wasnt the least bit suspicious and thought that the servant was telling the truth so he let the servant go off while he hurried on ahead afraid that it was getting late and that he wouldnt get to the moneylenders house in time for his mealAs for the servant he turned off the path and headed for the bush where he had hidden his crossbow and arrowsBut before he got there one of the forest devas decided to test his loyalty to the old monkSo the deva metamorphosed himself into a large golden swan and pretended to have a broken wing flying an erratic course under the trees near the path the servant was followingThe servant heard the sound of a bird flapping its wings  flipflap flipflap  and looking up saw an enormous golden swan zigzagging back and forth looking like it couldnt get awaySeeing this he got really excited thinking that hed have to shoot this bird for food for sureIn his excitement he forgot that he was carrying the monks bowl and shoulder bag and thought instead that he had a quiver strapped to his back and a crossbow on his shoulderSo he reached into the shoulder bag and pulled out the old monks betel nut crusher about two feet long and took aim with it as if it were a crossbow or a rifleThen he took his stance and pulled back on the crusher at the same time making the sound of a gun firing byng byng byngBut of course he never hit the bird at allAs for the old monk after walking on a ways he began to forget the servants directions so he turned left and right right and wrong and couldnt find his way out of the forestHe looked back over his shoulder to see if the servant was catching up with him but the servant never cameAll he could hear was the sound  byng byng byng  echoing through the forest but no matter how much he called out there was never any answerThe later it got the hotter the sun and the more tired and hungry he got  for after all he was very old  so he made up his mind to turn around and retrace his steps staggering back to his hutMeanwhile the servant  exhausted from trying to shoot the golden swan without success  was ready to give upSo the deva seeing that he had had enough fun with the servant pretended to be shot and fell down panting heavily on the path a little ways aheadThrilled the servant came running up to pick up the bird but just as he bent over to grasp hold of it it disappeared in a flashThis startled the servant and suddenly it dawned on him that some forest spirit had been deceiving himThats when he remembered the old monkSo in his panic he dropped the bowl and shoulder bag and ran away with his arms flailing all the while calling out to the monk Help meHelp me But the monk was nowhere to be foundSo the servant hurried straight home and told his master everything that had happenedThe moneylender was so furious that he punished the servant by making him sleep outside the walls of the house compound and go without food for three daysOn top of that he cut back his daily wageThis story shows the hardships that come when a person isnt loyal to his monk when he runs away from his responsibilities and abandons his monkHe causes all sorts of problems for himself and for others as wellThe old monk had to go without food for a dayHaving lost his bowl shoulder bag and betel nut crusher he was forced to search for new requisitesAs for the moneylender and his wife they didnt get the things they had hoped forWhen you apply this story to the Dhamma it becomes a lesson worth rememberingIf youre not loyal to your meditation object or to yourself if you forget the breath youre meditating on with buddho buddho and let your mind go wandering off in thoughts and concepts its as if youve abandoned the monk youre supposed to look afterYou dont follow him you dont act the role of his student as you had intended toThe results that you had hoped for will thus get ruinedIn other words your mind wont get established in concentrationAll kinds of hardships  the five Hindrances  will come flowing into the heart and no peace will appearThis causes you to suffer and to miss out on the good results that you should have achievedAt the same time you cause hardships to others  ie the monk sitting up here giving you a Dhamma talkHe wastes his time talking for hours until his rear end hurtsInstead of lying around his hut at his leisure he has to sit here jabbering away with no results to show for it at allSo keep this story in mind as a lesson in teaching yourself to be intent in doing whats goodDont be the sort of person who  like the servant in the story  is disloyal to his monkTheres another story to illustrate the good things that come from being loyal to your monk which Ill tell to you nowOnce there was a moneylender couple who had a large mansion in the city of VaranasiBoth husband and wife were avid meritmakersEvery year during the Rains retreat they would invite a monk to have his meal in their home each day for the entire three monthsNow the moneylender couple had a slave couple working in their householdThe duty of the slave woman was to pound the rice and separate it into various gradesThe highest grade rice was for giving the monk as almsThe second grade rice was for the moneylender couple to eatThe third grade rice was for the servants in the household and the fourth grade  the lowest grade rice mixed with bran  was for the slave couple to eat themselvesAs for the slave womans husband his primary duty was to cut firewood in the forest and make the fire for cooking the riceHis secondary duty was to wait at the mansion gate each morning to welcome the monk who would come for the meal and to carry his bowl and shoulder bag up to the house for himAnd if I remember rightly the monk who was invited for the meal that year was a Private BuddhaAt any rate when the monk had finished his meal the slave would carry his bowl and bag from the front door of the house back out to the mansion gateAs he performed this duty every day the slave came to develop a strong affection for the monkAnd the monk felt compassion for the slaveIf he had any fruits or other delicacies left from his meal he would always share them with the slaveThis made the slave feel an even greater loyalty toward the monk  to the point where the moneylender couple allowed him to enter the house as the monks attendantOne day the slave got to follow the monk all the way into the dining roomBefore reaching the dining room he passed the bedroom the parlor and the moneylenders private dining roomHe got to see all the many beautiful and expensive things decorating the moneylender couples homeOn the way out after the meal he happened to see the moneylenders favorite dog  a male  eating food from a dish near the door to the dining roomHe couldnt help noticing that the dogs food was fine rice with curries and that the dish was made of silverHe thought to himself Look at all the merit this dog hasIt gets to live in the house and doesnt have to run around looking for food on the ground outside like other dogsWhen the time comes someone fixes food for it to eat and the food looks so deliciousThe rice is a higher grade than what my wife and I get to eatAnd its dish is a fine one made of silverIf only I could be reborn as a moneylenders dog just think of how happy Id beAfter he had accompanied the monk to the mansion gate he went back to his shack and told his wife about all the things he had seen in the moneylenders house and especially about the dog eating high grade rice and curries from a silver dishThen he added Neither you nor I have any real happiness or ease in our livesYoure exhausted every day from having to pound the riceAs for me I have to slash through the forest to find firewood and to make the fire for cooking the rice for everyone in the householdBut all we get to eat is the lowest grade rice mixed with branWe shouldnt have been born as human beingsIf only we could be reborn like that moneylenders dog From that day on the memory of the moneylenders dog kept occupying his thoughtsAt the same time though he still remained loyal to the monkBut just a few days later he had an attack of horrible cramps and diedAfter he stopped breathing his spirit didnt go off anywhere but kept hovering around the moneylenders house  both because it was still fixated on the dog and because it felt attached to the monkEvery morning it would follow the monk in and out of the houseOne day after offering the monk his meal the moneylender couple presented him with many additional offeringsWhen he had finished eating he carried all the offerings out the door where the dog was lying on guardSeeing the monk with his arms all full of things the dog thought that he had stolen them from the moneylender coupleSo it rushed at him and started to barkThe spirit of the slave hovering behind the monk slipped right into the dogs open mouth and into its stomach  and then couldnt get outSo now it was stuckIt couldnt follow the monk in and out of the house as it had every morningInstead it could only stir around restlessly in the dogs stomach which of course had an effect on the dogs behaviorIt couldnt lie still and kept getting into places it didnt belongThe moneylender couple noticed it acting abnormally and mystified had one of their servants put it outside in a pen with the other dogs of the householdBefore too long the dog mated with a female and the female became pregnantAnd so now the slave was reborn as a puppy in the females wombWhile it was in the womb it still wanted to follow the monk in and out of the house but it couldnt get outAll it could do was thrash around in its mothers womb causing her all sorts of misery and painWhen her time came the female finally gave birth to a male puppy much larger and stronger than normalThis was because the puppys consciousness had such a strong desire to get out and see the monk all alongAs soon as it was born it opened its eyes wide and started to run  because actually it had been running ever since its time in the wombSo the next morning when it saw the Private Buddha come to the mansion gate it was overjoyedIt ran up and jumped all over him grabbing his shoulder bag from his hand and running after him all the way into the dining room in the moneylenders houseThis amazed the moneylender couple and made them feel strong affection for itThe next morning happened to be the last day of the Rains retreat which was the final day of the monks invitation to eat in the moneylender couples homeSo before leaving the house after he had finished his meal the monk said to the moneylender couple Because today is the last day of your invitation I would like to give you my blessing and take my leave to return to the seclusion of my hermitage in the forest Then he turned to the puppy Tomorrow I wont be coming to your masters home any more now so I want you to stay here and guard your masters with loyaltyDont follow me out into the forest okayWhen the puppy heard the Private Buddha say this it was so heartbroken that it dropped dead on the spotThrough the power of its love and loyalty for the Private Buddha it was reborn as a devas son in heaven with a large following and many divine treasuresHis palace was more lovely than that of anyone elses his looks more handsome than any other devas son in heavenHis voice was alluring his fragrance like that of flowersAny female deva who heard his voice or smelled his fragrance wanted to see himOn seeing him she would want him as her mateAll of this was the result of the goodness of the slaves sincere loyalty to the Private BuddhaThe only bad part of his story was that moment he got fixated on the moneylenders dog which was why he had to spend one lifetime as a puppyBut because the good kamma of his mind was stronger it was able to wipe out the kamma of his animal birth and take him to heavenThis story is another example that you should take to heart in your practice of training the mindYou have to be very very carefulDont let any Hindrances come in and take over your mind while youre practicing concentrationDont let your monk run away from you and dont you abandon your monk to go running after dogsIf your mind doesnt stay with your monk  ie the factors of your meditation  all sorts of troubles will result as in the stories Ive told you hereAs for the goodness that comes from keeping track of your monk it will send you to good states of becoming and birth and will raise your mind ultimately to the level of the transcendentWrong concentration is concentration lacking mindfulness and alertnessWrong release is when you get beyond distractions by falling asleepAnother form of wrong concentration is when you lose track of your breath and your bodyAnother form is when you dont lose track of them but you get deluded  as when you get fixated on signs or light and assume yourself to have gained some special attainmentYou fall for these things and hold onto them as being trustworthy and trueIn this way they turn into the corruptions of insight and all sorts of skewed perceptionsA pure mind is one that has grown dispassionate to thoughts of past and future and has no hankering for any sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations or ideas at allThe goodness weve been developing here dont forget itIts bound to bear fruitDont underestimate it thinking that the little things weve been doing here wont bear much fruitDont underestimate it at allThere are examples from the time of the BuddhaSome of the monks and novices after ordaining werent able to cut through their defilementsThey were only able to thin them out a bit so they got discouraged and disrobedAfter disrobing they had to find a livelihood sometimes in ways that were honest sometimes in ways that were notThose who got involved in dishonest ways were caught by the civil authorities and imprisonedOne example was a student of SariputtaHe ordained to develop his goodness but when he didnt get the results he had hoped for he disrobed and became a thiefAfter a while he was caught and sentenced to deathBefore he was to be executed the civil authorities decided to torture him for seven days as an example to the general public so as to discourage other people from breaking the lawThe king ordered his officials to sharpen some wood and iron spears to a superfine point to plant them in rows and then to have the thief sit and lie on the spear points so that they would skewer his body causing him to be bathed in blood and to experience excruciating painThey would do this three times a day  morning noon and evening  calling the people of the city to come and see an example of how thieves have to sufferThe plan was to have the thief tortured like this for seven days and then to behead him but the thief still had some good karma left over from the time he had studied with SariputtaSariputta had taught him to follow some of the ascetic practices and to meditate and he had been able to develop his mind to the level of the first jhanaBut the first jhana wasnt enough to withstand his defilements and cravings which is why he had disrobedIt so happened that on the sixth day Sariputta through his great compassion  after all there were times when he in the Buddhas stead had helped teach the populace to practice the Dhamma  used the powers of his meditation to check up on his students who were still ordained as well as those who had disrobed to return to the lay life to see where they were and how they were doingBecause of the goodness that the thief had developed with Sariputta a light appeared to Sariputta in which he saw that his student was being tortured and was scheduled to be beheaded the next dayOn seeing this Sariputta contemplated the students reserves of goodness seeing that he still had some potential but that it had all witheredEven so some of the goodness he had developed was still buried there inside himEven though defilements had enwrapped his heart there was still some goodness thereOn realizing this Sariputta went on his almsround in the early morning to the area where his student was being torturedHis student was lying on his bed of spears as Sariputta came nearThe place was thronged with people running around in excitement some of them excited about seeing Sariputta some of them excited about seeing the thief being torturedIt so happened that the crowd parted briefly enough for Sariputtas student to see the edge of his teachers robeSariputta spread thoughts of good will which the student could feel and which served as a guarantee of his presence but that was as close as he could getOn seeing Sariputta the student felt overjoyed thinking Tomorrow Im going to have to take my leave of my teacher  Im going to be executed At the thought of bowing down to his teacher he remembered Sariputtas meditation instructions and so he started to practice jhana stilling his mind in concentrationWhen his mind grew still he reflected on death thinking Tomorrow theyre going to get me for sureTheres no doubt about that So he reflected further Where is deathWhere does death happen And he came to the realization that death lies at the end of your nose If the breath stops thats itBut as long as youre still breathing then even if youre being brutally tortured youre not deadSo he started to practice mindfulness of breathingAs soon as he got focused on the breath the breath grew absolutely still and his blood stopped flowing from his woundsWhen the blood stopped flowing his wounds closed up and healedWhen his wounds were healed he felt a sense of rapture and joy over how much his meditation had been able to overcome the painSo he surveyed the parts of his body  hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin  back and forth over and over again until all the severed parts of his body connected back up againWhen the parts of his body gained strength like this he was able to sit up in full lotus on the tips of the spears and to enter into jhana the first jhana the second the third and the fourthOn entering into the fourth jhana his body became as light as a tuft of cotton and stronger than the wood and iron spearsThe tips of the spears couldnt penetrate his body any moreFinally his mind entered fixed penetration and he made a vow If I escape with my life Im going back to live with my teacher He focused his mind in the fourth jhana with its two factorsThe first was singleness of preoccupation not involved with anything at all the thought that they were going to execute him had disappeared completelyThe second factor was mindfulness bright and dazzlingAnd in that light of mindfulness he was able to see his teacherSo he made another determination Im going to go stay with my teacher As soon as he made this determination his body levitated up into the air and went to where Sariputta wasAfter rejoining his teacher he vowed he would never do anything evil ever againSo he practiced meditation and came out of the whole affair aliveHe didnt become an arahant or anything but he did come out aliveThis goes to show that even though the goodness we develop doesnt meet with our expectations right away we shouldnt underestimate itGoodness is like fireYou shouldnt underestimate fire for a single match can destroy an entire cityGoodness has power in just the same wayThis is why the Buddha taught us not to underestimate the goodness we developEven though it seems to be just a tiny bit it has the power to ward off unfortunate events to turn heavy into light and to keep us safe and secureThis is one point to rememberAnother point is that people are like plantsSay that you plant some squash seeds in the ground You want the seeds to grow and give you squash right away but they cant do thatStill the nature of what youve planted will grow bit by bit and after a while will give you the squash you wantBut if you sit there and watch it to see how much the squash plant grows in a day an hour a minute to see how many centimeters the shoot will grow can you measure itNo of course notBut do you believe that its growing every daySureIf it werent growing how would it get so long over timeThe same holds true with however much or little goodness we develop Even though we dont see the results right away theyre sure to comeYou cant measure how much good youve done in a day or how much goodness has resulted from your actions in a day but if you ask whether there are results you have to answer YesIts like the squash plant You cant see it growing but you know that it growsEven though the goodness youve been doing doesnt seem to be developing you shouldnt underestimate itAnother point is that some people are like banana treesThe nature of banana trees is that if you cut them off at the trunk and then come back in an hour youll see that a new shoot has grown a whole inch from the topIn two or three days the shoot will have grown a foot or twoSome people are like thisThey get fast results extraordinary results and develop all kinds of abilitiesFor example they can get quickly into jhana and then clearly explain what theyve experienced to other peopleThe same thing happened in the time of the BuddhaTake Culapanthaka for example He had worked at developing goodness for a long time but when he finally got the hang of the meditation practicing with a sense of wounded pride after being scorned by his friends he got results right awayThe story is this Once when he was staying with a group of monks headed by the Buddha a moneylender invited the whole group for a meal at his homeCulapanthakas older brother Mahapanthaka was the meal distributorWhoever came with an invitation it was Mahapanthakas duty to inform the other monksNow Mahapanthaka was ashamed of his younger brother for being so lazy and torpid in his meditation nodding off all the timeSo thinking that Culapanthaka didnt deserve to eat food in anyones home Mahapanthaka decided not to include him in the invitationHe invited only the remaining monks headed by the Buddha to go to the moneylenders mealWhen the group arrived at the moneylenders home and all the monks were served one tray of food was left overSo the moneylender asked Mahapanthaka why the monks didnt number the full he had asked for Mahapanthaka informed him that Culapanthaka hadnt been included in the invitationThe moneylender then went to the BuddhaThe Buddha knowing that Culapanthaka was meditating back at the monastery told the moneylender that Culapanthaka was an important monk The moneylender would have to send one of his servants to invite him to the mealBut because the Buddha wanted the moneylender to see the powers Culapanthaka had developed he didnt explain how to go about making the invitationHe let the moneylenders servant go to see for himself only then would he explainAs for Culapanthaka his pride had been so wounded that he decided to go without food and to sit in meditation that dayIt so happened that he entered the fourth jhana Never since the day of his birth had his meditation progressed so farOn reaching the fourth jhana he entered the fifth making his mind clear bright and blooming and giving rise to supernormal strengths both in body and mindIt was at that point that the moneylenders servant arrived at the monasteryCulapanthaka saw him and made a mental determination causing monks  all of them images of himself  to fill the monasterySome were sitting in meditation some were doing walking meditation some were washing their robesThe servant went to ask one of the monks where Culapanthaka was and the monk pointed to another part of the monasteryHe went to that part of the monastery and asked one of the monks there who pointed to still another part of the monasteryThis kept up until the time for the meal was almost over and yet the servant couldnt locate Culapanthaka at allSo he ran back to the moneylenders houseThe Buddha at this point knew that Culapanthaka had perfected his psychic powers and from now on wouldnt be scorned by his friends so he told the servant to go back and make the invitation again but this time he told him how to do itHow was thatWhen the servant asked one of the monks where Culapanthaka was then as soon as the monk was about to open his mouth the servant should grab him by the arm before he had a chance to speakSo the servant did as he was toldHe went back to the monastery which was still filled with monks and asked one of the monks where Culapanthaka wasAs the monk started to point to another part of the monastery the servant grabbed hold of his armThe instant he grabbed the monk by the arm all the other monks in the monastery disappeared leaving only the monk he was holdingSo he invited that monk to the meal at the moneylenders homeFrom that point on Culapanthaka became one of the prominent monks of the Sangha with all sorts of extraordinary psychic abilitiesHe was able to stand in the sun without getting hot to walk in the rain without getting wet to travel great distances in no time at allHe could make himself appear in many places at once in forests cemeteries and other places as wellHe developed all kinds of powersAs a result he was able to get over his wounded pride from being scorned by his friends and instead became one of the more extraordinary of the Buddhas prominent disciplesThis is the power of goodnessSome people gain extraordinary powers and wideranging abilities mature in their concentration mature in their insight able to reach nibbana in this very lifeAll of this comes from the goodness the perfections theyve developedSo we should take pride in the goodness weve been developing tooTheres another story about an old woman who went to a monastery one day and saw that the walking meditation paths were dirtyShe swept the paths clear of the dirt and rubbish so that the monks could walk conveniently on the pathsShe did it only this once but she did it with an attitude of love an attitude of conviction an attitude of respect and a pure state of mindThe dirt and rubbish had made her feel dispirited so she swept it all away and set out water for washing the feet as a result her mind felt clean and refreshedSoon after she returned home she had a heart attackAfter she died she was reborn as a deva with a large following a palace divine food and all kinds of abundant wealthLiving in her palace she began to remember her previous life and thought to herself If I had done lots of merit Id be even richer than I am nowItd be good to go back and do good things for just a little bit longer so that I could get even more abundant results than what I have nowBefore I had no idea that goodness would give results like thisSo she left heaven and came down to earth prowling around in search of monks in the forest and wildernessShe came across one monk who was about to enter concentration so she stood there staring at him looking for a way to be of serviceBut when he saw her he chased her away What kind of deva is this trying to horn in on human beings meritBefore you underestimated merit but now that youve received good results you want even moreHow greedy can you getGo awayI wont let you do anythingLet human beings have a chance to do goodThere are lots of people who dont have any of the good things you doDont come horning in on their chance for goodnessChagrined the deva fled back up to heaven and had to content herself with the results she already hadShe had wanted to make more merit but they wouldnt let herWhy was thatWe human beings tend to underestimate little acts of merit but after you die its hard for you to make any more merit at allHow is it hardYour body is no longer like a human bodyYou cant talk with human beings at allYou cant even put food in monks bowlsThe best you can do is simply stand around rejoicing in the merit of othersOnly human beings with good eyes can see youThose without that kind of eye wont detect you at allIf you encounter those with the right mental powers they can teach you to some extentBut if you dont encounter that kind of person when youre a deva you have no way of developing any more goodnessSo you shouldnt underestimate the power of goodnessAs long as youve got the time and the opportunity then whenever you notice the chance to do goodness of which youre capable you should hurry up and make the effort trying to develop that goodness as soon as you canIf death were to come right now what would you have leftNothingAll you could do is wrap up the trail mix youve put aside  in other words the goodness youve done in the pastWhen you remember it that goodness will nourish your spirit helping you reach one of the good destinations in the heavenly worldsIf youve developed your mind in strong concentration youll be able to gain release from the range of worldliness and take your heart to the transcendentSo those of us who havent yet developed the goodness weve hoped for Dont underestimate what youve gotRegard what youve done as your wealthThis wealth of yours is what will prevent your life from falling into low placesAs long as you stay in this world you can depend on the good youve done to determine the course of your lifeIf you leave this world your goodness will follow you like a shadow at all timesHere Ive been talking about the goodness weve joined our hearts together in developing hereTake the advice Ive given and remember it as part of your recollection of the DhammaTranslators note This is one of Ajaan Lees few tape recorded talks dating from October just six months before he passed awayIn the talk he covers the eight classical forms of knowledge and skill that come from the practice of concentration discussing how they relate to the methods of science and other forms of worldly knowledgeThree of the knowledges toward the end of the list are barely touched on and the end of the talk is fairly abruptThis may have been due to the tapes running out for he had quite a lot to say on these knowledges in his other talks and writingsStill the heart of the talk  the role of thinking and notthinking in developing concentration and liberating insight  is discussed in considerable detail making this an extremely helpful guide to the how of concentration and insight practiceIm going to talk about knowledge  the highest level of knowledge not ordinary knowledgeOrdinary knowledge is adulterated with a lot of defilements and mental fermentations and so its called hethimavijja lower knowledgeLower knowledge is something everyone has Buddhist and nonBuddhist alike the various branches of worldly knowledge that people study from textbooks so as to run their societies and administer their nationsAnd then there are the special branches of knowledge the scientific ways of thinking that people use to invent all sorts of amazing contraptions for the human race  things like clairvoyance clairaudience and powers of levitationTheyve gotten to the point where these contraptions can work in place of peopleDuring the last war for instance I heard that they were able to drop bombs on other countries without sending people along with themWith a push of a button they could tell the missile where to go what to do and when it had finished the job to their satisfaction have it come back homeThis is whats called progress in worldly knowledge  or lokiya vijjaThis kind of knowledge is common all over the world and falls into the two sorts that Ive mentioned the sort that comes from studying books and the sort that comes from thinking things through or cintamayapaññaThis second kind of knowledge arises within the mind itselfPeople with a lot of education in the theoretical sciences work with their thinkingThey think to the point where an idea appears as a picture in the mind like an uggahanimittaWhen the picture appears in the mind they may sketch it down on paper and then experiment with physical objects to see if it worksIf it doesnt work they make adjustments creating a new idea from their old idea  adjusting it a bit here expanding it a bit there  keeping at it until they find what works in line with their aimsIf we think about this on a shallow level its really amazingBut if we think a little bit deeper its not so amazing at allThey take their starting point with something really simple for example how to make a small person large or a large person small  something really really simpleThen they take a mirror and bend it in so that a tall person will turn into a small personThey bend it out so that a small person will become tallThats all to begin withThen they keep thinking along these lines until they can take a faraway object and make it appear up closeThe people who get these things started tend to be military strategistsTheyre the ones who usually get these ideas firstAnother important branch of science is medicinePeople in both these branches have to think deeper than people in generalFor example people in ships out at sea got it into their heads that theyd like to see the ships approaching them from a distanceHow can we see themHow can we get their image to appear in our ship They worked on this idea until they succeededFirst they started out really simpleminded just like usSimpleminded in what wayThey thought like a mirror thats all nothing specialThey put a mirror up high on a mast and then had a series of mirrors pick up the image in the first mirror and send it on down into the shipThey didnt have to look in the first mirrorThey could look at a little tiny mirror down in the ship and see ships approaching from far awayThats all they used in the beginningAfter a while they made a single mirror in wavesWhen an image hit the top wave the next wave picked it up and sent it on down the waves of the mirror into the shipThey kept thinking about this until now no more They have radar a tiny little box that doesnt use a series of mirrors and doesnt use a mirror in waves but can still pull the image of a faraway ship and make it appear in your shipThis is how knowledge develops to a high level in the sciencesAs for medicine doctors these days are researching into how they can keep people from dyingLots of people are doing the research but no one has found the solutionNo matter how much research they do people are still dyingThey havent succeeded in making people live longer than their ordinary spanThis is another branch of knowledge that comes from thinking and not from textbooksAnd theres still another branch thats moving even further out but how far theyll get is hard to sayThese are the people who want to go and live on MarsIt must be really nice up thereBut the chances of their succeeding are smallWhy are they smallBecause the people arent really sincereAnd why arent they sincereBecause theyre still unsure and uncertainThe idea isnt really clear in their headsThis uncertainty is what gets in the way of successSo this is the second level of worldly knowledge the level that comes from thinking and ideas or cintamayapaññaBut in the final analysis neither of these two levels of knowledge can take us beyond suffering and stressTheyre the type of knowledge that creates bad kamma about percent of the timeOnly percent of the time do they actually benefit the human raceWhy only percentIf another war gets started total disasterThe kinds of knowledge that are really useful that give convenience to human transportation and communication are few and far betweenFor the most part worldly knowledge is aimed at massive killing at amassing power and influenceThats why it doesnt lead beyond suffering and stress doesnt lead beyond birth aging illness and deathTake for instance the countries at present that are clever in building all kinds of weaponsThey sell their weapons to other countries and sometimes those other countries use the weapons to kill people in the countries that built themThere are countries that cant build their own weapons yet they declare war on the countries who gave them military aidThats about as far as the results of worldly knowledge can take youThis is why the Buddha taught us a higher level of knowledge Dhamma knowledgeDhamma knowledge arises in two ways through thinking and through not thinkingThe first level of thinking is called appropriate attentionWhen we hear the Dhamma we have to use appropriate attention to consider things before were asked to believe themFor instance suppose we want to make meritWe simply hear the word merit and we want some but usually without stopping to think about what sorts of things are appropriate to give as donations and what sorts of people are appropriate to receive our meritorious offeringsYou have to consider things carefully consider yourself then consider the object you want to give and then consider the recipient of the object to see if all these things go togetherEven if they dont you can still go ahead and give the object of course but its best that you know what youre doing that youre not acting out of delusion not simply acting out of desireIf you want merit and simply act without giving appropriate attention to things youre lacking the kind of discernment that comes from thinking cintamayapaññaYou have to reflect on things on many levels if you want your act of meritmaking to lead to purityThis is called doing good based on discernmentThis is whats meant by kusala dhamma the quality of skillfulnessKusala dhamma is a name for discernment but we usually dont translate that way in ThaiWe think of kusala as just another word for meritActually kusala can be a noun and it can also be an adjectiveAs a noun it means the demeanor by which a person acts in good ways in body speech and mindAs an adjective it refers to this and that kind of act leading to this and that kind of purityWhen we apply it to discernment it means kusalopaya a skillful strategyWhen we do anything at all we have to use our discernment to consider things from every angle before we act so that our actions will give complete resultsThis is called having a skillful strategy for giving rise to goodness within ourselves in full purityThis is why the Buddha taught us to start out by using appropriate attention in considering things over and over around and around many timesOnly then  when things are really clear in the mind  should we actIts the nature of things that the more you walk back and forth on a path the more smooth it gets wornWhen the path gets worn really smooth you can see the door at the far endIf you walk back and forth many times the grass and weeds on the path all dieAnd knowledge arises you learn which plants growing on the side of the path can be eaten and which ones cantAs the path gets worn more and more smooth you gain all sorts of benefitsOne it doesnt hurt your feet to walk on itTwo you learn whats growing along the side of the path which plants can be eaten and what uses there are for the plants that cantYou might be able to make them into compostAs for the plants that can be eaten if theres more than enough for you to eat you can take whats left and sell it on the marketThese are called side benefitsIn addition when youre in a hurry you can run easily along the pathIf you need to rest it doesnt hurt to sit on itIf youre sleepy and the path is really smooth you can lie right down on itIf a snake or an enemy crosses your path you can run quickly in the other directionSo there are all sorts of good benefitsIn the same way when we plan to make merit or do anything skillfully we should think things over back and forth many many times before acting and well get good resultsThis is the first level of thinking called cintamayapaññaThe next level goes deeperIts called directed thought and evaluationThis level isnt said to be a part of cintamayapañña but its a similar sort of thing only with a differenceThats why it has to be given another name bhavanamayapañña the discernment that comes with meditationWhen you meditate you have to thinkIf you dont think you cant meditate because thinking forms a necessary part of meditationTake jhana for instanceUse your powers of directed thought to bring the mind to the object and your powers of evaluation to be discriminating in your choice of an objectExamine the object of your meditation until you see that its just right for youYou can choose slow breathing fast breathing short breathing long breathing narrow breathing broad breathing hot cool or warm breathing a breath that goes only as far as the nose a breath that goes only as far as the base of the throat a breath that goes all the way down to the heartWhen youve found an object that suits your taste catch hold of it and make the mind one focused on a single objectOnce youve done this evaluate your objectDirect your thoughts to making it stand outDont let the mind leave the objectDont let the object leave the mindTell yourself that its like eating Put the food in line with your mouth put your mouth in line with the foodDont missIf you miss and go sticking the food in your ear under your chin in your eye or on your forehead youll never get anywhere in your eatingSo it is with your meditationSometimes the one object of your mind takes a sudden sharp turn into the past back hundreds of yearsSometimes it takes off into the future and comes back with all sorts of things to clutter your mindThis is like taking your food sticking it up over your head and letting it fall down behind you  the dogs are sure to get it or like bringing the food to your mouth and then tossing it out in front of youWhen you find this happening its a sign that your mind hasnt been made snug with its objectYour powers of directed thought arent firm enoughYou have to bring the mind to the object and then keep after it to make sure it stays putLike eating Make sure the food is in line with the mouth and stick it right inThis is directed thought The food is in line with the mouth the mouth is in line with the foodYoure sure its food and you know what kind it is  main course or dessert coarse or refinedOnce you know whats what and its in your mouth chew it right upThis is evaluation examining reviewing your meditationSometimes this comes under threshold concentration examining a coarse object to make it more and more refinedIf you find that the breath is long examine long breathingIf its short examine short breathingIf its slow examine slow breathing  to see if the mind will stay with that kind of breathing to see if that kind of breathing will stay with the mind to see whether or not the breath is smooth and unhinderedThis is evaluationWhen the mind gives rise to directed thought and evaluation you have both concentration and discernmentDirected thought and singleness of preoccupation fall under the heading of concentration evaluation under the heading of discernmentWhen you have both concentration and discernment the mind is still and knowledge can ariseIf theres too much evaluation though it can destroy your stillness of mindIf theres too much stillness it can snuff out thoughtYou have to watch over the stillness of your mind to make sure you have things in the right proportionsIf you dont have a sense of just right youre in for troubleIf the mind is too still your progress will be slowIf you think too much itll run away with your concentrationSo observe things carefullyAgain its like eatingIf you go shoveling food into your mouth you might end up choking to deathYou have to ask yourself Is it good for meCan I handle itAre my teeth strong enoughSome people have nothing but empty gums and yet they want to eat sugar cane Its not normalSome people even though their teeth are aching and falling out still want to eat crunchy foodsSo it is with the mind As soon as its just a little bit still we want to see this know that  we want to take on more than we can handleYou first have to make sure that your concentration is solidly based that your discernment and concentration are properly balancedThis point is very importantYour powers of evaluation have to be ripe your directed thought firmSay you have a water buffalo tie it to a stake and pound the stake deep into the groundIf your buffalo is strong it just might walk or run away with the stake and then its all over the placeYou have to know your buffalos strengthIf its really strong pound the stake so that its firmly in the ground and keep watch over itIn other words if you find that the obsessiveness of your thinking is getting out of hand going beyond the bounds of mental stillness fix the mind in place and make it extra still  but not so still that you lose track of thingsIf the mind is too quiet its like being in a dazeYou dont know whats going on at allEverything is dark blotted outOr else you have good and bad spells sinking out of sight and then popping up againThis is concentration without directed thought or evaluation with no sense of judgment Wrong ConcentrationSo you have to be observantUse your judgment  but dont let the mind get carried away by its thoughtsYour thinking is something separateThe mind stays with the meditation objectWherever your thoughts may go spinning your mind is still firmly based  like holding onto a post and spinning around and aroundYou can keep on spinning and yet it doesnt wear you outBut if you let go of the post and spin around three times you get dizzy and  Bang fall flat on your faceSo it is with the mind If it stays with the singleness of its preoccupation it can keep thinking and not get tired not get harmedYour thinking is cintamayapañña your stillness bhavanamayapañña theyre right there togetherThis is the strategy of skillfulness discernment on the level of concentration practiceThinking and stillness keep staying together like thisWhen we practice generosity it comes under the level of appropriate attention when we practice virtue it comes under the level of appropriate attention and when we practice concentration we dont lose a beat  it comes under the same sort of principle only more advanced directed thought and evaluationWhen you have directed thought and evaluation in charge of the mind then the more you think the more solid and sure the mind getsThe more you sit and meditate the more you thinkThe mind becomes more and more firm until all the Hindrances fall awayThe mind no longer goes looking for conceptsNow it can give rise to knowledgeThe knowledge here isnt ordinary knowledgeIt washes away your old knowledgeYou dont want the knowledge that comes from ordinary thinking and reasoning Let go of itYou dont want the knowledge that comes from directed thought and evaluation StopMake the mind quietStillWhen the mind is still and unhindered this is the essence of all thats meritorious and skillfulWhen your mind is on this level it isnt attached to any concepts at allAll the concepts youve known  dealing with the world or the Dhamma however many or few  are washed awayOnly when theyre washed away can new knowledge ariseThis is why were taught not to hold onto concepts  all the labels and names we have for thingsYou have to let yourself be poorIts when people are poor that they become ingenious and resourcefulIf you dont let yourself be poor youll never gain discernmentIn other words you dont have to be afraid of being stupid or of missing out on thingsYou dont have to be afraid that youve hit a dead endYou dont want any of the insights youve gained from listening to others or from reading books because theyre concepts and therefore inconstantYou dont want any of the insights youve gained by reasoning and thinking because theyre concepts and therefore notselfLet all these insights disappear leaving just the mind firmly intent leaning neither to the left toward selftorment or being displeased nor to the right toward sensual indulgence or being pleasedKeep the mind still quiet neutral impassive  set tallAnd there you are Right ConcentrationWhen Right Concentration arises in the mind it has a shadowWhen you can catch sight of the shadow appearing thats vipassana insight meditationVipassanañana is the first branch of knowledge and skill in the Buddhas teachingThe second branch is iddhividhi the power of mind over matterThe third is manomayiddhi the power of mindmade imagesThe fourth is dibbacakkhu clairvoyanceThe fifth is dibbasota clairaudienceThe sixth is cetopariyañana the ability to read mindsThe seventh is pubbenivasanussatiñana knowledge of previous lifetimesAnd the eighth asavakkhayañana knowledge of the ending of mental fermentationsAll eight of these branches are forms of knowledge and skill that arise from concentrationPeople without concentration cant gain them thats an absolute guaranteeNo matter how smart or clever they may be they cant gain these forms of knowledgeThey have to fall under the power of ignoranceThese eight branches of knowledge come from Right ConcentrationWhen they arise theyre not called thoughts or ideasTheyre called Right ViewsWhat looks wrong to you is really wrongWhat looks right is really rightIf what looks right is really wrong thats Wrong ViewIf what looks wrong is really right again  Wrong ViewWith Right View though right looks right and wrong looks wrongTo put it in terms of cause and effect you see the four Noble TruthsYou see stress and it really is stressfulYou see the cause of stress arising and that its really causing stressThese are Noble Truths absolutely undeniably indisputably trueYou see that stress has a causeOnce the cause arises there has to be stressAs for the way to the disbanding of stress you see that the path youre following will without a doubt lead to LiberationWhether or not you go all the way what you see is correctThis is Right ViewAnd as for the disbanding of stress you see that there really is such a thingYou see that as long as youre on the path stress does in fact fall awayWhen you come to realize the truth of these things in your heart thats vipassanañanaTo put it even more simply You see that all things inside as well as out are undependableThe body is undependable aging is undependable death is undependableTheyre slippery characters constantly changing on youTo see this is to see inconstancyDont let yourself be pleased by inconstancyDont let yourself be upsetKeep the mind neutral on an even keelThats whats meant by vipassanaSometimes inconstancy makes us happy sometimes it makes us sadSay we hear that a person we dont like is going to be demoted or is sick or dyingIt makes us gleeful and we cant wait for him or her to dieHis body is impermanent his life is uncertain  it can change  but were gladThats a defilementSay we hear that a son or daughter has become wealthy influential and famous and we become happyAgain our mind has strayed from the noble pathIts not firmly in Right ConcentrationWe have to make the mind neutral not thrilled over things not upset over things not thrilled when our plans succeed not upset when they dontWhen we can make the mind neutral like this thats the neutrality of Right ViewWe see whats wrong whats right and try to steer the mind away from the wrong and toward the rightThis is called Right Resolve part of vipassanañanaThe same holds true with stress whether its our stress and pain or somebody elsesSay we hear that an enemy is sufferingGlad to hear it we thinkHope they hurry up and die The heart has tiltedSay we hear that a friend has become wealthy and we become happy or a son or daughter is ill and we become sadOur mind has fallen in with suffering and stressWhyBecause we dont have any knowledgeWere unskilledThe mind isnt centeredIn other words its not in Right ConcentrationWe have to look after the mindDont let it fall in with stressWhatever suffers let it suffer but dont let the mind suffer with itThe people in the world may be pained but the mind isnt pained along with themPain may arise in the body but the mind isnt pained along with itLet the body go ahead and suffer but the mind doesnt sufferKeep the mind neutralDont be pleased by pleasure either  pleasure is a form of stress you knowHow soIt can changeIt can rise and fallIt can be high and lowIt cant lastThats stressPain is also stress double stressWhen you gain this sort of insight into stress  when you really see stress  vipassana has arisen in the mindAs for anatta notself Once weve examined things and seen them for what they really are we dont make claims we dont display influence we dont try to show that we have the right or the power to bring things that are notself under our controlNo matter how hard we try we cant prevent birth aging illness and deathIf the body is going to be old let it be oldIf its going to hurt let it hurtIf it has to die let it dieDont be pleased by death either your own or that of othersDont be upset by death your own or that of othersKeep the mind neutralUnruffledUnfazedThis is sankharupekkhañana letting sankharas  all things fashioned and fabricated  follow their own inherent natureThe mind like this is in vipassanaThis is the first branch of knowledge  vipassana  in brief You see that all things fashioned are inconstant stressful and notselfYou can disentangle them from your graspYou can let goThis is where it gets goodHow soYou dont have to wear yourself out lugging sankharas aroundTo be attached means to carry a load and there are five heaps we carryrupupadanakkhandho physical phenomena are the first loadvedanupadanakkhandho feelings that were attached to are anothersaññupadanakkhandho the concepts and labels that we claim are ours are a pole for carrying a load on our shouldersankharupadanakkhandho the mental fashionings that we hang onto and think are oursviññanupadanakkhandho our attachment to sensory consciousnessGo ahead Carry them aroundHang one load from your left leg and one from your rightPut one on your left shoulder and one on your rightPut the last load on your headAnd now Carry them wherever you go  clumsy encumbered and comicalThe Buddha taught that whoever lacks discernment whoever is unskilled whoever doesnt practice concentration leading to liberating insight will have to be burdened with stress will always be loaded downIts patheticIts a shameTheyll never get awayWhen theyre loaded down like this its really patheticTheir legs are burdened their shoulders burdened  and where are they goingThree steps forward and two steps backSoon theyll get discouraged and then after a while theyll pick themselves up and get going againNow when we see inconstancy  that all things fashioned whether within us or without are undependable when we see that theyre stressful when we see that theyre not our self that they simply whirl around in and of themselves When we gain these insights we can put down our burdens ie let go of our attachmentsWe can put down the past  ie stop dwelling in itWe can let go of the future  ie stop yearning for itWe can let go of the present  ie stop claiming it as the selfOnce these three big baskets have fallen from our shoulders we can walk with a light stepWe can even danceWere beautifulWherever we go people will be glad to know usWhyBecause were not encumberedWhatever we do we can do with easeWe can walk run dance and sing  all with a light heartWere Buddhisms beauty a sight for sore eyes graceful wherever we goNo longer burdened no longer encumbered we can be at our easeThis is vipassanañana the first branch of knowledgeSoNow that weve cleared away these splinters and thorns so that everything is level and smooth we can relaxAnd now were ready for the knowledge that we can use as a weaponWhats the knowledge we use as a weaponIddhividhiWe can display powers in one way or another and give rise to miraculous things by way of the body by way of speech or by way of the mindWe have powers that we can use in doing the work of the religionThats called iddhividhiBut in the Canon they describe it as different kinds of walking walking through the water without getting wet walking through fire without getting hot staying out in the rain without getting chilled staying out in the wind without getting cold resilient enough to withstand wind rain and sunIf youre young you can make yourself old if old you can make yourself youngIf youre tall you can make yourself short if short you can make yourself tallYou can change your body in all kinds of waysThis is why the Buddha was able to teach all kinds of peopleIf he was teaching old people hed make his body look oldOld people talking with old people can have a good time because theres no distrust or suspicionIf he met up with pretty young women he could make himself look youngHed enjoy talking with them theyd enjoy talking with him and not get boredThis is why the Dhamma he taught appealed to all classes of peopleHe could adapt his body to fit with whatever type of society he found himself inFor instance if he met up with children hed talk about the affairs of children act in a childlike wayIf he met up with old people hed talk about the affairs of old peopleIf he met up with young men and women hed talk about the affairs of young men and womenTheyd all enjoy listening to what he had to say develop a sense of faith become Buddhists and even ordainThis is called iddhividhiNext is manomayiddhi power in the area of the mindThe mind acquires powerWhat kind of powerYou can go wherever you wantIf you want to go sightseeing in hell you canIf you want to get away from human beings you can go sightseeing in hellIts nice and relaxingYou can play with the denizens of hell fool around with the denizens of hellAny of them who have only a little bad kamma can come up and chat with you to send word back to their relativesOnce you get back from touring around hell you can tell the relatives to make merit in the dead persons nameOr if you want you can travel in the world of common animals and chat with mynah birds owls  any kind of bird  or with fourfooted animals twofooted animalsYou can go into the forests into the wilds and converse with the animals thereIts a lot of fun not like talking with peopleTalking with people is hard talking with animals is easyYou dont have to say a lot simply think in the mind tell them stories ask them questions like Now that youre an animal what do you eatDo you get enough to stay full and content You find that you have a lot of companions there people who used to be your friends and relativesOr if you want you can travel in the world of the hungry shadesThe world of the hungry shades is even more funHungry shades come in all different shapes and sizes  really entertaining the hungry shadesSome of them have heads as big as large water jars but their mouths are just like the eye of a needle thats all no bigger than the eye of a needleSome of them have legs six yards long but hands only half a footTheyre amazing to watch just like a cartoonSome of them have lower lips with no upper lips some of them are missing their lips altogether with their teeth exposed all the timeThere are all kinds of hungry shadesSome of them have big bulging eyes the size of coconuts others have fingernails as long as palm leavesYou really ought to see themSome of them are so fat they cant move others so thin that theyre nothing but bonesAnd sometimes the different groups get into battles biting each other hitting each otherThats the hungry shades for youReally entertainingThis is called manomayiddhiWhen the mind is firmly established you can go see these thingsOr you can go to the land of the nagas the different lands on the human level  sometimes when you get tired of human beings you can go visit the heavens the heaven of the Four Great Kings the heaven of the Guardians of the Hours the Thirtythree gods all the way up there to the Brahma worldsThe mind can go without any problemThis is called manomayiddhiIts a lot of funYour defilements are gone your work is done youve got enough rice to eat and money to spend so you can go traveling to see the sights and soak up the breezesThats manomayiddhiDibbacakkhu clairvoyanceYou gain eyes on two levelsThe outer level is called the mansacakkhu the eye of the flesh which enables you to look at human beings in the world devas in the worldThe eye of discernment allows you to examine the defilements of human beings those with coarse defilements those with thick defilements those with faith in the Buddhas teachings those with none those who have the potential to be taught those with no potential at allYou can consider them with your internal discernmentThis is called paññacakkhu the eye of discernmentIn this way you have eyes on two levelsMost of us have eyes on only one level the eye of the flesh while the inner eye doesnt ariseAnd how could it ariseYou dont wash the sleep out of your eyesWhat are the bits of sleep in your eyesSensual desire an enormous hunkIll will another big hunkSloth and torpor a hunk the size of a hammer headYour mind calms down and begins to grow still but this hunk of sleep in your eyes is so heavy it makes you nodThis is called sloth and torporAll you can think about is lying down to sleepThen theres restlessness and anxiety another hunk of sleep and uncertainty still anotherWhen these things get stuck in the heart how can it possibly be brightIts dark on all sidesNow when you develop your meditation and bring the mind to stillness thats called getting the sleep out of your eyesDirected thought loosens it up and evaluation rinses it outOnce your eyes gets rinsed and washed clean this way they can see clearlyThe eye of your mind becomes the eye of discernmentThis is called dibbacakkhuDibbasota clairaudienceThere are two levels of ears as wellThe outer ears are the ones made of skinThe inner ear is the ear of the heartThe ear of the heart doesnt appear for the same sort of reason its full of earwaxYou never clean it outYou dont build up any goodness in the area of the mindThe mind isnt centered in concentrationWhen its not in concentration and hears an attractive sound it cant stay stillYour ears are full of waxYou hear people gossiping or cursing each other out and you love to hear itThis is a humongous hunk of wax stuck in your earAs for the Dhamma youre not really interested in listening which is why theres nothing but earwax earwax stuck in your mind earwax all over everything outsideThis is why your powers of clairaudience dont ariseClairaudience is really refreshingYou dont have to waste your time listeningIf you feel like listening you can hear anythingWhat the hungry shades are talking about what common animals are talking about what the devas are talking about  how fantastic it is to be in heaven  you can hear it all unless you dont want to listenLike a radio If its turned on you can hear it loud and clearIf it becomes a nuisance you dont have to keep it onIf you have this skill you can turn it on to listen for the fun of it if you dont want to listen you can turn it off in an instantThis is called clairaudience one of the skills of concentration practiceAnother skill is cetopariyañana the ability to read minds to see if people are thinking good thoughts or bad high low crude evil you can use this insight to knowThis is called cetopariyañana an important skillThen theres pubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember previous lives and asavakkhayañana the ability to clean out the mind washing away all the ignorance craving and clinging inside itYou can keep ignorance from arising in the heartYou can keep craving from taking charge of the heartYou can make sure that theres no clinging or attachmentWhen you can let go of your defilements  kamajaho when youre not stuck on sensual objects or sensual desires ditthijaho when youre not stuck on views and opinions avijjajaho when you dont mistake ignorance for knowledge and can let it go without any attachment  when you dont latch onto evil when you dont latch onto your own goodness when you can spit out evil and goodness without holding onto them as your own letting them go in line with their nature Thats called asavakkhayañana the knowledge of the ending of the fermentations in the mindThis is the third noble truth the truth of cessation achieved through the practices that give rise to knowledge and skillThese are the skills that arise from meditation practiceTheyre uparimavijja higher learning in the area of the religionWhen youve got them you can be at your ease  at ease if you die at ease if you dontYou dont have to build a rocket to go to MarsYou can live right here in the world and nothing will be able to harm youIn other words you know what things are dangerous what things are harmful and so you leave them alone and dont touch themThis way you can live in safety and peaceThe heart can stay blooming and bright like this at all timesThis is why we should be earnest and strict with ourselves in the practice so that we can achieve the aims we all wantHere Ive explained the eight knowledges in briefIf I were to go into detail there would be lots more to sayTo boil it down All these forms of knowledge come from stillnessIf the mind isnt still they dont ariseAt best if the mind isnt still you can gain knowledge only from listening reading or thinking things overBut the person who can stop thinking stop pondering and yet can still be intelligent Thats something really amazing something that goes against the currents of the worldNormally people in the world have to study and read think and ponder if they want to be intelligentBut with the Dhamma you have to stop thinking stop writing stop memorizing stop doing in order to gain the highest level of knowledgeThis is something that goes against the currents of the world and that human beings find hard to doBut when you become intent in the practice that gives rise to knowledge youll succeed in line with your aspirationsHaving talked on the theme of vijjacaranasampanno Ill end right hereEvery human being falls under the same conditionsIn the beginning were born then in the middle we change and in the end we fall apart and dieDeath is something no one aspires to and yet no one can escape itWe all have death at the end of our pathThinking about death gives rise both to benefits and to harmFor shortsighted people its harmful because it makes them so depressed and discouraged that they dont want to do any good in the worldIn other words all they see is the part that diesThey dont see the part that doesntActually there are two parts to every person the part that can die and the part that doesnt dieFor example the nature of the body is to keep changing until it falls apartYou can say that it dies and you can say that it doesntThe word dies applies to the fact that the person disappears from his or her friends and relatives but the elements of the body simply go back to their original formThe earth returns to being earth the water to water the fire to fire and wind to windIts like a cube of ice if you keep the ice long enough itll return to its original condition of being waterSo you can say that the body dies and you can say that it doesnt die  simply that it doesnt maintain the same form it hadAccording to the conventions of the world this is called death but wise people dont see death as anything strange or out of the ordinaryThe only question is whether death is accompanied by merit or notThis brings us to the mind that used to stay with the bodyThis is the important part because it doesnt dieIt simply changes in line with the way good and evil arrange things for itIn other words they arrange the level of the mind the place where it takes rebirthIf you do good youll have to go to a good destinationIf you do evil youll have to go to a bad destinationIf you develop goodness to the ultimate degree so that you can let go of good and evil the mind will become changeless or whats called deathlessBut most of us cant conceive of the truthWe tend to overlook it so that we never reach the deathlessThis is because of our own stupidity and lack of discernmentOur ignorance hides the truth from usThe nature of the mind is very subtleYou cant see it with your eyesSome people say it doesnt exist which is why people who dont consider things carefully say that death is followed by annihilationWe can make a comparison with the fire element in the airThe mind is like the fire elementThe body is like a lit candleWhen the candle runs out of its wax and wick the fire has to go outBut when the fire goes out that doesnt mean that no fire is left in the worldWere able to light another candle because of the fire element still there throughout the airThats the way it is with us when the body falls apart the mind gives rise to a new level of being for itself as long as it still has the fuel of ignorance craving and clingingThis is why the Buddha taught his disciples not to be heedless to develop as much merit and skillfulness as possible for merit and skillfulness are what bring happiness both in this world and in the nextThis is in line with the sayingsThe word merit here means the happiness or wellbeing that results from doing goodThe good we can do comes in many forms but in short there are two kindsThe merit that acts as a cause comes in three types danamaya the merit of being generous silamaya the merit of observing the precepts and bhavanamaya the merit of meditatingIn the Abhidhamma these three types are divided into ten meritorious activitiesGenerosity is expanded to include pattidanamaya the merit of dedicating merit to others and pattanumodanamaya the merit of appreciating other peoples meritThese three go together in that they all counteract jealousy and stinginessThe merit of observing the precepts is expanded to include apacayanamaya the merit of showing respect to people worthy of respect such as our elders and those to whom we should be grateful veyyavaccamaya the merit that comes in helping others in skillful activities sharing your strength wealth and intelligenceThese three all go together in that theyre related to interpersonal virtueAs for the merit of meditation thats expanded to include dhammassavanamaya the merit of listening to the Dhamma dhammadesanamaya the merit of teaching the Dhamma and ditthujukamma making ones views straightAll four of these go together in that they are all sources of discernmentThese forms of merit can arise only when they are rooted in mental states free of greed aversion and delusionAs the Pali says alobho danahetu lack of greed is the basis for generosity adoso silahetu lack of aversion is the basis for virtue and amoho bhavanahetu lack of delusion is the basis for developing the mind in meditationThe merit you do gives you ease in body and mindWhenever you think of the good youve done it will always make you happyIts a noble treasure that follows you just as your shadow follows you at all timesEven when you die the merit youve done will follow you and arrange a good place for you to be rebornThis is called puññabhisankhara merit as a fabricating factorWhen people are about to die they are like travelers getting ready to abroadBefore they go they have to prepare themselvesOnly then will the trip be comfortableFor example they have to put money in the bank exchanging their Thai currency for foreign currency so they can use it when theyre abroadIf they simply take their Thai money along with them they wont be able to use it to buy anythingIn the same way when people leave this world at death they cant take along their wealth or possessions to use in the next worldInstead while theyre still alive here they have to deposit their money in the bank for Buddhists and exchange it for noble treasures or inner wealthWhat this means is that they make donations for example in homage to the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaThat way theyll be able to use their wealth in the next worldIf they have only counterfeit money  ie if theyve done nothing but evil and unskillful things  they wont be able to go to anywhere comfortable or prosperous because they lack the funds needed to take themselves thereThey wont be able to return to the human world because they lack the funds  the human values  needed to take themselves thereSo theyll have to turn into hungry ghosts wandering around losing their way haunting people and possessing them suffering all kinds of hardshipsFor this reason being generous is like depositing your money in a bank so that youll be able to use it when you go abroadThats the first stepThe second step is to get a passport as proof of your nationalityWhat this means is that you establish yourself in the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha observing the precepts to get rid of the gross defilements in your words and deeds as proof of your status as a member of the Buddhas followingThe third step is to learn foreign languagesIn other words you have to practice tranquillity meditation and insight meditation so as to get rid of the intermediate and refined defilements  the Hindrances  in the heart straightening out the heart so that you can give rise to three forms of knowledgeThese three forms of knowledge count as the foreign languages youll need for your journeyYour trip will be easy and fun dazzling bright with plenty of treasures along the wayYoull see sights youve never seen before such as the heavens and brahma worldsThis is what it means to be wellgone Even as you stay here youll stay wellIf you want to come back youll be able toIf you dont you can continue your studies and go all the way to nibbana released from having to swim around in the cycle of death and rebirthYoull reach security joyful and free from danger of every sortThe practice of generosity virtue and meditation thus results in three types of treasure  the treasure of the human state the treasure of the heavenly state and the treasure of nibbana  in line with your abilities to do the practicePeople who are complete in all three of these forms of skillfulness are said to go well come well and stay well because their thoughts words and deeds have been trained wellWherever they go they are free from animosity and danger for they are loved and respected by all beings human and divineSo we should each look at our condition realizing that were on a journey leading day by day minute by minute to deathTheres no escaping thisFor this reason we should develop the three forms of skillfulness and merit  generosity virtue and meditation  so that the happiness and security resulting from goodness will arise for us taking us beyond death in line with our abilitiesThe Dhamma is something that cleanses the mind so that its bright clean and happyPeople differ in their temperaments some are crude others intermediate and others refinedThis is why the Buddha elaborated on the Dhamma in various ways in line with the character of his listenersIn other words he took short things and explained them until they were longFor example sometimes hed explain the rewards of generosity sometimes the rewards of virtue and sometimes the rewards of polishing the heart whats called meditationBut his real aim was to teach people to make their minds pureEverything else was just elaborationEach of us human beings is like a person sitting in a boat in the middle of an ocean filled with wind waves and stormsSome people are floating so far out they cant even see the shoreSome are bobbing up and down so that sometimes they see the shore and sometimes they dontThis stands for the people who are repeating buddho buddhoSome people are floating closer to land so that they can see the fish traps the sailboats and the green trees on shoreSome have struggled to swim closer to shore but they still havent made it to landAs for the Buddha hes like a person standing on the shore free from all the dangers of being at seaHes seen the dangers that people are subject to which is why he has the great compassion to want to help us get out of the sea and safely on landThis is why he teaches us to practice generosity virtue and meditation for these are the things that will pull us safely on to shoreWhen we set our minds on practicing the Dhamma we have to set our sights on the Dhammas true aimDont go wandering off in other directionsYou have to know which path is the wrong one the dangerous one and which one is the right one the safe oneIts like steering a ship across the oceanThe captain has to watch for the signals of the lighthouseOr you can make a comparison with driving a car The traffic police have their red yellow and green lights as traffic signals at the major intersectionsIf when the signal has its red light on you dont stop then if you keep on driving theres bound to be danger and youre sure to get pulled overIf the green light is on but you dont go thats wrong tooThis is why when youre driving you have to understand the signals so that youll reach your destination safelyIts the same when youre traveling to the DhammaYou have to know the Buddhas traffic signalsHis red lights are his prohibitions the things he doesnt allowAnyone who lets his or her boat or car go through the red light will have to meet with dangerSo while were meditating here we have to make sure we dont go through the red light of our defilementsThe Buddha compared our defilements to fireThe heat of our single sun can make the world as hot as it isThink of how hot it would be if there were five or six sunsThe defilements around each of our senses are like the heat of the sunCakkhum adittam the eye is a mass of fireSotam adittam the ear is a mass of flameGhanam adittam the nose is a mass of fireJivha aditta the tongue is a mass of flameKayo aditto the body is a mass of fireMano aditto the heart is a mass of flameDont let these six masses of fire burn youNormally the sensual desires arising around the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind are red masses of flame burning away at the heartIf while were meditating we stick our minds into these preoccupations its like taking a burning match and sticking it into some kerosene or gasolineFor this reason while youre meditating dont stick your mind into the affairs of your family your home your belongings or absolutely anybody or anything at allThis is the Buddhas red light where he tells you not to goThe other signal is the green light the Dhamma being explainedWhen the light is green thats a sign for you to go aheadThe green light here stands for the Dhamma youve already studied as well as the Dhamma youre training yourself in right nowWhen the light is green then whether were fast or slow we have to goDont just loiter around and block the way or the police will arrest youIn other words when the Dhamma arises by way of our eyes ears nose tongue body and mind we have to pursue that goodnessThe Dhamma is what pushes or pulls as to goodness and peaceThe green light is the Dhamma arising in a heart thats clean and pureRight now have our minds entered the quality of buddhaThis is an important pointWe have to be observant to see whether the affairs of our minds are heading toward the green light or toward the red lightIf were not heading in the right direction we have to turn ourselves aroundIts like picking flowers washing them and then putting them in a vaseWe have to make sure there arent any worms or caterpillars eating away at themMake the mind like a pure blooming lotus in a vaseThis qualifies as the quality of buddhaOr think of it in another way the mind is cool and refreshed like a lotus blooming in the middle of a pondIts surrounded by nourishing water cool and with an appealing scentIf youre sitting here in the meditation hall without any hindrances in the mind its like a lotus in the middle of a pondThis is also called the quality of buddhaThis is called the radiant mind or in simpler terms the quality of inner worthWhen the mind is saturated in inner worth like this its happy and at easeThe Dhamma is a preoccupation that gives the mind a sense of rapture fullness and easeWhen it arises were taught to develop it and cultivate it as much as possibleKeep the mind in this preoccupation until it attains a state of oneness thats the DhammaWhatever is good in the heart we try to raise that goodness to a higher and higher levelKeep evaluating it focusing your mindfulness on it at all times to see how the mind enters into this state of goodnessThis is called developing a foundation of mindfulnessIf you keep your mindfulness focused on a single path  as when you think buddho buddho  without sending your mind off on other paths the mind grows deeper and deeper into a state of inner worthJust as when we walk along a path on the ground if we keep walking back and forth on the same path its bound to get worn smoothThe grasses and weeds will die away and the path will get worn deeper into the ground to the point where when it rains it becomes a watercourse watering our crops so that they grow abundantWell be able to sell them for a living and grow rich freed from povertyThis is why this quality of merit or inner worth is called noble wealthThings deep and refined tend to be high in qualityIf the breath is refined the mind refined and mindfulness refined then the brightness of our awareness will spread wider and wider like the electric lights that spread their light throughout the capitalThis is different from lantern light which  if we want to see all around us  we have to carry and run aroundWhen the mind is refined and the breath is refined well be able to know the breath energies throughout the worldWell see how things are going with all the elementsThe heart will grow even broader so that our foundation of mindfulness becomes the great frame of referenceThe mind grows even deeper and coolerMore full and rapturousBlooming and at easeWhen the mind matures in this way youve got noble wealthYoure no longer poorCoolness is like waterWherever the ground has water there are bound to be fish crabs crayfish and shellfish grasses and vegetables all of which can be converted to wealthThe Buddha saw the fullness of this mind state which is why he told the monks Dont farm for a livingDont get involved in receiving gold and silverFocus on doing only one thing  be intent on really practicing the Dhamma making your minds into the single unified path  and then whatever you want youll be sure to getThis is because when the mind is full of virtue and Dhamma youll always have wealthThis is the power that comes from making your goodness deep  like the Chao Phraya River which is deeper and broader than any other river in ThailandIts full of everything boats rafts motor boats steamboats big boats little boats so that travel and commerce are convenientIn the river will be fish in the fields will be rice melons cucumbers corn wheat  all of these things will be within youYoull be wealthy in everythingIf you dont give rise to goodness then no matter what you wont be wealthyThis is why the Buddha taught the monks Dont be farmers of merchantsAnd dont worry you wont be poorSimply build up a lot of goodness in your hearts and all forms of wealth will come flowing your way on their ownBut we dont really believe himWe believe our defilements instead and so our minds keep sliding toward red masses of flame rather than to the clear mass of purityThis is why were taught sukkam bhavetha pandito the wise person develops the clear Dhamma of purityAll Ive mentioned so far deals with the qualities of the Buddha and DhammaThe quality of the Sangha means making the mind go forward without sliding backWe keep putting our mind into good shapeFor instance when the eye sees something that isnt good our mind is in good shapeThe ear hears something that isnt good yet our mind is in good shapeThe nose smells an aroma that isnt good the tongue tastes a flavor that isnt good the body touches a tactile sensation that isnt good yet our mind is still in good shapeThis is called supatipanno practicing rightlyWhen we keep the mind straight on the right path thats called ujupatipanno practicing straightforwardlyWhen we bring the mind to the level of insight meditation attaining the transcendent thats ñayapatipanno practicing for the sake of knowledgeAs for samicipatipanno practicing masterfully that means making our goodness even better and betterFor example when defilement arises in the heart we have to use the Dhamma to pen it inDefilement is like a rabid dog running around in miseryWhoever it sees it runs right up to bite indiscriminately until eventually it gets killed or falls down dead on its ownIn the same way when our defilements arise we have to pen them in quickly and keep them under our thumbDont bring them out to put them to useGreed anger and delusion are intoxicantsWhen were intoxicated our minds are in the darkWhen were in the dark we stagger around back and forth dizzy and confused not knowing what way to go and as a result we never get to the destination we wantThe Buddhas green light takes us to the clear light of the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaWhen we have these three gems and are sitting on the crystal throne of the seven forms of noble wealth what suffering will we haveWhen we make our minds into Dhamma the various defilements that lie fermenting in the heart will have to disappearThere will be nothing to spoil the heartWell be able to escape from the seaOnce we get on land we can have all kinds of fun for there are a lot of things we never saw at seaIts like when we come into the mouth of the Chao Phraya River where there are marsh trees and fresh green plantsWe become enchanted and keep walking further inland to Sukhumvit RoadThere we see bicycles and trucks and jeeps and pretty automobiles of different colorsThis gets us even more excited and some of us get smitten with what we see on landIn other words we fall for the visions and signs that come in meditationFor instance we may begin to remember previous lifetimesIf we remember bad things we become sadIf we remember good things we get happyThis turns into craving the desire to be this or that and some people get really deluded thinking they actually are the things they seeIf our discernment isnt strong enough then whatever we see will turn into the corruptions of insight  like people who get all excited the first time they see a carThey go running to the car wanting to ride in it wanting to drive it but without looking right or left or stopping to take note of anythingThey run right out into the middle of the road get run over and either die or break an arm or a legAfter all the trouble they went to in order to get out of the sea they get deluded and put themselves in danger all over againLike the example that happened a few days agoAn old monk came into the monastery so some lay people asked him where he was from and whom he wanted to meetHe told them You all dont know a thingAjaan Lee used to be King Asoka which is why he built Wat AsokaramIm King Pasenadi the Kosalan his old friendThats why Ive come to visit him today He had his student come in to inform me and so I told the student QuickQuickGo back and tell him to go awayHes absolutely forbidden to come in here Even this sort of thing can happenThis is called getting smitten with being on land ie falling for the visions you seeThat old monk probably had a few ideas of one sort or another arising in his mind and so got carried awayIf you start seeing things when your discernment isnt strong enough it turns into a corruption of insight  as when a person gets excited at the sight of a car because hes never seen one beforeHe wants to ride in it to drive it so without looking left or right he goes running toward it right into the middle of the roadAnd so he gets run over by a car and killed or else crippled with a broken legThis too is a kind of delusion a dangerBut if our discernment is strong enough whatever we see will turn into noble treasuresIf we see a forest of marsh tress we can put them to useWe can cut them into firewood to use ourselves or sell in the marketIf the land is a tangle of weeds we can clear it and turn it into fieldsIf we dont let it lie fallow its sure to yield cropsFalling for visions is also called skewed perception The right way to act when you see a vision is to remember to evaluate it and then let it go in line with its true natureDont latch onto what you see because all things are inconstantIf youre born poor you suffer from your desire to be richIf youre born rich you suffer in looking after your possessions afraid that theyll wear out afraid that youll get cheated out of them afraid that thieves will break in and steal themTheres nothing certain or dependable at allThe same holds true with visionsSo whatever you see you have to let it go in line with its natureLeave the trees in the forest the grass in the meadows and the rice in the fieldsIf you can do this you can be at your ease because you know what its like on land what its like in the water when to get in and when to get outOnce youre skilled you can travel on water or land at ease in every wayYou can go forward or back without any obstaclesThis is called lokavidu knowing the worldYou can stay with what you know but youre not stuck on itYou can live in the ocean without drowningYou can live in the world without getting sunk in the world  like a lotus leaf in the water the water doesnt seep into the leaf at allFabricated things belong to no one have no one in chargeIf you contemplate them and let go of them in line with their nature  in the same way that you put down a knife without holding onto it  the mind will reach an important point the level of the radiant mindThe Dhamma is something constant and trueThe reason we dont see the truth is because were always spinning aroundIf were riding in a car we cant clearly see the things that pass near by us on the road such as how big the stones on the ground are what color they areWe look at trees mountains and fields and they all seem to be on the moveIf weve been in a car since birth without stopping to get out and walk around on our own were sure to think that cars run trees run and mountains runThe fact is though that the truth and our spinning around arent in line with each otherThe running lies in us in the car not in the trees or mountainsEverything thats Dhamma stays firm and constantThats why its called the truthWhatever isnt true isnt DhammaIn the area of the Dhamma one of the Buddhas highest aims was discernmentHe wasnt just out after a sense of peace and ease for simple peace of mind isnt really peaceful isnt really easeful isnt really restfulIt still has some unrest mixed in with itThe highest happiness lies above not only peace of mind but also above discernment as wellMost of us when we feel at peace and at ease tend to get heedless and carelessAs a result we dont develop any discernmentWe can take a lesson from the people of Japan their land is poor their crops grow slowly and the landscape is full of volcanoesAs a result the people have to exert themselves to make a living and always be on the alert ready to evacuate whenever theres dangerThis is why theyre so active and intelligent solving all their difficulties so that they can bring progress to their countryPeople who have it easy though tend to be stupid because they have no sense of how to exert themselves to get rid of sufferingPeople nowadays have studied a lot but theyre still stupidStupid in what wayStupid in that they dont know how to fix their own rice sew their own clothes or wash their own clothesThey dont have any skillsThe time will have to come when this causes them to suffer and fall into difficultiesMost of us Thai people complain that foreigners are taking over our economy but actually the fault lies with our own stupidityWe cant even make one big toes worth of happiness for ourselves and instead sit staring off into the distanceOther people run and jump and do everything necessary for the sake of their happiness but we just sit around and create difficulties for our familiesThen when we suffer that opens the way for corruptionWe get up from a meal and dont wash our own dishes or put them awayIf all our discernment is in knowing how to eat how will we ever get anywhereThis is why the Buddha taught the Dhamma both in terms of causes and results skills and their rewardsHe taught first about things that lie immediately around usOnce we put ourselves into good shape it will spread to help everyone who comes after usWhatever causes whatever skills will give rise to peace ease and convenience for ourselves we have to doThe results are sure to followOn the good side virtue is a cause for concentrationConcentration is a cause for discernmentOn the bad side suffering comes from cravingAnd what does craving come fromFrom our own stupidityIts because were stupid in so many ways that we suffer so muchWhen craving arises it damages people all around usThis is why we should develop the causes for happiness and ease so as to prevent these kinds of dangers  for when difficulties arise the mind will start spinning in all sorts ways that will cause us to sufferFor this reason you should examine yourself whenever you get the chance at all timesIf you start feeling ill at ease you should trace back to the causesAsk yourself What have I been doing since I got up this morningWhat have I been thinking about When you try to cut down a tree but cant cut all the way through you have to look at your machete to see if its nicked or dullIf you try to cut the tree down with your teeth you wont get anywhereYou have to trace back to the causes of your problems if you want to figure out how to solve themWhen you do that all your difficulties will vanishKnowledge has to come from the discernment we give rise to within ourselvesThe lowest or weakest level of discernment knows neither causes nor resultsThe middle level knows results without knowing their causes or causes without knowing their resultsThe highest level of discernment knows causes before they give rise to their resultsIn other words you know what kind of results youll get from your actionsBut most of us dont even know what causes were creating which is why the results we get arent good at allWhen we want to progress in life we have to give rise to the causes for peace and easeIn other words we have to practice meditation in line with the factors of the noble pathSammakammanta right action is the cause for peace and easeOur actions come in all sorts of formsThe way we stand is an actionThe movement of the body is an actionThe actions the various kinds of work in the world require us to run to pick things up with our bodyBut in the area of the Dhamma simply sitting still with the right intention is a form of work or actionLying down with the right intention is a form of work or actionSitting standing walking lying down all of our movements and postures if done with the right intention are a form of work or actionWhen our actions are right well experience peace and easeAnd then how will suffering come our wayThe reason we suffer is because our actions are wrongWe sit stand walk and lie down in ways contrary to the DhammaAnd then when we take on other work in addition to our basic actions that work is bound to turn into wrong action as wellThis was why the Buddha improved his manners in how he sat stood walked and lay down so that they were all pure in terms of the intentions of his mindWhat this means is that he kept practicing tranquillity meditation in all his activitiesHis mind had to stay with what the body was doingIf the mind told the body to do something but didnt do it along with the body then he didnt succeed in what he wanted to doHe couldnt let the body work on its ownThe mind had to work along with the bodyOtherwise his old manners would come back and take charge of the mindWrong action means thoughts of sensuality thinking in terms of sensual objects that give rise to sensual defilementsSights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas come from the body and mind acting togetherIf the mind then wants any of these things thats called greedYou want them to be good but when they arent good in line with your thoughts that gives rise to aversionIf you get carried away by your aversion thats delusionBut if you direct your thinking to the breath that will kill off sensual desiresEvaluate your breath and that will kill off ill willThere are two kinds of evaluation evaluating the in and out breath and evaluating the inner breath sensations of the body until they interact with the other properties of the bodyWhen you reach this point you forget any feelings of ill willOnce the mind and body are full you feel a sense of easeRapture and pleasure are thus the results of directed thought and evaluationDirected thought and evaluation thus count as right actionThe principle of cause and effect applies to all your activities both inside and outThe reason we suffer is because we eatHow is eating sufferingBecause we never can get fullThe body isnt full the mind isnt fullIt never has a sense of enough with its preoccupationsThis gives rise to hungerBut when the mind stops worrying about eating and instead stays with its right actions then you can be at your easeSometimes while you meditate you focus on the cause the sense of seclusion without any thought for the resultsSometimes you stay with the results viharadhamma the ease of staying in the home of the mindEven though the work this requires may be difficult you arent worried or concernedThe mind keeps staying with its sense of easeWhen you get skilled you gain a sense of when to focus on the causes and when to focus on the resultsThis is called acting with a sense of causes and resultsYoure not stuck on any of the baits of the worldYou stay exclusively with the ease of the DhammaEven though the work may require effort youre not worked up about itYou do it with a sense of wellbeingWhen theres a sense of wellbeing the mind doesnt get stirred upWhen its still in this way liberating insight can ariseOur work turns into the work of insightYou watch the properties of sensation when sights strike the eye there arise feelings of liking and dislikingYou watch while these things stay for an instant disintegrate and disappearYou see sights as properties that moveThe eye is a property that movesConsciousness  the awareness of these things  is a property that movesThis applies to all the sense media they all lie under the characteristics of inconstancy stress and notselfDiscernment is what stays still enough to see what moves and what doesntAnd then theres a lettinggo of bothThats when you see that ease on the conventional level from the point of view of the Dhamma is a falsehood  for theres an ease on the ultimate level thats trueThe happiness to which every human being aspires is attained solely through the heartSome of these forms of happiness though arent clean or clearThe happiness that is clear and clean is the highest happiness in the Buddhas teachings in other words nibbanaAny form of happiness aside from this is neither clean nor clearFor the mind to attain happiness it has to depend on the Dhamma as its foundationThis is why the Buddha taught us to become acquainted with the Dhamma so that we can put it to use in developing the goodness that brings us the beneficial happiness we wantIn what way is the practice of the Dhamma so importantIts important in that when a person practices the Dhamma it gives cool shelter to the person who practices it and to others at largeIf the world lacked the Dhamma theres no way we could find happiness anywhere at allThis is why we have to seek out Dhamma for the heart because the current situation of the world is such that all kinds of events are sure to come seeping into the heartAnything protected by the Dhamma contains the causes that will bring about happinessAnything not protected by the Dhamma contains the causes for disturbance and unrestWe human beings are like treesIf a tree has an abundance of flowers and fruits thick branches and leaves and a firmly rooted trunk that doesnt fall down in the wind it gives pleasure to the birds who come and live in it to the travelers who pass by and rest in its shadeThis is like a person who has the Dhamma as a firmly rooted foundation in the heartSuch a person gives shelter both to himself and to others as wellThe Dhamma is like a rainy mist that keeps plants fresh and greenPeople protected by the Dhamma have a cool sense of ease within themselves and are able to spread and share it with others at largeTake the Buddha as an example When he was still a lay person he was the son of a powerful king with great wealth and a large followingHis palace was enormousHe had everything he could wish for without the least thing lackingBut even then he saw that this sort of happiness was like a ripe banana on a tree theres no way it could escape from the beaks of the hawks and ravens who wanted to eat itThis is why he abandoned his great wealth and went forth in search of a happiness lasting and true  in other words the path to release from sufferingWhen he found it he kept exclaiming in his heart What blissWhat bliss Even though there were times when he had to encounter situations that were difficult to bear  for instance when there were hardships in gaining food or in the external conditions of his life  he never saw these things as troublesome in any way at allHe kept repeating to himself What blissWhat bliss to the point where he was rumored to be crazyStill when he had found a happiness this true he naturally felt compassion for the stupidity of human beings and other living beings at large who still kept themselves sunk in suffering in such a pitiful way without knowing the means for gaining release from itFeeling this compassion the Buddha thus wandered from city to city village to village to teach people the Dhamma and the way to practice by which they could release themselves from suffering and reach the same kind of happiness he had found himselfWhen people listened to the Buddhas Dhamma many of them gained conviction and confidence in what he taughtSo they put it into practice to the point where they attained many of the highest levels of happinessThey then brought their children grandchildren and friends to hear the Buddhas Dhamma and so everincreasing numbers of people saw the results appearing in their heartsThis is how the Buddhas teachings spread far and wide in every directionAt present Buddhism seems to be most predominant in Thailand in that those who respect the Buddhas teachings are found in every level of society from the lowest to the highestThe study of the Dhamma is found on every level from the lowest to the highestThe same is true of the practice of the Dhamma it occurs on low levels intermediate levels up to the highest levelThe lowest levels are those of us sitting here training ourselves in meditationThe intermediate levels start with the attainment of streamentry on upOn the highest level are the arahantsYou have to be very observant to know thisThere are lots of people on the low levels but only a few on the intermediate and highest levelsThe really low levels are those who want to develop goodness but whose motivation is badIn this way our practice depends on what we want to choose Do you want to eat leaves flowers or the actual fruitIf we want the kind of intelligence that can gather flowers and fruit to eat we have to use our discernment  the inner brightness called the eye of the mind or the inner eyeAs for the outer eye thats the eye of fleshFor the brightness of the inner eye to arise and see the truth we need concentrationThe outer eye keeps deceiving the mind all the time making us see things in this way or believe things in thatThis is why the Buddha taught us to develop the inner eye so that our vision can penetrate farThere are actually two parts to each personThe outer part is the body the inner part is the heart and mindThe outer part is like a puppet or a mannequin built out of the elements of stressNo matter how much we fawn over it caring for it at great expense it wont stay with usIn the end itll have to turn into ashes and sink into the groundAs for the mind which is the more lasting part we dont give it much care or attention at allThis is why the Buddha said that people are very deludedWe dont see our substantial part and instead see only the deceptive partWere like a monkey who sees its reflection in a mirror and assumes that theres another monkeySo it sticks out its tongue and makes faces at its reflection trying to scare its reflection  and so scaring itself until it gets all worn out to no purpose at allOur substantial part is the mindOur fake part is the bodyEven if we were to decorate the body with crowns and headdresses to make it look really fancy it wouldnt change its basic natureOnce its born it ages then it starts to hurt and then it diesNo matter how much we study and gain degrees from universities all over the world we still cant divert the body from its basic natureTheres no way it can escape dyingThis is why discerning people focus their attention on the substantial part of themselves in other words the part thats responsible for all things the mindThe body isnt responsible for good or evil at allFor example if we murder or steal the body doesnt go to hellNo matter how much good we do the body doesnt go along with us to heavenThe mind we cant see thats what goesWe cant see the process of its going but its nevertheless capable of moving from place to placeThe act of going to the good or bad destinations is entirely an affair of the heart and mindThis is why those who train their own hearts and minds are said truly to love themselvesThose who dont train their own hearts and minds are said to be in a place of darkness or unawarenessWhen the light of awareness or cognitive skill arises in the mind the mind will have the arms legs hands and eyes it needs to succeed in its aimsIf it doesnt have this awareness its in so much darkness that it cant see anything at allIt has to depend totally on the bodyBut when you practice so as to give rise to the eye of the mind youll see that the body is one thing the mind anotherTheyre not one and the sameAt the moment our minds are still like children which is why we have to depend on the body to be our guardianBut once the mind is trained it will grow into an adult and be able to let go of the bodyThe nature of children is that they still have to depend on their guardiansBut once a child is raised to adulthood it can go out on its own without the guardianTheres no need to carry the child around any moreIf we dont know how to train the mind itll simply stay at the childish levelThe reason we all suffer so much in our lives is that our minds are still childrenThis is why the Buddha taught us to find the Dhamma as a refuge or shelter for the mindAt present our minds dont have a home to stay inNo matter where we sit or lie down the mind wont stay putThe only thing that does stay put is the bodyAnd this is why the mind knows no happiness like a person who always has to keep wandering without rest tired and hot from the sunThe phrase home for the mind here means the foundation of concentrationJust as a person with lots of possessions but no safe place to keep them can find no rest in the same way people with no concentration  the foundation for the mind  cant find any peace no matter how many meritorious things they doThis is why we should train the mind to attain concentrationTraining the mind is like eating a meal when youve finished eating you have to wash the dishes and put them away in an orderly fashion so that the next time you want to eat youll have them right at handWhen we want to use the mind in any of our activities we have to keep washing it and putting it in order in just the same wayTell yourself while youre sitting here that youre on your way to the shade of a Bodhi tree ie the refuge of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaWhen you develop your inner goodness in this way you cant entrust your mind to the world to any people or any material things at allYoure going to entrust it entirely to someone venerableIn other words you keep your mind flowing in the recollection of the Buddha without getting snagged on anything elseUse your alertness to survey your heart and take the body as your playgroundKeep mindfulness always in charge of the mind thinking buddho with the in and outbreathYou know what the breath is like when it comes in you know what its like when it goes outThis is called getting established in the recollection of the BuddhaThats the first stepThe second step is to clean up the mindYou dont focus on anything involved with the Hindrances such as loving this person hating that person liking and disliking good and badYou have to be intent on releasing the mind from these thingsIn this way the Dhamma will arise in the heart with a cool sense of reliefThen you can look at the cleanliness of the mind to see whether the way you live from day to day is clean or notBeing unclean means having a mind mixed up with defilementsAs you sit here calming the mind dont go thinking about sights sounds smells etc in ways that lead to sensual desire ill will or thoughts of harmfulnessIf greed arises try to wash it awayDont let it arise againIf anger arises try to wash it awayDont let it arise againThe same holds true with delusionTry to chase out every form of evilThis is called mental purityOnce the mind comes to a stop thats when purity will arise  like a traveler who stops and rests under the shade of a treeHis weariness will disappear and he wont have any sweatPassion aversion and delusion are like sweat that moistens and stains our mindWhoever can stop sweating in this way  by entering the shade of the Bodhi tree through practicing recollection of the Buddha  will become clean like a person sitting under a treeWhen the mind is established in good qualities itll be sheltered and at easeAs the mind grows more and more clean it will become as clear and transparent as water giving rise to an inner brightnessSometimes its clean but not brightIn other words it keeps moving forward and back without staying in placeOnce the mind is bright and clear though itll give rise to awarenessCakkhum udapadi ñanam udapadi pañña udapadi vijja udapadi Vision arises knowledge arises discernment arises awareness arisesYoull give rise to three eyes the eye of the past is recollection of past lives the eye of the future is knowledge of the death and rebirth of living beings and the eye of the present is knowledge of the ending of mental fermentationsYoull be able to let go of all things poisonousYou wont be stuck on the past present or future at allThis is why when you develop concentration youll end up with three eyesIn other words your outer left eye will see good things your outer right eye will see bad things and theyll send them in to the inner eye which will remain at equilibriumYoull also have three ears Your outer left ear will hear praise your outer right ear will hear criticism and theyll send them in to the inner ear which will stay at equilibriumThis is how you can receive all the guests the world sends your wayAs for the eye of the mind  intuitive insight  itll receive your defilementsOnce it really understands them itll be able to send them packingThat way youll be able to live comfortably in the world with nothing to disturb your eyes ears nose tongue body or mindYoull meet with nothing but brightness and purityThe mind that hasnt been trained is like a childWhen its trained it turns into an adultAs for the body which used to seem so large and mature youll now see that its really a childIts inconstant stressful and notselfBut the mind trained to the point of adulthood wont be troubled by these thingsEven though the body is inconstant inconstancy wont appear in the mindEven though the body is stressful stress wont appear in the mindEven though the body is notself nothing troubling will appear in the mindThe mind will stay still and at equilibrium equanimous without latching onto any of these things at allOnce the mind is trained to a point of real strength its able to let go of the bodyFor this reason when we develop our goodness by practicing the recollection of the Buddha as our constant preoccupation well reach the point where we can let go of all attachmentsOur minds will enter the current of the Dhamma with true intuitive insight and well ultimately meet with the brightness coolness and ease Ive describedWhen youre sitting in concentration dont think that youre sitting here in this meditation hallTell yourself that youre sitting alone in the deep deep forestCut away all your commitments and concernsDont think about the group or about anyone at allThoughts of whats good whats bad what you have or what you lack you dont have to think themThink just about whats in your body and establish your mindfulness exclusively on the breathOr you can tell yourself that youre sitting facetoface with the Buddha so that you have to keep careful watch over the manners of the mindDont let it fidget around picking its ears and nose or scratching itself here and thereKeep the body straight and the mind focused steadily on the Buddha ie exclusively on your meditation word buddhoBe mindful with each and every inandout breathDont go slipping off anywhere elseIf you arent genuinely intent on what youre doing youre deceiving your teacher deceiving the people around you and deceiving yourself as wellThe deceit here is that you close your eyes and act like youre in concentration but the mind isnt still like the bodyWhen this is the case youll sufferThe results of not genuinely being intent are that things sometimes go well sometimes they dont sometimes youre aware sometimes youre notIn other words the good results youre looking for arent constantThats the first resultThe second is absentmindednessThe mind thinks about other people other things and doesnt stay with the body doesnt stay with the presentYoure like a person eating a mealYou intend for your hand to put rice in your mouth but you gaze around absentmindedlyYou think youre eating a spoonful of soup but it turns out to be a spoonful of pepper sauceYou reach for a sweet but grab and bite into a clod of dirt or a piece of gravel insteadOr you can make a comparison with a blind person eating a mealA person with good eyesight sends you your food telling you that This is riceThis is curryThis is a sweet but you dont take note of what she says and so you get them all mixed upThen you go blaming her for your own absentmindednessThe third result of not genuinely being intent is forgetfulnessYou lose track of your mindfulness lose track of the breath lose track of yourselfAll three of these results are obstacles to the practiceTheyre signs of not being sincere in your dutiesThere are two kinds of knowing genuine knowing and deceptive knowingGenuine knowing is what stays right here and now within you without going anywhere elseYou know when youre standing you know when youre lying down speaking thinking etcAs for deceptive knowing thats the knowledge going after labels and perceptionsLabels are an act of knowing but theyre not the knowing itselfTheyre like the shadow of knowingGenuine knowing is being mindful of the present seeing causes and effectsThis is discernmentFor this reason we should each try to train ourselves to give rise to discernment the genuine knowing that wont deceive us into falling for a mass of sufferingWe do this by training the mind to stay firmly in concentration by being mindful and circumspect in our breathing by being alert in our every movement by being genuinely intent in our duties and by showing respect for our teachers and for ourselvesThese are the factors that will lead us to the happiness and wellbeing to which we aspireThe Dhamma is what gives peace shelter and happiness to the worldIf the world were deprived of the Dhamma we couldnt find any peace here at allIf people individually or as a group have the Dhamma constantly in their hearts theyre like fresh green grass growing in a springfed meadow or mountain valley constantly watered by the rainIf people lack the Dhamma  if theyre evil or unskillful in their behavior  theyre like grass in the dry season or in a desert lying dead on the groundThey have nothing to attract the hearts of other people to like them or respect themInstead theyll simply get stepped all over and thrown awayTheyll reap nothing but suffering and misfortunePeople with the Dhamma in their hearts are like trees whose flowers are beautiful and fragrantEveryone wants to be near them to associate with themAs for people who are shoddy in their behavior theyre like the kind of tree whose flowers may be pretty but are surrounded by thorns or have no fragrance or are downright foul smellingOther people are sure to detest them and wont want to come nearThe Dhamma can also be compared to the flame of a lantern which by its nature is dazzling brightOur mind is like the globe around the lanternIf the globe hasnt been washed and is covered with soot then no matter how bright the light of the flame may be it wont be able to radiate that brightness outside of the globeIn the same way if our mind is clouded and obscured with evil intentions then no matter how much good we try to do it wont be clean or pure because our hearts are still soiled with defilements in the same way that the soot soils the globe of the lanternWeve come to this place which is a peaceful place so we should try to be peaceful and pure in our behavior pure in our words and deeds and pure in our thoughtsWhen were pure both inwardly and outwardly like this we fit in with the peacefulness of the placePeace comes from causes and gives rise to resultsIf the causes arent present the results wont comeThe kind of happiness coming from a lack of peacefulness lasts only as long as a quick catch in your breathBut the happiness coming from peace lasts for a long long timeIf where we live isnt peaceful it wont help us benefit from our activitiesFor instance if we want to read write or memorize a passage from a book well have a hard timeThis is why peacefulness is something very important that we should all work together to fosterOur body is like a large water jar the mind like the water in the jar and our defilements like sediment in the waterIf we take an alum crystal and swish it around in the water the bits of sediment will gather as a precipitate on the sides or bottom of the jar leaving the water clean and clearThe Dhamma is like an alum crystal that can make our minds clean and clearWhen we listen to the Dhamma and take it home to ponder so as to benefit from it it will filter out all our unskillful tendencies which are defilements so that they separate out as a precipitate in the mindWhen the Dhamma stays with the mind in this way then even when there are feelings of anger we wont get angry along with themWhen there are feelings of hatred we wont get worked up along with themWhen there are feelings of infatuation we wont get infatuated along with themBut even so these feelings are still lying in wait there in the mind which is why we have to develop higher forms of goodness so as to remove the precipitates completely from our water jarThe higher forms of goodness that we have to develop are the practices for giving rise to peace in the mindWhen the heart is at peace it gives rise to an inner quality within itself in the same way that water allowed to sit still will become more clearWe people have three instigators within us our eyes our ears and our mouthThis is on the physical levelOn the mental level the instigator within us is our heartThese are the things that create a lack of peace within usSo you have to be careful not to let poison into your system through any of these thingsIf you realize that youve ingested poison you have to spit it out right awayOtherwise itll harm youIn other words your eyes ears and mouth are areas where you have to exercise a lot of restraintNormally our eyes are always looking for trouble our ears are looking for trouble and our mouth has a habit of saying things that cause troubleTo speak in ways that wont cause trouble requires wisdom and discernmentWhen you have discernment then when you ingest good food you wont be harmedEven if you ingest poison you wont dieThe discernment Im referring to here is knowledge of past lives knowledge of how people die and are reborn and the knowledge that puts an end to the fermentation of defilement in the heartIf you dont yet have these kinds of discernment you have to be extra careful in looking after yourself so that you can gain knowledge of whats skillful and whats notIn looking after yourself you have to watch out for evil so that it doesnt arise watch out for your goodness so that it doesnt fall away and put your goodness to use so that it gives rise to benefitsWhen you speak speak in a way that leads to peacefulnessIf you speak in a way that gives rise to trouble its as if you had eaten poisonAnd in this way you harm not only yourself but other people as well in the same way as when you sprinkle poison in an aquarium of fighting fishOne fish bites another so that the wound becomes poisoned and when all the fish have bitten one another they end up floating dead like a raft on the surface of the waterSo when you realize that you still have greed anger and delusion in your mind you have to be extra careful in what you sayWhen youre mindful to speak only the things that should be said and hold back when youre about to say anything you shouldnt youll be looking out for your goodness to make sure it doesnt fall away at the same time that you prevent evil from arisingIn addition you have to watch out for your earsSometimes other people speak with good intentions but we hear them as badSometimes we speak with good intentions but other people misunderstandWhen this is the case its no different from playing a flute in the ears of a water buffaloIt serves no purpose at allWhen we live together in a group like this there are bound to be all kinds of sounds when we come into contact with one anotherIf you were to make a comparison were no different from an orchestra which has to include the sound of the oboes the sound of the gong the sound of the xylophones high sounds low sounds treble and bassIf all the instruments had the same sound there would be no fun in listening to the orchestra for a onesound orchestra wouldnt be pleasing at allIn the same way when lots of people live together there are bound to be good sounds and bad arising in the groupSo each of us has to look after his or her own heartDont let yourself feel anger or dislike for the bad sounds because when theres a lot of disliking its bound to turn to angerWhen theres a lot of anger itll turn to ill willWhen theres ill will itll lead to quarrels and troubleFor this reason we should spread thoughts of good will to people above us below us and on the same levelWhen people below us show disagreeable attitudes in their words or actions we should forgive themWhen we can do this well be contributing to the peace and calm of the groupOur human minds rarely have any time to rest and relaxWe all have things we keep thinking aboutYou could say that ever since weve learned human language weve kept on thinking without any time to stop and restThe mind keeps itself busy until it diesIf our bodies were this industrious wed all be millionairesBut when the mind doesnt have any time to rest its filled with the HindrancesThats why it knows no peaceSo were taught to practice concentration letting go of thoughts about sensualityIn other words we close off our sense doors so that the mind isnt involved with anything external and we set our mind still and tall in the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaWe dont let it fall down into any sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensations which are sensual objectsAs for sensual defilements we dont let the mind fall into passion aversion or delusionSometimes our concentration practice goes as we want it to and we get pleased and obliviousSometimes it doesnt go as wed like it to and we get irritated and annoyedThese are cases of passion and aversionAs for delusion sometimes when we sit we lose track of what were doing or where we areWe get distracted or absentminded and dont know whats going on good or bad right or wrongThis causes the mind to become dark and obscureSometimes we drift off into thoughts of the past and think about people who have done us wrong so that we fall into ill will wanting to get revenge and to settle an old scoreIn this way we harm ourselves by spoiling our practiceAll three of these defilements  passion aversion and delusion  are piles of dried timber just waiting to catch fire so we have to clear them completely out of the heartMindfulness and alertness are the quality of the BuddhaThe cool sense of happiness they give is the quality of the DhammaIf you can maintain that coolness until it hardens into a block of ice  in other words you make that goodness solid and strong in your heart  thats the quality of the SanghaOnce youve got a solid block of goodness like this you can pick it up and put it to any use you likeWhatever you say will give good resultsWhatever you do will give good resultsYour solid block of goodness will turn into a wishfulfilling gem bringing all sorts of happiness your wayWhen water is subjected to the heat of the sun or the heat of a fire to the point where it has evaporated away leaving just the dry kettle or pot can you say that thats the end of the waterActually it still exists simply that the heat has turned it into a vapor that has dispersed into the airSo you cant say that the water no longer existsIt still exists somewhere else in another conditionThe same holds true with the mindWhen the body dies the mind doesnt die along with itIt simply moves to a new place in line with your good or bad kammaThe fact that it still exists in another condition thats what we mean when we say that it doesnt dieStill when its subjected to a lot of fire it degeneratesJust like the body when the body is subjected to the fires of aging illness and death it degeneratesWhen the mind is subjected to the fires of defilement  passion aversion and delusion  it degeneratesThe more these three masses of flame burn away at the mind the more it degenerates in terms of its goodnessIts because we have fire burning the body and the mind from both sides that they end up having to fall apart and going their separate directionsThis we call the process of birth and deathSo if you want happiness you have to train the heart to get rid of its defilementsOnly then will you be done with birth and deathBut if you were to ask where that place of no birth and no death is located it would be hard to point outJust like pointing at an albino elephant or water buffalo to get a blind person to look at it it would be a waste of effortIn the same way describing the place of no birth and no death so that an ignorant person would understand it is a waste of timeOnly when you develop discernment will you understand where people go after they die and whether or not theres really a place of no birth and no deathThis is because a person of discernment has an inner eye  the ñanacakkhu or eye of knowledgeWhat this means is that he or she has seen the true DhammaThats what gives such a person the ability to understand this issueThe Buddha said Whoever sees the Dhamma sees me In other words when we see the Dhamma that doesnt die well be able to see those who dont die what it is that doesnt dieSo when we reach the Dhamma that doesnt die we meet with the place that doesnt dieAs long as we havent met with that place we have to keep practicing so as to give rise to the eye of the mindThe problem is that even though most of us have clear eyesight our minds are still dark and blurryThe Dhamma of the Buddha that were taught every day is like a lens for casting some light into the eye of the mind so that we can feel our way along without falling into pits or wellsEven then though our minds are still blurryThis is why we have so many differing opinions our eyes are still blurry  but at least were not blindWe can still see vague shapes and shadowsTheres a saying samanañca dassanam etammangalamuttamamSeeing a contemplative is the highest blessing What this means is that whoever sees a noble one  a streamenterer a oncereturner a nonreturner or an arahant  sees a grand auspicious sightBut you really have to see a genuine noble one for this to be trueSo where are you going to look for a noble oneWhat sorts of features help you recognize a noble oneIf you look at a noble one from the outside theres no way you can know for sureThe only way to know for sure is to practice the Dhamma so as to give rise to the qualities of a noble one within yourselfAs long as you dont have those qualities within you you cant see a genuine noble oneYour eyes are still blurry so everything you see is blurryYour mind is an ordinary mind so everywhere you look all you can see are ordinary peopleTo help us see the truth in this way the Buddha teaches three guidelines for practiceWith regard to the first guideline  having a sense of moderation in consuming food  there are two kinds of consumption consuming food for the body and consuming food for the mindTwo sorts of food for the body should be avoided anything thats been obtained through bad kamma and anything that doesnt really nourish the bodyWhen you avoid these two sorts of food thats called having a sense of moderation in consuming foodAs for food for the mind there are three kindsA person without a sense of moderation in food is like an ill person who doesnt know what foods will aggravate his illnessHes bound to have a short life and an early deathNot only that he also creates burdens for the people around him his parents spouse children and relativesTheyre put to all sorts of troubleWhen he dies they have to find the money to pay for the funeral and make merit to dedicate to himBefore he dies they have to pay for medical careThe doctors and nurses have to look after him until way late into the night giving him medicine cleaning up his urine and feces all kinds of thingsBut if you gain a sense of how to look after yourself and are careful about how you consume your food youll have few diseasesYou yourself will be at ease and the people around you wont be burdenedThe five Hindrances are like germsIf they get established in your heart theyll multiply and spread and eat away at your heart continually to the point where you mind falls to such a low level that you cant lift it up againThe food of consciousness means the consciousness at the six sense doors that arises when sights strike the eyes sounds strike the ears and so forthPleasing sights are like sugar molasses or honey which are sure to be teeming with ants gnats and fliesDisagreeable sights are like filth In addition to carrying germs theyre sure to attract all sorts of other bad things too because theyre crawling with flies and wormsIf we dont notice the ants flies and filth well go ahead and eat the food  and it will be toxic to our healthLike a person without any teeth who finds chicken bones in his food he cant chew them so he tries to swallow them whole and ends up with his eyes bulging out of their socketsIf you arent discerning youll gobble down the filth together with the worms and smelly parts and the sugar together with the ants and fliesSo you have to pay careful attentionBefore you eat look to see what you can handle and what you cant what you have to be wary of and what you dontThis is called having a knife and a chopping board for your foodWhen you examine things for yourself in this way youll get to eat food thats well prepared and cooked  not like a monster that eats things rawIf you dont examine things youll misunderstand whats happening thinking that good things are bad and bad things are goodThe mind wont be clear about these things because you lack mindfulness and discernmentYoull swallow toxic food right into your heartThis is called being very greedy very deluded because youre careless in your eating and this creates hazards for your heartThe same holds true with the food of earconsciousnessThe sounds you like are like sugar or delicious sweetsThe sounds you dont like are food thats rotten and spoiledIf you dont use discernment dont use restraint and dont pay proper attention youll end up eating food thats all rotten and wormyWhatevers sweet youll swallow down whole and all the ants worms and flies will go down with itThis will cause pain and trouble for your intestines and turmoil for your heartYour heart is already in poor health and yet you go gobbling down things that are toxicWhen this happens no one can cure you but you yourselfThe same thing applies in the area of the nose tongue body and mindWhatever food you plan to swallow you first have to pay careful attention as monks do when they chant the passage for reflection before using any of the four requisitesAt the same time we have to reflect on whether the person bringing us these things suffers from wrong views and practices wrong livelihood as wellOtherwise our own virtues will be compromisedSo we have to be firmly intent using mindfulness to gain evidence and our discernment to pass judgmentThat way well get to eat food thats just and fairAnyone who doesnt use mindfulness and discernment is like an ogre that eats dead things rotten things and rawBones wings skins and feathers everything you swallow right down like a savage who doesnt know any betterScientists nowadays are smartThey can take things you normally couldnt eat and then distil and process them so that you can eat them and theyre good for you tooPeople without discernment who allow themselves to get overcome with greed and hunger will eat everything wings tails bones finsThe things they like get stuck in their heartsThe things they dont like get stuck in their heartsWherever they go its as if they have bones stuck in their throatsBut if we have virtue concentration and discernment in our consumption of the food of consciousness its as if we have a fire a stove and a knife to prepare our food the right wayThe next kind of food is the food of mental intentionsIf we set our hearts on the wrong things it can be toxic to usIf you sit here thinking about someone you hate or who makes you angry telling yourself that if you meet that person youll have to say this or that this is called setting your heart on the wrong objectIf you set your heart on the right things it will flow in the right directionForgetfulness and delusion wont be able to ariseFor instance you can think about the virtues or the generosity youve practiced or about your teachersThis is called setting your heart on the right objectThe heart will begin to blossomJust like the people in the time of the Buddha when their hearts were inclined toward recollection of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha they entered the refuge of the noble attainmentsFor this reason we should incline our hearts toward the people or things that will cause our hearts to flourish and growThis is what will give them the strength they need to gain release from the Hindrances which are like curtains of fog or like worms that swarm over and eat away at the heartThis is what will give us the strength to shoot our way up to the paths and fruitions leading to nibbanaIn this way well be good cooks for ourselvesBut if we dont know how to chop boil or fry our own food well have to eat it raw just like a monsterThe third mouthful of food is the food of contactWhatever sights come in by way of the eyes whatever sounds come in by way of the ears whatever smells comes in by way of the nose and so forth you have to be carefulPay attention at all times to whatever will be of use and avoid anything poisonousWhatever will be meritorious or skillful even if it may be painful you have to endure and stick with it as when you have to endure heat cold or rain in the practiceAs for anything that will be unskillful you have to shake it right offThe same applies to the ideas that make contact in the mindWhen you can act in this way good food will keep flowing in to benefit your eyes ears nose tongue and body and will seep in to bathe your heartYoull be secluded from evil secluded from defilementsAdhicitte ca ayogo Youll be committed to the heightened mindMind states heading to the level of the lower realms will disappear and those of the noble ones will arise in their placeThe mind will be in a firm steady state heading straight for nibbanaThats how it gets beyond the reach of the fires that consume the cosmosThis is a work in progressEventually I hope to make available in English a much larger collection of Ajaan Lees talks to add to the collections already available Lessons in Samadhi Food for Thought Inner Strength and The Skill of ReleaseBut for the moment in keeping with the title of the collection Id like to start out smallThe passages translated here had their beginnings in talks that Ajaan Lee gave to groups of people while they were meditatingIn some cases the people were his followers in others total strangersIn every case Ajaan Lee found it necessary to cover the sorts of questions that occur to people new to meditation  Why meditateHow should I meditateAnd why in that particular way and in his own style he provided not only straightforward answers to these questions but also vivid analogies to help his listeners relate their meditation to familiar activities so that they would feel less intimidated by the uncharted areas of the minds they were trying to tameOne aspect of Ajaan Lees teachings that might strike you as foreign is his analysis of the body into four properties earth fire water and windThis mode of analysis dates back to the time of the Buddha although Ajaan Lee develops it in a distinctive wayThink of this analysis not as an attempt at biology or chemistry  the sciences we use to analyze the body from the outside  but as a way of analyzing how the body feels from the insideThis is an aspect of awareness that we often overlook and that in English at least we have a poor vocabulary for describingAs you gain through meditation a greater familiarity with this aspect of your awareness youll come to see how useful Ajaan Lees method of analysis isThe passages included here have taken a fairly circuitous route from Ajaan Lees mouth to your eyesOne of his followers  a nun Mae Chii Arun Abhivanna  took notes during the talks from which she later worked up reconstructed versions of what Ajaan Lee had saidAjaan Lee had a chance to review and revise the reconstructions of the talks dated prior toAs for the talks made after that year Mae Chii Arun didnt get around to making reconstructions until after Ajaan Lees death in and so these were printed without his inputAlthough the talks make for great reading they make for even better listeningIf you meditate with a group of friends try arranging for one member of the group to read a passage while the others are meditatingIn that way you can best recreate the context for which the talks were originally intendedFor people to be happy or sad good or bad all depends on the heartThe heart is whats in charge the most important thing to be found in our bodyThats because its lasting and responsible for all the good and evil we doAs for the body it knows nothing of pleasure or pain happiness or sadness and its not at all responsible for anyones good or evil actionsWhy is thatBecause the body isnt lastingIts emptyTo say that its empty means that as soon as its deprived of breath its four properties of earth water wind and fire separate from one another and return to their original natureThe parts coming from the earth property return to be earth as they originally wereThe parts coming from the water property return to be water as they originally wereThe parts coming from the wind and fire properties return to be wind and fire as they originally wereTheres nothing about them thats woman or man good or bad This is why were taught rupam aniccam physical form is inconstantRupam dukkham its hard to bearRupam anatta its notself empty and doesnt stay under anyones controlEven if we try to forbid it from growing old growing sick and dying it wont behave in line with our wishesIt has to fall in line with the processes of arising and wasting away in accordance with the nature of natural fabricationsThis applies to everyoneBut you cant say that the body is entirely anatta for some parts of it are attaIn other words they lie somewhat under our controlFor instance if you want the body to walk itll walkIf you want it to lie down itll lie downIf you want it to eat itll eatIf you want it to take a bath itll take a bathThis shows that it lies somewhat under your controlSo the body is both anatta and attaBut even so both aspects are equal in the sense that theyre empty and not responsible for the good or evil things we doNo matter how much good or evil you do the body doesnt have any part in the rewardsWhen it dies it gets cremated and turns into ashes either wayIts not responsible for anyones happiness or sadness at allWhen people do good or evil the results of their good and evil all fall to their own mindsThe mind is whats responsible for all our actions and its the one that experiences the results of its actions as wellThis is why the Buddha taught us to cleanse our hearts and minds to make them pure as a way of leading us to future happinessWhat do we use to cleanse the heart and mindWe cleanse the heart and mind with skillfulness  in other words by developing skillful qualities within it through practicing concentrationWe cut away all the thoughts of greed anger and delusion within the mind such as the Hindrances of sensual desire ill will torpor  lethargy restlessness  anxiety and doubtAll of these qualities are things that soil the mindWhen the mind is soiled in this way its bound to sufferIts headed for darkness because of its own actionsOur unskillful actions can be divided into the different ways theyre darkSome are dark like the darkness of night ie totally devoid of any brightnessSome are dark like clouds ie they alternate between being dark and bright just as when the moon is bright at some times and covered by clouds at othersSome of our unskillfulness is dark like haze obscuring all our vision whether by day or by nightThis third kind of unskillfulness is ignorance or avijjaIt obscures the mind at all times so that we cant recognize which of the minds objects are past which are future and which are presentThis is why the mind concerns itself with past present and future so that it cant stay firmly in any one placeIt has no certainty about anythingThis is ignoranceFrom ignorance comes craving the cause of all stress and sufferingTo get rid of this haze we have to meditate getting rid of thoughts and concepts of past and future by seeing them as inconstant stressful and notself seeing all the aggregates of form feeling perception thoughtfabrication and consciousness as inconstant stressful and notself to the point where there is no past no future no presentThats when the mind is released from the clouds and haze of its Hindrances and enters into brightnessThere are two kinds of people in the worldSome are like those with good eyesTheyre the ones who develop skillful qualities within themselves and so they see the brightness of the world both by day and by nightThen there are those who dont develop skillful mental qualitiesTheyre like people born blind even though the light of the sun and moon may be shining these people are in the darkness  in this case the darkness of their own mindsThis is why the Buddha taught us to remove the darkness from our minds to remove our minds from darkness as in the Pali versewhich means Having abandoned dark qualities the wise person develops the bright When people develop brightness within themselves they can use that brightness to illuminate all their activitiesThis will bring them success in all they doBut if theyre in the dark its as if they were blind so that the things they do wont succeed in full measureFor example they may listen to the Dhamma but if their minds are still wandering out all over the place its as if they were obscured by the clouds and haze of their HindrancesThis is why were taught to practice tranquillity meditation fixing the mind on a single preoccupationTell yourself that the qualities of the Buddha arent separate from the qualities of the Dhamma which arent separate from the qualities of the SanghaTheyre actually one and the same as the Pali verse tells usAlthough the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha may be different as objects seemingly separate from one another they are actually one in meaningThus when we make the mind firm in its awakened awareness it contains the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha all in oneThats when our concentration will develop in the proper waySo I ask that you abandon unskillful mental qualities and cleanse the mind so that its clean and pureBrightness will then arise within your heartThis way youll experience ease and happiness without a doubt as the Pali passage guarantees Citte sankilitthe duggati patikankhaCitte asankilitthe sugati patikankhaWhen the mind is defiled a bad destination can be expectedWhen the mind is undefiled a happy destination can be expectedOur discernment is like light and there are three levels to it lowlevel discernment which is like the light of a torch intermediate discernment which is like the light of a candle or a kerosene lantern and highlevel discernment which is like electric lightTo get light from a torch you need to use a lot of fuelAnd even though its bright it creates smokeThis is like the discernment that comes from being generous it requires a lot of financial resources and you sometimes have to contend with resistance from people outsideThe light of a candle or gas lantern is like the discernment that comes from observing the preceptsYou have to exercise a lot of care and use your powers of endurance to keep them pureLanternlight requires fuel and a wickAs for candlelight it requires a wick and some waxIf you have wax but no wick you cant get any lightAnd both lanternlight and candlelight create smoke and soot so neither of them counts as being entirely goodAs for electric discernment theres no need for fuel and it doesnt create smoke or sootIts easy to use whenever you want it by day or by night just flip on the switchThis refers to the discernment that comes from developing concentrationThe power of the mind when its pure and firmly established gives rise to the light of knowledge  liberating insight  enabling us to see events clearly both in the area of the world and of the DhammaWhen we can make the mind clean and pure it gives rise to concentration and to the light of discernment  paññapajjoto  which is like electric light or the light of the sun which shines all twelve hours of the dayThis kind of discernment is the discernment of the noble onesAll three forms of merit  generosity virtue and meditation  depend on discernmentWhen we develop discernment well know how to look for merit on our ownAnd what kind of light will we want  torch light candlelight lanternlight or electric lightDeath is like darknessWhen the time comes to die outside light wont be of any use to usOur speech hands feet arms and legs wont be of any use to usThey wont be able to help us at allOur eyes wont be able to see any lightNo one will hear what we have to sayOur hands and feet wont be able to moveOur possessions wont be able to help usThe only resource that will be able to help us is our discernment making sure that greed aversion and delusion dont get provoked maintaining the mind in a state free from greed free from aversion free from delusionWell be able to separate these three things  body mind and defilement  out from one another in the same way that we separate the wick of a candle from its waxThe fire of defilement will then have to go out because the wick and the wax lie in separate places and dont make contactIn the same way if we can separate the body from the mind our normal awareness will have to go outBut when it goes out that doesnt mean that awareness is annihilatedIts still there but as a special form of awareness that doesnt depend on the body or mind and yet can still be awareIts just like fire going out from a candle its not annihilatedTheres still plenty of fire potential left in the worldIts there by its nature simply that it isnt involved with any fuelThis kind of fire is better than the kind that requires fuel because it doesnt wear anything outIts simply there by its natureThis kind of merit is more wonderful than anything elseIf we can separate the body the mind and defilement from one another therell be no more heatThe mind wont be hot and instead will be cool at all timesThe light of fire arises from the spinning of wavesIf there are no waves therell be no spinningThe waves are like defilementIf we can cut through the waves the spinning will stopThere will be no more birthGreed aversion and delusion are like waves  or like the wick of a candleIf we cut out the wick leaving only the wax fire will have no place to catch hold and so will have to go outWhen the candle goes out its like the death of human beings the fire leaves the candle but the fire potential isnt annihilatedIn the same way the mind that goes out from the body isnt annihilatedIf it can remain on its own without having to depend on a body it doesnt appear in any way shape or form anywhere at allThats the awareness of nibbanaThis is the kind of awareness thats really like electric lightWhenever we want it its there for us to knowSometimes even if we dont want to know we still end up knowingAs for ordinary people even if they want to know things they often dont know they often dont see even when they want to seeThats like torch light or candlelight if theres no fuel theres no way it can be brightThis is why were taught to train our minds to be firmly established in concentration  for the mind welltrained is what gives rise to the light of discernment that doesnt get deluded the discernment that knows for sureClinging is the cause of all suffering and stressIts what gives rise to states of becoming and birthIts not at all safeWhatever appears and takes shape is bound to create sufferingJust as when a persons money appears in a way that other people can see there are bound to be thieves who will steal it awayWhen you have money youre afraid if people see itYoure afraid even if they dontIn the same way when people cling to the five aggregates as their self in this world they sufferWhen they die and go to the next world they suffer stillThe clinging we feel has three kinds or three time frames past present and futureIn each time frame there are five aggregates which means that each of us has aggregatesAnd when we have so many aggregates to carry around its no wonder we sufferWhen we look ahead we start wondering If I live until or whats it going to be likeIf I fall into poverty what will I do When we think like this we start worrying in all kinds of waysIf we think about good things we get enthralledIf we think about bad things we get disheartenedSome people think about bad things so much that they get really discouraged and despondentThats because they cling to their thoughts and preoccupationsThis is called having five heavy stones placed in front of usThen we turn around and look behind us When we die what will happen to our children and grandchildren We might think of giving them part of the family fortune so that theyll be able to set themselves up in lifeBut then we think of how foolish they can beIf they take our family fortune and gamble it all away what will we do When we think like this it makes us discouragedOther times we think of our own good qualities our childrens good qualities in the present and it makes us happyThats another five heavy stonesSo altogether we have five stones in front of us five stones behind us and five stones in the presentOur right hand clings to physical phenomena our left hand to mental phenomenaWe hold on to form feeling perception thoughtconstructs and consciousness as our selfSo we carry a burden in our right hand a burden in our left hand and more burdens placed on a pole over our shoulderIf we keep carrying these things around without ever putting them down well meet with nothing but sufferingThen we grab onto the suffering so that we suffer even more to the point where our faces are all contorted and our shoulders twisted out of shapeThis is why the Buddha had such compassion for us and taught us to cago patinissago to relinquish and let goWhoever doesnt put down the pole on his or her shoulder will never get awayIf we can first let go of our thoughts of past and future things will be somewhat lighterIf were only carrying things in our hands theres some hope that well be able to keep goingIn other words if we dont practice concentration keeping our minds still and away from the Hindrances were still carrying a pole over our shoulders with burdens in front of us and behind us all because we cant let go of our thoughts of past and futureThoughts of past and future are things we dont need to think aboutWhether theyre our own affairs the affairs of our children or grandchildren or our business or financial affairs when weve come to meditate like this theres no need to think about anything at allBe intent on sitting stillKeep your body straight focus on watching only the present  the breath  and light will appearEven though your right and left hands are still holding onto physical and mental phenomena at least youve put down both burdens that were on your shouldersAs for the physical phenomena that are still heavy thats because the King of Death keeps sprinkling poison on themFor example our eyes At first they are clearEverything we see is sharp and brightBut then the King of Death sprinkles his poison in them making them murky and dark or giving us cataractsSo we have to go running to have our eyes examined to get glasses for them to put medicine in them to go in for surgeryThey make us suffer in every way so that our tiny little eyes start weighing as much as a fist in the faceAs for our ears at first they can hear all kinds of soundsThen the King of Death comes and sprinkles his poison in them so that they start ringing or going deafWe can hardly hear what other people are saying we cant understand what theyre getting at and this makes us irritableThey say bad things and to us they sound goodOr they say good things and to us they sound badWe get things right and wrong and this gives rise to quarrels and disagreementsThe same with our noseAt first its in good shape but then the King of Death sprinkles poison in it so that tumors and growths developWe have to go looking for medicinal snuff and inhalers or for doctors to zap the growths with electricityOur nose starts smelling bad and disfigures our faceAs for the tongue body and mind they pile us high with pain in just the same wayThis is why were taught rupam aniccam all physical forms are unstable and inconstantIf we get stuck on thinking about these things it sets us on fireOur skin and flesh grow flabby and wrinkled our backs get bent and as we grow older like this its a burden both to our own hearts and to the hearts of our children and grandchildrenIn addition its a burden in terms of the money we need to spend to look after ourselvesWhoever holds onto unstable things as being his or her self will have to walk in an unstable wayMost of us tend to cling to the body and other physical things as being oursSometimes we cling to mental phenomena  feelings perceptions thoughtconstructs and consciousness  as being oursThis is called carrying things in both handsStill its better than carrying loads on a pole over our shoulder for as long as our burdens are only in our hands were able to sit or lie downBut if we have burdens on a pole over our shoulder we cant sit downWe have to keep standingFor this reason we should train our hearts to be peaceful and still  in other words to develop concentrationWhen the hearts tranquil and still discernment will ariseWhen discernment arises well understand our own birth When we were born we didnt bring along even a single tooth or piece of clothHowever we came is how well have to returnWe wont be able to take a single thing along with us aside from the good and evil that will take us to be reborn in good or bad destinations or that will send us to nibbanaPeople who can meditate in this way will become light and unburdened for theyll be able to let go of what theyre carrying in their handsIn that way theyll be happy for theyve received three jewels to adorn themselvesWhen they get to the other side theyll be able to sell them for a good priceAs long as they stay here theyll have good things to dress up withWhoever has the intelligence to practice letting go in this way will receive wealth thats of value everywhere  like gold No matter what country you go to gold is recognized as having valueIts not like paper money which is recognized only in your own countryFor this reason when we can train the mind to let go  so that its released from holding on to the future the past and the present  its as if weve received an entire ingot of pure goldWell be happy at all timesBut if were stupid enough to hold onto things as our own well set the mind on fire so that it wont know any peaceThis is why the Buddha has warned us Whoever clings to physical or mental phenomena or to mental labels and thoughts will have to be so burdened that they wont be able to get anywhereUltimately theyll have to die stuck in the world like the monkey who stole melons from the old couples field and ended up getting stuck in a tar trap and dying on the spotIts a story they tell as an analogy of how painful and difficult clinging can beThe story goes like this Once an old couple lived at the edge of the forest near the foot of a mountainIt so happened that their rice fields were flooded and they couldnt grow any rice so they cleared fields on the mountainside and planted them with corn beans watermelons and cantaloupes to have enough food to make it through the yearAt night though porcupines and other animals kept coming to eat their crops while during the day birds and monkeys would come and harass themSo eventually the old couple decided that theyd have to sleep out in the fields to keep watch over them and set out traps to protect themThe old man would keep watch at night while the old woman would keep watch by dayOne day a troop of monkeys came and invaded the fieldNo matter how much the old woman tried to chase them away they wouldnt leave her aloneTheyd jump from that tree to this teasing and pestering her to the point where she had no time for her midday restSo she came up with an ideaShe went into the forest and found some tree sap that she boiled until it was a nice sticky tarThen she took the tar and spread it all over any trees or stumps that the monkeys liked to use as their perchesThe next day a huge troop of monkeys came stealing watermelons and cantaloupes and eating their fillNow one of the monkeys a female had two babiesOne of her babies was sick so she left it home with her husband for him to look after while she came along with the troop with the other baby hanging down in front of her chestWhile eating the melons she thought of her sick baby so she decided to take some back for the baby and her husbandWhen she had eaten her fill she stuffed two tiny melons into her cheeks for her baby and grabbed a largish melon that she hugged to her chest for her husbandAs for the baby hanging in front of her she had it hang onto her backJust as she was all set to go the old woman  carrying a shovel  happened to come across the monkeys and gave chaseStartled the monkeys all ran off  except for the mother monkey who could do nothing but jump back and forth because she was so weighed down weighed down in front weighed down in back weighed down in her mouthShe tried calling for help but no sound came outShe happened to jump up onto a stump that the old woman had smeared with a thick soft glob of tarThe old woman came straight at her with the shovel so the monkey decided to jump away but she couldnt budgeHer tail was curled up and stuck in the tarShe tried to pry her tail loose with one of her paws but the paw got stuckShe used her other paw to pry off the tar but that one got stuck tooSeeing that the tar on her paw was black and sticky she sniffed it only to get her paw stuck to her noseWith one of her back feet she tried to push herself off the stump but the foot got stuckThen she used the other foot to wipe the first one off but her two feet got stuck together as if they were tied up with a ropeShe couldnt moveAll she could do was look around grimacing just like a monkeyAfter a moments thought she bent down and bit the tar in furious angerShe wanted to bite the old woman but all she could do was bend down and bite tarAs for the old woman when she saw the monkey all stuck in the tar like this she called the old man to come and seeThen the two of them found a red ants nest and broke it over the monkeyThen they set fire to her hair tormenting her there on the stumpFinally one of them took a hoe handle while the other took a shovel handle and the two of them beat the monkeys  mother and baby  to a miserable deathThis is the result of clinging and attachment clinging to the future clinging to the past clinging to the present the baby on her back and the melon she was holding to her chestThats why she had to suffer so muchFor this reason the Buddha taught us to let go of labels and thoughts of past and future and all five aggregates in the presentPhysical phenomena are like the melon the monkey held to her chest mental phenomena like the baby hanging from her backWe cant get away because of our heavy burdensWhoever clings is said to be heavily burdenedAs long as were alive we have trouble finding true goodnessWhen we die we have heavy burdens lying in our wayThis is why the Buddha teaches us to let goDont grasp onto thoughts of past future or presentMake the mind like water on a lotus leaf which doesnt seep inIt reaches a quality that doesnt die doesnt come back to be born in this world or any otherFree from suffering and stress it reaches the highest most excellent easeSo we should all try our best to lighten our burdensLetting goOne of the important reasons why the Buddha taught the Dhamma was to teach us to let go not to hold on to thingsThe more we really know the Dhamma the more we can let goThose who know a little can let go of a little those who know a lot can let go of a lotAs a first step were taught dana  to be generous to give donations  as a strategy for getting us to learn how to let goThe next step is caga  renouncing rights of possession  which is letting go at a higher level than danaAnd finally on a more refined level were taught to relinquish all our upadhi or the acquisitiondefilements in the mindThis is the level on which we examine and explore until we can gain total releaseDana means giving away material thingsIf we dont give them away theyre hard to let goFor the most part if we dont give things away we hold rights over them and regard them as belonging to usBut if we give them away we no longer have any rights over themThings we hold onto are dangerousThey can cause us harmThey cause harm to people who steal them from usAnd once those people have stolen them then they claim rights over themThe Buddha saw these dangers which is why he taught us to be generous to learn how to give things awayPeople who develop the habit of being generous reap many rewardsTheir act of generosity comes back to them both in the present and on into the futureThey have lots of friendsOther people trust themTheir hearts are light  they arent weighed down with worries about looking after the things theyve given awayAnd these same results will keep coming in the future just as when we have a bucket of rice grains if we plant them in a field well reap ten buckets of rice in returnThe same holds true with the goodness we develop in this lifetimeIt gives enormous returnsThats how people of discernment understand itCaga is the next stepDana is something that even crazy people can do but caga is a type of giving that only wise people can do because their sense of personal possession has to end immediately in the act of givingThey see that all material things are common property things dont really belong to us they dont really belong to other peopleIf you see things as belonging to you thats addiction to sensualityIf you see things as belonging to others thats addiction to selfafflictionWhen were born we didnt bring anything along with us when we cameWhen we die we wont take anything along when we goSo what really belongs to usOur sense of possession has to fall away from the heart if our giving is to count as cagaThe third level of letting go is relinquishing whats in the heartWhether or not we give things away we let go of them in the heart every dayWe let go of the things we haveWe let go of the things we dont haveJust as a person has to wash his mouth and hands every day after he eats if he wants to stay clean at all timesWhat this means is that were not willing to let anything act as an enemy to the heart by making us stingy or graspingIf we dont do this were the type of person who doesnt wash up after a mealWere not cleanWe stay asleep without ever waking upBut when we let go in this way its called viragadhamma or dispassionThe lower levels of letting go are things we can do only from time to timeDispassion is something we can develop alwaysOrdinarily our defilements tie us down hand and foot and then nail us to the floorIts hard to get free which is why we need a high level of skill called bhavanamayapañña  the discernment that comes from developing the mind in meditation  to gain releaseDispassion is a mental quality thats really delicious and nourishingWhoever hasnt reached this level of the Dhamma has eaten only the rind of the fruit without knowing the taste and nourishment of the fleshThe good part of the flesh lies deepThe upadhikilesas or acquisitiondefilements in the mind are ignorance craving and clingingIf we reach the level where we see the Dhamma for ourselves within us then we take responsibility for ourselvesWe can take care of these things on our own just as when we come of age in terms of the lawIf we can get our minds into the first jhana we can let go of the five hindrancesMost of us are like inexperienced children when we eat fish or chicken we eat the bones along with the flesh because we havent developed any intuitive insightWhen this insight arises its more dazzling than the light of a fire sharper than a spearIt can consume anything meat bones rice husks  anything  because its smart enough to pound everything into a powderIt can consume sights sounds smells flavors tactile sensations and ideasGood or bad it isnt pickyIt can eat them allIf people praise us we can use it to nourish the heartIf they criticize us we can use it to nourish the heartEven if the body is in terrible pain the heart can be at its ease for it has all the utensils it needs to fix its food properly grinders mixers steamers pots and pansThe fog of ignorance will scatterEverything that ties us down  the nails of the five clingingaggregates the three ropes and the eight chains of the affairs of the world  gain loss status loss of status praise criticism pleasure and pain  will all fall awayStupid people think that staying in jail is comfortable which is why they keep on doing more and more evilThey see the world as pleasant and so theyre like prisoners who dont want to get out of jailAs for people with discernment theyre like the caged quail who keeps looking for a way to get out of the cageAs a result the chains that hold them down will fall away one link at a timeThe eight affairs of the world are like the chains put on criminals to keep them boundStupid people think these chains are necklaces of gold to wear as ornamentsActually theyre things that defile the mindPeople who get tied down by them will never get away because theyre afraid theyll lose their wealth and status afraid of criticism and painAnyone who is stuck on pleasure who is afraid of criticism will never manage to come to the monastery to practiceThe Buddha saw that were like monkeys tied to a chainIf we dont develop liberating insight well never get free from our chainsWell never make it to dispassionIn the first stage we let go of evil and start doing goodIn the second stage we let go of evil and some forms of goodIn the third stage we let go of everything good and evil because everything is fabricated by nature and thus undependableWe do good but were not attached to itWhen you let go you have do it intelligently and not in a ruinous way  ie by not doing goodYou cant hold on even to your opinions much less to material thingsWhen you do good you do it for the sake of the living beings of the world for your children and grandchildrenYou do everything in the best way possible but youre not attached to it because you know that all things fabricated are inconstantThis way your heart can be clear and bright like a jewelIf you get caught up on criticism or praise youre foolishIts like drinking other peoples salivaWhen you act rightly there are people who will say that youre right and those who will say that youre wrongWhen you act wrong there are people who will say youre wrong and those who will say youre rightTheres nothing constant about good or bad for theyre all nothing but fabricationsIn brief there are three principles that are really basic to meditationThe right intention You have to make up your mind that youre going to let go of all thoughts and preoccupations dealing with the worldYou arent going to keep them to think aboutEvery thought and concept dealing with the past or future is an affair of the world and not of the DhammaMake up your mind that youre going to do one thing right now the work of the religion and nothing elseIn other words youre going to work on the immediate presentThis is called the right intentionThe right object This means the right theme or focal point for the mindThe theme here is dhatuvavatthana or resolution into the properties one of the themes in taking the body as a frame of referenceIn short were going to look at the four properties that make up the body the properties of earth water wind and fireThe earth property covers the hard parts of the body such as the bonesThe water property covers the liquid parts such as urine saliva blood and pusThe fire property covers the heat and warmth in the bodyThe wind property covers the feelings of energy that flow in the body such as the breathOf all these properties the most important one is the wind property or the breathIf other parts of the body get damaged  say if our eyes go blind our ears go deaf our arms and legs get broken  it can still surviveBut if it doesnt have any breath it cant lastItll have to dieSo the breath is an important object because it forms a basis for our awarenessThe right quality This means the feelings of comfort or discomfort that arise in the bodyWhen you take care of the inandout breath so that it flows freely through the various parts of the body itll give rise to resultsTake good note of whether the results that the body and mind reap from the breath are good or badDoes the body feel open and at ease or does it feel tight and constrictedDoes the mind feel calm quiet and pleasant or is it irritable distracted and chaoticIf the body and mind feel at ease that counts as good resultsIf the opposite is true then that counts as bad resultsSo you have to gain a sense of how to adjust the breath so that it becomes comfortableAs for the right qualities of the mind those are mindfulness and alertnessTry to keep following these three basic principles every time you practice concentrationOnly then will you get results that are full and correctAs for the rewards of concentration there are lots of themThey arise in line with the power of the mind of the person meditating as Ill explain at a later dateIf youve never meditated these two easy principles are all you have to understand Think of the qualities of the Buddha and think of bringing them into your mindWhat this means is be mindful to make the mind firmly established solely in the breath without forgetting it or letting yourself get distractedNot forgetting the breath means being mindful of the inandout breath at all timesNot getting distracted means that you dont grab hold of anything else to think aboutIf the mind is focused but youre thinking about something else its not called Right ConcentrationYour mindfulness has to keep within the bounds of the work youre doing in other words staying with the breathDont put pressure on the breath tense it up or hold itLet it flow easily and comfortably as when you put a fresh egg in cotton battingIf you dont throw it or push it down the egg wont get dented or crackedThis way your meditation will progress smoothlyThe breath is one thing mindfulness is another and your awareness still anotherYou have to twist these three strands together so that they dont break away from one anotherIn other words your awareness has to stay with the act of mindfulness thinking about the breathAnd both your awareness and mindfulness have to stay with the breathOnly then can you say that these things are factors of meditationWhen you can twist these three strands into a single rope focus your awareness on observing the inandout breath to see whether its comfortable or not expansive or confined broad or narrowWhichever way of breathing feels comfortable keep breathing in that wayIf the breath isnt comfortable keep changing it until it isIf you force the mind too much its bound to pop awayIf you loosen your grip too much its going to get lostSo try to tend to it in a way thats just rightThe important point is that your mindfulness and alertness be circumspect making adjustments throughout the breathDont let the mind go flowing out after other preoccupationsMindfulness is like a person whos awake and aliveIf the mind lacks mindfulness its like were sleeping with dead bodies in a cemeteryTheres nothing but foul smells and fearThis is why were taught to be mindful of ourselves in the present moment at all timesCut away all thoughts of past and future without grabbing onto them to think about for these things are deceitful and illusory like spirits and demonsThey waste your time and pull you downSo be aware simply of the breath for the breath is what gives life and leads you to higher happinessMindfulness is like a magic soap that scrubs the breathAlertness is another bar of magic soap for scrubbing the mindIf you constantly have mindfulness and alertness in conjunction with the breath and the mind your body and mind will be valuable and pure so that as long as you live in the world youll be at your ease when you die you wont be put to difficultiesIf the mind is focused but forgets the breath and goes thinking about other things thats called Wrong ConcentrationIf the mind drops some of its Hindrances such as sensual desire by falling asleep thats called Wrong ReleaseOnly if the mind is firmly focused on mindfulness and the breath is it in Right ConcentrationOnly if it drops its Hindrances by being wise to their tricks is it called Right ReleaseIf mindfulness and alertness are constantly established in the mind our views will become straight our concentration will become right just as when two beams of light meet they give rise to the bright light of discernmentThere are times when discernment arises for only a tiny moment in the mind and yet it can kill off enormous defilementsFor example it can let go of all the clingingaggregatesIt can abandon selfidentity views by letting go of the body it can abandon attachment to practices and precepts by letting go of feeling and it can abandon uncertainty by letting go of perception mental fabrications and consciousnessWere taught to develop this sort of discernment by practicing Right ConcentrationEven if it arises only for the flash of an eye it can bring us many many benefitsJust like an atomic bomb even though its only a tiny thing it can bring destruction to the world in an awesome wayThe discernment arising from within the mind is something that cant be describedIts a tiny little thing not like the knowledge that comes from studying and memorizing in schoolThats why we cant talk about itThe Buddha even laid down training rules for the monks forbidding them from talking about their spiritual attainmentsThis is why we cant know if other people are noble disciplesIts something that each noble disciple can know only for him or herself aloneId like to recommend the basic principles of sitting in meditation for newcomers whove never done it beforeBe firmly mindful of the breath thinking bud with the inbreath and dho with the outOr if you want you can simply think buddho buddho in the mindMake the mind still and then drop the word buddho so that you can simply observe nothing but the inandout breathIts like standing at the gate of a cattlepen and keeping watch over the cattle to see their characteristics as they come in and out of the penWhat color are they  blackredwhitespottedAre they old or youngAre they calves or fully grownMake sure you dont go walking in with the cattle yet for they might kick you and break your shins or gore you to death with their hornsStay right at the gateWhat this means is that you keep your mind still in one pointYou dont have to make it go in and out with the breathObserving the characteristics of the cattle means learning how to observe the breath Does breathing in short and out short feel good or does in long and out long feel goodHow about in long and out short or in short and out longLearn to recognize which type of breathing is most comfortable and then stick with itSo there are three steps you have to follow the first step is to stay mindful of the word buddhoThe second is to be mindful of the breath thinking bud with the in breath and dho with the outDont forgetDont get distractedThe third step when the mind is still is to drop the word buddho and to be observant of nothing but the inandout breathWhen you can do this the mind will grow stillThe breath will be still too like a dipper floating in a barrel of water the water is still the dipper is still because no one is pressing on it tipping it or hitting against itThe dipper will keep floating in perfect stillness on the surface of the waterOr you can say that its like climbing up to the top of a very tall mountain or like floating up above the cloudsThe mind will feel nothing but a cool sense of pleasure and easeThis is the root the heartwood the apex of all that is skillfulIts called the root because its a good quality that runs deep and tenacious right down the middle of the heartIts called the heartwood because its solid and resilient like the heartwood of a tree that insects cant burrow into and destroyEven though insects may be able to nibble away at the tree they can go only as far as the bark or the sapwoodIn other words even though distractions may come and bother us they can reach only as far as the sense doors our eyes ears nose tongue and bodyFor example when sights strike against the eye they go only as far as the eyeThey dont get into the heartWhen sounds strike the ear they go only as far as the ear and not into the heartWhen smells strike the nose they go only as far as the noseThey dont enter the heartThis is why we say that the goodness of meditation is the heartwood of whats skillful because the various forms of evil cant easily destroy the goodness of the heart when its solid and stable in the same way that insects cant bore into heartwoodThe skillfulness of a mind in concentration is called the apex of all thats skillful because its high in qualityIt can pull all other forms of goodness into the mind as wellWhen the mind is still its goodness spreads out to cover the entire body so that we stop doing unskillful things with the bodyIt will cover our speech so that we stop saying unskillful things with our mouthThe unskillful things weve done with our eyes ears hands will all get washed awayIn this way the goodness that comes from meditating will wash out our eyes and ears will wash our hands and all the various parts of our body so that they all become cleanWhen we have cleanliness in charge of our body its a goodness thats high in quality  just as rain falling from high up in the sky spreads to cover everythingThe higher it comes from the more territory it coversWhen the mind is high in quality its goodness spreads to cover our eyes ears nose tongue and bodyIt spreads to cover sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensationsIt spreads to cover our thoughts of past and futureIn this way this goodness spreads out until eventually it covers the entire cosmosThese in short are a few of the rewards that come from meditationThe highquality goodness coming from meditation is like rain falling from high in the skyNot only does it wash away the dirty things on the ground but it also nourishes the plants so that human beings can depend on themIn addition it refreshes people with its coolnessThe Buddha showered his goodness on the world beginning from the very day of his Awakening and his goodness is still raining on us years laterThe Buddha was a Great Being because of the highquality goodness he developed through his meditation  the same meditation were doing right nowTo put it simply every aspect of meditation is goodNo matter how much you do even if you dont seem to be getting any results its all good regardlessEven when you simply repeat the word buddho its good for the mindWhen youre mindful of the breath its good for the mindWhen you can make the mind still with the breath its good for the mindFor this reason meditation is something you should do at all timesDont let the time and opportunity to meditate pass you byThe power of the Buddha is more tremendous than that of all other beings human and divineHis body is enormous in that weve been making representations of it from ancient times up to the present and yet still havent finished the jobHis mouth is enormously wideMany are the things that he said only once but that other people have repeated without ceasing here Im talking about his teachings which members of the Sangha have copied down into texts and delivered as sermons for us to hear up to the presentThe Buddhas physical mouth was small but his words are amazingly great which is why we say that his mouth is wideHis eyes are wide as well theyve seen the true nature of the entire cosmosThis is the way it is with people who are really good they tend to have this kind of enormous greatnessBig things like this have to come from small thingsBefore the Buddha could become enormous in this way he first had to make himself smallIn other words he cut himself off from his royal family and went alone into the forest to sit under the branches of the Bodhi tree on the banks of the Nerañjara RiverHe let his inandout breathing grow smaller and smaller until it was extremely subtle and there the fire of his defilements and mental fermentations went totally out without traceHe awakened to the foremost right selfawakening becoming a BuddhaHis heart which he had let grow so extremely subtle and small exploded outward in goodness in a way that is still blatant to us even todaySo I ask that we all set our minds on really practicing concentrationDont worry about the past or the future or anything elseWhen the mind is firmly set in concentration knowledge and discernment will arise without our having to worry about themDont let yourself think that you want to know this or see thatThese things will come on their ownAs the proverb says Those with a lot of greed get only a little to feed on those content with only a pinkies worth will get a whole thumb Keep bearing this point in mindFor the mind to range far and wide wandering after outside concepts and preoccupations saps the strength it needs to deal with its various affairsWhatever it then thinks of doing will succeed only with difficultyIts like a gun with a broadgauged barrelIf you put tiny bullets into it they rattle around inside and dont come out with much forceThe narrower the gauge of the barrel the more force the bullets will have when you shoot them outIts the same with the breath The more you narrow its focus the more refined the breath will become until eventually you can breathe through your poresThe mind at this stage has more strength than an atomic bombIntelligent orchard owners get their bananas to help them plant their orchard get their mangoes to help them plant their orchardThey dont have to invest a lot of capitalIn other words they clear the land bit by bit plant it bit by bit harvest bit by bit sell bit by bit until the orchard grows larger and larger all the timeThis way they dont need to invest much in terms of labor or capital but the results they get are large and lastingAs for stupid people when they start an orchard no matter how large they pour all their money into it hiring people to clear the land plow it and plant it all at onceIf they run into a drought for three days or seven days running their plants all wither and dieGrass and weeds spring up and overrun the placeAt that point theres nothing the owners can do because the orchard is way too big for themThey dont have the money to hire the workers again because they used up all their funds right at the beginningAll they can do is sit with their arms around their knees blinking back the tearsTheyve lost all their capital and have no profits to showThats the way it is with people who are greedyAs for those who keep at their work steadily bit by bit the results keep growing bigger and bigger all the timeWhen we sit and meditate there are three things we have to work withMindfulness think of the meditation word bud with the inbreath and dho with the outThe mind keep the mind both with the breath and with the meditation wordLet the breath flow comfortablyLet the mind be at easeDont force the breath or try to put the mind into a tranceKeep the mind firm and upright and dont let it slip off here or thereThese are the things we have to study  not just so that well know themWe study them so that we can put them into practice ie we practice them so that well come to the knowledge we really wantIn keeping the mind pure we have to cut away perceptions so that they dont stick in the heartIts like looking after a white sheet spread on our bedWe have to watch out for any dust that will blow in on the wind and land on the sheet and for any insects  such as ants or bed bugs  that will come to live thereIf we see any dust we have to take the sheet and shake it outWherever there are any stains we have to launder it immediatelyDont let them stay long on the sheet or else theyll be hard to wash outIf there are any insects we have to remove them for they may bite us and give us a rash or keep us from sleeping soundlyWhen we keep looking after our sheet in this way it will have to stay clean and white and be a comfortable place for us to sleepThe dust and insects here are the Hindrances that are the enemies of the heartWe have to look after our heart in just the same way we look after our beddingWe cant let any outside perceptions come in and stick to the heart or nibble at itWe have to brush them all awayThat way the mind will become calm free from distractionsWhen we meditate were giving rise to skill in three ways we arent harming anyone with our body we arent badmouthing anyone with our speech and were getting the mind to stay with good intentionsIn other words were staying with buddho with every inandout breath so were not thinking of doing anything evil and we dont think thoughts of anger or hatred about anyoneThis way our body speech and mind are pureThis is what gives rise to merit and skill for were not doing any evil at allWhen we think of the breath in this way its as if were painting a picture on a piece of white clothOur mind in its ordinary state is like a plain piece of cloth with no patterns or designsWhen we raise the mind to a higher level and think of the factors of meditation its like drawing a mental picture on itFor example the word buddho is a mental picture inasmuch as we cant see it with our eyes but we can see it through our thinkingIf we think of it constantly its as if our ink or paint seeps deep into the clothIf we dont think buddho or think of it in only a superficial way its like drawing with a pencilThe picture wont stick and seep into the heartIt might get smeared or entirely erasedThen we add details to our picture this is whats meant by evaluationIf we keep at it our picture will become more and more elaborateAs the picture becomes more and more elaborate well notice whether the inandout breath has become comfortable or notIf its easy and comfortable keep it that waySometimes youll notice that the mind is comfortable but the body isnt sometimes the body is comfortable but the mind is irritable and distracted sometimes the body is reasonably comfortable and at ease and the mind has settled down and isnt jumping aboutSo when you see any aspect that isnt comfortable you should fix it in the same way that a rice farmer has to keep careful watch over the sluice gates in his field clearing out any branches or stumps that will cut off the flow of the waterWhen you see anything that isnt good you should get rid of itYou have to stay observant of the breath to see if its too slow or too fast or if its making you tiredIf it is change itThis is like plowing or harrowing your fieldWhen the big clods of earth get broken up and spread around the field will be levelWhen the body gets level and smooth keep it going that wayThe mind will then become level and smooth as well  for it lives with the body and now it gets to stay in a place of comfortWhether its good in every part or only in some parts youll knowWhen we give rise to skill in the mind like this its as if weve gained wealthAnd when we gain wealth things are bound to come and disturb us just as a tree with beautiful fragrant flowers tends to have caterpillars or insects disturbing its flowersWhen the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha arise in the heart there are bound to be things that will disturb or destroy them such as visions or Hindrances just as when a flower is pestered by insects it may fall away from the treeWhen it falls off the tree it wont be able to bear fruitThe same with your mind Dont let your goodness fall away under the influence of the HindrancesYou have to keep after it to make sure that it stays still and established in the body until theres no sense of anything disturbing it or trying to destroy itThe mind will then be like a spray of mango flowers nourished with drops of mistIn no long time it will bear fruit and youll be able to harvest the fruit and eat it in comfortIn the Dhammapada the Buddha says that a person who is forgetful or heedless is like a dead personIn other words if mindfulness lapses for a moment youve passed out for a momentIf it lapses for a long time youve passed out for a long timeSo if you realize that its lapsed you have to correct things immediatelyIn other words you reestablish mindfulness right awayIf youve realized its lapsed theres at least some hope for youSome people dont even know that its lapsed those are the ones who are hopelessAs the Buddha said pamado maccuno padam heedlessness is the path of deathThis is because heedlessness is delusion the root of unskillfulnessWhen delusion arises it opens the way for all kinds of evil and unskillful thingsSo we should try to uproot it immediately before it starts growing and spreading its branches far and wideWhen mindfulness lapses it opens the way for us to think of all kinds of things making it hard for us to finish our workTo say nothing of keeping track of the breath if mindfulness keeps lapsing we couldnt even finish writing a single letterSo we have to be especially careful to maintain mindfulnessDont let yourself forget or lose track of what youre doingWhen you sit in concentration you have to keep being observant to see whether the mind is established in all the component factors of meditationYour practice of concentration has to be composed of three component factors for it to count as correct in line with the principles of meditation that will give rise to the full results that we all wantThe component factors of meditation areThe right intentionOnce weve focused our awareness on the inandout breath we have to keep our mindfulness fixed solely on the breath by thinking bud in with the inbreath and dho out with the outWe have to keep doing this until the mind is still and in placeThen we can drop the meditation wordOnce the mind is still and doesnt go wandering off in other places mindfulness will stay snug with the breath without slipping away or growing absent mindedThis is the intention the kamma of our kammatthanaThe right qualityThis refers to the skill with which we can improve adjust and spread the breath so that it becomes comfortableFor example if short breathing is uncomfortable change it so that its a little longerIf long breathing is uncomfortable change it so that its a bit shorterObserve long breathing short breathing fast or slow breathing and then keep on breathing in whichever way is most comfortableIf any problem or discomfort arises make further changesBut dont tense up the breath or try to hold itLet the body breathe in and out with a sense of easeThe breath will then feel wide open agile and spaciousIt wont get bottled up in any one spot wont feel heavy or confinedWhen this is the case a sense of fullness and refreshment a cool sense of ease will arise in the mindAs for the body itll feel at ease as wellThis is the essence of what is good the skillfulness that we all desireWhen we can train the mind to stay firmly in these three factors of meditation itll become tame and obedient and no longer stubborn  because once our mind becomes skillful and intelligent itll gain a sense of whats good for us whats not what are the affairs of other people what are our own affairsWhen this happens there wont be a lot of confusionIts the same as when weve trained an oxWe can put it to good work and wont have to waste a lot of rope to keep it tied downThats when we can be at our easeEven if we let it wander off on its own it wont get lostWhen it goes away itll come back to its pen on its own for it knows which pen belongs to its owner which pens belong to other people which person is its owner and which people are not which plants are the grasses it can eat which plants are the rice plants it shouldntThis way it wont invade the fields of other people trampling their crops and eating their rice which would give rise to all sorts of controversies and bad feelingsThat way we can live in peaceIts the same with the mindOnce its trained itll become tameIt wont go traipsing off after external thoughts and preoccupationsNormally the mind doesnt like to stay with the body in the presentSometimes it goes flowing out the eyes sometimes out the ears sometimes out the nose the tongue and the body so that it splits into five different currents just like a river that splits into five channels instead of staying in one the force of the current gets weakenedAnd in addition to leaking out the five sense doors after sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations the mind also goes flowing out after thoughts of the past and thoughts of the future without ever staying firmly in the presentThis is why it knows no peace because it doesnt get any time to restAs a result its strength begins to fail and when the strength of the mind grows weaker so does the strength of the bodyWhen this is the case we cant bring any of our projects to completion either in the area of the world or of the DhammaWhen this happens were like a sick person whos a burden on his doctors and nursesThe doctors have to keep making visits to check up on his symptomsThe nurses have to feed him give him medicine and take him to the bathroomWhen he tries to sit up he needs someone to support himThe people looking after him have to go without sleep both by day and by night and can never leave him aloneAs for the people financially responsible they have to run around trying to find money to pay the medical billsThe whole family is worried and concerned and the sick person himself can find no comfortHe cant go anywhere cant do anything cant eat solid food cant get any sleep everything becomes a problemIn the same way when our minds arent quiet and still and instead keep flowing out after concepts and preoccupations were like sick peopleWe dont have the strength to bring our work to completionThis is because the untrained mind goes wandering off as it likes and is very stubbornYou cant tell it to do anything at allIf you tell it to lie down itll sit downIf you tell it to sit down itll get up and walkIf you tell it to walk itll start runningIf you tell it to run itll stopYou cant really control it at allWhen this is the case all sorts of unskillful qualities  ignorance and defilements like greed anger and delusion or the five Hindrances  will come flowing into the mind overcoming it and possessing it in the same way that people get possessed by spiritsWhen this is the case were in all sorts of trouble and turmoil  all because the mind doesnt have the strength it needs to withstand ignorance or to drive it out of the heartThe Buddha saw that this is the way things are for people by and large causing them to suffer which is why he taught us to gather up the strength of body and strength of mind we need to fight off these various forms of sufferingIn other words he taught us to practice concentration so as to make the strength of our mind firm and solidPracticing concentration means training the mind to be quiet and stillAs the mind stays quiet and still for longer and longer periods of time itll become clearWhen its clear the light of discernment will arise within itThis discernment is the strength that will enable the mind to contend with all sorts of events both good and bad for itll have the intelligence enabling it to wise up to all the preoccupations coming in by way of the eyes ears nose tongue body and intellectIt will be able to identify perceptions of past present and futureIt will be acquainted with the properties aggregates and sense media knowing whats good what isnt whats worth thinking about whats not whats untrue whats trueWhen it knows this itll become dispassionate disenchanted and will let go of all thoughts and concepts let go of its attachments to the body let go of its attachments to things outside all of which arise from the process of fabrication and have no real enduring essenceWhen the mind can let go of all thoughts and preoccupations itll become light and agile like a person who has put down all the burdens shes been carrying on her shoulders and in her handsShe can walk run and jump with agilityShe can sit down or lie down with easeWherever she goes shes comfortableWhen the mind has experienced a sense of comfort itll become happy and fullIt wont feel hungryWhen its full and happy it can restOnce its rested itll have strengthWhatever tasks it undertakes in terms of the world or the Dhamma will succeedIf the mind lacks a sense of fullness though itll be hungryWhen its hungry its in a lousy mood irritable and upsetWhen this is the case its like a sick person who doesnt have the strength to complete any task with easeAs for people who have practiced concentration to the point where their minds are quiet and still theyre no longer hungry for they have a sense of fullness within themThis gives them five kinds of strength  conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment  which will enable them to advance to even higher levels of goodnessWhen the mind is still it develops mental serenityWhen the body is still it develops physical serenity as well the various properties within it are peaceful and harmonious and dont quarrel with one anotherThe whole body is then bathed in the purity that comes flowing out the currents of the mind through the properties of earth water fire and wind caring for them and protecting themWhen things are protected and cared for they dont run downIn this way the properties of the body reach a state of harmony giving them the strength they need to withstand feelings of pain and wearinessAs for the mind itll develop greater and greater strength enabling it to withstand all sorts of mental tormentsItll keep getting more and more powerful like the gunpowder used to make rockets and fireworksWhen its lit it explodes and shoots all the way up to the skyWhen we practice concentration its as if we were gathering provisions for a tripThe provisions here are the skillful qualities we develop in the mindThe more provisions we have the more comfortably we can travel and the further we can goWe can go to the human world the deva worlds the brahma worlds or all the way to nibbanaWhen we have a lot of provisions our traveling is easy for we can afford to go by car or by boatWe can stay in comfortable places and have plenty of food to eatThe trip wont tire us and we can go far and fastAs for people with meager provisions they cant afford the carfare so they have to go barefoot walking on gravel and stepping on thorns exposed to the sun and rainThey cant stay in comfortable places theyre lacking in food their progress is tiring and slowBy the time they reach their destination theyre ready to give up for theyre all out of strengthBut whether we travel quickly or slowly were all headed to the same destinationFor example suppose were all going to BangkokThose who go by foot will get there in three months those who go by car in three days while those who get on a plane will arrive in three minutesFor this reason you shouldnt get discouraged in your efforts to do whats goodDevelop as much strength as you can so that youll have the provisions and vehicles youll need to help speed you along to your goalOnce youve arrived youll experience nothing but happiness and easeWhen you practice the Dhamma even if you dont reach the paths their fruitions or nibbana in this lifetime at the very least youre developing the conditions that will help you along the way in the futureWhen we meditate its as if we were driving a car on a tripIf you have a sense of how to adjust and improve your breath its like driving along a smooth paved roadThe car wont run into any obstacles and even a long trip will seem shortAs for people who arent centered in concentration whose minds are slipping and slithering around with no sense of how to improve their breathing theyre driving their car along a bumpy unpaved road full of potholesIn some spots the bridges have collapsedIn others the road is washed outWhat this means is that their mindfulness lapses and they let their minds fall into thoughts of the past and futureThey dont stay put in the presentIf they dont know how to repair their road theyll keep running into dangers and obstaclesTheir car will keep getting bogged downSometimes they spend weeks and months stuck in one place and their short trip turns into a long oneSometimes they go back to the beginning point and start all over againRunning back and forth like this around and around in circles theyll never be able to get to the goalSo I ask that you all remember this discussion of the Dhamma and take it to heartTry using it to make adjustments in your mind and see what happensIf you train the mind correctly in line with the three factors of meditation that Ive mentioned here you may well meet with the peace and happiness for which you aimWhen meditators get into position exactly what are they doingGetting into position means making the mind stay in place making it stay with the body not letting it go stay with other people or think about anything else at allIf the mind stays outside of the body its like a battery without any currentYou cant get any use out of itYou cant use it to produce heat or give off lightSo this is why were taught to keep the mind insideWhen trees are withered and dry its because they dont have any water to nourish themThe same holds true with usIf the mind doesnt stay inside the body the body wont flourishItll have to wither and wear out grow ill in one way or another and eventually die because of this disease or thatSo the mind is like water that permeates the body to give it nourishmentIf the mind focuses its attention outside of the body then the body wont be able to gain any sense of freshness fullness or easeThis is because the mind is the most important factor influencing the bodyIts our most valuable resourceNow when the mind is a valuable resource in this way we should learn how to look after itWe have to hand it over to someone we can trustIn other words we entrust it to somebody venerableBut the word venerable here doesnt mean the external venerables like monks because not all monks are trustworthySome of them are good monks some of them arentIf we let them cheat us out of our valuables we end up even worse off than before
