It does this in two ways
First it provides a standard for judging those realizations Is there any stress remaining in the mind
At all
If there is then they're not genuine Awakening
Second the skills you've developed have sensitized you to all the doings in simply being which ensures that the subtlest levels of stress won't escape your gaze
Without this sensitivity you could easily mistake an infinitely luminous state of concentration for something more
But when you really know what you're doing you'll recognize freedom from doing when you finally encounter it
And when you know that freedom you'll know something further that the greatest gift you can give to others is to teach them the skills to encounter it for themselves
In saying that kind and grateful people are rare the Buddha isn't simply stating a harsh truth about the human race
He's advising you to treasure these people when you find them and  more importantly  showing how you can become a rare person yourself
Kindness and gratitude are virtues you can cultivate but they have to be cultivated together
Each needs the other to be genuine  a point that becomes obvious when you think about the three things most likely to make gratitude heartfelt
Points one and two are lessons that gratitude teaches kindness If you want to be genuinely kind you have to be of actual benefit  nobody wants to be the recipient of help that isn't really helpful  and you have to provide that benefit in a way that shows respect and empathy for the other person's needs
No one likes to receive a gift given with calculating motives or in an offhand or disdainful way
Points two and three are lessons that kindness teaches to gratitude
Only if you've been kind to another person will you accept the idea that others can be kind to you
At the same time if you've been kind to another person you know the effort involved
Kind impulses often have to do battle with unkind impulses in the heart so it's not always easy to be helpful
Sometimes it involves great sacrifice  a sacrifice possible only when you trust the recipient to make good use of your help
So when you're on the receiving end of a sacrifice like that you realize you've incurred a debt an obligation to repay the other person's trust
This is why the Buddha always discusses gratitude as a response to kindness and doesn't equate it with appreciation in general
It's a special kind of appreciation inspiring a more demanding response
The difference here is best illustrated by two passages in which the Buddha uses the image of carrying
The first passage concerns appreciation of a general sort
Then the man having gathered grass twigs branches  leaves having bound them together to make a raft would cross over to safety on the far shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with his hands  feet
Having crossed over to the far shore he might think 'How useful this raft has been to me
For it was in dependence on this raft that making an effort with my hands  feet I have crossed over to safety on the far shore
Why don't I having hoisted it on my head or carrying it on my back go wherever I like' What do you think monks
Would the man in doing that be doing what should be done with the raft
No lord
And what should the man do in order to be doing what should be done with the raft
There is the case where the man having crossed over to the far shore would think 'How useful this raft has been to me
For it was in dependence on this raft that making an effort with my hands  feet I have crossed over to safety on the far shore
Why don't I having dragged it on dry land or sinking it in the water go wherever I like' In doing this he would be doing what should be done with the raft
The second passage concerns gratitude in particular
I tell you monks there are two people who are not easy to repay
Which two
Your mother  father
Even if you were to carry your mother on one shoulder  your father on the other shoulder for years and were to look after them by anointing massaging bathing  rubbing their limbs and they were to defecate  urinate right there you would not in that way pay or repay your parents
If you were to establish your mother  father in absolute sovereignty over this great earth abounding in the seven treasures you would not in that way pay or repay your parents
Why is that
Mother  father do much for their children
They care for them they nourish them they introduce them to this world
But anyone who rouses his unbelieving mother  father settles  establishes them in conviction rouses his unvirtuous mother  father settles  establishes them in virtue rouses his stingy mother  father settles  establishes them in generosity rouses his foolish mother  father settles  establishes them in discernment To this extent one pays  repays one's mother  father
In other words as the first passage shows it's perfectly fine to appreciate the benefits you've received from rafts and other conveniences without feeling any need to repay them
You take care of them simply because that enables you to benefit from them more
The same holds true for difficult people and situations that have forced you to develop strength of character
You can appreciate that you've learned persistence from dealing with crabgrass in your lawn or equanimity from dealing with unreasonable neighbors without owing the crabgrass or neighbors any debt of gratitude
After all they didn't kindly go out of their way to help you
And if you were to take them as models you'd learn all the wrong lessons about kindness that simply following your natural impulses  or even worse behaving unreasonably  is the way to be kind
Debts of gratitude apply only to parents teachers and other benefactors who have acted with your wellbeing in mind
They've gone out of their way to help you and have taught you valuable lessons about kindness and empathy in the process
In the case of the raft you'd do best to focus gratitude on the person who taught you how to make a raft
In the case of the crabgrass and the neighbors focus gratitude on the people who taught you how not to be overcome by adversity
If there are benefits you've received from things or situations you can't trace to a conscious agent in this lifetime feel gratitude to yourself for the good karma you did in the past that allowed those benefits to appear
And be grateful for the good karma that allows you to receive and benefit from other people's help in the first place
If you had no good to your credit they wouldn't be able to reach you
As the Buddha's second passage shows the debt you owe to your benefactors needn't be tit for tat and shouldn't be directed solely to them
Now the debt you owe your parents for giving birth to you and enabling you to live is immense
In some passages the Buddha recommends expressing gratitude for their compassion with personal services
However AN
shows that the only true way to repay your parents is to strengthen them in four qualities conviction virtue generosity and discernment
To do so of course you have to develop these qualities in yourself as well as learning how to employ great tact in being an example to your parents
As it happens these four qualities are also those of an admirable friend which means that in repaying your parents in this way you become the sort of person who'd be an admirable friend to others as well
You become a person of integrity who  as the Buddha points out  has learned from gratitude how to be harmless in all your dealings and to give help with an empathetic heart respectfully in a timely way and with the sense that something good will come of it
In this way you repay your parents' goodness many times over by allowing its influence to spread beyond the small circle of the family into the world at large
In so doing you enlarge the circle of their goodness as well
This principle also applies to your teachers as the Buddha told his disciples
So this is what you think of me 'The Blessed One sympathetic seeking our wellbeing teaches the Dhamma out of sympathy' Then you should train yourselves  harmoniously cordially and without dispute  in the qualities I have pointed out having known them directly the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors of Awakening the noble eightfold path
In other words the way to repay a teacher's compassion and sympathy in teaching you is to apply yourself to learning your lessons well
Only then can you spread the good influence of those lessons to others
As for the debts you owe yourself for your past good karma the best way to repay them is to use your benefits as opportunities to create further good karma and not simply enjoy the pleasure they offer
Here again it's important to remember the hardships that can be involved in acting skillfully and to honor your past skillful intentions by not allowing them to go to waste in the present
For example as Ajaan Lee once said it's not easy to attain a human mouth so bow down to your mouth every day
In other words respect your ability to communicate and use it to say only what's timely beneficial and true
These are some of the lessons about kindness and empathy that wellfocused gratitude can teach  lessons that teach you how to deal maturely and responsibly in the give and take of social life
Small wonder then that the Buddha cited gratitude as the quality defining what it means to be civilized
But wellfocused gratitude can also teach lessons that apply further to the training of the mind
First are the lessons touching on the nature of human action itself
The sense that you've benefited from another person's action underscores the point that action does give results the importance you give to the other person's motives in helping you underscores the point that the quality of the action lies in the intention behind it and the sense that the other person went out of his or her way to help you underscores the sense that action isn't totally determined You feel indebted to the people who helped you because you sense how easily they might have denied that help and how difficult your life might have been if that's what they had chosen to do
Your parents for instance didn't have to raise you or arrange for someone else to raise you they could have aborted you or left you to die
So the fact that you're alive to read this means that somebody chose again and again to help you when you were helpless
Sensing that element of choice is what creates your sense of debt
All three of these points  the efficacy of action the importance of intention and the existence of choice  were distinctive elements in the Buddha's teaching on action
And the emotional resonance that gratitude and empathy give to these points may be the reason why when the Buddha introduced the basic outline of this teaching he cited topics connected with these emotions the value of giving and the debt owed to one's parents
He couldn't offer his listeners proof for his three points  that would come only with their experience of Awakening  but by showing how his teaching on action allowed for generosity to be a meaningful action and gratitude a meaningful emotion he offered his listeners an emotionally satisfying reason for accepting his words
Gratitude also gives practice in developing qualities needed in meditation
As the Buddha noted the practice of concentration centers on the power of perception
Training in gratitude shows how powerful perception can be for it requires developing a particular set of perceptions about life and the world
If you perceive help as demeaning then gratitude itself feels demeaning but if you perceive help as an expression of trust  the other person wouldn't want to help you unless he or she felt you would use the help well  then gratitude feels ennobling an aid to selfesteem
Similarly if you perceive life as a competition it's hard to trust the motives of those who help you and you resent the need to repay their help as a gratuitous burden
If however you perceive that the goodness in life is the result of cooperation then the give and take of kindness and gratitude become a much more pleasant exchange
Similarly gratitude requires mindfulness in the Buddha's original sense of the word as keeping something in mind
In fact the connection between these two qualities extends to language itself
In Pali the word for gratitude  kataññu  literally means to have a sense of what was done
In SN the Buddha defines mindfulness as remembering  able to call to mind even things that were done  said long ago Our parents' instructions to us when we were children  to remember the kindnesses of others  are among our first lessons in mindfulness
As we develop our sense of gratitude we get practice in strengthening this quality of mind
However not all the lessons taught by gratitude and empathy are of a heartwarming sort
Instead they give rise to a sense of samvega  which can be translated as dismay or even terror  over how risky and precarious the goodness of the world can be
To begin with there's the fact that you can't choose beforehand whose kindness you'll be indebted to
There's no telling what kind of parents you'll get
As the Buddha rightly notes some parents are stingy immoral and foolish
Not only are they abusive to their children but they also might not be content or even pleased with the type of repayment the Buddha says is best for them
They may demand an unreasonable level of repayment involving actions that are downright harmful for you themselves and others
And yet this doesn't cancel the debt you owe them for the simple fact that they've enabled you to live
You've probably heard of the passage in which the Buddha says
A being who has not been your mother at one time in the past is not easy to find A being who has not been your father your brother your sister your son your daughter at one time in the past is not easy to find
Why is that
From an inconceivable beginning comes transmigration
When you think about how difficult each of these relationships can be it's no surprise that the Buddha didn't say this to make you feel warmhearted to all the beings you meet
He said it to induce samvega
Long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be released
Even the debts of gratitude you owe to yourself for the good actions you've done are enough to induce a sense of disease
You know that not all your past intentions have been skillful and yet these are the things that will shape the conditions of your life now and into the future
You're in a precarious position  enough to make you want to find a way out even of the network of kindness and gratitude that sustains whatever goodness there is in the world
This desire grows even stronger when you allow your empathy to spread to those who have had to make unwilling sacrifices to keep you alive
Every day the Buddha advised you should reflect on the fact that life depends on the requisites of food clothing shelter and medicine
Many are the beings who have had to die and suffer other hardships because of your need for these things
Contrary to the song that concludes Mahler's Fourth Symphony lambs don't gleefully jump into the stewpot to feed you
And even if  when you're in the fortunate position to be able to decide what kind of food you eat  you adhere to a vegetarian diet you still owe an enormous debt to the farmers and workers who have had to slave under harsh conditions to provide the requisites you need
The sense of indebtedness that these reflections induce goes far beyond gratitude and is certainly not pleasant to think about
This may be why so many people try to deny that they owe anyone a debt of gratitude at all
Or why those who do encourage the contemplation of gratitude as a source of happiness tend to reduce it to a generic sense of appreciation and contentment  in the words of one writer wanting what you have knowing that you have and are enough  devoid of any sense of debt
Gratitude of this sort tends to focus on things because gratitude to things is so much easier than gratitude to benefactors
Things don't make demands
They don't suffer and they don't mix their kindness with abuse
Yet there's no getting around the fact that our very lives depend on the kindness and hardships of others and that we can't get out of the resulting debts by callously denying them or blithely wishing them away
If we don't repay them now we'll have to repay them  sometimes at high interest  later for even death doesn't erase our debts or free us from coming back to incur more
So to avoid these entanglements we need another way out  a way the Buddha found through training his mind to reach a happiness that no longer needs to depend on the kindness and sacrifices of others
And although this happiness provides an escape it isn't escapist
It settles your debts in a responsible and generous way
This is because unconditional happiness allows you to abandon the cravings and attachments through which you repeatedly take on the identity of a being
To identify yourself as a being means having to find food  both physical and mental  to keep that identity going
This is why when you're a being you need to depend on a network of kindness gratitude and sacrifice
But when you can abandon the need for that identity the mind no longer has to feed
It's no longer a burden to anyone
As for the body as long as you're still alive those who provide for its needs reap merit many times over for the gifts they provide
This in fact is one of the motivations for gaining awakening
We will undertake  practice those qualities that make one a contemplative so that the services of those whose robes almsfood lodging and medicinal requisites we use will bring them great fruit  great reward
At the same time the example of your behavior and freedom of mind is a gift to others in that it shows how they too can free themselves from their debts
This is why the Buddha said that only those who have attained full awakening eat the alms food of the country without incurring debt
They've even paid off their debt to the Buddha for having taught the way to release
As he said the only homage he requested was that people practice the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma  ie to develop the disenchantment and dispassion that lead to release  so that the world will not be empty of awakened people
In this way attaining full release is not a selfish act instead it's the highest expression of kindness and gratitude
Of course it's a rare person who will take this route to freedom but that doesn't lessen its value or relevance
As with gratitude and benefaction it's an opportunity to become rare and distinctive that's open to anyone with the discernment to appreciate it and the determination to become truly kind and debtfree
The Buddha was like a doctor treating the spiritual ills of the human race
The path of practice he taught was like a course of therapy for suffering hearts and minds
This way of understanding the Buddha and his teachings dates back to the earliest texts and yet is also very current
Buddhist meditation practice is often advertised as a form of healing and quite a few psychotherapists now recommend that their patients try meditation as part of their treatment
After several years of teaching and practicing meditation as therapy however many of us have found that meditation on its own is not enough
In my own experience I have found that Western meditators tend to be afflicted more with a certain grimness and lack of selfesteem than any Asians I have ever taught
Their psyches are so wounded by modern civilization that they lack the resilience and persistence needed before concentration and insight practices can be genuinely therapeutic
Other teachers have noted this problem as well and as a result many of them have decided that the Buddhist path is insufficient for our particular needs
To make up for this insufficiency they have experimented with ways of supplementing meditation practice combining it with such things as myth poetry psychotherapy social activism sweat lodges mourning rituals and even drumming
The problem though may not be that there is anything lacking in the Buddhist path but that we simply haven't been following the Buddha's full course of therapy
The Buddha's path consisted not only of mindfulness concentration and insight practices but also of virtue beginning with the five precepts
In fact the precepts constitute the first step in the path
There is a tendency in the West to dismiss the five precepts as Sundayschool rules bound to old cultural norms that no longer apply to our modern society but this misses the role that the Buddha intended for them They are part of a course of therapy for wounded minds
In particular they are aimed at curing two ailments that underlie low selfesteem regret and denial
When our actions don't measure up to certain standards of behavior we either regret the actions or engage in one of two kinds of denial either denying that our actions did in fact happen or denying that the standards of measurement are really valid
These reactions are like wounds in the mind
Regret is an open wound tender to the touch while denial is like hardened twisted scar tissue around a tender spot
When the mind is wounded in these ways it can't settle down comfortably in the present for it finds itself resting on raw exposed flesh or calcified knots
Even when it's forced to stay in the present it's there only in a tensed contorted and partial way and so the insights it gains tend to be contorted and partial as well
Only if the mind is free of wounds and scars can it be expected to settle down comfortably and freely in the present and to give rise to undistorted discernment
This is where the five precepts come in They are designed to heal these wounds and scars
Healthy selfesteem comes from living up to a set of standards that are practical clearcut humane and worthy of respect the five precepts are formulated in such a way that they provide just such a set of standards
Practical The standards set by the precepts are simple  no intentional killing stealing having illicit sex lying or taking intoxicants
It's entirely possible to live in line with these standards
Not always easy or convenient but always possible
I have seen efforts to translate the precepts into standards that sound more lofty or noble  taking the second precept for example to mean no abuse of the planet's resources  but even the people who reformulate the precepts in this way admit that it is impossible to live up to them
Anyone who has dealt with psychologically damaged people knows that very often the damage comes from having been presented with impossible standards to live by
If you can give people standards that take a little effort and mindfulness but are possible to meet their selfesteem soars dramatically as they discover that they are actually capable of meeting those standards
They can then face more demanding tasks with confidence
Clearcut The precepts are formulated with no ifs ands or buts
This means that they give very clear guidance with no room for waffling or lessthanhonest rationalizations
An action either fits in with the precepts or it doesn't
Again standards of this sort are very healthy to live by
Anyone who has raised children has found that although they may complain about hard and fast rules they actually feel more secure with them than with rules that are vague and always open to negotiation
Clearcut rules don't allow for unspoken agendas to come sneaking in the back door of the mind
If for example the precept against killing allowed you to kill living beings when their presence is inconvenient that would place your convenience on a higher level than your compassion for life
Convenience would become your unspoken standard  and as we all know unspoken standards provide huge tracts of fertile ground for hypocrisy and denial to grow
If however you stick by the standards of the precepts then as the Buddha says you are providing unlimited safety for the lives of all
There are no conditions under which you would take the lives of any living beings no matter how inconvenient they might be
In terms of the other precepts you are providing unlimited safety for their possessions and sexuality and unlimited truthfulness and mindfulness in your communication with them
When you find that you can trust yourself in matters like these you gain an undeniably healthy sense of selfrespect
Humane The precepts are humane both to the person who observes them and to the people affected by his or her actions
If you observe them you are aligning yourself with the doctrine of karma which teaches that the most important powers shaping your experience of the world are the intentional thoughts words and deeds you choose in the present moment
This means that you are not insignificant
Every time you take a choice  at home at work at play  you are exercising your power in the ongoing fashioning of the world
At the same time this principle allows you to measure yourself in terms that are entirely under your control your intentional actions in the present moment
In other words they don't force you to measure yourself in terms of your looks strength brains financial prowess or any other criteria that depend less on your present karma than they do on karma from the past
Also they don't play on feelings of guilt or force you to bemoan your past lapses
Instead they focus your attention on the everpresent possibility of living up to your standards in the here and now
If you are living with people who observe the precepts you find that your dealings with them are not a cause for mistrust or fear
They regard your desire for happiness as akin to theirs
Their worth as individuals does not depend on situations in which there have to be winners and losers
When they talk about developing lovingkindness and mindfulness in their meditation you see it reflected in their actions
In this way the precepts foster not only healthy individuals but also a healthy society  a society in which the selfrespect and mutual respect are not at odds
Worthy of respect When you adopt a set of standards it is important to know whose standards they are and to see where those standards come from for in effect you are joining their group looking for their approval and accepting their criteria for right and wrong
In this case you couldn't ask for a better group to join the Buddha and his noble disciples
The five precepts are called standards appealing to the noble ones From what the texts tell us of the noble ones they are not people who accept standards simply on the basis of popularity
They have put their lives on the line to see what leads to true happiness and have seen for themselves for example that all lying is pathological and that any sex outside of a stable committed relationship is unsafe at any speed
Other people may not respect you for living by the five precepts but noble ones do and their respect is worth more than that of anyone else in the world
Now many people find it cold comfort to join such an abstract group especially when they have not yet met any noble ones in person
It's hard to be goodhearted and generous when the society immediately around you openly laughs at those qualities and values such things as sexual prowess or predatory business skills instead
This is where Buddhist communities can come in
It would be very useful if Buddhist groups would openly part ways with the prevailing amoral tenor of our culture and let it be known in a kindly way that they value goodheartedness and restraint among their members
In doing so they would provide a healthy environment for the fullscale adoption of the Buddha's course of therapy the practice of concentration and discernment in a life of virtuous action
Where we have such environments we find that meditation needs no myth or makebelieve to support it because it is based on the reality of a welllived life
You can look at the standards by which you live and then breathe in and out comfortably  not as a flower or a mountain but as a fullfledged responsible human being
For that's what you are
When explaining meditation the Buddha often drew analogies with the skills of artists carpenters musicians archers and cooks
Finding the right level of effort he said is like a musician's tuning of a lute
Reading the mind's needs in the moment  to be gladdened steadied or inspired  is like a palace cook's ability to read and please the tastes of a prince
Collectively these analogies make an important point Meditation is a skill and mastering it should be enjoyable in the same way that mastering any other rewarding skill can be
The Buddha said as much to his son Rahula When you see that you've acted spoken or thought in a skillful way  conducive to happiness while causing no harm to yourself or others  take joy in that fact and keep on training
Of course saying that meditation should be enjoyable doesn't mean that it will always be easy or pleasant
Every meditator knows it requires serious discipline to sit with long unpleasant stretches and untangle all the mind's difficult issues
But if you can approach difficulties with the enthusiasm that an artist approaches challenges in her work the discipline becomes enjoyable Problems are solved through your own ingenuity and the mind is energized for even greater challenges
This joyful attitude is a useful antidote to the more pessimistic attitudes that people often bring to meditation which tend to fall into two extremes
On the one hand there's the belief that meditation is a series of dull and dreary exercises allowing no room for imagination and inquiry Simply grit your teeth and at the end of the long haul your mind will be processed into an awakened state
On the other hand there's the belief that effort is counterproductive to happiness so meditation should involve no exertion at all Simply accept things as they are  it's foolish to demand that they get any better  and relax into the moment
While it's true that both repetition and relaxation can bring results in meditation when either is pursued to the exclusion of the other it leads to a dead end
If however you can integrate them both into the larger skill of learning how to apply whatever level of effort the practice requires at any given moment they can take you far
This larger skill requires strong powers of mindfulness concentration and discernment but if you stick with it it can lead you all the way to the Buddha's ultimate aim in teaching meditation nirvana a happiness totally unconditioned free from the constraints of space and time
That's an inspiring aim but it requires work
And the key to maintaining your inspiration in the daytoday work of meditation practice is to approach it as play a happy opportunity to master practical skills to raise questions experiment and explore
This is precisely how the Buddha himself taught meditation
Instead of formulating a cutanddried method he first trained his students in the personal qualities  such as honesty and patience  needed to make trustworthy observations
Only then did he teach meditation techniques and even then he didn't spell everything out
He raised questions and suggested areas for exploration in hopes that his questions would capture his students' imagination so they'd develop discernment and gain insights on their own
We can see this in the way the Buddha taught Rahula how to meditate
He started with the issue of patience
Meditate he said so that your mind is like the earth
Disgusting things get thrown on the earth but the earth isn't horrified by them
When you make your mind like the earth neither agreeable nor disagreeable sensory impressions will take charge of it
Now the Buddha wasn't telling Rahula to become a passive clod of dirt
He was teaching Rahula to be grounded to develop his powers of endurance so that he'd be able to observe both pleasant and painful events in his body and mind without becoming engrossed in the pleasure or blown away by the pain
This is what patience is for
It helps you sit with things until you understand them well enough to respond to them skillfully
To develop honesty in meditation the Buddha taught Rahula a further exercise
Look at the inconstancy of events in body and mind he said so that you don't develop a sense of I am around them
Here the Buddha was building on a lesson that he had taught Rahula when the latter was seven years old
Learn to look at your actions he had said before you do them while you're doing them and after they're done
If you see that you've acted unskillfully and caused harm resolve not to repeat the mistake
Then talk it over with someone you respect
In these lessons the Buddha was training Rahula to be honest with himself and with others
And the key to this honesty is to treat your actions as experiments
Then if you see the results aren't good you are free to change your ways
This attitude is essential for developing honesty in your meditation as well
If you regard every thing  good or bad  that arises in the meditation as a sign of the sort of person you are it will be hard to observe anything honestly at all
If an unskillful intention arises you're likely either to come down on yourself as a miserable meditator or to smother the intention under a cloak of denial
If a skillful intention arises you're likely to become proud and complacent reading it as a sign of your innate good nature
As a result you never get to see if these intentions are actually as skillful as they seemed at first glance
To avoid these pitfalls you can learn to see events simply as events and not as signs of the innate Buddhaness or badness of who you are
Then you can observe these events honestly to see where they come from and where they lead
Honesty together with patience puts you in a better position to use the techniques of meditation to explore your own mind
The primary technique the Buddha taught Rahula was breath meditation
The Buddha recommended sixteen steps in dealing with the breath
The first two involve straightforward instructions
The rest raise questions to be explored
In this way the breath becomes a vehicle for exercising your ingenuity in solving the problems of the mind and exercising your sensitivity in gauging the results
To begin simply notice when the breath is long and when it's short
In the remaining steps though you train yourself
In other words you have to figure out for yourself how to do what the Buddha recommends
The first two trainings are to breathe in and out sensitive to the entire body then to calm the effect that the breath has on the body
How do you do that
You experiment
What rhythm of breathing what way of conceiving the breath calms its effect on the body
Try thinking of the breath not as the air coming in and out of the lungs but as the energy flow throughout the body that draws the air in and out
Where do you feel that energy flow
Think of it as flowing in and out the back of your neck in your feet and hands along the nerves and blood vessels in your bones
Think of it coming in and out every pore of your skin
Where is it blocked
How do you dissolve the blockages
By breathing through them
Around them
Straight into them
See what works
As you play around with the breath in this way you'll make some mistakes  I've sometimes given myself headaches by forcing the breath too much  but with the right attitude the mistakes become lessons in learning how the impact of your perceptions shapes the way you breathe
You'll also catch yourself getting impatient or frustrated but then you'll see that when you breathe through these emotions they go away
You're beginning to see the impact of the breath on the mind
The next step is to breathe in and out with a sense of refreshing fullness and a sense of ease
Here too you'll need to experiment both with the way you breathe and with the way you conceive of the breath
Notice how these feelings and conceptions have an impact on the mind and how you can calm that impact so that the mind feels most at ease
Then when the breath is calm and you've been refreshed by feelings of ease and stillness you're ready to look at the mind itself
You don't leave the breath though
You adjust your attention slightly so that you're watching the mind as it stays with the breath
Here the Buddha recommends three areas for experimentation Notice how to gladden the mind when it needs gladdening how to steady it when it needs steadying and how to release it from its attachments and burdens when it's ready for release
Sometimes the gladdening and steadying will require bringing in other topics for contemplation
For instance to gladden the mind you can develop an attitude of infinite good will or recollect the times in the past when you've been virtuous or generous
To steady the mind when it's been knocked over by lust you can contemplate the unattractive side of the human body
To reestablish your focus when you're drowsy or complacent you can contemplate death  realizing that death could come at any time and you need to prepare your mind if you're going to face it with any finesse
At other times you can gladden or steady the mind simply by the way you focus on the breath itself
For instance breathing down into your hands and feet can really anchor the mind when its concentration has become shaky
When one spot in the body isn't enough to hold your interest try focusing on the breath in two spots at once
The important point is that you've now put yourself in a position where you can experiment with the mind and read the results of your experiments with greater and greater accuracy
You can try exploring these skills off the cushion as well How do you gladden the mind when you're sick
How do you steady the mind when dealing with a difficult person
As for releasing the mind from its burdens you prepare for the ultimate freedom of nirvana first by releasing the mind from any awkwardness in its concentration
Once the mind has settled down check to see if there are any ways you can refine the stillness
For instance in the beginning stages of concentration you need to keep directing your thoughts to the breath evaluating and adjusting it to make it more agreeable
But eventually the mind grows so still that evaluating the breath is no longer necessary
So you figure out how to make the mind one with the breath and in that way you release the mind into a more intense and refreshing state of ease
As you expand your skills in this way the intentions that you've been using to shape your experience of body and mind become more and more transparent
At this point the Buddha suggests revisiting the theme of inconstancy learning to look for it in the effects of every intention
You see that even the best states produced by skillful intentions  the most solid and refined states of concentration  waver and change
Realizing this induces a sense of disenchantment with and dispassion for all intentions
You see that the only way to get beyond this changeability is to allow all intentions to cease
You watch as everything is relinquished including the path
What's left is unconditioned the deathless
Your desire to explore the breath has taken you beyond desiring beyond the breath all the way to nirvana
But the path doesn't save all its pleasures for the end
It takes the daunting prospect of reaching full Awakening and breaks it down into manageable interim goals  a series of intriguing challenges that as you meet them allow you to see progress in your practice
This in and of itself makes the practice interesting and a source of joy
At the same time you're not engaged in busywork
You're developing a sensitivity to cause and effect that helps make body and mind transparent
Only when they're fully transparent can you let them go
In experiencing the full body of the breath in meditation you're sensitizing yourself to the area of your awareness where the deathless  when you're acute enough to see it  will appear
So even though the path requires effort it's an effort that keeps opening up new possibilities for happiness and wellbeing in the present moment
And even though the steps of breath meditation eventually lead to a sense of disenchantment and dispassion they don't do so in a joyless way
The Buddha never asks anyone to adopt a worldnegating  or worldaffirming for that matter  frame of mind
Instead he asks for a worldexploring attitude in which you use the inner world of fullbody breathing as a laboratory for exploring the harmless and clearminded pleasures the world as a whole can provide
You learn skills to calm the body to develop feelings of refreshment fullness and ease
You learn how to calm the mind to steady it gladden it and release it from its burdens
Only when you run up against the limits of these skills are you ready to drop them to explore what greater potential for happiness there may be
In this way disenchantment develops not from a narrow or pessimistic attitude but from an attitude of hope that there must be something better
This is like the disenchantment a child senses when he has mastered a simple game and feels ready for something more challenging
It's the attitude of a person who has matured
And as we all know you don't mature by shrinking from the world watching it passively or demanding that it entertain you
You mature by exploring it by expanding your range of usable skills through play
When I first went to study with my teacher Ajaan Fuang he handed me a small booklet of meditation instructions and sent me up the hill behind the monastery to meditate
The booklet  written by his teacher Ajaan Lee  began with a breath meditation technique and concluded with a section showing how the technique was used to induce the first four levels of jhana
In the following years I saw Ajaan Fuang hand the same booklet to each of his new students lay and ordained
Yet despite the booklet's detailed descriptions of jhana he himself rarely mentioned the word jhana in his conversations and never indicated to any of his students that they had reached a particular level of jhana in their practice
When a student told him of a recurring meditative experience he liked to discuss not what it was but what to do with it what to focus on what to drop what to change what to maintain the same
Then he'd teach the student how to experiment with it  to make it even more stable and restful  and how to judge the results of the experiments
If his students wanted to measure their progress against the descriptions of jhana in the booklet that was their business and none of his
He never said this in so many words but given the way he taught the implicit message was clear
As were the implicit reasons for his attitude
He had told me once about his own experiences as a young meditator Back in those days you didn't have books explaining everything the way we do now
When I first studied with Ajaan Lee he told me to bring my mind down
So I focused on getting it down down down but the more I brought it down the heavily and duller it got
I thought 'This can't be right' So I turned around and focused on bringing it up up up until I found a balance and could figure out what he was talking about This incident was one of many that taught him some important lessons that you have to test things for yourself to see where the instructions had to be taken literally and where they had to be taken figuratively that you had to judge for yourself how well you were doing and that you had to be ingenious experimenting and taking risks to find ways to deal with problems as they arose
So as a teacher he tried to instill in his students these qualities of selfreliance ingenuity and a willingness to take risks and test things for themselves
He did that not only by talking about these qualities but also by forcing you into situations where you'd have to develop them
Had he always been there to confirm for you that Yes you've reached the third jhana or No that's only the second jhana he would have shortcircuited the qualities he was trying to instill
He rather than your own powers of observation would have been the authority on what was going on in your mind and you would have been absolved of any responsibility for correctly evaluating what you had experienced
At the same time he would have been feeding your childish desire to please or impress him and undermining your ability to deal with the task at hand which was how to develop your own powers of sensitivity to put an end to suffering and stress
As he once told me If I have to explain everything you'll get used to having things handed to you on a platter
And then what will you do when problems come up in your meditation and you don't have any experience in figuring things out on your own 
So studying with him I had to learn to take risks in the midst of uncertainties
If something interesting came up in the practice I'd have to stick with it observing it over time before reaching any conclusions about it
Even then I learned the labels I applied to my experiences couldn't be chiseled in rock
They had to be more like postit notes convenient markers for my own reference that I might have to peel off and stick elsewhere as I became more familiar with the territory of my mind
This proved to be a valuable lesson that applied to all areas of my practice
Still Ajaan Fuang didn't leave me to reinvent the dharma wheel totally on my own
Experience had shown him that some approaches to concentration worked better than others for putting the mind in a position where it could exercise its ingenuity and accurately judge the results of its experiments and he was very explicit in recommending those approaches
Among the points he emphasized were these
Strong concentration is absolutely necessary for liberating insight
Without a firm basis in concentration he often said insight is just concepts To see clearly the connections between stress and its causes the mind has to be very steady and still
And to stay still it requires the strong sense of well being that only strong concentration can provide

To gain insight into a state of concentration you have to stick with it for a long time
If you push impatiently from one level of concentration to the next or if you try to analyze a new state of concentration too quickly after you've attained it you never give it the chance to show its full potential and you don't give yourself the chance to familiarize yourself with it
So you have to keep working at it as a skill something you can tap into in all situations
This enables you to see it from a variety of perspectives and to test it over time to see if it really is as totally blissful empty and effortless as it may have seemed on first sight

The best state of concentration for the sake of developing allaround insight is one that encompasses a wholebody awareness
There were two exceptions to Ajaan Fuang's usual practice of not identifying the state you had attained in your practice and both involved states of wrong concentration
The first was the state that comes when the breath gets so comfortable that your focus drifts from the breath to the sense of comfort itself your mindfulness begins to blur and your sense of the body and your surroundings gets lost in a pleasant haze
When you emerge you find it hard to identify where exactly you were focused
Ajaan Fuang called this mohasamadhi or delusionconcentration

The second state was one I happened to hit one night when my concentration was extremely onepointed and so refined that it refused settle on or label even the most fleeting mental objects
I dropped into a state in which I lost all sense of the body of any internalexternal sounds or of any thoughts or perceptions at all  although there was just enough tiny awareness to let me know when I emerged that I hadn't been asleep
I found that I could stay there for many hours and yet time would pass very quickly
Two hours would seem like two minutes
I could also program myself to come out at a particular time

After hitting this state several nights in a row I told Ajaan Fuang about it and his first question was Do you like it My answer was No because I felt a little groggy the first time I came out
Good he said
As long as you don't like it you're safe
Some people really like it and think it's nibbana or cessation
Actually it's the state of nonperception
It's not even right concentration because there's no way you can investigate anything in there to gain any sort of discernment
But it does have other uses He then told me of the time he had undergone kidney surgery and not trusting the anesthesiologist had put himself in that state for the duration of the operation

In both these states of wrong concentration the limited range of awareness was what made them wrong
If whole areas of your awareness are blocked off how can you gain allaround insight
And as I've noticed in years since people adept at blotting out large areas of awareness through powerful onepointedness also tend to be psychologically adept at dissociation and denial
This is why Ajaan Fuang following Ajaan Lee taught a form of breath meditation that aimed at an allaround awareness of the breath energy throughout the body playing with it to gain a sense of ease and then calming it so that it wouldn't interfere with a clear vision of the subtle movements of the mind
This allaround awareness helped to eliminate the blind spots where ignorance likes to lurk
An ideal state of concentration for giving rise to insight is one that you can analyze in terms of stress and the absence of stress even while you're in it
Once your mind was firmly established in a state of concentration Ajaan Fuang would recommend lifting it from its object but not so far that the concentration was destroyed
From that perspective you could evaluate what levels of stress were still present in the concentration and let them go
In the initial stages this usually involved evaluating how you were relating to the breath and detecting more subtle levels of breath energy in the body that would provide a basis for deeper levels of stillness
Once the breath was perfectly still and the sense of the body started dissolving into a formless mist this process would involve detecting the perceptions of space knowing oneness etc that would appear in place of the body and could be peeled away like the layers of an onion in the mind
In either case the basic pattern was the same detecting the level of perception or mental fabrication that was causing the unnecessary stress and dropping it for a more subtle level of perception or fabrication until there was nothing left to drop

This was why as long as your awareness was still and alert allaround it didn't matter whether you were in the first or the fourteenth jhana for the way you treated your state of concentration was always the same
By directing your attention to issues of stress and its absence he was pointing you to terms by which to evaluate your state of mind for yourself without having to ask any outside authority
And as it turns out the terms you can evaluate for yourself  stress its cause its cessation and the path to its cessation  are the issues that define the four noble truths the right view that the Buddha says can lead to total liberation

For all the subtlety of his teachings the Buddha had a simple test for measuring wisdom
You're wise he said to the extent that you can get yourself to do things you don't like doing but know will result in happiness and to refrain from things you like doing but know will result in pain and harm
He derived this standard for wisdom from his insight into the radical importance of intentional action in shaping our experience of happiness and sorrow pleasure and pain
With action so important and yet so frequently misguided wisdom has to be tactical strategic in fostering actions that are truly beneficial
It has to outwit shortsighted preferences to yield a happiness that lasts
Because the Buddha viewed all issues of experience from the gross to the subtle in terms of intentional actions and their results his tactical standard for wisdom applies to all levels as well from the wisdom of simple generosity to the wisdom of emptiness and ultimate Awakening
Wisdom on all levels is wise because it works
It makes a difference in what you do and the happiness that results
And to work it requires integrity the willingness to look honestly at the results of your actions to admit when you've caused harm and to change your ways so that you won't make the same mistake again
What's striking about this standard for wisdom is how direct and down to earth it is
This might come as a surprise for most of us don't think of Buddhist wisdom as so commonsensical and straightforward
Instead the phrase Buddhist wisdom conjures up teachings more abstract and paradoxical flying in the face of common sense  emptiness being a prime example
Emptiness we're told means that nothing has any inherent existence
In other words on an ultimate level things aren't what we conventionally think of as things They're processes that are in no way separate from all the other processes on which they depend
This is a philosophically sophisticated idea that's fascinating to ponder but it doesn't provide much obvious help in getting you up early on a cold morning to meditate nor in convincing you to give up a destructive addiction
For example if you're addicted to alcohol it's not because you feel that the alcohol has any inherent existence
It's because in your calculation the immediate pleasure derived from the alcohol outweighs the longterm damage it's doing to your life
This is a general principle attachment and addiction are not metaphysical problems
They're tactical ones
We're attached to things and actions not because of what we think they are but because of what we think they can do for our happiness
If we keep overestimating the pleasure and underestimating the pain they bring we stay attached to them regardless of what in an ultimate sense we understand them to be
Because the problem is tactical the solution has to be tactical as well
The cure for addiction and attachment lies in retraining your imagination and your intentions through expanding your sense of the power of your actions and the possible happiness you can achieve
This means learning to become more honest and sensitive to your actions and their consequences at the same time allowing yourself to imagine and master alternative routes to greater happiness with fewer drawbacks
Metaphysical views may sometimes enter into the equation but at most they're only secondary
Many times they're irrelevant
Even if you were to see the alcohol and its pleasure as lacking inherent existence you'd still go for the pleasure as long as you saw it as outweighing the damage
Sometimes ideas of metaphysical emptiness can actually be harmful
If you start focusing on how the damage of drinking  and the people damaged by your drinking  are empty of inherent existence you could develop a rationale for continuing to drink
So the teaching on metaphysical emptiness wouldn't seem to pass the Buddha's own test for wisdom
The irony here is that the idea of emptiness as lack of inherent existence has very little to do with what the Buddha himself said about emptiness
His teachings on emptiness  as reported in the earliest Buddhist texts the Pali Canon  deal directly with actions and their results with issues of pleasure and pain
To understand and experience emptiness in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication but a personal integrity willing to admit the actual motivations behind your actions and the actual benefits and harm they cause
For these reasons this version of emptiness is very relevant in developing the sort of wisdom that would pass the Buddha's commonsensical test for measuring how wise you are
The Buddha's teachings on emptiness  contained in two major discourses and several smaller ones  define it in three distinct ways as an approach to meditation as an attribute of the senses and their objects and as a state of concentration
Although these forms of emptiness differ in their definitions they ultimately converge on the same route to release from suffering
To see how this happens we will need to examine the three meanings of emptiness one by one
In doing so we'll find that each of them applies the Buddha's commonsensical test for wisdom to subtle actions of the mind
But to understand how this test applies to this subtle level we first have to see how it applies to actions on a more obvious level
For that there's no better introduction than the Buddha's advice to his son Rahula on how to cultivate wisdom while engaging in the activities of everyday life
The Buddha told Rahula  who was seven at the time  to use his thoughts words and deeds as a mirror
In other words just as you would use a mirror to check for any dirt on your face Rahula was to use his actions as a means of learning where there was still anything impure in his mind
Before he acted he should try to anticipate the results of the action
If he saw that they'd be harmful to himself or to others he shouldn't follow through with the action
If he foresaw no harm he could go ahead and act
If in the course of doing the action he saw it causing unexpected harm he should stop the action
If he didn't see any harm he could continue with it
If after he was done he saw any longterm harm resulting from the action he should consult with another person on the path to get some perspective on what he had done  and on how not to do it again  and then resolve not to repeat that mistake
In other words he should not feel embarrassed or ashamed to reveal his mistakes to people he respected for if he started hiding his mistakes from them he would soon start hiding them from himself
If on the other hand he saw no harm resulting from the action he should rejoice in his progress in the practice and continue with his training
The right name for this reflection is not selfpurification It's actionpurification You deflect judgments of good and bad away from your sense of self where they can tie you down with conceit and guilt
Instead you focus directly on the actions themselves where the judgments can allow you to learn from your mistakes and to find a healthy joy in what you did right
When you keep reflecting in this way it serves many purposes
First and foremost it forces you to be honest about your intentions and about the effects of your actions
Honesty here is a simple principle you don't add any afterthefact rationalizations to cover up what you actually did nor do you try to subtract from the actual facts through denial
Because you're applying this honesty to areas where the normal reaction is to be embarrassed about or afraid of the truth it's more than a simple registering of the facts
It also requires moral integrity
This is why the Buddha stressed morality as a precondition for wisdom and declared the highest moral principle to be the precept against lying
If you don't make a habit of admitting uncomfortable truths the truth as a whole will elude you
The second purpose of this reflection is to emphasize the power of your actions
You see that your actions do make the difference between pleasure and pain
Third you gain practice in learning from your mistakes without shame or remorse
Fourth you realize that the more honest you are in evaluating your actions the more power you have to change your ways in a positive direction
And finally you develop good will and compassion in that you resolve to act only on intentions that mean no harm to anyone and you continually focus on developing the skill of harmlessness as your top priority
All of these lessons are necessary to develop the kind of wisdom measured by the Buddha's test for wisdom and as it turns out they're directly related to the first meaning of emptiness as an approach to meditation
In fact this sort of emptiness simply takes the instructions Rahula received for observing everyday actions and extends them to the act of perception within the mind
Emptiness as an approach to meditation is the most basic of the three kinds of emptiness
In the context of this approach emptiness means empty of disturbance  or to put it in other terms empty of stress
You bring the mind to concentration and then examine your state of concentration in order to detect the presence or absence of subtle disturbance or stress still inherent within that state
When you find a disturbance you follow it back to the perception  the mental label or act of recognition  on which the concentration is based
Then you drop that perception in favor of a more refined one one leading to a state of concentration with less inherent disturbance
In the discourse explaining this meaning of emptiness the Buddha introduces his explanation with a simile
He and Ananda are dwelling in an abandoned palace that is now a quiet monastery
The Buddha tells Ananda to notice and appreciate how the monastery is empty of the disturbances it contained when it was still used as a palace  the disturbances caused by gold and silver elephants and horses assemblies of women and men
The only disturbance remaining is that caused by the presence of the monks meditating in unity
Taking this observation as a simile the Buddha launches into his description of emptiness as an approach to meditation
He describes a monk meditating in the wilderness who is simply noting to himself that he is now in the wilderness
The monk allows his mind to concentrate on and enjoy the perception wilderness He then steps back mentally to observe and appreciate that this mode of perception is empty of the disturbances that come with perceptions of the village life he has left behind
The only remaining disturbances are those associated with the perception wilderness  for example any emotional reactions to the dangers that wilderness might entail
As the Buddha says the monk sees accurately which disturbances are not present in that mode of perception as for those remaining he sees accurately There is this In other words he adds nothing to what is there and takes nothing away
This is how he enters into a meditative emptiness that is pure and undistorted
Then noting the disturbances inherent in the act of focusing on wilderness the monk drops that perception and replaces it with a more refined perception one with less potential for arousing disturbance
He chooses the earth element banishing from his mind any details of the hills and ravines of the earth simply taking note of its earthness
He repeats the process he applied to the perception of wilderness  settling into the perception of earth fully indulging in it and then stepping back to notice how the disturbances associated with wilderness are now gone while the only remaining disturbances are those associated with the singleness of mind based on the perception of earth
He then repeats the same process with ever more refined perceptions settling into the formless jhanas or meditative absorptions infinite space infinite consciousness nothingness neither perception nor nonperception and the objectless concentration of awareness
Finally seeing that even this objectless concentration of awareness is fabricated and willed he drops his desire to continue mentally fabricating anything at all
In this way he is released from the mental fermentations  sensual desire becoming views ignorance  that would bubble up into further becoming
He observes that this release still has the disturbances that come with the functioning of the six sense spheres but that it's empty of all fermentation all potential for further suffering and stress
This concludes the Buddha is the entry into a pure and undistorted emptiness that is superior and unsurpassed
It's the emptiness in which he himself dwells and that throughout time has never been nor ever will be excelled
Throughout this description emptiness means one thing empty of disturbance or stress
The meditator is taught to appreciate the lack of disturbance as a positive accomplishment and to see any remaining disturbance created by the mind however subtle as a problem to be solved
When you understand disturbance as a subtle form of harm you see the connections between this description of emptiness and the Buddha's instructions to Rahula
Instead of regarding his meditative states as a measure of selfidentity or selfworth  in having developed a self that's purer more expansive more at one with the ground of being  the monk views them simply in terms of actions and their consequences
And the same principles apply here on the meditative level as apply in the Buddha's comments to Rahula on action in general
Here the action is the perception that underlies your state of meditative concentration
You settle into the state by repeating the action of perception continually until you are thoroughly familiar with it
Just as Rahula discovered the consequences of his actions by observing the obvious harm done to himself or to others here you discover the consequences of concentrating on the perception by seeing how much disturbance arises from the mental action
As you sense disturbance you can change your mental action moving your concentration to a more refined perception until ultimately you can stop the fabrication of mental states altogether
At the core of this meditation practice are two important principles derived from the instructions to Rahula
The first is honesty the ability to be free of embellishment or denial adding no interpretation to the disturbance actually present while at the same time not trying to deny that it's there
An integral part of this honesty is the ability to see things simply as action and result without reading into them the conceit I am
The second principle is compassion  the desire to end suffering  in that you keep trying to abandon the causes of stress and disturbance wherever you find them
The effects of this compassion extend not only to yourself but to others as well
When you don't weigh yourself down with stress you're less likely to be a burden to others you're also in a better position to help shoulder their burdens when need be
In this way the principles of integrity and compassion underlie even the most subtle expressions of the wisdom leading to release
This process of developing emptiness of disturbance is not necessarily smooth and straightforward
It keeps requiring the strength of will needed to give up any attachment
This is because an essential step in getting to know the meditative perception as an action is learning to settle into it to indulge in it  in other words to enjoy it thoroughly even to the point of attachment
This is one of the roles of tranquility in meditation
If you don't learn to enjoy the meditation enough to keep at it consistently you won't grow familiar with it
If you aren't familiar with it insight into its consequences won't arise
However unless you've already had practice using the Rahula instructions to overcome grosser attachments then even if you gain insight into the disturbances caused by your attachment to concentration your insight will lack integrity
Because you haven't had any practice with more blatant attachments you won't be able to pry loose your subtle attachments in a reliable way
You first need to develop the moral habit of looking at your actions and their consequences believing firmly  through experience  in the worth of refraining from harm however subtle
Only then will you have the skill needed to develop emptiness as an approach to meditation in a pure and undistorted way that will carry you all the way to its intended goal
Emptiness as an attribute when used as a departure point for practice leads to a similar process but by a different route
Whereas emptiness as an approach to meditation focuses on issues of disturbance and stress emptiness as an attribute focuses on issues of self and notself
And whereas emptiness as an approach to meditation starts with tranquility emptiness as an attribute starts with insight
The Buddha describes this kind of emptiness in a short discourse
Again Ananda is his interlocutor opening the discourse with a question In what way is the world empty
The Buddha answers that each of the six senses and their objects are empty of one's self or anything pertaining to one's self
The discourse gives no further explanation but related discourses show that this insight can be put into practice in one of two ways
The first is to reflect on what the Buddha says about self and how ideas of self can be understood as forms of mental activity
The second way which we will discuss in the next section is to develop the perception of all things being empty of one's self as a basis for a state of refined concentration
However as we shall see both of these tactics ultimately lead back to using the first form of emptiness as an approach to meditation to complete the path to Awakening
When talking about self the Buddha refused to say whether it exists or not but he gave a detailed description of how the mind develops the idea of self as a strategy based on craving
In our desire for happiness we repeatedly engage in what the Buddha calls Imaking and mymaking as ways of trying to exercise control over pleasure and pain
Because Imaking and mymaking are actions they fall under the purview of the Buddha's instructions to Rahula
Whenever you engage in them you should check to see whether they lead to affliction if they do you should abandon them
This is a lesson that on a blatant level we learn even as children
If you lay claim to a piece of candy belonging to your sister you're going to get into a fight
If she's bigger than you you'd do better not to claim the candy as yours
Much of our practical education as we grow up lies in discovering where it's beneficial to create a sense of self around something and where it's not
If you learn to approach your Imaking and mymaking in the light of the Rahula instructions you greatly refine this aspect of your education as you find yourself forced to be more honest discerning and compassionate in seeing where an I is a liability and where it's an asset
On a blatant level you discover that while there are many areas where I and mine lead only to useless conflicts there are others where they're beneficial
The sense of I that leads you to be generous and principled in your actions is an I worth making worth mastering as a skill
So too is the sense of I that can assume responsibility for your actions and can be willing to sacrifice a small pleasure in the present for a greater happiness in the future
This kind of I with practice leads away from affliction and toward increasing levels of happiness
This is the I that will eventually lead you to practice meditation for you see the longterm benefits that come from training your powers of mindfulness concentration and discernment
However as meditation refines your sensitivity you begin to notice the subtle levels of affliction and disturbance that Imaking and mymaking can create in the mind
They can get you attached to a state of calm so that you resent any intrusions on my calm
They can get you attached to your insights so that you develop pride around my insights
This can block further progress for the sense of I and mine can blind you to the subtle stress on which the calm and insights are based
If you've had training in following the Rahula instructions though you'll come to appreciate the advantages of learning to see even the calm and the insights as empty of self or anything pertaining to self
That is the essence of this second type of emptiness
When you remove labels of I or mine even from your own insights and mental states how do you see them
Simply as instances of stress arising and passing away  disturbance arising and passing away  with nothing else added or taken away
As you pursue this mode of perception you're adopting the first form of emptiness as an approach to meditation
The third kind of emptiness taught by the Buddha  as a state of concentration  is essentially another way of using insight into emptiness as an attribute of the senses and their objects as a means to attain release
One discourse describes it as follows A monk goes to sit in a quiet place and intentionally perceives the six senses and their objects as empty of self or anything pertaining to self
As he pursues this perception it brings his mind not directly to release but to the formless jhana of nothingness which is accompanied by strong equanimity
Another discourse pursues this topic further noting that the monk relishes the equanimity
If he simply keeps on relishing it his meditation goes no further than that
But if he learns to see that equanimity as an action  fabricated willed  he can look for the subtle stress it engenders
If he can observe this stress as it arises and passes away simply on its own terms neither adding any other perceptions to it nor taking anything away he's again adopting emptiness as an approach to his meditation
By dropping the causes of stress wherever he finds them in his concentration he ultimately reaches the highest form of emptiness free from all mental fabrication
Thus the last two types of emptiness ultimately lead back to the first  emptiness as an approach to meditation  which means that all three types of emptiness ultimately lead to the same destination
Whether they interpret emptiness as meaning empty of disturbance or empty of self whether they encourage fostering insight through tranquility or tranquility through insight they all culminate in a practice that completes the tasks appropriate to the four noble truths comprehending stress abandoning its cause realizing its cessation and developing the path to that cessation
Completing these tasks leads to release
What's distinctive about this process is the way it grows out of the principles of actionpurification that the Buddha taught to Rahula applying these principles to every step of the practice from the most elementary to the most refined
As the Buddha told Rahula these principles are the only possible means by which purity can be attained
Although most explanations of this statement define purity as purity of virtue the Buddha's discussion of emptiness as an approach to meditation shows that purity here means purity of mind and purity of wisdom as well
Every aspect of the training is purified by viewing it in terms of actions and consequences which helps to develop the integrity that's willing to admit to unskillful actions and the mature goodwill that keeps aiming at consequences entailing ever less harm disturbance and stress
This is where this sort of emptiness differs from the metaphysical definition of emptiness as lack of inherent existence Whereas that view of emptiness doesn't necessarily involve integrity  it's an attempt to describe the ultimate truth of the nature of things rather than to evaluate actions  this approach to emptiness requires honestly evaluating your mental actions and their results
Integrity is thus integral to its mastery
In this way the highest levels of wisdom and discernment grow primarily not from the type of knowledge fostered by debate and logical analysis nor from the type fostered by bare awareness or mere noting
They grow from the knowledge fostered by integrity devoid of conceit coupled with compassion and goodwill
The reason for this is so obvious that it's often missed if you're going to put an end to suffering you need the compassion to see that this is a worthwhile goal and the integrity to admit the suffering you've heedlessly and needlessly caused throughout the past
The ignorance that gives rise to suffering occurs not because you don't know enough or are not philosophically sophisticated enough to understand the true meaning of emptiness
It comes from being unwilling to admit that what you're obviously doing right before your very eyes is causing suffering
This is why Awakening destroys conceit it awakens you to the full extent of the willful blindness that has kept you complicit in unskillful behavior all along
It's a chastening experience
The only honest thing to do in response to this experience is to open to release
That's the emptiness that's superior and unsurpassed
In building the path to this emptiness on the same principles that underlie the more elementary levels of actionpurification the Buddha managed to avoid creating artificial dichotomies between conventional and ultimate truths in the practice
For this reason his approach to ultimate wisdom helps validate the more elementary levels as well
When you realize that an undistorted understanding of emptiness depends on the skills you develop in adopting a responsible honest and kind attitude toward all your actions you're more likely to bring this attitude to everything you do  gross or subtle
You give more importance to all your actions and their consequences you give more importance to your sense of integrity for you realize that these things are directly related to the skills leading to total release
You can't develop a throwaway attitude to your actions and their consequences for if you do you're throwing away your chances for a true and unconditional happiness
The skills you need to talk yourself into meditating on a cold dark morning or into resisting a drink on a lazy afternoon are the same ones that will eventually guarantee an undistorted realization of the highest peace
This is how the Buddha's teachings on emptiness encourage you to exercise wisdom in everything you do
The brahmaviharas or sublime attitudes are the Buddha's primary heart teachings  the ones that connect most directly with our desire for true happiness
The term brahmavihara literally means dwelling place of brahmas Brahmas are gods who live in the higher heavens dwelling in an attitude of unlimited goodwill unlimited compassion unlimited empathetic joy and unlimited equanimity
These unlimited attitudes can be developed from the more limited versions of these emotions that we experience in the human heart
Of these four emotions goodwill is the most fundamental
It's the wish for true happiness a wish you can direct to yourself or to others
Goodwill was the underlying motivation that led the Buddha to search for awakening and to teach the path to awakening to others after he had found it
The next two emotions in the list are essentially applications of goodwill
Compassion is what goodwill feels when it encounters suffering It wants the suffering to stop
Empathetic joy is what goodwill feels when it encounters happiness It wants the happiness to continue
Equanimity is a different emotion in that it acts as an aid to and a check on the other three
When you encounter suffering that you can't stop no matter how hard you try you need equanimity to avoid creating additional suffering and to channel your energies to areas where you can be of help
In this way equanimity isn't cold hearted or indifferent
It simply makes your goodwill more focused and effective
Making these attitudes limitless requires work
It's easy to feel goodwill compassion and empathetic joy for people you like and love but there are bound to be people you dislike  often for very good reasons
Similarly there are many people for whom it's easy to feel equanimity people you don't know or don't really care about
But it's hard to feel equanimity when people you love are suffering
Yet if you want to develop the brahmaviharas you have to include all of these people within the scope of your awareness so that you can apply the proper attitude no matter where or when
This is where your heart needs the help of your head
All too often meditators believe that if they can simply add a little more heart juice a little more emotional oomph to their brahmavihara practice their attitudes can become limitless
But if something inside you keeps churning up reasons for liking this person or hating that one your practice starts feeling hypocritical
You wonder who you're trying to fool
Or after a month devoted to the practice you still find yourself thinking black thoughts about people who cut you off in traffic  to say nothing of people who've done the world serious harm
This is where the head comes in
If we think of the heart as the side of the mind that wants happiness the head is the side that understands how cause and effect actually work
If your head and heart can learn to cooperate  that is if your head can give priority to finding the causes for true happiness and your heart can learn to embrace those causes  then the training of the mind can go far
This is why the Buddha taught the brahmaviharas in a context of head teachings the principle of causality as it plays out in karma and the process of fabrication that shapes emotions within the body and mind
The more we can get our heads around these teachings the easier it will be to put our whole heart into developing attitudes that truly are sublime
An understanding of karma helps to explain what we're doing as we develop the brahmaviharas and why we might want to do so in the first place
An understanding of fabrication helps to explain how we can take our human heart and convert it into a place where brahmas could dwell
The teaching on karma starts with the principle that people experience happiness and sorrow based on a combination of their past and present intentions
If we act with unskillful intentions either for ourselves or for others we're going to suffer
If we act with skillful intentions we'll experience happiness
So if we want to be happy we have to train our intentions to always be skillful
This is the first reason for developing the brahmaviharas so that we can make our intentions more trustworthy
Some people say that unlimited goodwill comes naturally to us that our Buddha nature is intrinsically compassionate
But the Buddha never said anything about Buddhanature
What he did say is that the mind is even more variegated than the animal world
We're capable of anything
So what are we going to do with this capability
We could do  and have done  almost anything but the one thing the Buddha does assume across the board is that deep down inside we want to take this capability and devote it to happiness
So the first lesson of karma is that if you really want to be happy you can't trust that deep down you know the right thing to do because that would simply foster complacency
Unskillful intentions would take over and you wouldn't even know it
Instead you have to be heedful to recognize unskillful intentions for what they are and to act only on skillful ones
The way to ensure that you'll stay heedful is to take your desire for happiness and spread it around
The second lesson of karma is that just as you're the primary architect of your own happiness and suffering other people are the primary architects of theirs
If you really want them to be happy you don't just treat them nicely
You also want them to learn how to create the causes for happiness
If you can you want to show them how to do that
This is why the gift of dharma  lessons in how to give rise to true happiness  is the greatest gift
In the Buddha's most famous example of how to express an attitude of unlimited good will he doesn't just express the following wish for universal happiness
He immediately adds a wish that all beings avoid the causes that would lead them to unhappiness
So if you're using visualization as part of your goodwill practice don't visualize people simply as smiling surrounded willynilly by wealth and sensual pleasures
Visualize them acting speaking and thinking skillfully
If they're currently acting on unskillful intentions visualize them changing their ways
Then act to realize those visualizations if you can
A similar principle applies to compassion and empathetic joy
Learn to feel compassion not only for people who are already suffering but also for those who are engaging in unskillful actions that will lead to future suffering
This means if possible trying to stop them from doing those things
And learn to feel empathetic joy not only for those who are already happy but also for those whose actions will lead to future happiness
If you have the opportunity give them encouragement
But you also have to realize that no matter how unlimited the scope of these positive emotions their effect is going to run into limits
In other words regardless of how strong your goodwill or compassion may be there are bound to be people whose past actions are unskillful and who cannot or will not change their ways in the present
This is why you need equanimity as your reality check
When you encounter areas where you can't be of help you learn not to get upset
Think about the universality of the principle of karma it applies to everyone regardless of whether you like them or not
That puts you in a position where you can see more clearly what can be changed where you can be of help
In other words equanimity isn't a blanket acceptance of things as they are
It's a tool for helping you to develop discernment as to which kinds of suffering you have to accept and which ones you don't
For example someone in your family may be suffering from Alzheimer's
If you get upset about the fact of the disease you're limiting your ability to be genuinely helpful
To be more effective you have to use equanimity as a means of letting go of what you want to change and focusing more on what can be changed in the present
A third lesson from the principle of karma is that developing the brahmaviharas can also help mitigate the results of your past bad actions
The Buddha explains this point with an analogy If you put a lump of salt into a glass of water you can't drink the water in the glass
But if you put that lump of salt into a river you could then drink the water in the river because the river contains so much more water than salt
When you develop the four brahmaviharas your mind is like the river
The skillful karma of developing these attitudes in the present is so expansive that whatever results of past bad actions may arise you hardly notice them
A proper understanding of karma also helps to correct the false idea that if people are suffering they deserve to suffer so you might as well just leave them alone
When you catch yourself thinking in those terms you have to keep four principles in mind
First remember that when you look at people you can't see all the karmic seeds from their past actions
They may be experiencing the results of past bad actions but you don't know when those seeds will stop sprouting
Also you have no idea what other seeds whatever wonderful latent potentials will sprout in their place
There's a saying in some Buddhist circles that if you want to see a person's past actions you look at his present condition if you want to see his future condition you look at his present actions
This principle however is based on a basic misperception that we each have a single karmic account and what we see in the present is the current running balance in each person's account
Actually no one's karmic history is a single account
It's composed of the many different seeds planted in many places through the many different actions we've done in the past each seed maturing at its own rate
Some of these seeds have already sprouted and disappeared some are sprouting now some will sprout in the future
This means that a person's present condition reflects only a small portion of his or her past actions
As for the other seeds you can't see them at all
This reflection helps you when developing compassion for it reminds you that you never know when the possibility to help somebody can have an effect
The seeds of the other person's past bad actions may be flowering right now but they could die at any time
You may happen to be the person who's there to help when that person is ready to receive help
The same pattern applies to empathetic joy
Suppose that your neighbor is wealthier than you are
You may resist feeling empathetic joy for him because you think He's already welloff while I'm still struggling
Why should I wish him to be even happier than he is If you find yourself thinking in those terms remind yourself that you don't know what your karmic seeds are you don't know what his karmic seeds are
Maybe his good karmic seeds are about to die
Do you want them to die any faster
Does his happiness diminish yours
What kind of attitude is that
It's useful to think in these ways
The second principle to keep in mind is that in the Buddha's teaching there's no question of a person's deserving happiness or deserving pain
The Buddha simply says that there are actions leading to pleasure and actions leading to pain
Karma is not a respecter of persons it's simply an issue of actions and results
Good people may have some bad actions squirreled away in their past
People who seem horrible may have done some wonderful things
You never know
So there's no question of a person's deserving or not deserving pleasure or pain
There's simply the principle that actions have results and that your present experience of pleasure or pain is the combined result of past and present actions
You may have some very unskillful actions in your past but if you learn to think skillfully when those actions bear fruit in the present you don't have to suffer
A third principle applies to the question of whether the person who's suffering deserves your compassion
You sometimes hear that everyone deserves your compassion because they all have Buddhanature
But this ignores the primary reason for developing compassion as a brahmavihara in the first place You need to make your compassion universal so that you can trust your intentions
If you regard your compassion as so precious that only Buddhas deserve it you won't be able to trust yourself when encountering people whose actions are consistently evil
At the same time you have to remember that no human being has a totally pure karmic past so you can't make a person's purity the basis for your compassion
Some people resist the idea that say children born into a warzone suffering from brutality and starvation are there for a karmic reason
It seems heartless they say to attribute these sufferings to karma from past lives
The only heartlessness here though is the insistence that people are worthy of compassion only if they are innocent of any wrongdoing
Remember that you don't have to like or admire someone to feel compassion for that person
All you have to do is wish for that person to be happy
The more you can develop this attitude toward people you know have misbehaved the more you'll be able to trust your intentions in any situation
The Buddha illustrates this point with a graphic analogy Even if bandits attack you and saw off your limbs with a twohandled saw you have to feel goodwill starting with them and then spreading to include the entire world
If you keep this analogy in mind it helps to protect you from acting in unskillful ways no matter how badly provoked
The fourth principle to remember concerns the karma you're creating right now in reaction to other people's pleasure and pain
If you're resentful of somebody else's happiness someday when you get happy there's going to be somebody resentful of yours
Do you want that
Or if you're hardhearted toward somebody who's suffering right now someday you may face the same sort of suffering
Do you want people to be hardhearted toward you
Always remember that your reactions are a form of karma so be mindful to create the kind of karma that gives the results you'd like to see
When you think in these ways you see that it really is in your interest to develop the brahmaviharas in all situations
So the question is how do you do that
This is where another aspect of the Buddha's teachings on causality plays a role his teaching on fabrication or the way you shape your experience
Fabrication is of three kinds bodily verbal and mental
Bodily fabrication is the way you breathe
Verbal fabrications are thoughts and mental comments on things  your internal speech
In Pali these thoughts and comments are called vitakka  directed thought and vicara evaluation
Mental fabrications are perceptions and feelings the mental labels you apply to things and the feelings of pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain you feel about them
Any desire or emotion is made up of these three types of fabrication
It starts with thoughts and perceptions and then it gets into your body through the way you breathe
This is why emotions seem so real so insistent so genuinely you But as the Buddha points out you identify with these things because you fabricate them in ignorance you don't know what you're doing and you suffer as a result
But if you can fabricate your emotions with knowledge they can form a path to the end of suffering
And the breath is a good place to start
If for example you're feeling anger toward someone ask yourself How am I breathing right now
How can I change the way I breathe so that my body can feel more comfortable Anger often engenders a sense of discomfort in the body and you feel you've got to get rid of it
The common ways of getting rid of it are two and they're both unskillful either you bottle it up or you try to get it out of your system by letting it out in your words and deeds
So the Buddha provides a third more skillful alternative Breathe through your discomfort and dissolve it away
Let the breath create physical feelings of ease and fullness and allow those feelings to saturate your whole body
This physical ease helps put the mind at ease as well
When you're operating from a sense of ease it's easier to fabricate skillful perceptions as you evaluate your response to the issue with which you're faced
Here the analogy of the lump of salt is an important perception to keep in mind as it reminds you to perceive the situation in terms of your need for your own goodwill to protect yourself from bad karma
Part of this protection is to look for the good points of the person you're angry at
And to help with this perception the Buddha provides an even more graphic analogy to remind you of why this approach is not mere sentimentality If you see someone who's been really nasty to you in his words and deeds but has moments of honesty and goodwill it's as if you're walking through a desert  hot trembling thirsty  and you come across a cow footprint with a little bit of water in it
Now what do you do
You can't scoop the water up with your hand because that would muddy it
Instead you get down on your hands and knees and very carefully slurp it up
Notice your position in this image
It may seem demeaning to have your mouth to the ground like this but remember You're trembling with thirst
You need water
If you focus just on the bad points of other people you're going to feel even more oppressed with the heat and the thirst
You'll get bitter about the human race and see no need to treat it well
But if you can see the good in other people you'll find it easier to treat them skillfully
Their good points are like water for your heart
You need to focus on them to nourish your own goodness now and in the future
If however the person you're angry about has no good qualities at all then the Buddha recommends another perception Think of that person as a sick stranger you've found on the side of the road far away from any help
You have to feel compassion for him and do whatever you can to get him to the safety of skillful thoughts words and deeds
What you've done here is to use skillful verbal fabrication  thinking about and evaluating the breath  to turn the breath into a skillful bodily fabrication
This in turn creates a healthy mental fabrication  the feeling of ease  that makes it easier to mentally fabricate perceptions that can deconstruct your unskillful reaction and construct a skillful emotion in its place
This is how we use our knowledge of karma and fabrication to shape our emotions in the direction we want  which is why head teachings are needed even in matters of the heart
At the same time because we've sensitized ourselves to the role that the breath plays in shaping emotion we can make a genuine change in how we physically feel about these matters
We're not playing make believe
Our change of heart becomes fully embodied genuinely felt
This helps undercut the feeling of hypocrisy that can sometimes envelop the practice of the brahmaviharas
Instead of denying our original feelings of anger or distress in any given situation smothering them with a mass of cotton candy or marshmallow cream we actually get more closely in touch with them and learn to skillfully reshape them
All too often we think that getting in touch with our emotions is a means of tapping into who we really are  that we've been divorced from our true nature and that by getting back in touch with our emotions we'll reconnect with our true identity
But your emotions are not your true nature they're just as fabricated as anything else
Because they're fabricated the real issue is to learn how to fabricate them skillfully so they don't lead to trouble and can instead lead to a trustworthy happiness
Remember that emotions cause you to act
They're paths leading to good or bad karma
When you see them as paths you can transform them into a path you can trust
As you learn how to deconstruct emotions of ill will hardheartedness resentment and distress and reconstruct the brahmaviharas in their place you don't simply attain an unlimited heart
You gain practice in mastering the processes of fabrication
As the Buddha says that mastery leads first to strong and blissful states of concentration
From there it can fabricate all the factors of the path leading to the goal of all the Buddha's teachings whether for head or for heart the total happiness of nirvana unconditionally true
Which simply goes to show that if you get your head and your heart to respect each other they can take each other far
Your heart needs the help of your head to generate and act on more skillful emotions
Your head needs your heart to remind you that what's really important in life is putting an end to suffering
When they learn how to work together they can make your human mind into an unlimited brahmamind
And more They can master the causes of happiness to the point where they transcend themselves touching an uncaused dimension that the head can't encompass and a happiness so true that the heart has no further need for desire
Emptiness is a mode of perception a way of looking at experience
It adds nothing to and takes nothing away from the raw data of physical and mental events
You look at events in the mind and the senses with no thought of whether there's anything lying behind them
This mode is called emptiness because it's empty of the presuppositions we usually add to experience to make sense of it the stories and worldviews we fashion to explain who we are and the world we live in
Although these stories and views have their uses the Buddha found that some of the more abstract questions they raise  of our true identity and the reality of the world outside  pull attention away from a direct experience of how events influence one another in the immediate present
Thus they get in the way when we try to understand and solve the problem of suffering
Say for instance that you're meditating and a feeling of anger toward your mother appears
Immediately the mind's reaction is to identify the anger as my anger or to say that I'm angry
It then elaborates on the feeling either working it into the story of your relationship to your mother or to your general views about when and where anger toward one's mother can be justified
The problem with all this from the Buddha's perspective is that these stories and views entail a lot of suffering
The more you get involved in them the more you get distracted from seeing the actual cause of the suffering the labels of I and mine that set the whole process in motion
As a result you can't find the way to unravel that cause and bring the suffering to an end
If however you can adopt the emptiness mode  by not acting on or reacting to the anger but simply watching it as a series of events in and of themselves  you can see that the anger is empty of anything worth identifying with or possessing
As you master the emptiness mode more consistently you see that this truth holds not only for such gross emotions as anger but also for even the most subtle events in the realm of experience
This is the sense in which all things are empty
When you see this you realize that labels of I and mine are inappropriate unnecessary and cause nothing but stress and pain
You can then drop them
When you drop them totally you discover a mode of experience that lies deeper still one that's totally free
To master the emptiness mode of perception requires training in firm virtue concentration and discernment
Without this training the mind tends to stay in the mode that keeps creating stories and world views
And from the perspective of that mode the teaching of emptiness sounds simply like another story or world view with new ground rules
In terms of the story of your relationship with your mother it seems to be saying that there's really no mother no you
In terms of your views about the world it seems to be saying either that the world doesn't really exist or else that emptiness is the great undifferentiated ground of being from which we all came to which someday we'll all return
These interpretations not only miss the meaning of emptiness but also keep the mind from getting into the proper mode
If the world and the people in the story of your life don't really exist then all the actions and reactions in that story seem like a mathematics of zeros and you wonder why there's any point in practicing virtue at all
If on the other hand you see emptiness as the ground of being to which we're all going to return then what need is there to train the mind in concentration and discernment since we're all going to get there anyway
And even if we need training to get back to our ground of being what's to keep us from coming out of it and suffering all over again
So in all these scenarios the whole idea of training the mind seems futile and pointless
By focusing on the question of whether or not there really is something behind experience they entangle the mind in issues that keep it from getting into the present mode
Now stories and world views do serve a purpose
The Buddha employed them when teaching people but he never used the word emptiness when speaking in these modes
He recounted the stories of people's lives to show how suffering comes from the unskillful perceptions behind their actions and how freedom from suffering can come from being more perceptive
And he described the basic principles that underlie the round of rebirth to show how bad intentional actions lead to pain within that round good ones lead to pleasure while really skillful actions can take you beyond the round altogether
In all these cases these teachings were aimed at getting people to focus on the quality of the perceptions and intentions in their minds in the present  in other words to get them into the emptiness mode
Once there they can use the teachings on emptiness for their intended purpose to loosen all attachments to views stories and assumptions leaving the mind empty of all greed anger and delusion and thus empty of suffering and stress
And when you come right down to it that's the emptiness that really counts
The Buddha is famous for having refused to take a position on many of the controversial issues of his day such as whether the cosmos is finite or infinite eternal or not
In fact many people  both in his time and in ours  have assumed that he didn't take a firm position on any issue at all
Based on this assumption some people have been exasperated with the Buddha accusing him of being wishywashy and indecisive while others have been pleased praising him for being tolerant and refreshingly free from ideas of right and wrong
Both reactions however are misinformed
The early texts report that a group of wanderers in a discussion with one of the Buddha's lay disciples once accused the Buddha of not taking a position on any issue and the disciple replied that they were mistaken
There was one issue on which the Buddha's position was very clear what kind of behavior is skillful and what kind of behavior is not
When the disciple later reported the conversation to the Buddha the Buddha approved of what he had said
The distinction between skillful and unskillful behavior lies at the basis of everything the Buddha taught
In making this distinction the Buddha drew some very sharp lines
What is unskillful
Taking life is unskillful taking what is not given sexual misconduct lying abusive speech divisive talebearing idle chatter is unskillful
Covetousness ill will wrong views are unskillful
These things are called unskillful
And what is skillful
Abstaining from taking life is skillful abstaining from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from lying from abusive speech from divisive talebearing abstaining from idle chatter is skillful
Lack of covetousness lack of ill will right views are skillful
These things are called skillful
Killing is never skillful
Stealing lying and everything else in the first list are never skillful
When asked if there was anything whose killing he approved of the Buddha answered that there was only one thing anger
In no recorded instance did he approve of killing any living being at all
When one of his monks went to an executioner and told the man to kill his victims compassionately with one blow rather than torturing them the Buddha expelled the monk from the Sangha on the grounds that even the recommendation to kill compassionately is still a recommendation to kill  something he would never condone
If a monk was physically attacked the Buddha allowed him to strike back in selfdefense but never with the intention to kill
As he told the monks
Even if bandits were to carve you up savagely limb by limb with a twohandled saw he among you who let his heart get angered even at that would not be doing my bidding
Even then you should train yourselves 'Our minds will be unaffected and we will say no evil words
We will remain sympathetic with a mind of good will and with no inner hate
We will keep pervading these people with an awareness imbued with good will and beginning with them we will keep pervading the allencompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will' That's how you should train yourselves
When formulating lay precepts based on his distinction between skillful and unskillful the Buddha never made any allowances for ifs ands or buts
When you promise yourself to abstain from killing or stealing the power of the promise lies in its universality
You won't break your promise to yourself under any conditions at all
This is because this sort of unconditional promise is a powerful gift
Take for instance the first precept against killing
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abandoning the taking of life abstains from taking life
In doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings
In giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppression
This is the first gift the first great gift  original longstanding traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning  that is not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and is unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives  brahmans
If you make exceptions in your promise to yourself  trying to justify killing in cases where you feel endangered or inconvenienced by another being's existence  your gift of freedom is limited and you lose your share in limitless freedom
Thus the gift of freedom to be fully effective has to be unconditional with no room for exceptions no matter how noble they may sound of any kind
The dynamic of this kind of gift of course depends on an important principle the teaching of karma and rebirth If you act on unskillful motivations the act will result in your suffering now or in lives to come if you act on skillful intentions the act will result in your pleasure now or in lives to come
If you don't kill anyone you are not creating the circumstances where anyone or anything will cut short your life span
Your past karma may still leave an opening for your murder or accidental death  you can't go back and undo what you've already done  but once you make and follow through with the promise not to kill again you are creating no new openings for having your life cut short
As the Dhammapada says
This is why the Buddha listed virtue as one of a person's greatest treasures
Kings and thieves can steal your material belongings and even take your life but they can't take your virtue
If it's uncompromising your virtue protects you from any true danger from now until you reach nirvana
Even if you're not ready to accept the teaching on karma and rebirth the Buddha still recommended an absolute standard of virtue
As he told the Kalamas if you decide to act skillfully at all times harming no one then even if it turned out that there was no life after death you'd still come out ahead for you would have been able to live and die with a clear conscience  something that no amount of money or political influence can buy
So the Buddha's position on the precepts was uncompromising and clear
If you want to follow his teachings there's absolutely no room for killing stealing or lying period
However in our current climate of terrorism and counterterrorism  where governments have claimed that it's their moral duty to lie kill and torture in order to prevent others from lying killing and torturing  a number of Buddhist teachers have joined in the effort trying to find evidence that there were some occasions at least where the Buddha would condone killing or offer a rationale for a just war
Exactly why they would want to do this is up to them to say but there's a need to examine their arguments in order to set the record straight
The Buddha never taught a theory of just war no decision to wage war can legitimately be traced to his teachings no war veteran has ever had to agonize over memories of the people he killed because the Buddha said that war was okay
These facts are among the glories of the Buddhist tradition and it's important for the human race that they not be muddied in an effort to recast the Buddha in our own less than glorious image
Because the Pali Canon is such an unpromising place to look for the justification of killing most of the arguments for a Buddhist theory of just war look elsewhere for their evidence citing the words and behavior of people they take as surrogates for the Buddha
These arguments are obviously on shaky ground and can be easily dismissed even by people who know nothing of the Canon
For example it has been argued that because Asian governments claiming to be Buddhist have engaged in war and torture the Buddha's teachings must condone such behavior
However we've had enough exposure to people claiming to be Christian whose behavior is very unChristian to realize that the same thing can probably happen in the Buddhist world as well
To take killers and torturers as your guide to the Buddha's teaching is hardly a sign of good judgment
On a somewhat higher note one writer has noted that his meditation teacher has told soldiers and policemen that if their duty is to kill they must perform their duty albeit compassionately and with mindfulness
The writer then goes on to argue that because his teacher is the direct recipient of an oral tradition dating back to the Buddha we must take this as evidence that the Buddha would give similar advice as well
This statement of course tells us more about the writer's faith in his teacher than about the Buddha and when we reflect that the Buddha expelled from the Sangha a monk who gave advice of this sort to an executioner it casts serious doubts on his argument
There are however writers who try to find evidence in the Pali Canon for a Buddhist theory of just war not in what the Buddha said but in what he didn't
The arguments go like this When talking with kings the Buddha never told them not to engage in war or capital punishment
This was his tacit admission that the king had a justifiable duty to engage in these activities and the kings would have understood his silence as such
Because these arguments cite the Pali Canon and claim a historian's knowledge of how silence was interpreted in the Buddha's day they seem to carry more authority than the others
But when we actually look at the Pali record of the Buddha's conversations with kings we find that the arguments are bogus
The Buddha was able to communicate the message to kings that they shouldn't kill but because kings in general were not the most promising students of the Dhamma he had to bring them to this message in an indirect way
It's true that in the Pali Canon silence is sometimes interpreted as acquiescence but this principle holds only in response to a request
If someone invited the Buddha to his house for a meal and the Buddha remained silent that was a sign of consent
However there were many instances in which the Buddha's silence was a sign not of acquiescence but of tact
A professional soldier once went to the Buddha and said that his teachers had taught the existence of a heaven awaiting soldiers who die in battle
What did the Buddha have to say about that
At first the Buddha declined to answer but when the soldier showed the sincerity of his question by pressing him three times for a response he finally replied
When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle his mind is already seized debased  misdirected by the thought 'May these beings be struck down or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyed
May they not exist' If others then strike him down  slay him while he is thus striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the hell called the realm of those slain in battle
But if he holds such a view as this 'When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle' that is his wrong view
Now there are two destinations for a person with wrong view I tell you either hell or the animal womb
The soldier then broke down and cried  not because he felt that the Buddha's words were cruel but because he believed their truth and was upset at his earlier teachers for having lied to him
In this case the Buddha's reticence and tact helped to make his teaching effective
A similar set of events happened when an actor asked the Buddha if there is a special heaven reserved for actors
The Buddha's reticence and tact in informing the actor of a hell for actors who incite their audiences to greed anger and delusion inspired the actor to respond in the same way as the soldier
If the pride of soldiers and actors required special handling even more care was required in the handling of kings for their pride was often coupled with an unrestrained sense of power
A remarkable feature of the Pali Canon is that even though the Buddha was a member of the noble warrior caste the discourses generally show a low regard for the spiritual standing of kings
In many passages kings are mentioned in the same breath with thieves They confiscate property and show little regard for the rule of law
The Canon does recognize exceptions  King Bimbisara of Magadha achieves streamentry the first time he hears the Dhamma and he never engages in war  but for the most part kings are depicted as spiritually stunted
King Ajatasattu on first seeing the Buddha sitting surrounded by monks can't tell which person in the assembly is the Buddha a sign of his spiritual blindness this blindness is later proven by his asking the Buddha's advice on how to defeat his innocent neighbors in war
As one of the discourses suggests this sort of blindness is an occupational hazard for rulers in that the unfair exercise of power can make a person unfit for learning the truth
Because of having wrongly inflicted suffering on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment 'I have power
I want power' when told what is factual he denies it and doesn't acknowledge it
When told what is unfactual he doesn't make an ardent effort to untangle it 'This is unfactual
This is baseless'
Even King Pasenadi of Kosala the king most closely associated with the Buddha comes across as wellmeaning but somewhat dense
An entire discourse MN is a satire of how his royal position has thwarted his ability to learn the Dhamma
He can't phrase his questions properly has trouble following a discussion for more than a few sentences and is unable to come to any certain conclusions about the truth
Still in other discourses he has his occasional moments of spiritual clarity and the Buddha uses those moments as opportunities to teach the Dhamma
The Buddha's approach here is twofold to try to expand the king's perspective on life at times when the king is willing to be frank and to encourage the king when the latter gains insights on his own
For example there's the famous discourse where Pasenadi comes to visit the Buddha in the middle of the day
The Buddha asks him what he's been doing and the king replies  in a moment of rare and wonderful frankness  that he's been involved in the sort of activities typical of a king intoxicated with his power
The Buddha takes this moment of frankness as an opportunity to teach the Dhamma
Suppose he says that four mountains were rolling in inexorably from the four directions crushing all life in their path
Given that the human birth is so rare and hard to achieve what should be done
The king's reply What else should be done but living in line with the Dhamma
The Buddha then draws the lesson Aging and death are rolling in inexorably
Given that the human birth is so rare and hard to achieve what should be done
The king draws the obvious conclusion that again the only thing to be done is to live in line with the Dhamma
He then goes on to make the observation that when aging and death are rolling in inexorably there is no role for armies wars clever advisors or great wealth to prevent their rolling in
The only thing to do is to live in line with the Dhamma
In another discourse Pasenadi comes to the Buddha and reports his own independent observation
Those who engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct leave themselves unprotected
Even though a squadron of elephant troops might protect them a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they leave themselves unprotected
Why is that
Because that's an external protection not an internal one
Therefore they leave themselves unprotected
But those who engage in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct have themselves protected
Even though neither a squadron of elephant troops a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops nor a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they have themselves protected
Why is that
Because that's an internal protection not an external one
Therefore they have themselves protected
It's highly unlikely that Pasenadi would have come to this conclusion if he hadn't spent time in conversation with the Buddha
From that conversation he would have learned the meaning of good bodily verbal and mental conduct the ten forms of skillful action
As a tactful teacher the Buddha simply concurred with the king's insight
The discourses suggest that this strategy encouraged the king to spend time in reflection of this sort for in other discourses the king reports many similar insights for the Buddha to confirm
We learn that the king did not always follow through with his insights but that's not because the Buddha encouraged him to view killing as his duty
In fact there is one striking example where these insights had at least a partial effect
Ajatasattu once attacked Pasenadi's kingdom and Pasenadi responded by raising an army to fight him off
After an initial setback Pasenadi was able to capture Ajatasattu
He could have killed him in revenge for that was allowable under the rules of engagement during his time
But he chose not to and it's hard not to see the Buddha's impact on this decision
When told of the battle the Buddha said
Benighted as he was Pasenadi still got the message
The question is why can't we
An anthropologist once questioned an Alaskan shaman about his tribe's belief system
After putting up with the anthropologist's questions for a while the shaman finally told him Look
We don't believe
We fear
His words have intrigued me ever since I first heard them
I've also been intrigued by the responses I get when I share his words with my friends
Some say that the shaman unconsciously put his finger on the line separating primitive religion from civilized religion primitive religion is founded on childish fear civilized religion on love trust and joy
Others maintain that the shaman cut through the pretensions and denials of civilized religion and pointed to the true source of all serious religious life
If we dig down to the assumptions underlying these two responses we find that the first response views fear itself as our greatest weakness
If we can simply overcome fear we put ourselves in a position of strength
The second sees fear as the most honest response to our greater weakness in the face of aging illness and death  a weakness that can't be overcome with a simple change in attitude
If we're not in touch with our honest fears we won't feel motivated to do what's needed to protect ourselves from genuine dangers
So  which attitude toward fear is childish and which is mature
Is there an element of truth in both
If so how can those elements best be combined
These questions are best answered by rephrasing them To what extent is fear a useful emotion
To what extent is it not
Does it have a role in the practice that puts an end to fear
The Buddhist answer to these questions is complex
This is due partly to Buddhism's dual roots  both as a civilized and as a wilderness tradition  and also to the complexity of fear itself even in its most primal forms
Think of a deer at night suddenly caught in a hunter's headlights
It's confused
Angry
It senses danger and that it's weak in the face of the danger
It wants to escape
These five elements  confusion aversion a sense of danger a sense of weakness and a desire to escape  are present to a greater or lesser extent in every fear
The confusion and aversion are the unskillful elements
Even if the deer has many openings to escape from the hunter its confusion and aversion might cause it to miss them
The same holds true for human beings
The mistakes and evils we commit when finding ourselves weak in the face of danger come from confusion and aversion
Maddeningly however there are also evils that we commit out of complacency when oblivious to actual dangers the callous things we do when we feel we can get away with them
Thus the last three elements of fear  the perception of weakness the perception of danger and the desire to escape it  are needed to avoid the evils coming from complacency
If stripped of confusion and aversion these three elements become a positive quality heedfulness  something so essential to the practice that the Buddha devoted his last words to it
The dangers of life are real
Our weaknesses are real
If we don't see them clearly don't take them to heart and don't try to find a way out there's no way we can put an end to the causes of our fears
Just like the deer if it's complacent about the hunter's headlights it's going to end up strapped to the fender for sure
So to genuinely free the mind from fear we can't simply deny that there's any reason for fear
We have to overcome the cause of fear the mind's weaknesses in the face of very real dangers
The elegance of the Buddha's approach to this problem though lies in his insight into the confusion  or to use the standard Buddhist term the delusion  that makes fear unskillful
Despite the complexity of fear delusion is the single factor that in itself is both the mind's prime weakness and its greatest danger
Thus the Buddha approaches the problem of fear by focusing on delusion and he attacks delusion in two ways getting us to think about its dangerous role in making fear unskillful and getting us to develop inner strengths leading to the insights that free the mind from the delusions that make it weak
In this way we not only overcome the factor that makes fear unskillful
We ultimately put the mind in a position where it has no need for fear
When we think about how delusion infects fear and incites us to do unskillful things we see that it can act in two ways
First the delusions surrounding our fears can cause us to misapprehend the dangers we face seeing danger where there is none and no danger where there is
If we obsess over nonexistent or trivial dangers we'll squander time and energy building up useless defenses diverting our attention from genuine threats
If on the other hand we put the genuine dangers of aging illness and death out of our minds we grow complacent in our actions
We let ourselves cling to things  our bodies our loved ones our possessions our views  that leave us exposed to aging illness separation and death in the first place
We allow our cravings to take charge of the mind sometimes to the point of doing evil with impunity thinking we're immune to the results of our evil that those results will never return to harm us
The more complacent we are about the genuine dangers lying in wait all around us the more shocked and confused we become when they actually hit
This leads to the second way in which the delusions surrounding our fears promote unskillful actions we react to genuine dangers in ways that instead of ending the dangers actually create new ones
We amass wealth to provide security but wealth creates a high profile that excites jealousy in others
We build walls to keep out dangerous people but those walls become our prisons
We stockpile weapons but they can easily be turned against us
The most unskillful response to fear is when perceiving dangers to our own life or property we believe that we can gain strength and security by destroying the lives and property of others
The delusion pervading our fear makes us lose perspective
If other people were to act in this way we would know they were wrong
But somehow when we feel threatened our standards change our perspective warps so that wrong seems right as long as we're the ones doing it
This is probably the most disconcerting human weakness of all our inability to trust ourselves to do the right thing when the chips are down
If standards of right and wrong are meaningful only when we find them convenient they have no real meaning at all
Fortunately though the area of life posing the most danger and insecurity is the area where through training we can make the most changes and exercise the most control
Although aging illness and death follow inevitably on birth delusion doesn't
It can be prevented
If through thought and contemplation we become heedful of the dangers it poses we can feel motivated to overcome it
However the insights coming from simple thought and contemplation aren't enough to fully understand and overthrow delusion
It's the same as with any revolution no matter how much you may think about the matter you don't really know the tricks and strengths of entrenched powers until you amass your own troops and do battle with them
And only when your own troops develop their own tricks and strengths can they come out on top
So it is with delusion only when you develop mental strengths can you see through the delusions that give fear its power
Beyond that these strengths can put you in a position where you are no longer exposed to dangers ever again
The Canon lists these mental strengths at five conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment
It also emphasizes the role that heedfulness plays in developing each for heedfulness is what enables each strength to counteract a particular delusion that makes fear unskillful and the mind weak in the face of its fears
What this means is that none of these strengths are mere brute forces
Each contains an element of wisdom and discernment which gets more penetrating as you progress along the list
Of the five strengths conviction requires the longest explanation both because it's one of the most misunderstood and underappreciated factors in the Buddhist path and because of the multiple delusions it has to counteract
The conviction here is conviction in the principle of karma that the pleasure and pain we experience depends on the quality of the intentions on which we act
This conviction counteracts the delusion that It's not in my best interest to stick to moral principles in the face of danger and it attacks this delusion in three ways
First it insists on what might be called the boomerang or spitting into the wind principle of karmic cause and effect
If you act on harmful intentions regardless of the situation the harm will come back to you
Even if unskillful actions such as killing stealing or lying might bring shortterm advantages these are more than offset by the longterm harm to which they leave you exposed
Conversely this same principle can make us brave in doing good
If we're convinced that the results of skillful intentions will have to return to us even if death intervenes we can more easily make the sacrifices demanded by longterm endeavors for our own good and that of others
Whether or not we live to see the results in this lifetime we're convinced that the good we do is never lost
In this way we develop the courage needed to build a store of skillful actions  generous and virtuous  that forms our first line of defense against dangers and fear
Second conviction insists on giving priority to your state of mind above all else for that's what shapes your intentions
This counteracts the corollary to the first delusion What if sticking to my principles makes it easier for people to do me harm This question is based ultimately on the delusion that life is our most precious possession
If that were true it would be a pretty miserable possession for it heads inexorably to death
Conviction views our life as precious only to the extent that it's used to develop the mind for the mind  when developed  is something that no one not even death can harm
Quality of life is measured by the quality and integrity of the intentions on which we act just as quality time is time devoted to the practice
Or in the Buddha's words
Third conviction insists that the need for integrity is unconditional
Even though other people may throw away their most valuable possession  their integrity  it's no excuse for us to throw away ours
The principle of karma isn't a traffic ordinance in effect only on certain hours of the day or certain days of the week
It's a law operating around the clock around the cycles of the cosmos
Some people have argued that because the Buddha recognized the principle of conditionality he would have no problem with the idea that our virtues should depend on conditions as well
This is a misunderstanding of the principle
To begin with conditionality doesn't simply mean that everything is changeable and contingent
It's like the theory of relativity
Relativity doesn't mean that all things are relative
It simply replaces mass and time  which long were considered constants  with another unexpected constant the speed of light
Mass and time may be relative to a particular inertial frame as the frame relates to the speed of light but the laws of physics are constant for all inertial frames regardless of speed
In the same way conditionality means that there are certain unchanging patterns to contingency and change  one of those patterns being that unskillful intentions based on craving and delusion invariably lead to unpleasant results
If we learn to accept this pattern rather than our feelings and opinions as absolute it requires us to become more ingenious in dealing with danger
Instead of following our unskillful kneejerk reactions we learn to think outside the box to find responses that best prevent harm of any kind
This gives our actions added precision and grace
At the same time we have to note that the Buddha didn't teach conditionality simply to encourage acceptance for the inevitability of change
He taught it to show how the patterns underlying change can be mastered to create an opening that leads beyond conditionality and change
If we want to reach the unconditioned  the truest security  our integrity has to be unconditional a gift of temporal security not only to those who treat us well but to everyone without exception
As the texts say when you abstain absolutely from doing harm you give a great gift  freedom from danger to limitless beings  and you yourself find a share in that limitless freedom as well
Conviction and integrity of this sort make great demands on us
Until we gain our first taste of the unconditioned they can easily be shaken
This is why they have to be augmented with other mental strengths
The three middle strengths  persistence mindfulness and concentration  act in concert
Persistence in the form of right effort counteracts the delusion that we're no match for our fears that once they arise we have to give into them
Right effort gives us practice in eliminating milder unskillful qualities and developing skillful ones in their place so that when stronger unskillful qualities arise we can use our skillful qualities as allies in fending them off
The strength of mindfulness assists this process in two ways
It reminds us of the danger of giving in to fear
It teaches us to focus our attention not on the object of our fear but on the fear in and of itself as a mental event something we can watch from the outside rather jumping in and going along for a ride
The strength of concentration in providing the mind with a still center of wellbeing puts us in a solid position where we don't feel compelled to identify with fears as they come and where the comings and goings of internal and external dangers are less and less threatening to the mind
Even then though the mind can't reach ultimate security until it uproots the causes of these comings and goings which is why the first four strengths require the strength of discernment to make them fully secure
Discernment is what sees that these comings and goings are ultimately rooted in our sense of I and mine and that I and mine are not built into experience
They come from the repeated processes of Imaking and mymaking in which we impose these notions on experience and identify with things subject to aging illness and death
Furthermore discernment sees through our inner traitors and weaknesses the cravings that want us to make an I and mine the delusions that make us believe in them once they're made
It realizes that this level of delusion is precisely the factor that makes aging illness and death dangerous to begin with
If we didn't identify with things that age grow ill and die their aging illness and death wouldn't threaten the mind
Totally unthreatened the mind would have no reason to do anything unskillful ever again
When this level of discernment matures and bears the fruit of release our greatest insecurity  our inability to trust ourselves  has been eliminated
Freed from the attachments of I and mine we find that the component factors of fear  both skillful and unskillful  are gone
There's no remaining confusion or aversion the mind is no longer weak in the face of danger and so there's nothing from which we need to escape
This is where the questions raised by the shaman's remarks find their answers
We fear because we believe in we We believe in we because of the delusion in our fear
Paradoxically though if we love ourselves enough to fear the suffering that comes from unskillful actions and attachments and learn to believe in the way out we'll develop the strengths that allow us to cut through our cravings delusions and attachments
That way the entire complex  the we the fear the beliefs the attachments  dissolves away
The freedom remaining is the only true security there is
This teaching may offer cold comfort to anyone who wants the impossible security for his or her attachments
But in trading away the hope for an impossible security you gain the reality of a happiness totally independent and conditionfree
Once you've made this trade you know that the payoff is more than worth the price
As one of the Buddha's students once reported Before when I was a householder maintaining the bliss of kingship I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments within and without the city within and without the countryside
But even though I was thus guarded thus protected I dwelled in fear  agitated distrustful and afraid
But now on going alone to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling I dwell without fear unagitated confident and unafraid  unconcerned unruffled my wants satisfied with my mind like a wild deer
This is the meaning I have in mind that I repeatedly exclaim 'What bliss
What bliss' His deer is obviously not the deer in the headlights
It's a deer safe in the wilderness at its ease wherever it goes
What makes it more than a deer is that free from attachment it's called a consciousness without surface Light goes right through it
The hunter can't shoot it for it can't be seen
What is the mind
The mind isn't 'is' anything
 Ajaan Chah
The mind is neither good nor evil but it's what knows good and knows evil
It's what does good and does evil
And it's what lets go of good and lets go of evil
 Ajaan Lee
A brahman once asked the Buddha Will all the world reach release or half the world or a third But the Buddha didn't answer
Ven
Ananda concerned that the brahman might misconstrue the Buddha's silence took the man aside and gave him an analogy Imagine a fortress with a single gate
A wise gatekeeper would walk around the fortress and not see an opening in the wall big enough for even a cat to slip through
Because he's wise he would realize that his knowledge didn't tell him how many people would come into the fortress but it did tell him that whoever came into the fortress would have to come in through the gate
In the same way the Buddha didn't focus on how many people would reach Awakening but he did know that anyone who reached Awakening would have to follow the path he had found abandoning the five hindrances establishing the four frames of reference and developing the seven factors for Awakening
What's striking about the Buddha's knowledge is the implied if If people want to gain Awakening they will have to follow this path but the choice as to whether they want Awakening is theirs
The Buddha's knowledge of the future didn't mean that the future was preordained for people are free to choose
They can take up a particular course of action and stick with it or not as they see fit
The Buddha thus based all his teaching on freedom of choice
As he said if everything were predetermined by the past there would be no point in teaching a path to Awakening
The number of people who would reach Awakening would already have been set a long time ago and they would have no need for a path or a teacher
Those preordained to awaken would get there inevitably as a result of a longpast action or an essential nature already built into the mind
Those preordained not to awaken wouldn't stand a chance
But these things are not preordained
No one is doomed never to awaken but  until you've had your first sight of the deathless at streamentry  neither is Awakening assured
It's contingent on intentional actions chosen in each present moment
And even after streamentry you're constantly faced with choices that will speed up final Awakening or slow it down
Nibbana of course is independent and unconditioned but the act of awakening to nibbana depends on a path of practice that has to be willed
It happens only if you choose to give rise to its causes
This as the Buddha noted involves determining to do four things not to neglect discernment to preserve truth to develop relinquishment and to train for peace
To stick with these four determinations the mind has to make some assumptions about itself its power to do the necessary work and to receive the anticipated benefits
But one of the central features of the Buddha's strategy as a teacher was that even though his primary focus was on the mind he nowhere defined what the mind is
As he said if you define yourself you limit yourself
So instead he focused his assumptions on what the mind can do
To begin with the mind can change quickly
Normally a master of the apt simile even the Buddha had to admit that he could find no adequate analogy for how quickly the mind can change
We might say that it can change in the twinkling of an eye but it's actually faster than that
And it's capable of all sorts of things
Neither inherently good nor inherently bad it can do a huge variety of good and bad actions
As the Buddha said the mind is more variegated than the animal kingdom
Think of the many species of fish in the sea birds in the sky animals on the land and under the ground whether extant or extinct All of these species are products of minds and the mind can take on a wider variety of forms than even that
This variety comes from the many different choices the mind makes under the influence of ignorance and defilement
But the mind doesn't always have to be defiled
Past kamma is not entirely deterministic
Even though past kamma shapes the range of options open to the mind in the present it doesn't have to determine present kamma  the intentions by which the mind chooses to fabricate actual experiences from among those options
Thus present kamma can choose to continue creating the conditions for more ignorance or not because present choices are what keep ignorance alive
Although no one  not even a Buddha  can trace back to when the defilement of ignorance first began the continued existence of ignorance depends on conditions continually provided by unskillful kamma
If these conditions are removed ignorance will disband
This is why the Buddha said that the mind is luminous stained with defilements that come and go
Taken out of context this statement might be construed as implying that the mind is inherently awakened
But in context the Buddha is simply saying that the mind once stained is not permanently stained
When the conditions for the stains are gone the mind becomes luminous again
But this luminosity is not an awakened nature
As the Buddha states this luminous mind can be developed
In the scheme of the four noble truths if something is to be developed it's not the goal it's part of the path to the goal
After this luminosity has been developed in the advanced stages of concentration it's abandoned once it has completed its work in helping to pierce through ignorance
The fact that the mind's own choices can pierce its own ignorance underlies the Buddha's most important assumption about the mind It can be trained to awaken to see the causes of ignorance and to bring them to an end
The primary step in this training is the first determination not to neglect discernment
This phrase may sound strange  to what extent do we consciously neglect discernment
 but it points to an important truth
Discernment is insight into how the mind fabricates its experiences
This process of fabrication is going on all the time right before our eyes  even nearer than our eyes  and yet part of the mind chooses to ignore it
We tend to be more interested in the experiences that result from the fabrication the physical mental and emotional states we want to savor and enjoy
It's like watching a play
We enjoy entering into the makebelieve world on the stage and prefer to ignore the noises made by the backstage crew that would call the reality of that world into question
This ignorance is willed which is why we need an act of the will to see through it to discern the backstage machinations of the mind
Discernment thus has two sides understanding and motivation
You have to understand the mind's fabrications as fabrications looking less for the what  ie what they are  than for the how  how they happen as part of a causal process
And you have to be motivated to develop this discernment to see why you want it to influence the mind
Otherwise it won't have the conditions to grow
The understanding comes down to the basic insight of the Buddha's Awakening seeing things as actions and events in a pattern of cause and effect
It also involves seeing how some actions are unskillful leading to stress and suffering while others are skillful bringing stress to an end and that we have the freedom to choose skillful actions or not
This understanding  which forms the basic framework of the four noble truths  is called appropriate attention
The motivation to develop appropriate attention grows from combining good will with this understanding
You set your sights on a happiness totally harmless
You see that if you make unskillful choices you're going to cause suffering if you make skillful ones you won't
This motivation thus combines good will with heedfulness the quality that underlies every step on the path
In fact heedfulness lies at the root of all skillful qualities in the mind
Thus in encouraging people to awaken the Buddha never assumed that their Awakening would come from the innate goodness of their nature
He simply assumed something very blatant and ordinary that people like pleasure and hate pain and that they care about whether they can gain that pleasure and avoid that pain
It was a mark of his genius that he could see the potential for Awakening in this very common desire
When you stick with the understanding and motivation provided by this first determination it sets in motion the other three
For instance the determination to preserve the truth grows from seeing the mind's capacity to lie to itself about whether its actions are causing suffering
You want to be honest and vigilant in looking for and admitting suffering even when you're attached to the actions that cause it
This truthfulness relates to the path in two stages first when looking for unskillful actions that keep you off the path and then as the path nears fruition looking for the subtle levels of stress caused even by skillful elements of the path  such as right concentration  once they have done their work and need to be let go for the sake of full liberation
The determination to develop relinquishment can then build on this truthful assessment of what needs to be done
Relinquishment requires discernment as well for not only do you need to see what's skillful and what's not you also need to keep reminding yourself that you have the freedom to choose and to be adept at talking yourself into doing skillful things you're afraid of and abandoning unskillful actions you like
The determination to train for peace helps maintain your sense of direction in this process for it reminds you that the only true happiness is peace of mind and that you want to look for everincreasing levels of peace as they become possible through the practice
This determination emulates the trait that the Buddha said was essential to his Awakening the unwillingness to rest content with lesser levels of stillness when higher levels could be attained
In this way the stages of concentration instead of becoming obstacles or dangers on the path serve as steppingstones to greater sensitivity and through that sensitivity to the ultimate peace where all passion aversion and delusion grow still
This peace thus grows from the simple choice to keep looking at the mind's fabrications as processes as actions and results
But to fully achieve this peace your discernment has to be directed not only at the mind's fabrication of the objects of its awareness but also at its fabrications about itself and about the path it's creating
Your sense of who you are is a fabrication regardless of whether you see the mind as separate or interconnected finite or infinite good or bad
The path is also a fabrication very subtle and sometimes seemingly effortless but fabricated nonetheless
If these layers of inner fabrication aren't seen for what they are  if you regard them as innate or inevitable  they can't be deconstructed and full Awakening can't occur
This is why the Buddha never advocated attributing an innate nature of any kind to the mind  good bad or Buddha
The idea of innate natures slipped into the Buddhist tradition in later centuries when the principle of freedom was forgotten
Past bad kamma was seen as so totally deterministic that there seemed no way around it unless you assumed either an innate Buddha in the mind that could overpower it or an external Buddha who would save you from it
But when you understand the principle of freedom  that past kamma doesn't totally shape the present and that present kamma can always be free to choose the skillful alternative  you realize that the idea of innate natures is unnecessary excess baggage on the path
And it bogs you down
If you assume that the mind is basically bad you won't feel capable of following the path and will tend to look for outside help to do the work for you
If you assume that the mind is basically good you'll feel capable but will easily get complacent
This stands in the way of the heedfulness needed to get you on the path and to keep you there when the path creates states of relative peace and ease that seem so trustworthy and real
If you assume a Buddha nature you not only risk complacency but you also entangle yourself in metaphysical thorn patches If something with an awakened nature can suffer what good is it
How could something innately awakened become defiled
If your original Buddha nature became deluded what's to prevent it from becoming deluded after it's reawakened
These points become especially important as you reach the subtle levels of fabrication on the more advanced stages of the path
If you're primed to look for innate natures you'll tend to see innate natures especially when you reach the luminous nondual stages of concentration called themeless emptiness and undirected
You'll get stuck on whichever stage matches your assumptions about what your awakened nature is
But if you're primed to look for the process of fabrication you'll see these stages as forms of fabrication and this will enable you to deconstruct them to pacify them until you encounter the peace that's not fabricated at all
So instead of making assumptions about innate natures or inevitable outcomes the Buddha advised exploring the possibility of freedom as it's immediately present each time you make a choice
Freedom is not a nature and you don't find it by looking for your hidden innate nature
You find freedom by looking at where it's constantly showing itself in the fact that your present intentions are not totally conditioned by the past
You catch your first glimmer of it as a range of possibilities from which you can choose and as your ability to act more skillfully  causing more pleasure and less pain  than you ordinarily might
Your sense of this freedom grows as you explore and exercise it each time you choose the most skillful course of action heading in the direction of discernment truthfulness relinquishment and peace
The choice to keep making skillful choices may require assumptions but to keep the mind focused on the issue of fabrication the Buddha saw that these assumptions are best kept to a bare minimum that the mind wants happiness that it can choose courses of actions that promote happiness or thwart it that it can change its ways and that it can train itself to achieve the ultimate happiness where all fabrications fall away
These assumptions are the Buddha's starter kit of skillful means to get you on the path of good will heedfulness and appropriate attention
As with any journey you do best to take along only the bare essentials so that you don't weigh yourself down
This is especially true as you test the limits of freedom for the closer you come to ultimate freedom the more you find that things fall away
First the nouns of natures and identities fall away as you focus on the verbs of action and choice
Then the verbs fall away too
When the Buddha was asked who or what he was he didn't answer with a who or what
He said simply Awakened a past participle a verb that has done its work
Similarly when the suttas describe the Awakening of an arahant they say that his or her mind is released from fermentations
But when they describe how this release is experienced they simply say With release there is the knowledge 'Released' No comment on what is released
Not even as it's sometimes translated It is released There's no noun no pronoun just a past participle released That's all but it's enough
The Buddha never used the word for bare attention in his meditation instructions
That's because he realized that attention never occurs in a bare pure or unconditioned form
It's always colored by views and perceptions  the labels you tend to give to events  and by intentions your choice of what to attend to and your purpose in being attentive
If you don't understand the conditioned nature of even simple acts of attention you might assume that a moment of nonreactive attention is a moment of Awakening
And in that way you miss one of the most crucial insights in Buddhist meditation how even the simplest events in the mind can form a condition for clinging and suffering
If you assume a conditioned event to be unconditioned you close the door to the unconditioned
So it's important to understand the conditioned nature of attention and the Buddha's recommendations for how to train it  as appropriate attention  to be a factor in the path leading beyond attention to total Awakening
The Pali term for attention is manasikara
You may have heard that the term for mindfulness  sati  means attention but that's not how the Buddha used the term
Mindfulness in his usage means keeping something in mind
It's a function of memory
When you practice the establishings of mindfulness you remain focused on observing the object you've chosen as your frame of reference the body feelings mind or mental qualities in and of themselves
This is called anupassana
Mindfulness is one of three qualities you bring to anupassana
Its function is to keep your frame of reference in mind to keep remembering it
At the same time you have to be alert clearly aware of what you're doing to make sure that you're actually doing what you're trying to remember to do and ardent to do it skillfully
The act of establishing mindfulness in this way  by being mindful alert and ardent  then forms the topic or theme of right concentration
For instance if you focus on the breath in and of itself as your frame of reference anupassana means keeping continual watch over the breath
Mindfulness means simply remembering to stick with it keeping it in mind at all times whereas alertness means knowing what the breath is doing and how well you're staying with it
Ardency is the effort to do all of this skillfully
When all these activities stay fully coordinated they form the theme of your concentration
To understand how appropriate attention functions in the context of this training though you first have to understand how attention ordinarily functions in an untrained mind
In the teaching on dependent coarising  the Buddha's explanation of how events interact to create the conditions for suffering  attention appears early in the sequence in the factor for mental events called name where it comes even prior to the sense media and sensory contact
But it's not the first item in the list
It follows on ignorance fabrication and consciousness
Ignorance here doesn't mean a general lack of knowledge
It means not viewing experience in terms of the four noble truths stress its cause its cessation and the path to its cessation
Any other framework for viewing experience no matter how sophisticated would qualify as ignorance
Typical examples given in the Canon include seeing things through the framework of self and other or of existence and nonexistence What am I
What am I not
Do I exist
Do I not exist
Do things outside me exist
Do they not
These ignorant ways of seeing then condition the way we intentionally fabricate or manipulate bodily verbal and mental states
The breath is the primary means for fabricating bodily states and practical experience shows that  in giving rise to feelings of comfort or discomfort  it has an impact on mental states as well
When colored by ignorance even your breathing can act as a cause of suffering
As for verbal states directed thought and evaluation are the means for fabricating words and sentences whereas mental states are fabricated by feelings  pleasure pain neitherpleasurenorpain  and perceptions  the labels we apply to things
Sensory consciousness is colored by these fabrications
And then  based on the conditions of ignorance fabrication and sensory consciousness  the act of attention arises as one of a cluster of mental and physical events called name and form
As if the preconditions for attention weren't already complex enough the coconditions in name and form add another level of complexity
Form means of the form of the body  as experienced from within as properties of earth water wind and fire and as shaped by the activity of breathing
Name includes not only attention but also intention again feeling and perception again and contact which here apparently means contact among all the factors already listed
All of these conditions acting together under the influence of ignorance are what ordinarily color every act of attention to any of the six senses sight hearing smell taste the tactile sense and the sense of the mind that knows mental qualities and ideas
Even before we're aware of contact at the senses conditions in the mind are primed to create suffering and stress from that contact
So how can attention be trained in the other direction
Obviously it should be freed from the conditions of ignorance but that doesn't mean that it should  or even can  be freed from conditions entirely
After all that would require an act of will and that act of will would have to be formed by a correct and pragmatic understanding of suffering and its causes
Also that act of will and that understanding would have to be borne in mind continually so that attention could be effectively retrained
So instead of being stripped from all conditions attention requires this new set of conditions to make it appropriate
This is why the Buddha said that the factors of the path corresponding to understanding will and memory  right view right effort and right mindfulness  hover around every step of the path
Right view provides the ability to see things in terms of the four noble truths right effort activates the desire and intent to act skillfully on those views while right mindfulness provides a solid basis for keeping that view and that effort in mind
Of these three factors of the path right view comes first for it's the direct antidote for the primary condition of ignorance
Right view is not simply knowledge about the four noble truths it sees things in terms of those truths
In other words for a person aiming at the end of suffering and stress it points out the four salient factors to look for in any given moment
At the same time it sees the tasks or duties appropriate to each factor Stress is to be comprehended its cause abandoned its cessation realized and the path to its cessation developed
As the Buddha noted in his first sermon this knowledge of the appropriate tasks for each truth comes in two stages
The first stage identifies the task
The second realizes that it has been completed
This second stage is the knowledge of Awakening
Between the first and the second lies the practice  which because it involves mastering the skills of each task has to be gradual
That's why it's called a path
As with the development of any skill the path has its inevitable ups and downs
In other words the practice is marked by alternating periods of ignorance and knowledge with the knowledge gradually growing stronger and more refined
During these periods of knowledge the act of attention is informed by an understanding of suffering and its causes
It is also motivated by intentions  expressed through the way you relate to your breath your mental activity of directed thought and evaluation and your perceptions and feelings  that aim at bringing suffering to an end
This combination of wise understanding and compassionate intention is what turns the act of attention from a cause of suffering into a strategy for health a healing attention
This healing attention is called appropriate because it looks at things in ways appropriate for advancing the tasks of the noble truths focusing on whichever task needs to be advanced at any particular moment
For instance when attention needs to be focused on comprehending suffering the role of appropriate attention is to view the aggregates  the components of our sense of self  in such a way as to induce dispassion for them
To attend to the aggregates in this way helps to advance the task of abandoning any craving for the aggregates that causes suffering
When attention needs to be focused on developing the path the role of appropriate attention is to feed the factors for Awakening and to starve the five hindrances that stand in their way
Here is where appropriate attention applies to the practice of establishing mindfulness in that mindfulness solidly established is the first factor for Awakening
Thus one of the first roles of appropriate attention is to feed the development of mindfulness
The image of feeding and starving here is directly related to the insight into conditionality that formed the essential message of the Buddha's Awakening
In fact when he introduced the topic of conditionality to young novices he illustrated it with the act of feeding All beings he said subsist on food
If their existence depends on eating then it ends when they are deprived of food
Applying this analogy to the problem of suffering leads to the conclusion that if suffering depends on conditions it can be brought to an end by starving it of its conditions
In its most sophisticated expression though the Buddha's insight into causality implies that each moment is composed of three types of factors results of past intentions present intentions and the results of present intentions
Because many past intentions can have an impact on any given moment this means that there can be many potential influences from the past  helpful or harmful  appearing in the body or mind at any given time
The role of appropriate attention is to focus on whichever influence is potentially most helpful and to look at it in such a way as to promote skillful intentions in the present
The Food Discourse indicates how appropriate attention can be applied to the potentials of the present to starve the hindrances and feed the factors for Awakening
With regard to the hindrances it notes that
In short each hindrance is starved by shifting both the focus and the quality of your attention
However with the factors for Awakening  mindfulness analysis of qualities persistence rapture serenity concentration and equanimity  the process of feeding consists primarily of changing the quality of your attention
The discourse lists each factor with its potential basis saying that the factor is starved by inappropriate attention to that basis and fed by appropriate attention to the basis
With one exception the discourse doesn't say what each basis is
Apparently the purpose of this is to challenge the meditator
Once you've received instructions in mindfulness and concentration you should try to identify in your own experience what the potential basis for each factor of Awakening is
The one exception however is illuminating
The basis for the second factor for Awakening  analysis of mental qualities  is the presence of skillful and unskillful qualities in the mind
To pay appropriate attention to these qualities not only feeds the factor of analysis of mental qualities but also starves the hindrance of uncertainty at the same time providing the framework for identifying for yourself the bases for each of the remaining factors for Awakening
Of these factors equanimity is the closest to what is sometimes described as bare attention or nonreactive awareness
But even equanimity is conditioned by views and intentions
For instance the Buddha points out in MN that when encountering unskillful qualities in the mind you'll observe that some of them go away only through concerted effort in other cases nothing more is required than onlooking equanimity
But even this equanimity is conditioned by an understanding of skillful and unskillful and is motivated to make the unskillful go away
In fact equanimity has many levels and a crucial insight on the higher level of practice is to see that even the equanimity of refined jhanic states  in which awareness and its object seem totally one  is a fabrication conditioned and willed
On gaining this insight the mind inclines toward what is called nonfashioning in which you add nothing at all to the data of sensory experience
The move from equanimity to nonfashioning is briefly described in a famous passage
Then Bahiya you should train yourself thus In reference to the seen there will be only the seen
In reference to the heard only the heard
In reference to the sensed only the sensed
In reference to the cognized only the cognized
That is how you should train yourself
When for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen only the heard in reference to the heard only the sensed in reference to the sensed only the cognized in reference to the cognized then Bahiya there's no you in that
When there's no you in that there's no you there
When there's no you there you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two
This just this is the end of stress
On the surface these instructions might seem to be describing bare attention but a closer look shows that something more is going on
To begin with the instructions come in two parts advice on how to train attention and a promise of the results that will come from training attention in that way
In other words the training is still operating on the conditioned level of cause and effect
It's something to be done
This means it's shaped by an intention which in turn is shaped by a view
The intention and view are informed by the result part of the passage The meditator wants to attain the end of stress and suffering and so is willing to follow the path to that end
Thus as with every other level of appropriate attention the attention developed here is conditioned by right view  the knowledge that your present intentions are ultimately the source of stress  and motivated by the desire to put an end to that stress
This is why you make the effort not to add anything at all to the potentials coming from the past
The need for right view would seem to be belied by the circumstances surrounding these instructions
After all these are the first instructions Bahiya receives from the Buddha and he attains Awakening immediately afterward so they would appear to be complete in and of themselves
However in the leadup to this passage Bahiya is portrayed as unusually heedful and motivated to practice
He already knows that Awakening is attained by doing and the instructions come in response to his request for a teaching that will show him what to do now for his longterm welfare and happiness  a question that MN identifies as the foundation for wisdom and discernment
So his attitude contains all the seeds for right view and right intention
Because he was wise  the Buddha later praised him as the foremost of his disciples in terms of the quickness of his discernment  he was able to bring those seeds to fruition immediately
A verse from SN
 which the Buddha says expresses the meaning of the instructions to Bahiya  throws light on how Bahiya may have developed those seeds
Notice two words in this verse mindfulness and dispassioned
The reference to mindfulness underlines the need to continually remind oneself of the intention not to add anything to any potentials from the past
This again points to the willed nature of the attention being developed here
MN offers an alternative way of expressing this intention at the same time offering further analysis of the stages the mind goes through when it is kept in mind
The intention is this 'It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me
What is what has come to be that I abandon' As the Buddha says in that discourse a person who pursues this intention will abandon passion for sights sounds etc and arrive at the equanimity of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
But if discernment isn't yet sharp enough he or she will simply move the focus of passion from sensory and mental input to the equanimity itself and thus stay fixated on that level
Thus the importance of the second word noted above  dispassion  which highlights the fact that passion is the crucial factor normally added to the seen heard sensed and cognized and thus the factor most needing to be undercut in every way possible
Some interpretations of the instructions to Bahiya identify the added factor as a metaphysical view about there being something behind the data of experience but this sort of metaphysical view  even though it can form a basis for passion  is only one of many such bases
The belief that there is something out there that can be grasped and possessed can obviously form a condition for passion but so can the belief that there's nothing there When there's nothing there's nothing to be harmed by giving in to desire an idea that can excuse all kinds of harmful passions
So the meditator has to be careful not to add any assumptions to the data of experience that would foster passion in any way shape or form
And this involves more than bare attention
It requires right view about how passion works and what's necessary to thwart it
As SN
and SN
indicate our sense of who we are is defined by our passions
Even when we don't consciously think of self  as when we're totally immersed in an activity at one with the action  there can be a passion for that oneness with a strong sense of being here being the doing or being the knowing which is identity in a subtle form
But when discernment is sharp enough to see that even this equanimity is fabricated and conditioned something that's done any passion for it can be undercut as well
When passion is consistently offered no place to land there's no nucleus for a place of any sort no here no there no nucleus for a sense of identity to be constructed around anything anywhere at all
This explains why the state of nonfashioning is expressed in terms devoid of place When there's no you in that there's no you there
When there's no you there you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two
With the total fading of passion the final intention to undercut passion can thus be dropped
When it's dropped  with no need to replace it with any other  nothing more is constructed
This brings a true opening to the Deathless which lies beyond all conditions  even the conditions of right view mindfulness and appropriate attention
The extraordinary nature of this experience is indicated by the verse that concludes the discourse on Bahiya
When the awakened person emerges from this experience and resumes dealing with the conditions of time and space it's with a totally new perspective
But even then heshe still has use for appropriate attention
As Ven
Sariputta notes in SN
So it's important to understand that there's no such thing as bare attention in the practice of the Buddha's teachings
Instead of trying to create an unconditioned form of attention the practice tries to create a set of skillful conditions to shape and direct the act of attention to make it appropriate truly healing truly leading to the end of suffering and stress
Once these conditions are well developed the Buddha promises that they will serve you well  even past the moment of Awakening all the way to your very last death
The Buddha's Awakening gave him among other things a new perspective on the uses and limitations of words
He had discovered a reality  the Deathless  that no words could describe
At the same time he discovered that the path to Awakening could be described although it involved a new way of seeing and conceptualizing the problem of suffering and stress
Because ordinary concepts were often poor tools for teaching the path he had to invent new concepts and to stretch preexisting words to encompass those concepts so that others could taste Awakening themselves
One of the new concepts most central to his teaching was that of the khandhas which are most frequently translated into English as aggregates Prior to the Buddha the Pali word khandha had very ordinary meanings A khandha could be a pile a bundle a heap a mass
It could also be the trunk of a tree
In his first sermon though the Buddha gave it a new psychological meaning introducing the term clingingkhandhas to summarize his analysis of the truth of stress and suffering
Throughout the remainder of his teaching career he referred to these psychological khandhas time and again
Their importance in his teachings has thus been obvious to every generation of Buddhists ever since
Less obvious though has been the issue of how they are important How should a meditator make use of the concept of the psychological khandhas
What questions are they meant to answer
The most common response to these questions is best exemplified by two recent scholarly books devoted to the subject
Both treat the khandhas as the Buddha's answer to the question What is a person To quote from the jacket of the first
From the introduction of the other
This understanding of the khandhas isn't confined to scholars
Almost any modern Buddhist meditation teacher would explain the khandhas in a similar way
And it isn't a modern innovation
It was first proposed at the beginning of the common era in the commentaries to the early Buddhist canons  both the Theravadin and the Sarvastivadin which formed the basis for Mahayana scholasticism
However once the commentaries used the khandhas to define what a person is they spawned many of the controversies that have plagued Buddhist thinking ever since If a person is just khandhas then what gets reborn If a person is just khandhas and the khandhas are annihilated on reaching total nibbana then isn't total nibbana the annihilation of the person If a person is khandhas and khandhas are interrelated with other khandhas how can one person enter nibbana without dragging everyone else along
A large part of the history of Buddhist thought has been the story of ingenious but unsuccessful attempts to settle these questions
It's instructive to note though that the Pali canon never quotes the Buddha as trying to answer them
In fact it never quotes him as trying to define what a person is at all
Instead it quotes him as saying that to define yourself in any way is to limit yourself and that the question What am I is best ignored
This suggests that he formulated the concept of the khandhas to answer other different questions
If as meditators we want to make the best use of this concept we should look at what those original questions were and determine how they apply to our practice
The canon depicts the Buddha as saying that he taught only two topics suffering and the end of suffering
A survey of the Pali discourses shows him using the concept of the khandhas to answer the primary questions related to those topics What is suffering
How is it caused
What can be done to bring those causes to an end
The Buddha introduced the concept of the khandhas in his first sermon in response to the first of these questions
His short definition of suffering was the five clingingkhandhas This fairly cryptic phrase can be fleshed out by drawing on other passages in the canon
The five khandhas are bundles or piles of form feeling perception fabrications and consciousness
None of the texts explain why the Buddha used the word khandha to describe these things
The meaning of tree trunk may be relevant to the pervasive fire imagery in the canon  nibbana being extinguishing of the fires of passion aversion and delusion  but none of the texts explicitly make this connection
The common and explicit image is of the khandhas as burdensome
We can think of them as piles of bricks we carry on our shoulders
However these piles are best understood not as objects but as activities for an important passage defines them in terms of their functions
Form  which covers physical phenomena of all sorts both within and without the body  wears down or deforms Feeling feels pleasure pain and neither pleasure nor pain
Perception labels or identifies objects
Consciousness cognizes the six senses along with their objects
Of the five khandhas fabrication is the most complex
Passages in the canon define it as intention but it includes a wide variety of activities such as attention evaluation and all the active processes of the mind
It is also the most fundamental khandha for its intentional activity underlies the experience of form feeling etc
in the present moment
Thus intention is an integral part of our experience of all the khandhas  an important point for this means that there is an element of intention in all suffering
This opens the possibility that suffering can be ended by changing our intentions  or abandoning them entirely  which is precisely the point of the Buddha's teachings
To understand how this happens we have to look more closely at how suffering arises  or in other words how khandhas become clingingkhandhas
When khandhas are experienced the process of fabrication normally doesn't simply stop there
If attention focuses on the khandhas' attractive features  beautiful forms pleasant feelings etc
 it can give rise to passion and delight
This passion and delight can take many forms but the most tenacious is the habitual act of fabricating a sense of me or mine identifying with a particular khandha or claiming possession of it
This sense of me and mine is rarely static
It roams like an amoeba changing its contours as it changes location
Sometimes expansive sometimes contracted it can view itself as identical with a khandha as possessing a khandha as existing within a khandha or as having a khandha existing within itself
At times feeling finite at other times infinite whatever shape it takes it's always unstable and insecure for the khandhas providing its food are simply activities and functions inconstant and insubstantial
In the words of the canon the khandhas are like foam like a mirage like the bubbles formed when rain falls on water
They're heavy only because the iron grip of trying to cling to them is burdensome
As long as we're addicted to passion and delight for these activities  as long as we cling to them  we're bound to suffer
The Buddhist approach to ending this clinging however is not simply to drop it
As with any addiction the mind has to be gradually weaned away
Before we can reach the point of no intention where we're totally freed from the fabrication of khandhas we have to change our intentions toward the khandhas so as to change their functions
Instead of using them for the purpose of constructing a self we use them for the purpose of creating a path to the end of suffering
Instead of carrying piles of bricks on our shoulders we take them off and lay them along the ground as pavement
The first step in this process is to use the khandhas to construct the factors of the noble eightfold path
For example Right Concentration we maintain a steady perception focused on an aspect of form such as the breath and use directed thought and evaluation  which count as fabrications  to create feelings of pleasure and refreshment which we spread through the body
In the beginning it's normal that we experience passion and delight for these feelings and that consciousness follows along in line with them
This helps get us absorbed in mastering the skills of concentration
Once we've gained the sense of strength and wellbeing that comes from mastering these skills we can proceed to the second step attending to the drawbacks of even the refined khandhas we experience in concentration so as to undercut the passion and delight we might feel for them
Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great masses
In the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perceptions fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration a void notself

The various ways of fostering dispassion are also khandhas khandhas of perception
A standard list includes the following the perception of inconstancy the perception of notself the perception of unattractiveness the perception of drawbacks the perception of abandoning the perception of distaste for every world the perception of the undesirability of all fabrications
One of the most important of these perceptions is that of notself
When the Buddha first introduced the concept of notself in his second sermon he also introduced a way of strengthening its impact with a series of questions based around the khandhas
Taking each khandha in turn he asked Is it constant or inconstant Inconstant
And is what is inconstant stressful or pleasurable Stressful
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am' No
These questions show the complex role the khandhas play in this second step of the path
The questions themselves are khandhas  of fabrication  and they use the concept of the khandhas to deconstruct any passion and delight that might center on the khandhas and create suffering
Thus in this step we use khandhas that point out the drawbacks of the khandhas
If used unskillfully though these perceptions and fabrications can simply replace passion with its mirror image aversion
This is why they have to be based on the first step  the wellbeing constructed in jhana  and coupled with the third step the perceptions of dispassion and cessation that incline the mind to the deathless This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding
In effect these are perceptionkhandhas that point the mind beyond all khandhas
The texts say that this threestep process can lead to one of two results
If after undercutting passion and delight for the khandhas the mind contains any residual passion for the perception of the deathless it will attain the third level of Awakening called nonreturn
If passion and delight are entirely eradicated though all clinging is entirely abandoned the intentions that fabricate khandhas are dropped and the mind totally released
The bricks of the pavement have turned into a runway and the mind has taken off
Into what
The authors of the discourses seem unwilling to say even to the extent of describing it as a state of existence nonexistence neither or both
As one of the discourses states the freedom lying beyond the khandhas also lies beyond the realm to which language properly applies
There is also the very real practical problem that any preconceived notions of that freedom if clung to as a perceptionkhandha could easily act as an obstacle to its attainment
Still there is also the possibility that if properly used such a perceptionkhandha might act as an aid on the path
So the discourses provide hints in the form of similes referring to total freedom as
Other passages mention a consciousness in this freedom  without feature or surface without end luminous all around  lying outside of time and space experienced when the six sense spheres stop functioning
In this it differs from the consciousnesskhandha which depends on the six sense spheres and can be described in such terms as near or far past present or future
Consciousness without feature is thus the awareness of Awakening
And the freedom of this awareness carries over even when the awakened person returns to ordinary consciousness
As the Buddha said of himself
Freed dissociated  released from form the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awareness
Freed dissociated  released from feeling perception fabrications consciousness birth aging death suffering  stress defilement the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awareness 
This shows again the importance of bringing the right questions to the teachings on the khandhas
If you use them to define what you are as a person you tie yourself down to no purpose
The questions keep piling on
But if you use them to put an end to suffering your questions fall away and you're free
You never again cling to the khandhas and no longer need to use them to end your selfcreated suffering
As long as you're still alive you can employ the khandhas as needed for whatever skillful uses you see fit
After that you're liberated from all uses and needs including the need to find words to describe that freedom to yourself or to anyone else
The Buddha never placed unconditional demands on anyone's faith
And for anyone from a culture where the dominant religions do place such demands on one's faith this is one of Buddhism's most attractive features
We read his famous instructions to the Kalamas in which he advises testing things for oneself and we see it as an invitation to believe or not whatever we like
Some people go so far as to say that faith has no place in the Buddhist tradition that the proper Buddhist attitude is one of skepticism
But even though the Buddha recommends tolerance and a healthy skepticism toward matters of faith he also makes a conditional request about faith If you sincerely want to put an end to suffering  that's the condition  you should take certain things on faith as working hypotheses and then test them through following his path of practice
There's a hint of this need for faith even in the discourse to the Kalamas
Don't go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought 'This contemplative is our teacher' When you know for yourselves that 'These mental qualities are skillful these mental qualities are blameless these mental qualities are praised by the wise these mental qualities when adopted  carried out lead to welfare and to happiness'  then you should enter  remain in them
The first few phrases in this passage refuting the authority of scripture and tradition are so strikingly empirical that it's easy to miss the phrase buried further on asserting that you have to take into account what's praised by the wise
That phrase is important for it helps to make sense of the Buddha's teachings as a whole
If he had simply wanted you to trust your own unaided sense of right and wrong why would he have left so many other teachings
So the Buddha's advice to the Kalamas is balanced Just as you shouldn't give unreserved trust to outside authority you can't give unreserved trust to your own logic and feelings if they go against the genuine wisdom of others
As other early discourses make clear wise people can be recognized by their words and behavior but the standards for wisdom are clearly measured against the Buddha and his noble disciples people who've already touched awakening
And the proper attitude toward those who meet these standards is faith
For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher's message  lives to penetrate it what accords with the Dhamma is this 'The Blessed One is the Teacher I am a disciple
He is the one who knows not I' For a disciple who has conviction in the Teacher's message  lives to penetrate it what accords with the Dhamma is this 'Gladly would I let the flesh  blood in my body dry up leaving just the skin tendons  bones but if I have not attained what can be reached through human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing my persistence'
Repeatedly the Buddha stated that faith in a teacher is what leads you to learn from that teacher
Faith in the Buddha's own Awakening is a requisite strength for anyone else who wants to attain Awakening
As it fosters persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment this faith can take you all the way to the deathless
So there's a tension in the Buddha's recommendations about faith and empiricism
I've discussed this point with many Asian Buddhists and few of them find the tension uncomfortable
But Western Buddhists raised in a culture where religion and faith have long been at war with science and empiricism find the tension very disconcerting
In discussing the issue with them over the past several years I've noticed that they often try to resolve it in the same ways that historically the tension between Christian faith and scientific empiricism has been resolved in our own culture
Three general positions stand out not only because they are the most common but also because they are so clearly Western
Consciously or not they attempt to understand the Buddha's position on faith and empiricism in a way that can be easily mapped onto the modern Western battle lines between religion and science
The first interpretation has its roots in the side of Western culture that totally rejects the legitimacy of faith
In this view the Buddha was an embodiment of the Victorian ideal of the heroic agnostic one who eschewed the childish consolations of faith and instead advocated a purely scientific method for training and strengthening one's own mind
Because his method focused entirely on the present moment questions of past and future were totally irrelevant to his message
Thus any references to faith in such issues as past karma future rebirth or an unconditioned happiness separate from the immediate input of the senses are later interpolations in the texts which Buddhist agnostics following the Buddha's example should do their best to reject
The second interpretation has roots in the side of Western culture that has rejected either the specifics of Christian faith or the authority of any organized religion but has appreciated the emotion of faith as an essential requirement for mental health
This view presents the Buddha as a Romantic hero who appreciated the subjective value of faith in establishing a sense of wholeness within and interconnectedness without
Tolerant and opposed to dogmatism he saw the psychological fact of a living faith as more important than its object
In other words it doesn't matter where faith is directed as long as it's deeply felt and personally nourishing
Faith in the Buddha's Awakening means simply believing that he found what worked for himself
This carries no implications for what will work for you
If you find the teaching on karma and rebirth comforting fine Believe it
If not don't
If you want to include an allpowerful God or a Goddess in your worldview the Buddha wouldn't object
What's important is that you relate to your faith in a way that's emotionally healing nourishing and empowering
Because this second interpretation tends to be allembracing it sometimes leads to a third one that encompasses the first two
This interpretation presents the Buddha as trapped in his historical situation
Much like us he was faced with the issue of finding a meaningful life in light of the worldview of his day
His views on karma and rebirth were simply assumptions picked up from the crude science of ancient India while his path of practice was an attempt to negotiate a satisfying life within those assumptions
If he were alive today he would try to reconcile his values with the discoveries of modern science in the same way that some Westerners have done with their faith in monotheism
The underlying assumption of this position is that science is concerned with facts religion with values
Science provides the hard data to which religion should provide meaning
Thus each Buddhist would be performing the work of a Buddha by accepting the hard facts that have been scientifically proven for our generation and then searching the Buddhist tradition  as well as other traditions where appropriate  for myths and values to give meaning to those facts and in the process forging a new Buddhism for our times
Each of these three interpretations may make eminent sense from a Western point of view but none of them do justice to what we know of the Buddha or of his teaching on the role of faith and empiricism on the path
All three are correct in emphasizing the Buddha's unwillingness to force his teachings on other people but  by forcing our own assumptions onto his teachings and actions  they misread what that unwillingness means
He wasn't an agnostic he had strong reasons for declaring some ideas as worthy of faith and others as not and his teachings on karma rebirth and nirvana broke radically with the dominant worldview of his time
He was neither a Victorian nor a Romantic hero nor was he a victim of his times
He was a hero who among other things mastered the issue of faith and empiricism in his own way
But to appreciate that way we first have to step back from the Western cultural battlefield and look at faith and empiricism in a more basic context simply as processes within the individual mind
There they play their major roles in the psychology of how we decide to act
Although we like to think that we base our decisions on hard facts we actually use both faith and empiricism in every decision we make
Even in our most empirically based decisions our vision is hampered by our position in time
As Kierkegaard noted we live forwards but understand backwards
Any hardheaded business entrepreneur will tell you that the future has to be taken on faith no matter how much we know of the past
What's more we're often forced into decisions where there's no time or opportunity to gather enough past facts for an informed choice
At other times we have too many facts  as when a doctor is faced with many conflicting tests on a patient's condition  and we have to go on faith in deciding which facts to focus on and which ones to ignore
However faith also plays a deeper role in many of our decisions
As William James once observed there are two kinds of truths in life those whose validity has nothing to do with our actions and those whose reality depends on what we do
Truths of the first sort  truths of the observer  include facts about the behavior of the physical world how atoms form molecules how stars explode
Truths of the second sort  truths of the will  include skills relationships business ventures anything that requires your effort to make it real
With truths of the observer it's best to stay skeptical until reasonable evidence is in
With truths of the will though the truth won't happen without your faith in it often in the face of unpromising odds
If you don't believe that democracy will work in your nation it won't
If you don't believe that becoming a pianist is worthwhile or that you have the makings of a good pianist it won't happen
Truths of the will are the ones most relevant to our pursuit of true happiness
Many of the most inspiring stories in life are of people who create truths of this sort when a mountain of empirical evidence is against them
In cases like this the truth requires that faith actively discount the immediate facts
If we dig even deeper into the psychology of decisionmaking we run into an area for which no scientific evidence can offer any proof Do we actually act or are actions an illusion
Are our acts already predetermined by physical laws or an external intelligence or do we have free will
Are the results of our acts illusory
Are causal relationships real or only a fiction
Even the most carefully planned scientific experiment could never settle any of these issues and yet once we become aware of them we have to take a stand on them if we want to continue putting any energy into our thoughts words and deeds
These were the areas where the Buddha focused his teachings on empiricism and faith
Although his first noble truth requires that we observe suffering until we comprehend it we have to take on faith his assertion that the facts we observe about suffering are the most important guide for making decisions moment by moment throughout life
Because his third noble truth the cessation of suffering is a truth of the will we have to take it on faith that it's a possible goal a worthwhile goal and that we're capable of attaining it
And because the fourth noble truth  the path to the cessation of suffering  is a path of action and skill we have to take it on faith that our actions are real that we have free will and yet that there's a causal pattern to the workings of the mind from which we can learn in mastering that skill
As the Buddha said the path will lead to a direct experience of these truths but only if you bring faith to the practice will you know this for yourself
In other words faith in the Buddhist context means faith in the ability of your actions to lead to a direct experience of the end of suffering
The Buddha offered these teachings to people seeking advice on how to find true happiness
That's why he was able to avoid any coercion of others His teachings assumed that his listeners were already involved in a search
When we understand his views on what it means to search  why people search and what they're searching for  we can understand his advice on how to use faith and empiricism in a successful search
The best way to do this is to examine five of his similes illustrating how a search should be conducted
The first simile illustrates search in its most raw and unfocused form
Two strong men have grabbed another man by the arms and are dragging him to a pit of burning embers
The Buddha notes Wouldn't the man twist his body this way and that
The twisting of his body stands for the way we react to suffering
We don't bother to ask if our suffering is predetermined or our actions have any hope of success
We simply put up a struggle and do what we can to escape
It's our natural reaction
The Buddha taught that this reaction is twofold We're bewildered  Why is this happening to me  and we search for a way to put an end to the suffering
When he stated that all he taught was suffering and the end of suffering he was responding to these two reactions providing an explanation of suffering and its end so as to do away with our bewilderment at the same time showing the way to the end of suffering as a way of satisfying our search
He had no use for the idea  often advanced by later writers in the Buddhist tradition  that our suffering comes from our struggle to resist suffering that the search for an end to suffering is precisely what keeps us from seeing the peace already there
In the light of the above simile simply relaxing into a total acceptance of the moment means relaxing into the prospect of being burned alive
The present keeps morphing into the future and you can't turn a blind eye to where it's taking you
This simile also explains why the idea of a Buddhism without faith holds little appeal for people suffering from serious illness oppression poverty or racism Their experience has shown that the only way to overcome these obstacles is to pursue truths of the will which require faith as their rocksolid foundation
The second simile
A man searching for fruit climbs a tree to eat his fill and to stuff his garments with fruit to take home
While he is there another man searching for fruit comes along
The second man can't climb the tree but he has an axe so he chops the tree down
If the first man doesn't quickly get out of the tree he may break an arm or a leg or even die
This simile shows the perils of looking for true happiness in the wrong place in sensual pleasures
If your happiness depends on anything other people can take away from you you're putting yourself in danger
As the Buddha notes we hope for happiness in sensual pleasures not because they've ever really satisfied us but because we can't imagine any other escape from pain and suffering
If we allowed ourselves to believe that there is another alternative we'd be more willing to question our strong faith in our cravings and attachments more willing to look for that alternative and give it a try
And as the third simile argues if we look in the right way we'll find it
A person searching for milk tries to get milk out of a cow by twisting its horn
Another person searching for milk tries to get milk out of the cow by pulling at its udder

The Buddha taught this simile in response to an assertion that there is nothing a human being can do to attain release from suffering
We can attain it he said as long as we follow the right method like the person pulling at the udder of the cow
The right method starts with right understanding and this is where faith in the Buddha's Awakening comes in
As the Buddha once stated he didn't tell us everything he awakened to
What he told was like a handful of leaves what he learned was like the leaves in the forest
Still the leaves in the handful contained all the lessons that would help others to awaken right understanding begins with learning what those specific lessons are
The most important lesson and the most important item of faith is simply the fact of the Awakening itself
The Buddha achieved it through his own efforts and he did so not because he was more than human but because he developed mental qualities that we each have the potential to develop
To have faith in his Awakening thus means having faith in your own potential for Awakening
However the specifics of what he learned in his Awakening are important as well
It's not simply the case that he found what worked for him while what works for you may be something else entirely
No matter how much you twist a cow's horn it'll never produce milk
The Buddha's insights penetrated into how things work what it means for them to work
These insights apply to everyone throughout time
When summarizing his Awakening in the most condensed form the Buddha focused on a principle of causality that explains how we live in a world where patterns of causality fashion events and yet those events are not totally predetermined by the past
The principle is actually a dual one for there are two kinds of causality interweaving in our lives
The first is that of a cause giving results in the immediate present When this is that is when this isn't that isn't
When you turn on a stereo for example the noise comes out when you turn it off the noise stops
The second type of causality is that of a cause giving results over time From the arising of this comes the arising of that from the cessation of this comes the cessation of that
If you study now you'll have knowledge long into the future
If you damage your brain the negative effects will be longterm as well
Applied to karma or intention the dual principle means this Any moment of experience consists of three things pleasures and pains resulting from past intentions present intentions and pleasures and pains resulting from present intentions
Thus the present is not totally shaped by the past
In fact the most important element shaping your present experience of pleasure or pain is how you fashion with your present intentions the raw material provided by past intentions
And your present intentions can be totally free
This is how there's free will in the midst of causality
At the same time the pattern in the way intentions lead to results allows us to learn from past mistakes
This freedom within a pattern opens the way to a path of mental training that can lead to the end of suffering
We practice generosity virtue and meditation to learn the power of our intentions and in particular to see what happens as our intentions grow more skillful so skillful that present intentions actually stop
Only when they stop can you prove for yourself how powerful they've been
And the spot where they stop is where the unconditioned  the end of suffering  is found
From there you can return to intentions but you're no longer their captive or slave
In presenting his teachings on karma and suffering to his listeners the Buddha would offer empirical evidence to corroborate them  noting for instance how your reaction to another person's misery depends on how attached you are to that person  but he never attempted to back these teachings with fullscale empirical proof
In fact he heaped ridicule on his contemporaries the Jains who attempted to prove their more deterministic teaching on karma by claiming that all those who kill steal lie or engage in illicit sex will suffer from their actions here and now
Haven't you seen the case the Buddha asked where a man is rewarded by a king for killing the king's enemy for stealing from the king's enemy for amusing the king with a clever lie for seducing the king's enemy's wife Even though the basic principle of karma is simple enough  skillful intentions lead to pleasure unskillful intentions to pain  the dual principle of causality through which karma operates is so complex like a Mandelbrot set that you would go crazy trying to nail the whole thing down empirically
So instead of an empirical proof for his teaching on karma the Buddha offered a pragmatic proof If you believe in his teachings on causality karma rebirth and the four noble truths how will you act
What kind of life will you lead
Won't you tend to be more responsible and compassionate
If on the other hand you were to believe in any of the alternatives  such as a doctrine of an impersonal fate or a deity who determined the course of your pleasure and pain or a doctrine that all things were coincidental and without cause  what would those beliefs lead you to do
Would they allow you to put an end to suffering through your own efforts
Would they allow any purpose for knowledge at all
If on the other hand you refused to commit to a coherent idea of what human action can do would you be likely to see a demanding path of practice all the way through to the end
This was the kind of reasoning that the Buddha used to inspire faith in his Awakening and in its relevance to our own search for true happiness
The fourth simile stresses the importance of not settling for anything less than the genuine thing
A man searching for heartwood goes into a forest and comes to a tree containing heartwood but instead of taking the heartwood he takes home some sapwood branches or bark

Faith in the possibility of nirvana  the heartwood of the path  is what keeps you from getting waylaid by the pleasures of the sapwood and bark the gratification that comes from being generous and virtuous the sense of peace interconnectedness and oneness that comes with strong concentration
Yet surprisingly modern discussions of the role of faith in the Buddha's teachings rarely mention this point and focus on faith in karma and rebirth instead
This is surprising because nirvana is much less related to our everyday experience than either karma or rebirth
We see the fruits of our actions all around us we see people being born with distinct personalities and differing strengths and it's only a short leap to the idea that there's some connection between these things
Nirvana however isn't connected to anything we've experienced at all
It's already there but hidden by all our desires for physical and mental activity
To touch it we have to abandon our habitual attachment to activity
To believe that such a thing is possible and that it's the ultimate happiness is to take a major leap
Many in the Buddha's time were willing to take the leap while many others were not preferring to content themselves with the branches and sapwood wanting simply to learn how to live happily with their families in this life and go to heaven in the next
Nirvana they said could wait
Faced with this honest and gentle resistance to his teaching on nirvana the Buddha was happy to comply
But he was less tolerant of the stronger resistance he received from brahmas heavenly deities who complacently felt that their experience of limitless oneness and compassion in the midst of samsara  their sapwood  was superior to the heartwood of nirvana
In cases like this he used all the psychic and intellectual powers at his disposal to humble their pride because he realized that their views totally closed the door to Awakening
If you think that your sapwood is actually heartwood you won't look for anything better
When your sapwood breaks you'll decide that heartwood is a lie
But if you realize that you're using bark and sapwood you leave open the possibility that someday you'll go back and give the heartwood a try
Of course it's even better if you can take the Buddha's teachings on nirvana as a direct challenge in this lifetime  as if he were saying Here's your chance
Can you prove me wrong
The fifth simile
An experienced elephant hunter searching for a big bull elephant comes across a large elephant footprint in the forest
However he doesn't jump to the conclusion that it's the footprint of a big bull elephant
Why
Because there are dwarf female elephants with big feet
It might be one of theirs
He follows along and sees some scratch marks and tusk marks high up on the trees but still doesn't jump to the conclusion that he's on the trail of a big bull elephant
Why
Because there are tall female elephants with tusks
The marks might be theirs
He follows along and finally sees a big bull elephant under a tree or in a clearing
That's when he concludes that he's found his bull elephant
In explaining this simile the Buddha said that all the preliminary steps of the practice  going into the wilderness as a monastic adhering to the precepts developing restraint contentment and strong concentration seeing past lives and gaining vision of the beings of the cosmos dying and being reborn in line with their karma  are simply footprints and scratch marks of the Buddha's Awakening
Only when you have your own first taste of Awakening having followed his path do you really know that your faith in his Awakening was well placed
Touching the dimension where suffering ends you realize that the Buddha's teachings about it were not only true but also useful He knew what he was talking about and was able to point you there as well
What's interesting about this simile is the way it combines healthy faith with honest skepticism
To act on this faith is to test it the way you'd test a working hypothesis
You need faith to keep following the footprints but you also need the honesty to recognize where faith ends and knowledge begins
This is why in the Buddhist context faith and empiricism are inseparable
Unlike a monotheistic religion  where faith centers on the power of another  faith in the Buddha's Awakening keeps pointing back to the power of your own actions Do you have enough power over your intentions to make them harmless
Do harmless intentions then give you the freedom to drop intention entirely
The only way you can answer these questions is by being scrupulously honest about your intentions to detect even the slightest traces of harm even the slightest movement of intention itself
Only then will you know the deathless totally unconditioned by intention for sure
But if you claim to know things that you don't how can you trust yourself to detect any of these things
You need to make your honesty worthy of your faith testing its assumptions until you find true knowledge in the test
This is why science will never be able to pass valid judgment on the truths of Awakening for the path deals in matters that outside experimenters can't reach
Although others may sympathize with your suffering the suffering itself is an experience you can share with no one else
The honesty and skillfulness of your intentions is an affair of your internal dialogue something that is also purely your own
Scientists can measure the neurological data indicating pain or intentional activity but there's no external measurement for how the pain feels or how honest your intentional dialogue may be
And as for the deathless it has no physical correlates at all
The closest that outside empirical measurement can get is to pictures of the footprints on the ground and the marks in the trees
To get to the bull elephant you have to do what the Buddha's disciple Sariputta did
He kept following the path without jumping to dishonest conclusions until he saw the elephant within
Then when the Buddha asked him Do you take it on faith that these five strengths  faith persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment  lead to the deathless Sariputta could answer honestly No I don't take it on faith
I know
As Sariputta stated in another discourse his proof was experiential but so inward that it touched a dimension where not only the external senses but even the sense of the functioning of the mind can't reach
If you want to confirm his knowledge you have to touch that dimension in the only place you can access it inside yourself
This is one of two ways in which the Buddha's method differs from that of modern empiricism
The other has to do with the integrity of the person attempting the proof
As in science faith in the Buddha's Awakening acts like a working hypothesis but the test of that hypothesis requires an honesty deeper and more radical than anything science requires
You have to commit yourself  every variation on who you feel you are  totally to the test
Only when you take apart all clinging to your inner and outer senses can you prove whether the activity of clinging is what hides the deathless
The Buddha never forced anyone to commit to this test both because you can't coerce people to be honest with themselves and because he saw that the pit of burning embers was coercion enough
The Pali term for meditation is bhavana development
It's a shorthand word for the development of skillful qualities in the mind
Bhavana is a type of karma  the intentional activity ultimately leading to the end of karma  but karma nonetheless
This point is underlined by another Pali term for meditation kammatthana the work at hand and by a Thai idiom for meditation to make an effort These terms are worth keeping in mind to counterbalance the common assumption that meditation is an exercise in inaction or in passive allencompassing acceptance
Actually as described in the Pali texts meditation is a very proactive process
It has an agenda and works actively to bring it about
This can be seen in the Pali description of how right mindfulness is fostered through satipatthana
Satipatthana is often translated as foundation of mindfulness which gives the impression that it refers to an object of meditation
This impression is reinforced when you see the four satipatthanas listed as body feelings mind and mental qualities
But if you look at the texts you find that they teach satipatthana as a process a way of establishing mindfulness hence the compound term
When the texts define the compound they give not a list of objects but four formulas describing an activity
Here's the first formula
Each of the terms in this formula is important
Remaining focused can also be translated as keeping track This refers to the element of concentration in the practice as you hold to one particular theme or frame of reference amid the conflicting currents of experience
Ardent refers to the effort you put into the practice trying to abandon unskillful states of mind and develop skillful ones in their stead all the while trying to discern the difference between the two
Alert means being clearly aware of what's happening in the present
Mindful means being able to remember or recollect
Sometimes mindfulness is translated as nonreactive awareness free from agendas simply present with whatever arises but the formula for satipatthana doesn't support that translation
Nonreactive awareness is actually part of equanimity one of many qualities fostered in the course of satipatthana but the ardency involved in satipatthana definitely has an agenda a task to be done while the role of mindfulness is to keep your task in mind
The task here is twofold staying focused on your frame of reference and putting aside any greed and distress that would result from shifting your frame of reference back to the world
This is the meaning of the body in and of itself In other words you try to stay with the experience of the body as it's immediately felt without referring it to the narratives and views that make up your sense of the world
You stay away from stories of how you have related to your body in the past and how you hope to relate to it in the future
You drop any concern for how your body fits into the world in terms of its beauty agility or strength
You simply tune into the body on its own terms  the direct experience of its breathing its movements its postures its elementary properties and its inevitable decay
In this way you learn how to strip away your assumptions about what does or doesn't lie behind your experience of the body and gain practice in referring everything to the experience itself
The same approach applies to the remaining types of satipatthana focusing on feelings on mind states and on mental qualities in and of themselves
At first glance these may look like new and different meditation exercises but the Buddha makes clear that they can all center on a single practice keeping the breath in mind
When the mind is with the breath all four frames of reference are right there
The difference lies simply in the subtlety of your focus
So when you've developed your skills with the first most blatant type of satipatthana you don't have to move far to take up the more subtle ones
Simply stay with the breath and shift your focus to the feelings and mind states that arise from being mindful of the breath and the mental qualities that either get in the way of your focus or strengthen it
Once you've chosen your frame of reference you treat it the same way you've been treating the body taking it as your frame of reference in and of itself without referring it to stories about yourself or views about the world
You separate feelings  of pleasure pain and neitherpleasurenorpain  from the stories you normally create around them
You separate states of greed anger and delusion from their focal points in the world
In this way you can see them for what they are
Still though you have an agenda based on the desire for Awakening  a desire that the Buddha classed not as a cause of suffering but as part of the path leading to its end
This becomes clearest in the satipatthana focused on mental qualities in and of themselves
You acquaint yourself with the unskillful qualities that obstruct concentration  such as sensual desire ill will and restlessness  not simply to experience them but also to understand them so that you can cut them away
Similarly you acquaint yourself with the skillful qualities that foster discernment so that you can develop them all the way to release
The texts call these skillful qualities the seven factors of Awakening and show that satipatthana practice is aimed at developing them all in order
The first factor is mindfulness
The second is called analysis of qualities the ability to distinguish skillful from unskillful qualities in the mind seeing what can be accepted and what needs to be changed
The third factor is persistence  persistence in abandoning unskillful qualities and fostering skillful ones in their place
The texts describe a wide variety of methods to use in this endeavor but they all come down to two sorts
In some cases an unskillful quality will disappear simply when you watch it steadily
In other cases you have to make a concerted effort actively doing what you can to counteract an unskillful quality and replace it with a more skillful one
As skillful qualities take charge within you you see that while skillful thinking leads to no harmful actions long bouts of it can tire the mind
So you bring your thoughts to stillness which develops three more of the factors of Awakening rapture serenity and concentration
These provide the mind with a foundation of wellbeing
The final factor is equanimity and its place in the list is significant
Its nonreactivity is fully appropriate only when the more active factors have done what they can
This is true of all the lists in which equanimity is included
It's never listed on its own as sufficient for Awakening and it always comes last after the proactive factors in the list
This doesn't mean that it supplants them simply that it joins in their interaction
Instead of replacing them it counterbalances them enabling you to step back and see subtle levels of stress and craving that the more proactive factors may have obscured
Then it makes room for the proactive factors to act on the newly discovered levels
Only when all levels of stress and craving are gone is the work of both the proactive and nonreactive sides of meditation done
That's when the mind can be truly agendafree
It's like learning to play the piano
As you get more proactive in playing proficiently you also become sensitive in listening nonreactively to discern ever more subtle levels in the music
This allows you to play even more skillfully
In the same way as you get more skilled in establishing mindfulness on your chosen frame of reference you gain greater sensitivity in peeling away ever more subtle layers of the present moment until nothing is left standing in the way of total release
The Atthaka Vagga is a set of sixteen poems on the theme of nonclinging
The poems cover all four types of clinging  clinging to sensuality to views to practices and precepts and to doctrines of the self  with a special emphasis on the first two
They describe what constitutes the nature of the clinging in each particular case the drawbacks of the clinging the advantages of abandoning clinging ways to abandon clinging and the subtle paradoxes of what it means not to cling
This last point is touched on in many discourses in the Pali canon as the Buddhist teachings on nonclinging all contain a central paradox the objects of clinging that must ultimately be abandoned form part of the path to their abandoning
A certain amount of sensual pleasure is needed in the path to go beyond sensual pleasure Right View is needed to overcome attachment to views a regimen of precepts and practices is needed to overcome attachment to precepts and practices a strong sense of selfresponsibility is needed to overcome attachment to doctrines of the self
Other passages in the Pali canon offer clear analogies to explain these paradoxes often in terms of movement toward a goal  taking a raft across a river walking to a park taking a series of relay coaches from one city to another  in which the motive and means of transport are abandoned on reaching the goal
The Atthaka however sometimes presents these paradoxes in as mystifying a manner as possible
In fact some of the paradoxes  particularly in the discussions of abandoning clinging to views  are stated in terms so stark that on the surface they are hard to reconcile with teachings in other Pali discourses or with other passages in the Atthaka itself
The question is thus whether these paradoxes should be taken at face value or further interpreted
Or to put the question in terms used by the Buddha himself Is their meaning as stated already fully drawn out or does it have to be inferred
Readers of the poems have offered arguments for both sides
The argument for taking the paradoxes at face value is based on a major assumption that the Atthaka is historically prior to the rest of the Pali canon
From this assumption the argument goes on to conclude that these poems contain the earliest recorded teachings of the Buddha and that if they conflict with other passages in the Canon that is simply because those other passages are less true to the Buddha's original message
This argument however contains several weaknesses
To begin with only two pieces of evidence are offered for the relative age of these poems the Atthaka Vagga as a set is mentioned at three other points in the Canon at Ud V Mv
V and SN and the language of the poems is more archaic than that of the other discourses
However neither piece of evidence can carry the weight of what it's supposed to prove
The first piece shows simply that an Atthaka Vagga predates the three passages in question not necessarily that the Atthaka Vagga as we have it predates the entire remainder of the Canon
As for the archaic nature of the language that is common to a great deal of the poetry throughout the Pali canon
Just as Tennyson's poetry contains more archaisms than Dryden's prose the fact that a Pali poem uses archaic language is no proof of its actual age
The arguments for taking the Atthaka's paradoxes at face value contain other weaknesses as well
They commonly state that the paradoxes teach a view of no views and a practice of no goals yet the people who advance this argument are the first to admit that such doctrines are totally impractical
These doctrines are also inconsistent with other passages in the Atthaka itself such as the clearcut view explaining the sources of conflict presented in Sn and the frequent references to Unbinding as the goal of the practice
Thus even if the Atthaka is appreciably older than the other Pali discourses we would have to assume gross inconsistencies in its message if we were to take its paradoxes at face value
The argument that the meaning of the Atthaka's paradoxes must be inferred  that they were intentionally stated in obscure terms  is based on firmer ground
To begin with this is the interpretation that Buddhist tradition has advanced from its earliest centuries
An extended commentary entitled the Mahaniddesa reconciling the content of the poems with the teachings in the rest of the discourses was compiled early enough to be included in the Canon itself
Although some of the explanations given in the Mahaniddesa may seem a little too pat and pedantic they make clear the point that Buddhists near the time of the Buddha found many useful levels of meaning below the surface level of the poems
Even if we disregard arguments from tradition there are other good reasons for maintaining that the meaning of the Atthaka's paradoxes was designed to be inferred
To begin with there is the question already mentioned of the internal consistency of the poems themselves they make better sense when taken as a whole if the paradoxes are explored for meanings not obvious on the surface
A prime example is the passage toward the beginning of Sn in which the Buddha seems to be saying that an awakened person would regard purity as being found neither by means of views precepts and practices etc nor through lack of views precepts and practices etc
Magandiya the Buddha's listener states understandably that such a teaching is confused
Readers who have acquired a taste for Mahayana nondualities and who would take the Buddha's statement at face value might scoff at Magandiya's narrowmindedness
But if the words are taken at face value Magandiya would be right for there are many passages in the Atthaka that recommend views precepts and practices as part of the path to purity
However if we take the Buddha's statements as puns on the instrumental case  which can be interpreted not only as through or by means of but also as in terms of or in connection with the Buddha's statements to Magandiya make sense in and of themselves and fit with the rest of the Atthaka an awakened person would not define purity in terms of views precepts and practices etc but would also realize that purity cannot be attained through a lack of these things
A second reason for regarding the paradoxes as requiring interpretation is that in their use of puns and grammatical wordplay they follow an ancient Indian genre  the philosophical enigma  that by its very nature called for extensive interpretation
Evidence in the Rig Veda shows that ancient Vedic ritual included contests in which elder brahmans used puns and other wordplay to express philosophical teachings as riddles that contestants were then challenged to solve
The purpose of these contests was to teach the contestants  usually students studying to become ritual experts  to use their powers of ingenuity in thinking outside the box in the justified belief that the process of searching for inspiration and being illuminated by the answer would transform the mind in a much deeper way than would be achieved simply by absorbing information

Although the Atthaka poems advise against engaging in intellectual contests they imitate the Vedic enigmas in the way they use language to challenge the reader
Individual words  sometimes whole lines and stanzas  in the poems can be interpreted in a variety of ways and it's up to the reader to explore and consider all the various meanings to decide which ones are most helpful
Although our culture associates wordplay with jokes the Atthaka stands at the head of a long line of Buddhist texts  both Theravada and not  that use wordplay with a serious purpose to teach the reader to think independently to see through the uncertainties of language and so to help loosen any clinging to the structures that language imposes on the mind
This type of rhetoric also rewards anyone who takes the text seriously enough to reread and rethink what it has to say
Thus the obscurity of some of the Atthaka's language can be regarded as a function not of the poems' age but of the genre to which they belong
The proper reading of a text like this requires that you question your assumptions about its message and clarify the intention behind your efforts at reaching an understanding
In this way the act of reading is meant not only to inform but to transform
The more you give to it the more it opens up new possibilities in the mind
Translating wordplay of this sort presents enormous challenges even when those challenges are surmounted the act of reading such word games in translation can never be quite the same as reading them in the original language and cultural setting
Fortunately aside from the more controversial passages much of the Atthaka is perfectly straightforward  although Ven
Maha Kaccana's commentary on one of the simpler verses in should serve as warning that even the straightforward passages can contain hidden meanings
In passages where I have detected multiple meanings I've included all the detected meanings in the translation  although I'm sure that there are instances of double meanings that I haven't detected
Wherever the Pali seems ambiguous I've tried to use English equivalents that convey the same ambiguity
Wherever this has proven beyond my abilities I've resorted to explanatory notes
I have also used the notes to cite interpretations from the Mahaniddesa and other passages from earlier parts of the Canon that help explain paradoxes and other obscure points  both as an aid to the serious reader and as a way of showing that the gulf assumed to separate the Atthaka from the rest of the discourse collection is more imagined than real
Two final notes on reading the Atthaka
Although these poems were originally composed for an audience of wandering homeless monks they offer valuable lessons for lay people as well
Even the passages referring directly to the homeless life can be read as symbolic of a state of mind
Ven
Maha Kaccana's commentary mentioned above shows that this has been done ever since canonical times
Addressing a lay person and commenting on a verse describing the behavior of a sage who has abandoned home and society he interprets home as the khandhas and society as sense impressions
Thus in his hands the verse develops an internal meaning that lay people can apply to their lives without necessarily leaving their external home and society
Other verses in the poems can be interpreted in similar ways
The poems center on descriptions of sages and enlightened people but these words don't have fixed meanings from verse to verse
In some contexts they denote arahants in others nothing more than intelligent runofthemill people
So be alert to context when reading descriptions about sages and enlightened people to see whether they're describing people following the path or those who have already reached the goal
A lifeaffirming Buddhism that teaches us to find happiness by opening to the richness of our everyday lives
That's what we want  or so we're told by the people who try to sell us a mainstreamlined Buddhism
But is it what we need
And is it Buddhism
Think back for a moment on the story of the young Prince Siddhartha and his first encounters with aging illness death and a wandering contemplative
It's one of the most accessible chapters in the Buddhist tradition largely because of the direct truetotheheart quality of the young prince's emotions
He saw aging illness and death as an absolute terror and pinned all his hopes on the contemplative forest life as his only escape
As Asvaghosa the great Buddhist poet depicts the story the young prince had no lack of friends and family members who tried to talk him out of those perceptions and Asvaghosa was wise enough to show their lifeaffirming advice in a very appealing light
Still the prince realized that if he were to give in to their advice he would be betraying his heart
Only by remaining true to his honest emotions was he able to embark on the path that led away from the ordinary values of his society and toward an unsurpassed Awakening into the Deathless
This is hardly a lifeaffirming story in the ordinary sense of the term but it does affirm something more important than life the truth of the heart when it aspires to a happiness absolutely pure
The power of this aspiration depends on two emotions called in Pali samvega and pasada
Very few of us have heard of them but they're the emotions most basic to the Buddhist tradition
Not only did they inspire the young prince in his quest for Awakening but even after he became the Buddha he advised his followers to cultivate them on a daily basis
In fact the way he handled these emotions is so distinctive that it may be one of the most important contributions his teachings have to offer to American culture today
Samvega was what the young Prince Siddhartha felt on his first exposure to aging illness and death
It's a hard word to translate because it covers such a complex range  at least three clusters of feelings at once the oppressive sense of shock dismay and alienation that come with realizing the futility and meaninglessness of life as it's normally lived a chastening sense of our own complacency and foolishness in having let ourselves live so blindly and an anxious sense of urgency in trying to find a way out of the meaningless cycle
This is a cluster of feelings we've all experienced at one time or another in the process of growing up but I don't know of a single English term that adequately covers all three
It would be useful to have such a term and maybe that's reason enough for simply adopting the word samvega into our language
But more than providing a useful term Buddhism also offers an effective strategy for dealing with the feelings behind it  feelings that our own culture finds threatening and handles very poorly
Ours of course is not the only culture threatened by feelings of samvega
In the Siddhartha story the father's reaction to the young prince's discovery stands for the way most cultures try to deal with these feelings He tried to convince the prince that his standards for happiness were impossibly high at the same time trying to distract him with relationships and every sensual pleasure imaginable
To put it simply the strategy was to get the prince to lower his aims and to find satisfaction in a happiness that was less than absolute and not especially pure
If the young prince were living in America today the father would have other tools for dealing with the prince's dissatisfaction but the basic strategy would be essentially the same
We can easily imagine him taking the prince to a religious counselor who would teach him to believe that God's creation is basically good and not to focus on any aspects of life that would cast doubt on that belief
Or he might take him to a psychotherapist who would treat feelings of samvega as an inability to accept reality
If talking therapies didn't get results the therapist would probably prescribe moodaltering drugs to dull the feeling out of the young man's system so that he could become a productive welladjusted member of society
If the father were really up on current trends he might find a Dharma teacher who would counsel the prince to find happiness in life's little miraculous pleasures  a cup of tea a walk in the woods social activism easing another person's pain
Never mind that these forms of happiness would still be cut short by aging illness and death he would be told
The present moment is all we have so we should try to appreciate the bittersweet opportunity of relishing but not holding on to brief joys as they pass
It's unlikely that the lionhearted prince we know from the story would take to any of this wellmeant advice
He'd see it as propaganda for a life of quiet desperation asking him to be a traitor to his heart
But if he found no solace from these sources where in our society would he go
Unlike the India of his time we don't have any wellestablished socially accepted alternatives to being economically productive members of society
Even our contemplative religious orders are prized for their ability to provide bread honey and wine for the marketplace
So the prince would probably find no alternative but to join the drifters and dropouts the radicals and revolutionaries the subsistence hunters and survivalists consigned to the social fringe
He'd discover many fine minds and sensitive spirits in these groups but no accumulated body of proven and profound alternative wisdom to draw on
Someone might give him a book by Thoreau or Muir but their writings would offer him no satisfactory analysis of aging illness and death and no recommendations for how to go beyond them
And because there's hardly any safety net for people on the fringe he'd find himself putting an inordinate amount of his energy into issues of basic survival with little time or energy left over to find his own solution to the problem of samvega
He would end up disappearing his Buddhahood aborted  perhaps in the Utah canyon country perhaps in a Yukon forest  without trace
Fortunately for us however the prince was born in a society that did provide support and respect for its dropouts
This was what gave him the opportunity to find a solution to the problem of samvega that did justice to the truths of his heart
The first step in that solution is symbolized in the Siddhartha story by the prince's reaction to the fourth person he saw on his travels outside of the palace the wandering forest contemplative
The emotion he felt at this point is termed pasada another complex set of feelings usually translated as clarity and serene confidence It's what keeps samvega from turning into despair
In the prince's case he gained a clear sense of his predicament and of the way out of it leading to something beyond aging illness and death at the same time feeling confident that the way would work
As the early Buddhist teachings freely admit the predicament is that the cycle of birth aging and death is meaningless
They don't try to deny this fact and so don't ask us to be dishonest with ourselves or to close our eyes to reality
As one teacher has put it the Buddhist recognition of the reality of suffering  so important that suffering is honored as the first noble truth  is a gift in that it confirms our most sensitive and direct experience of things an experience that many other traditions try to deny
From there the early teachings ask us to become even more sensitive to the point where we see that the true cause of suffering is not out there  in society or some outside being  but in here in the craving present in each individual mind
They then confirm that there is an end to suffering a release from the cycle
And they show the way to that release through developing noble qualities already latent in the mind to the point where they cast craving aside and open onto Deathlessness
Thus the predicament has a practical solution a solution within the powers of every human being
It's also a solution open to critical scrutiny and testing  an indication of how confident the Buddha was in the solution he found to the problem of samvega
This is one of the aspects of authentic Buddhism that most attracts people who are tired of being told that they should try to deny the insights that inspired their sense of samvega in the first place
In fact early Buddhism is not only confident that it can handle feelings of samvega but it's also one of the few religions that actively cultivates them to a radical extent
Its solution to the problems of life demand so much dedicated effort that only strong samvega will keep the practicing Buddhist from slipping back into his or her old ways
Hence the recommendation that all Buddhists both men and women lay or ordained should reflect daily on the facts of aging illness separation and death  to develop feelings of samvega  and on the power of one's own actions to take samvega one step further to pasada
For people whose sense of samvega is so strong that they want to abandon any social ties that prevent them from following the path to the end of suffering Buddhism offers both a longproven body of wisdom for them to draw from as well as a safety net the monastic sangha an institution that enables them to leave lay society without having to waste time worrying about basic survival
For those who can't leave their social ties Buddhist teaching offers a way to live in the world without being overcome by the world following a life of generosity virtue and meditation to strengthen the noble qualities of the mind that will lead to the end of suffering
The symbiotic relationship designed for these two branches of the Buddhist parisa or community guarantees that each will benefit from contact with the other
The support of the laity guarantees that the monastics will not need to be overly concerned about food clothing and shelter the gratitude that the monastics inevitably feel for the freelyoffered generosity of the laity helps to keep them from turning into misfits and misanthropes
At the same time contact with the monastics helps the laity foster the proper perspective on life that nurtures the energy of samvega and pasada they need to keep from becoming dulled and numbed by the materialistic propaganda of the mainstream economy
So the Buddhist attitude toward life cultivates samvega  a clear acceptance of the meaninglessness of the cycle of birth aging and death  and develops it into pasada a confident path to the Deathless
That path includes not only timeproven guidance but also a social institution that nurtures it and keeps it alive
These are all things that our society desperately needs
It's a shame that in our current efforts at mainstreaming Buddhism they are aspects of the Buddhist tradition usually ignored
We keep forgetting that one source of Buddhism's strength is its ability to keep one foot out of the mainstream and that the traditional metaphor for the practice is that it crosses over the stream to the further shore
My hope is that we will begin calling these things to mind and taking them to heart so that in our drive to find a Buddhism that sells we don't end up selling ourselves short
If you have any friends or family members who are sick or dying I know of no one who would tell you to treat them in a hardhearted way
Everyone would agree that you should be as compassionate as you can
The problem is that there's little agreement on how compassion translates into specific actions
For some people compassion means extending life as long as possible for others it means terminating life  through assisted suicide or euthanasia  when quality of life falls below a certain level
And neither of these two groups sees the other as compassionate at all
The first sees the second as criminal the second sees the first as heartless and cruel
For those of us trying to negotiate the murky territory between these two extremes there's not much reliable guidance
Ours is a culture that doesn't like to think about illness and death and as a result when faced with someone who's sick or dying we're at a loss as to what to do
Some people will advise you simply to do what feels right but feelings have a way of turning slippery and devious
Some things feel right simply because they make you feel good regardless of whether they're genuinely right for the other person
A desire to extend life may mask a deeper fear of your own death a desire to terminate a miserable illness may rationalize your distress at having to witness suffering
Even if you're told to act from a place of mindful presence you may find that what seem to be your spontaneous inspirations are actually conditioned by hidden unexamined assumptions about what life and death are all about
This is why the simple injunction to be compassionate or mindful in the presence of a sick or dying person isn't enough
We need help in educating our compassion specific advice on how to think through the implications of our actions in the face of life and death and specific examples of how people who have contemplated these issues thoroughly have actually acted in the past
With this thought in mind I searched through the Pali canon  the oldest extant record of the Buddha's teachings  to see what lessons could be drawn from the Buddha's example
After all the Buddha often referred to himself as a doctor and to his Dharma as medicine for the sufferings of the world
From his point of view we're all sick and dying on a subtle level so we all deserve continual compassion
But what sort of advice did this doctor give when facetoface with the flesh and blood suffering of illness and death
How did he treat people who were physically sick or dying
You probably know the story of how together with Ven
Ananda he once found an unattended sick monk lying in his own filth
After washing the monk he assembled the other monks chided them for abandoning their brother and gave them strong incentive to follow his example Whoever would tend to me he said should tend to the sick He arranged that monks nursing their fellow monks should receive special allotments of food to encourage them in their work and help lighten their burden
But he didn't subscribe to the notion that medical treatment should try to extend life at all costs
The Vinaya his monastic discipline imposes only a minor penalty on a monk who refuses to care for a fellow monk who is sick or dying or who totally abandons a sick monk before the latter recovers or dies
And there's no penalty for withholding or discontinuing a specific medical treatment
So the rules convey no message that the failure to keep life going is an offense of any kind
At the same time though a monk who deliberately ends the life of a patient even from compassionate motives is expelled from the monkhood and can never reordain in this life so there's no room for euthanasia or assisted suicide
This means that the middle ground is where true compassion can be exercised
The Buddha sets out some guidelines for this area in his definition of the ideal nurse
You're qualified to tend to the sick if you know how to prepare medicines you know what's amenable to the patient's cure taking away whatever's unamenable and providing things that are amenable you're motivated by compassion and not by material gain you're not squeamish about cleaning up urine excrement saliva or vomit and you're competent at encouraging the patient at the proper times with talk on Dharma
Of these five qualifications the one most discussed in the Pali canon is the fifth What qualifies as a helpful and compassionate talk on Dharma to a person who is sick or dying
What doesn't
Here again the don'ts mark off the territory for the do's
The Vinaya cites cases where monks tell a sick person to focus his thoughts on dying in the belief that death would be better than the miserable state of his life
The sick person does as they advise he dies as a result and the Buddha expels the monks from the monkhood
Thus from the Buddha's perspective encouraging a sick person to relax her grip on life or to give up the will to live would not count as an act of compassion
Instead of trying to ease the patient's transition to death the Buddha focused on easing his or her insight into suffering and its end
This is because he regarded every moment of life as an opportunity to practice and benefit from the Dharma
It's a wellknown principle in all meditation traditions that a moment's insight into the pain of the present is far more beneficial than viewing the present moment with disgust and placing one's hopes on a better future
This principle applies as much at the end of life as it does anywhere in the middle
In fact the Buddha encouraged his monks to reflect constantly on the potential imminence of death at every moment even when in ordinary health so that they could bring a sense of urgency to their practice and give the present moment their full attention
If you learn to treat all moments as potentially your last then when your last moment does come you will face it prepared
Most often though a sick or dying person hasn't been living with this sort of urgent alertness so the first step in advising such a person is to aim at clearing away any emotional obstacles to learning from the present
The Pali texts note two such obstacles worry over the responsibilities the person is leaving behind and fear of death
In one poignant discourse a man appears to be dying and his wife consoles him not to worry She'll be able to provide for herself and their children in his absence she won't go looking for another husband and she'll continue in her practice of the Dharma
With each reassurance she repeats the refrain So don't be worried as you die
Death is painful for one who is worried
The Blessed One has warned against being worried at the time of death The man recovers unexpectedly and while still frail goes to visit the Buddha telling him of his wife's reassurances
The Buddha comments on how fortunate the man is for having such a wise and sympathetic wife
As for fear of death the Buddha notes that one of the primary reasons for this fear is the remembrance of hurtful or cruel things you've done in the past
Thus the Vinaya shows that monks would often console a fellow monk on his deathbed by asking him to call to mind something more positive  his highest meditative attainment  and to focus his thoughts there
In a similar vein a common practice in Asian Buddhist countries is to remind a dying person of the acts of generosity or virtue he or she has performed in this life
Even if the person is unable to muster the mindfulness and alertness needed to gain further insight into the present any Dharma talk that helps allay worries and forestall fears is an act of true compassion
The Buddha comments however that there are three additional reasons for fearing death attachment to the body attachment to sensual pleasures and a lack of direct insight into the unconditioned Dharma of the Deathless
His more advanced instructions for sick and dying people thus focus on cutting these reasons for fear at the root
He once visited a sick ward and told the monks there to approach the moment of death mindful and alert
Instead of focusing on whether they would recover they should observe the movements of the feelings they were experiencing painful pleasant or neutral
Observing a sensation of pain for instance they should notice how inconstant it is and then focus on the repeated dissolution of all pains
They could then apply the same focused alertness to pleasant and neutral feelings as well
The steadiness of their focus would give rise to a sense of ease independent of sensory feelings and from this point of independence they could develop dispassion and relinquishment both for the body and for feelings of any sort
With relinquishment would come a genuine insight into the Dharma which being Deathless would end all fear of death
On another occasion Ven
Sariputta visited the famous supporter of the Buddha Anathapindika who was on his deathbed
After learning that Anathapindika's disease was worsening he advised him to train himself I won't cling to the eye my consciousness won't be dependent on the eye
I won't cling to the ear my consciousness won't be dependent on the ear and so forth through all the six senses their objects and any mental events dependent on them
Although Anathapindika was unable to develop this independent consciousness in line with Sariputta's instructions he asked that these instructions be given to other lay people as well for there would be those who would understand and benefit from them
Obviously these recommendations are all shaped by the Buddha's teachings on how the state of one's mind influences the process of death and rebirth but that doesn't mean that they're appropriate only for those who would call themselves Buddhist
Regardless of your religious beliefs when you're faced with obvious pain you're bound to see the value of any instructions that show you how to reduce suffering by investigating the pain in and of itself
If you have the strength to follow through with the instructions you're bound to want to give them a try
And if you encounter the Deathless in the course of your efforts you're not going to quibble about whether to call it by a Buddhist or nonBuddhist name
This point is illustrated by another story involving Ven
Sariputta
Visiting an aged brahman on his deathbed Sariputta reflected that brahmans desire union with Brahma so he taught the man to develop the four attitudes of a Brahma  infinite good will compassion appreciation and equanimity
After following these instructions the brahman was reborn as a Brahma after death
The Buddha however later chided Sariputta for not teaching the brahman to focus instead on investigating pain for if he had the brahman would have experienced nirvana and been freed from rebirth altogether
What's striking about all these instructions is that from the Buddha's point of view deathbed Dharma is no different from Dharma taught to people in ordinary health
The cause of suffering is in every case the same and the path to the end of suffering is the same as well comprehend suffering abandon its cause realize its cessation and develop the qualities of mind that lead to its cessation
The only difference is that the obvious proximity of death makes teaching the Dharma both easier and harder  easier in that the patient is freed from extraneous responsibilities and can see clearly the need to understand and gain release from pain harder in that the patient may be too weakened physically or emotionally through fear or worry to put the instructions into practice
But whatever the case it's worth noting that up to the moment of death the Buddha would have you focus less on the limitations of the situation than on the potential opportunities
Even one moment of insight in the midst of pain and suffering he said is worth more than one hundred years of good health
From my own personal experience  both in watching my teachers implement these instructions and in trying to implement them myself  I've learned two major lessons
One is that the patients best suited for making the most of the Dharma when sick or dying are those who are not tormented with memories of cruel or hurtful things they did in the past and who have already developed a meditative or contemplative practice prior to their illness
Even if that practice isn't Buddhist they intuitively respond to the Buddha's message on pain and are able to use it to alleviate their own sufferings
The lesson here is that as long as you know you're going to die someday it's a good idea to avoid cruel actions and to get started on a meditative practice of your own so that you'll be prepared for illness and death when they come
As my teacher Ajaan Fuang once said when you meditate you're gaining practice in how to die  how to be mindful and alert how to endure pain how to gain control over wayward thoughts and maybe even reach the Deathless  so that when the time comes to die you'll do it with skill
The second lesson is that if you want to help other people overcome their fear of death you have to learn how to overcome your own fear of death as well by abandoning attachment to the body abandoning attachment to sensual pleasures avoiding cruel actions and gaining direct insight into the Deathless
With your fears overcome you'll be much more effective in teaching the Dharma to those on their deathbed
You won't be disturbed by the physical horrors of death you'll be able to communicate directly to the needs of the dying person and your words will carry more weight for they come from direct experience
Your compassion will be educated not by books or feelings but by a clear insight into what dies and what doesn't
Ultimately these two lessons boil down to one Meditate as an act of compassion both for yourself and for others even if death seems far away
When the time comes to die you'll be less of a burden on those who are caring for you
In the meantime if you're called on to comfort those who are sick or dying your compassion will be more genuinely helpful and you'll have a more effective message to teach
According to the Buddhist monastic code monks and nuns are not allowed to accept money or even to engage in barter or trade with lay people
They live entirely in an economy of gifts
Lay supporters provide gifts of material requisites for the monastics while the monastics provide their supporters with the gift of the teaching
Ideally  and to a great extent in actual practice  this is an exchange that comes from the heart something totally voluntary
There are many stories in the texts that emphasize the point that returns in this economy  it might also be called an economy of merit  depend not on the material value of the object given but on the purity of heart of the donor and recipient
You give what is appropriate to the occasion and to your means when and wherever your heart feels inspired
For the monastics this means that you teach out of compassion what should be taught regardless of whether it will sell
For the laity this means that you give what you have to spare and feel inclined to share
There is no price for the teachings nor even a suggested donation Anyone who regards the act of teaching or the act of giving requisites as a repayment for a particular favor is ridiculed as mercenary
Instead you give because giving is good for the heart and because the survival of the Dhamma as a living principle depends on daily acts of generosity
The primary symbol of this economy is the alms bowl
If you are a monastic it represents your dependence on others your need to accept generosity no matter what form it takes
You may not get what you want in the bowl but you realize that you always get what you need even if it's a hardearned lesson in doing without
One of my students in Thailand once went to the mountains in the northern part of the country to practice in solitude
His hillside shack was an ideal place to meditate but he had to depend on a nearby hilltribe village for alms and the diet was mostly plain rice with some occasional boiled vegetables
After two months on this diet his meditation theme became the conflict in his mind over whether he should go or stay
One rainy morning as he was on his alms round he came to a shack just as the morning rice was ready
The wife of the house called out asking him to wait while she got some rice from the pot
As he was waiting there in the pouring rain he couldn't help grumbling inwardly about the fact that there would be nothing to go with the rice
It so happened that the woman had an infant son who was sitting near the kitchen fire crying from hunger
So as she scooped some rice out of the pot she stuck a small lump of rice in his mouth
Immediately the boy stopped crying and began to grin
My student saw this and it was like a light bulb turning on in his head
Here you are complaining about what people are giving you for free he told himself
You're no match for a little kid
If he can be happy with just a lump of rice why can't you As a result the lesson that came with his scoop of rice that day gave my student the strength he needed to stay on in the mountains for another three years
For a monastic the bowl also represents the opportunity you give others to practice the Dhamma in accordance with their means
In Thailand this is reflected in one of the idioms used to describe going for alms proad sat doing a favor for living beings
There were times on my alms round in rural Thailand when as I walked past a tiny grass shack someone would come running out to put rice in my bowl
Years earlier as lay person my reaction on seeing such a bare tiny shack would have been to want to give monetary help to them
But now I was on the receiving end of their generosity
In my new position I may have been doing less for them in material terms than I could have done as a lay person but at least I was giving them the opportunity to have the dignity that comes with being a donor
For the donors the monk's alms bowl becomes a symbol of the good they have done
On several occasions in Thailand people would tell me that they had dreamed of a monk standing before them opening the lid to his bowl
The details would differ as to what the dreamer saw in the bowl but in each case the interpretation of the dream was the same the dreamer's merit was about to bear fruit in an especially positive way
The alms round itself is also a gift that goes both ways
On the one hand daily contact with lay donors reminds the monastics that their practice is not just an individual matter but a concern of the entire community
They are indebted to others for the right and opportunity to practice and should do their best to practice diligently as a way of repaying that debt
At the same time the opportunity to walk through a village early in the morning passing by the houses of the rich and poor the happy and unhappy gives plenty of opportunities to reflect on the human condition and the need to find a way out of the grinding cycle of death and rebirth
For the donors the alms round is a reminder that the monetary economy is not the only way to happiness
It helps to keep a society sane when there are monastics infiltrating the towns every morning embodying an ethos very different from the dominant monetary economy
The gently subversive quality of this custom helps people to keep their values straight
Above all the economy of gifts symbolized by the alms bowl and the alms round allows for specialization a division of labor from which both sides benefit
Those who are willing can give up many of the privileges of home life and in return receive the free time the basic support and the communal training needed to devote themselves fully to Dhamma practice
Those who stay at home can benefit from having fulltime Dhamma practitioners around on a daily basis
I have always found it ironic that the modern world honors specialization in almost every area  even in things like running jumping and throwing a ball  but not in the Dhamma where it is denounced as dualism elitism or worse
The Buddha began the monastic order on the first day of his teaching career because he saw the benefits that come with specialization
Without it the practice tends to become limited and diluted negotiated into the demands of the monetary economy
The Dhamma becomes limited to what will sell and what will fit into a schedule dictated by the demands of family and job
In this sort of situation everyone ends up poorer in things of the heart
The fact that tangible goods run only one way in the economy of gifts means that the exchange is open to all sorts of abuses
This is why there are so many rules in the monastic code to keep the monastics from taking unfair advantage of the generosity of lay donors
There are rules against asking for donations in inappropriate circumstances from making claims as to one's spiritual attainments and even from covering up the good foods in one's bowl with rice in hopes that donors will then feel inclined to provide something more substantial
Most of the rules in fact were instituted at the request of lay supporters or in response to their complaints
They had made their investment in the merit economy and were interested in protecting their investment
This observation applies not only to ancient India but also to the modernday West
On their first contact with the Sangha most people tend to see little reason for the disciplinary rules and regard them as quaint holdovers from ancient Indian prejudices
When however they come to see the rules in the context of the economy of gifts and begin to participate in that economy themselves they also tend to become avid advocates of the rules and active protectors of their monastics
The arrangement may limit the freedom of the monastics in certain ways but it means that the lay supporters take an active interest not only in what the monastic teaches but also in how the monastic lives  a useful safeguard to make sure that teachers walk their talk
This again insures that the practice remains a communal concern
As the Buddha said
Monks householders are very helpful to you as they provide you with the requisites of robes almsfood lodgings and medicine
And you monks are very helpful to householders as you teach them the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle and admirable in the end as you expound the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely complete surpassingly pure
In this way the holy life is lived in mutual dependence for the purpose of crossing over the flood for making a right end to suffering and stress
Periodically throughout the history of Buddhism the economy of gifts has broken down usually when one side or the other gets fixated on the tangible side of the exchange and forgets the qualities of the heart that are its reason for being
And periodically it has been revived when people are sensitive to its rewards in terms of the living Dhamma
By its very nature the economy of gifts is something of a hothouse creation that requires careful nurture and a sensitive discernment of its benefits
I find it amazing that such an economy has lasted for more than years
It will never be more than an alternative to the dominant monetary economy largely because its rewards are so intangible and require so much patience trust and discipline in order to be appreciated
Those who demand immediate return for specific services and goods will always require a monetary system
Sincere Buddhist lay people however have the chance to play an amphibious role engaging in the monetary economy in order to maintain their livelihood and contributing to the economy of gifts whenever they feel so inclined
In this way they can maintain direct contact with teachers insuring the best possible instruction for their own practice in an atmosphere where mutual compassion and concern are the medium of exchange and purity of heart the bottom line
Change is the focal point for Buddhist insight  a fact so well known that it has spawned a familiar sound bite Isn't change what Buddhism is all about What's less well known is that this focus has a frame that change is neither where insight begins nor where it ends
Insight begins with a question that evaluates change in light of the desire for true happiness
It ends with a happiness that lies beyond change
When this frame is forgotten people create their own contexts for the teaching and often assume that the Buddha was operating within those same contexts
Two of the contexts commonly attributed to the Buddha at present are these
Insight into change teaches us hope
Because change is built into the nature of things nothing is inherently fixed not even our own identity
No matter how bad the situation anything is possible
We can do whatever we want to do create whatever world we want to live in and become whatever we want to be
The first of these interpretations offers wisdom on how to consume the pleasures of immediate personal experience when you'd rather they not change the second on how to produce change when you want it
Although sometimes presented as complementary insights these interpretations contain a practical conflict If experiences are so fleeting and changeable are they worth the effort needed to produce them
How can we find genuine hope in the prospect of positive change if we can't fully rest in the results when they arrive
Aren't we just setting ourselves up for disappointment
Or is this just one of the unavoidable paradoxes of life
Ancient folk wisdom from many cultures would suggest so advising us that we should approach change with cautious joy and stoic equanimity training ourselves to not to get attached to the results of our actions and accepting without question the need to keep on producing fleeting pleasures as best we can for the only alternative would be inaction and despair
This advice too is often attributed to the Buddha
But the Buddha was not the sort of person to accept things without question
His wisdom lay in realizing that the effort that goes into the production of happiness is worthwhile only if the processes of change can be skillfully managed to arrive at a happiness resistant to change
Otherwise we're lifelong prisoners in a forcedlabor camp compelled to keep on producing pleasurable experiences to assuage our hunger and yet finding them so empty of any real essence that they can never leave us full
These realizations are implicit in the question that according to the Buddha lies at the beginning of insight
This is a heartfelt question motivated by the desire behind all conscious action to attain levels of pleasure worthy of the effort that goes into them
It springs from the realization that life requires effort and that if we aren't careful whole lifetimes can be lived in vain
This question together with the realizations and desires behind it provides the context for the Buddha's perspective on change
If we examine it closely we find the seeds for all his insights into the production and consumption of change
The first phrase in the question  What when I do it will lead to  focuses on the issues of production on the potential effects of human action
Prior to his Awakening the Buddha had left home and gone into the wilderness to explore precisely this issue to see how far human action could go and whether it could lead to a dimension beyond the reach of change
His Awakening was confirmation that it could  if developed to the appropriate level of skillfulness
He thus taught that there are four types of action corresponding to four levels of skill three that produce pleasant unpleasant and mixed experiences within the cycles of space and time and a fourth that leads beyond action to a level of happiness transcending the dimensions of space and time thus eliminating the need to produce any further happiness
Because the activities of producing and consuming require space and time a happiness transcending space and time by its very nature is neither produced nor consumed
Thus when the Buddha reached that happiness and stepped outside the modes of producing and consuming he was able to turn back and see exactly how pervasive a role these activities play in ordinary experience and how imprisoning they normally are
He saw that our experience of the present is an activity  something fabricated or produced moment to moment from the raw material provided by past actions
We even fabricate our identity our sense of who we are
At the same time we try to consume any pleasure that can be found in what we've produced  although in our desire to consume pleasure we often gobble down pain
With every moment production and consumption are intertwined We consume experiences as we produce them and produce them as we consume
The way we consume our pleasures or pains can produce further pleasures or pains now and into the future depending on how skillful we are
The three parts of the latter phrase in the Buddha's question  my  longterm  wellbeing and happiness  provide standards for gauging the level of our skill in approaching true pleasure or happiness
We apply these standards to the experiences we consume if they aren't longterm then no matter how pleasant they might be they aren't true happiness
If they're not true happiness there's no reason to claim them as mine
This insight forms the basis for the Three Characteristics that the Buddha taught for inducing a sense of dispassion for normal time and spacebound experience
Anicca the first of the three is pivotal
Anicca applies to everything that changes
Often translated as impermanent it's actually the negative of nicca which means constant or dependable
Everything that changes is inconstant
Now the difference between impermanent and inconstant may seem semantic but it's crucial to the way anicca functions in the Buddha's teachings
As the early texts state repeatedly if something is anicca then the other two characteristics automatically follow it's dukkha and anatta ie not worthy to be claimed as me or mine
If we translate anicca as impermanent the connection among these Three Characteristics might seem debatable
But if we translate it as inconstant and consider the Three Characteristics in light of the Buddha's original question the connection is clear
If you're seeking a dependable basis for longterm happiness and ease anything inconstant is obviously a stressful place to pin your hopes  like trying to relax in an unstable chair whose legs are liable to break at any time
If you understand that your sense of self is something willed and fabricated  that you choose to create it  there's no compelling reason to keep creating a me or mine around any experience that's inconstant and stressful
You want something better
You don't want to make that experience the goal of your practice
So what do you do with experiences that are inconstant and stressful
You could treat them as worthless and throw them away but that would be wasteful
After all you went to the trouble to fabricate them in the first place and as it turns out the only way you can reach the goal is by utilizing experiences of just this sort
So you can learn how to use them as means to the goal and the role they can play in serving that purpose is determined by the type of activity that went into producing them the type that produces a pleasure conducive to the goal or the type that doesn't
Those that do the Buddha labeled the path These activities include acts of generosity acts of virtue and the practice of mental absorption or concentration
Even though they fall under the Three Characteristics these activities produce a sense of pleasure relatively stable and secure more deeply gratifying and nourishing than the act of producing and consuming ordinary sensual pleasures
So if you're aiming at happiness within the cycles of change you should look to generosity virtue and mental absorption to produce that happiness
But if you'd rather aim for a happiness going beyond change these same activities can still help you by fostering the clarity of mind needed for Awakening
Either way they're worth mastering as skills
They're your basic set of tools so you want to keep them in good shape and ready to hand
As for other pleasures and pains  such as those involved in sensual pursuits and in simply having a body and mind  these can serve as the objects you fashion with your tools as raw materials for the discernment leading to Awakening
By carefully examining them in light of their Three Characteristics  to see exactly how they're inconstant stressful and notself  you become less inclined to keep on producing and consuming them
You see that your addictive compulsion to fabricate them comes entirely from the hunger and ignorance embodied in states of passion aversion and delusion
When these realizations give rise to dispassion both for fabricated experiences and for the processes of fabrication you enter the path of the fourth kind of kamma leading to the Deathless
This path contains two important turns
The first comes when all passion and aversion for sensual pleasures and pains has been abandoned and your only remaining attachment is to the pleasure of concentration
At this point you turn and examine the pleasure of concentration in terms of the same Three Characteristics you used to contemplate sensual experiences
The difficulty here is that you've come to rely so strongly on the solidity of your concentration that you'd rather not look for its drawbacks
At the same time the inconstancy of a concentrated mind is much more subtle than that of sensual experiences
But once you overcome your unwillingness to look for that inconstancy the day is sure to come when you detect it
And then the mind can be inclined to the Deathless
That's where the second turn occurs
As the texts point out when the mind encounters the Deathless it can treat it as a mindobject  a dhamma  and then produce a feeling of passion and delight for it
The fabricated sense of the self that's producing and consuming this passion and delight thus gets in the way of full Awakening
So at this point the logic of the Three Characteristics has to take a new turn
Their original logic  Whatever is inconstant is stressful whatever is stressful is notself  leaves open the possibility that whatever is constant could be easeful and self
The first possibility is in fact the case whatever is constant is easeful the Deathless is actually the ultimate ease
But the second possibility isn't a skillful way of regarding what's constant if you latch onto what's constant as self you're stuck on your attachment
To go beyond space and time you have to go beyond fabricating the producing and consuming self which is why the concluding insight of the path is All dhammas  constant or not  are notself
When this insight has done its work in overcoming any passion or delight for the Deathless full Awakening occurs
And at that point even the path is relinquished and the Deathless remains although no longer as an object of the mind
It's simply there radically prior to and separate from the fabrication of space and time
All consuming and producing for the sake of your own happiness comes to an end for a timeless wellbeing has been found
And because all mindobjects are abandoned in this happiness questions of constant or inconstant stress or ease self or notself are no longer an issue
This then is the context of Buddhist insight into change an approach that takes seriously both the potential effects of human effort and the basic human desire that effort not go to waste that change have the potential to lead to a happiness beyond the reach of change
This insight is focused on developing the skills that lead to the production of genuine happiness
It employs the Three Characteristics  of inconstancy stress and notself  not as abstract statements about existence but as inducement for mastering those skills and as guidelines for measuring your progress along the way
When used in this way the Three Characteristics lead to a happiness transcending the Three Characteristics the activities of producing and consuming and space and time as a whole
When we understand this context for the Three Characteristics we can clearly see the halftruths contained in the insights on the production and consumption of change that are commonly misattributed to the Buddha
With regard to production Although it may be true that with enough patience and persistence we can produce just about anything including an amazing array of selfidentities from the raw material of the present moment the question is what's worth producing
We've imprisoned ourselves with our obsession for producing and consuming changeable pleasures and changeable selves and yet there's the possibility of using change to escape from this prison to the freedom of a happiness transcending time and space
Do we want to take advantage of that possibility or would we rather spend our spare time blowing bubbles in the sunlight coming through our prison windows and trying to derive happiness from their swirling patterns before they burst
This question ties in with wisdom on consumption Getting the most out of our changing experiences doesn't mean embracing them or milking them of their intensity
Instead it means learning to approach the pleasures and pains they offer not as fleeting ends in themselves but as tools for Awakening
With every moment we're supplied with raw materials  some of them attractive some of them not
Instead of embracing them in delight or throwing them away in disgust we can learn how to use them to produce the keys that will unlock our prison doors
And as for the wisdom of nonattachment to the results of our actions in the Buddha's context this notion can make sense only if we care deeply about the results of our actions and want to master the processes of cause and effect that lead to genuine freedom
In other words we don't demand childishly that our actions  skillful or not  always result in immediate happiness that everything we stick into the lock will automatically unlatch the door
If what we have done has been unskillful and led to undesirable results we want to admit our mistakes and find out why they were mistakes so that we can learn how to correct them the next time around
Only when we have the patience to look objectively at the results of our actions will we be able to learn by studying the keys that don't unlock the doors how finally to make the right keys that do
With this attitude we can make the most of the processes of change to develop the skill that releases us from the prison of endless producing and consuming
With release we plunge into the freedom of a happiness so true that it transcends the terms of the original question that led us there
There's nothing further we have to do our sense of my and mine is discarded and even the longterm which implies time is erased by the timeless
The happiness remaining lies radically beyond the range of our time and spacebound conceptions of happiness
Totally independent of mindobjects it's unadulterated and unalterable unlimited and pure
As the texts tell us it even lies beyond the range of totality and the All
And that's what Buddhist practice is all about
Peace means letting go of mental objects so that nothing comes in to disturb the mind
All that's left is a nature devoid of fabrication
Even the nibbana we want to reach is nothing other than a peace not fabricated by conditions
As for the peace we develop through various techniques by which the mind gathers into concentration or gathers into stillness that's the peace of the mind gathering in
It stops fabricating
It stops holding onto the aggregates
We should view this sort of peace in which we let go of the aggregates as a strategy
When the mind isn't at peace that's because it doesn't let go
It holds onto things as its self or belonging to its self
As a result it suffers
It feels stress
The mind takes its stance in form in feelings in perceptions in consciousness
It seizes hold of these things but these things are inconstant
When they change they lead to disappointment
The mind then thrashes around and piles on more stress and suffering
So we have to view peace as our strategy  the peace we try to give rise to  seeing it as a high level of happiness
As for any lack of peace we should view that as suffering
The mind lacks peace because defilements disturb it
This happens because the mind isn't skillful and the mind isn't skillful because of delusion
So we focus on peace and on the stress of disturbance as our strategies
Peace we regard as the goal for which we're practicing
Stress we use as an object of contemplation as a means for destroying delusion intoxication heedlessness our hankering for things
The strategy by which we can bring the mind to peace requires that we see the stress and drawbacks inherent in the aggregates
As long as we keep hankering after the aggregates as long as we're deluded by sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas found in the aggregates the peace we want can't last for these things are inconstant
This inconstancy is what leads to the stress and suffering we see all around us
We take our stance in forms that are inconstant
Or you could say that we seize hold of forms that are inconstant
We live in forms that are inconstant
We take a stance in feeling
We seize hold of feeling
Why do we seize hold of it
Because we've fabricated it into being from having seized hold of feeling in the past
The cause from the past becomes the effect in the present
To let go of the feeling in the present we have to examine things until we see the inconstancy the stress in form feeling perception fabrication and consciousness
Then the mind won't be deluded
This is our path
This is the right view that fosters discernment
In this way stress is the means for developing knowledge and vision
If there weren't any stress or suffering what would we take as our focus
Actually stress and suffering are already there so why don't we see them for what they are
Because we haven't heard the Dhamma  or we have heard it but we've listened in an aimless way with no truth in our listening our awareness our actions
So we have to be certain earnest and true in our heart
After all suffering is an earnest truth
If we just play at contemplation simply letting things happen on their own that's not meditation
It gives us no proof doesn't develop the mind
If you're going to focus on anything focus on it so that you comprehend it so that you see its truth so that you can grow disenchanted with stress and suffering and can abandon the origination of stress and suffering in line with its truth
Don't just go through the motions
When I went to stay with Ajaan Mun the first thing he spoke about was this being truthful earnest
He said You've ordained in earnestness
You didn't ordain in play
You ordained with conviction and did it properly with the Sangha and your preceptor admitting you to the community of monks
Everything was done in line with the Buddha's instructions
So you have your guarantee that you're a genuine monk on the conventional level
But your status as a monk isn't yet complete
You need to be earnest in your practice to complete all three parts of the Triple Training  heightened virtue heightened mind heightened discernment  until you gain true knowledge of what the Buddha taught
You have to practice all the way to the end so that you can gain true knowledge through proper discernment of the noble truths
Stress for instance is a noble truth
It's right there in front of you
Why don't you become disenchanted with it
Because you don't see it don't see the cause from which it comes
Or when you see the cause you don't see its connection to stress
Why is that
Because delusion gets in the way
You see pretty sights hear lovely sounds smell nice aromas taste good flavors and then you fall for them
You get carried away and grasp after them thinking that you've acquired something
As for the things you don't yet have you want to acquire them
Once you acquire them you fall for them and get all attached and entangled
This is the origination of suffering
When these things are inconstant they stop being peaceful
They become a turmoil because they're inconstant all the time
Have you ever acquired anything that's constant and lasting
Has anyone ever acquired anything that's constant and lasting
When you acquire money a home a car a boat whatever  a child or a grandchild  are these things constant
Stable
Do they make the mind constant and stable
You have to contemplate suffering and stress down to the details and see all the way through
Don't just go through the motions
Focus on sights and sounds in general  everything inside or outside where the mind takes up residence
They're all just like our body  they're all based on form
Hair of the head is a form hair of the body nails teeth skin  every part  the bones
If you took the bones out how could the rest of the body stay
Even when you don't take them out they're going to go on their own
Every part is going to fall away
They won't stay together like this forever
Whatever you acquire  good or bad pleasant or unpleasant  you have to investigate it
Ask yourself All these things that you hold onto that you love and delight in that you have to keep caring for from fear of hunger heat cold difficulties pains and illnesses all these things that you've been caring for all along What have you gained from them
All you've got to show is that you can't meditate and bring the mind to peace radiance or purity all because you're so possessive of these things
What I'm saying here is a truth that's true for everyone
Each of these words applies to each one of us
This is the truth
It's what the Buddha said when he was summarizing the basic principle of suffering and stress
We should use suffering and stress as our tool in destroying the origination of suffering so that we won't be deluded by craving
If we don't make use of suffering and stress there's no other way we can destroy it
We'll keep falling for it delighting in it
But if we see how things are inconstant and stressful we won't fall for craving any longer
We'll see how we've been taking birth and dying dying and taking birth endlessly all because we see this thing as delicious that as delicious this as sweetsmelling that as sweetsmelling this as soft that as soft
All of this is the origination of stress
We're deluded about these things we get infatuated with them
We don't get infatuated with suffering
As long as we're infatuated with these things there's inconstancy instability separation leading to sorrow and despair always searching for more
What does this all come from
We have to look for both the cause and the effect to see how they're connected if we want to know
That's when we'll be discerning when we gain knowledge and vision seeing the long course
The Buddha taught the Dhamma so as to broaden our mindfulness and discernment so that it can encompass more than just what's right in our face
For instance he has us contemplate that we're subject to aging subject to illness subject to death
Even though we're not yet old he has us contemplate aging so as to prepare ourselves for the fact that this is the way things will have to go
We're not yet ill we're not yet dead but we have to contemplate these things every day
This is what it means to be heedful prepared
Once we see this truth we won't want to give rise to anything unskillful in the mind
We won't be greedy angry or deluded for what do we gain from being greedy
Nothing but stress
What do we gain from being angry
Nothing but stress
What do we gain from being deluded
Nothing but stress
When we see this we'll be able to live without greed anger or delusion caring for the body just enough to keep it going just enough to develop the discernment that will enable us to see the truth
This will put an end to the burden of falling for the cycle of death and rebirth without end
Once we cast off this burden we won't have to concern ourselves with these things any longer
We hear that nibbana is happiness so we want to go there
We hear that meditating brings happiness so we want to meditate  but we do it without any skillful strategies
We need skillful strategies in our listening skillful strategies in focusing our awareness skillful strategies in our practice
Everything requires strategies intelligence mindfulness and discernment within the mind
The intelligence of the mind is something really powerful you know
It's nothing to sneeze at
But for the most part we don't apply that power inside
We apply it outside to material things
Whatever we put our minds to we can accomplish
We can build all kinds of things but we devote our power just to things outside to solving external problems
As a result we stay deluded about ourselves
We don't really look at ourselves
The Buddha was the first to really turn around and look at himself
He didn't build external power
He didn't claim to be special
He simply turned around to look at the mind asking himself If the mind is really special why does it have to depend on other things
Why does it have to keep building up other things
Those things are inconstant so when they change what's left
It's all a waste of energy
All you have to do is turn around and straighten out the mind so that it doesn't fall for its fabricating
You don't have to go building anything fabricating anything
When you see through the process of fabricating you put an end to it
That's called the unfabricated
Nibbana is the unfabricated
No conditions can fabricate it or dress it up at all
It comes from turning around to know the heart without fabricating or seizing hold of anything outside
This is the truth
If we don't reach this state of truth we'll just keep on circling around
You have to know what disbands and ceases in nibbana
You have to know what you're still deluded about that keeps getting in the way
So be intent on your meditation
Peace of mind is a strategy that we use to test the truth within ourselves
We see that when the mind lets go of the aggregates it's happy
If you don't yet believe this you can give it a try
When you sit in concentration try letting go
Tell yourself that you're not going to carry these aggregates around you're not going to get riled up about them
Whatever pains there may be you don't have to pay them any mind
Pay attention to buddho or whatever your meditation topic may be until there's nothing left but the property of knowing
And then keep watching watching watching letting go of anything else that comes along until the mind settles down and is peaceful
A sense of ease and pleasure will appear as your evidence You've been able to let go of the aggregates of form feeling perception and fabrication
As long as you're not involved with them the mind is peaceful and at ease
But as soon as you get involved with them the mind is immediately in a turmoil
This is your strategy for seeing stress for knowing stress
When the mind isn't peaceful that's stress
As soon as we see this we'll grow disenchanted
Whatever comes to disturb the mind there's stress in the process of fabrication which is conditioned by ignorance
So we should focus on studying the mind developing the mind
Once you've brought the mind to peace you should use that peace as a strategy to contemplate stress so as to disband it
See the connection between stress and lack of peace in the mind along with their relationship to form to the aggregates to the origination of stress
See how the origination of stress is related to the eye seeing forms the ear hearing sounds the nose smelling aromas the tongue tasting flavors
When craving arises this is where it's going to arise right here at these things but the only way to see this is through meditation
If you don't meditate you won't know
The way to know is through the strategy of finding a peaceful place and making the mind peaceful
That's how you'll gain release from suffering and stress
Now that you understand this focus on making the mind peaceful as a strategy for eliminating the stress and disturbance
Be circumspect in using your discernment
Keep on meditating until the end of the hour
When we meditate we're training the mind for we hold the mind to be very important
But training the mind is really difficult if we don't develop the right character habits
We have to depend on refined inner qualities for the training really to go straight to the heart because the heart itself is subtle and sensitive
We have to make our character meticulous pliant tractable respectful inoffensive
We have to be willing to follow the example already set by someone who knows who's already taken the path who  on examination  we've found to be above us in terms of his training in mindfulness and discernment above us in terms of the purity of his actions
Who is this person
The Buddha  someone to whom no one else can legitimately be compared
We can't legitimately compare our views and opinions with him for he is someone who truly trained himself who sacrificed everything with no thought for his survival
The fact that we're still left hanging on in samsara after this long long time is all because of our character habits
It's because of our character habits that we keep missing the path falling off the path straying away from the path all the time
It's because of our habit of finding excuses for ourselves that we aren't willing to follow the path set out by the Buddha
What sort of path has he set out for our actions
What sort has he set out for our words
For our mind
He set out standards for us to respect to obey to put into practice
Sages have said that the Buddha's path is an easy one to follow correctly for it creates no dangers
It doesn't require that we do anything hurtful or hard
We have to examine the Buddha's teachings to see if they're worthy of obedience or not to see if they're worthy to be followed or not
Do they have any defects that we should try to avoid that we shouldn't accept
Can we find any inconsistencies in the Buddha that would justify our giving more credence to our own opinions that would justify our disobeying his teachings
And what do we have that's so special
When you look carefully you can't find anything to fault him with
So what harm would it do to listen to him and to obey his teachings
We have to study to see where our own defects lie
It's as if we're going on a journey
Our body may be in good shape but if the workings of our car are defective they can take us right off the road
So we have to meditate to examine the workings of our car in other words the preoccupations that we create in the mind and that act as views
The Buddha gave a great deal of importance to the issue of views for our views can make us defective
When our views are defective they can make our virtues defective
They can make our practice defective taking us off the path
Our views get defective when the mind is infected with delusion
There's very little alertness
There may be a lot of knowledge a lot of information but very little alertness
We may think that we're knowledgeable that we're intelligent but we don't know that our views are defective
Only those who know who've gotten past this stage can recognize what's defective in our views
So we have to make a point of training the aspect of our character related to our views to practice making our views straight
Only then will we free ourselves from defective views and replace them with impeccable ones
In order to do this we have to be scrupulous in being observant
And we have to be scrupulous in reflecting on our past actions both the things we've done right and the things we've done wrong
For the most part we don't observe our actions carefully
We make the same mistakes over and over again
We cause ourselves suffering but don't take it to heart to prevent it from happening again
This is why we keep spinning around endlessly in the cycles of samsara
We keep making mistakes but we don't recognize them as mistakes
We do things right from time to time but don't recognize why they're right
So everything gets all confused
But if we train ourselves to be observant to keep cleansing the heart so that we won't repeat our mistakes a second time won't cause ourselves to suffer in that way a second time we'll be able to make choices that really benefit us
When we look at our past beliefs and actions and then compare them with the actions of those who are wise we'll see which things are useless and we'll stop doing them
But if we don't let go of our old views we won't be able to stop doing the things we should stop
We won't be able to give up the things we should give up
As long as we hold onto our old views the same old sufferings will keep shadowing us
We'll never be able to find the path leading to the end of suffering
This is why the noble eightfold path begins with sammaditthi or right view
Right view correctly describes things right around us  within and without us  that have always been that way from time immemorial
So when you see the Dhamma  the truth of things as they already are  you'll be willing to let go of your old opinions and follow the path taught by the Buddha
For the Buddha taught these truths so that we could study and know the genuine truth
It doesn't hurt to believe the Buddha
It can only help us
His Awakening was for the benefit and happiness of the beings of the world for the purification of the beings of the world who have the wisdom and discernment to follow the path that he followed
The arising of a Buddha leads to suffering only for those whose pride prevents them from following his path
They're the only ones who don't benefit from his Awakening
We should be open and honest with ourselves about our pride our views
We shouldn't hide them from ourselves
We should bring them out and flush them out
Don't keep feeding them
For the most part they're not the sort of friends who will help make us bright clean and pure
Don't go thinking that the ideas we like will necessarily help make us bright clean and pure
We should pry them out unfurl them clean them out so that all our defective views can be cut away
When we're free of defective views we'll be left with impeccable views views that are a treasure in terms of our thinking
When our views are impeccable our virtues will be impeccable
And when our virtues form a good solid foundation training the mind becomes easy and free from difficulties
The problem right now is that our views run contrary to the truth and are always ready to make false assumptions
We see stressful things as pleasurable short things as long things that should be done as things not to be done
We see things that are filthy that should be straightened out to put them in line with the truth and we simply leave them as they are at odds with the truth
So how can we hope to gain release from suffering
How can we hope to reach purity
The mind is something subtle and sensitive easily misled by subtle misunderstandings to say nothing of blatant ones
This is why the Buddha set out a training regime for our character habits to make us compliant and respectful toward the truth even in the smallest matters seeing danger in even the slightest faults
In other words he pointed out even the slightest faults that we should avoid should abandon but we feel that we can't do without them
We don't see them as faults
This means we don't see the frightening dangers that will arise from our own wrong actions
So we're audacious in doing what's wrong
As for the things the Buddha told us to do we're not willing to do them not willing to follow him all because of our views and our pride
This is why we can't reach the stream to nibbana
If we want to practice so as to abandon our pride so as to enter the stream to the transcendent we have to straighten out our views  in particular selfidentity views
These are the very first door
If we can't straighten out these sorts of wrong views we won't be able to find the door through the wall that separates us from the Deathless
We'll simply circle around the outside perimeter
No matter how many lifetimes we practice we'll just keep walking around the perimeter of the wall if we can't straighten out these views
So we should train ourselves to examine our many subtle views in all their elaborations
We should give rise to conviction that's stronger than what we already have
We should make our respect stronger than what it already is and be willing to follow the Buddha's instructions
When he says to renounce something we should renounce it even if it means putting our life on the line even if it means dying
Only then will we come out victorious making an opening in the wall of our views
If we're not willing to make that level of sacrifice there's no way we'll succeed
So remember this If we're not willing to make that level of sacrifice there's no way we'll succeed
If you want to get through the final wall so as to gain total release from dying and birth you have to stop circling around the outside perimeter like this
If you keep acting the way you are you'll never gain release from suffering and stress
So try to be observant try to evaluate the preoccupations that lie buried in your heart
What are the obstacles the defilements you have to undo so that you can come out victorious
If you can't overcome them using one method try other methods until you can
Don't let them become you Don't let them become your self making you engage in Imaking and mymaking and selfidentity views
Once there are selfidentity views the stupidity of the mind will lead to uncertainty so that you can't come to any clear and genuine conclusions
You'll grasp at external things  this is what's called grasping at precepts and practices  like the Jains in the time of the Buddha who thought they would succeed in gaining release through external practices without training the mind to give rise to discernment
They felt that if they followed their practices external forces would come and save them some god would come and save them
But the purity of our external actions is something only we can know
As the Buddha taught there's no one else who can come and save us
Only we can save ourselves
There's no god greater than the help we give ourselves
So don't let yourself be misled
Vanquish your wrong views so that you can be genuinely compliant toward the Buddha genuinely believing in his teachings with genuine respect
Keep on meditating
When we meditate we let go of our present preoccupations
Normally the mind is always preoccupied with the various objects that the eye sees the ear hears the nose smells the tongue tastes and the body comes into contact with
But when we want peace of mind we have to see these objects as coarse and gross
We try to let go of things that are gross things that are sensual
We focus instead on things that are more refined and of more lasting value step by step
We keep on getting the mind to gather in stillness keep on letting go of everything else
It's like when we go to sleep we have to let go of distracting thoughts we have to stop thinking have to cut those things away if we're going to sleep in comfort
As long as the mind is in a turmoil over those things and can't let them go it won't be able to fall asleep
It'll have no sense of ease won't gain any strength
Even more so when we meditate we have to cut away all our other preoccupations let them all go leaving only buddho
Adjust your attitude so that you can find a sense of ease at the same time you're repeating buddho to yourself
Don't let yourself get bored or tired of the meditation
How do you develop a sense of ease
Through your conviction in what you're doing
No matter what the job if you can do it with a sense of conviction a sense of respect for your work you can keep at it continuously
Even if the sun is beating down and you're all tired and worn out you can keep on doing it
If you do it with a sense of desire for the results a sense of persistence intentness and circumspection you can keep on doing it without getting tired
When you do your work with this attitude you can keep at it always
This is why our teachers were able to live with a sense of contentment even when they were out in the mountain wilds
They put effort into their meditation with a sense of ease and wellbeing in the peace of mind they were able to maintain through restraining the mind with mindfulness
If their hearts were already inclined to stillness and seclusion then as soon as the mind had developed its foundation they were able to keep it going without any difficulties
It became automatic and they were able to experience a sense of wellbeing  the stillness the fullness the brightness of the mind
So adjusting the mind properly in this way is something very important for anyone who wants peace of mind
Keep reminding yourself to develop an attitude of conviction and this will give energy and encouragement to your efforts
If your conviction persistence and mindfulness are strong you'll be able to win out over any restless anxious sleepy or lazy states of mind
You'll be able to win out over these things through the qualities of mind you develop
The qualities of mind we're developing are like strategic weapons
We develop mindfulness
We develop alertness
We pick out our one object of meditation  This is what I'm going to fasten on  and then we both keep it in mind and stay aware of it
When we refuse to let go of it when we hold on tight to a single object it becomes the quality called singleness of preoccupation
When this singleness of mind arises it can cut through restlessness cut through anxiety
It includes both mindfulness and persistence and can keep the mind firmly gathered in one place
When this singleness of mind arises it turns into firm concentration
The mind gets more refined and can let go of everything else step by step
This singleness is the refined part that holds through all the levels of right concentration
In the first level you have to have singleness of preoccupation in charge
Even though there's also directed thought evaluation rapture and pleasure singleness of preoccupation has to be there
Directed thought and evaluation are the coarser parts of the concentration
You'll know as the mind gets more refined because it lets go of them leaving just singleness of preoccupation rapture and pleasure
Rapture is the coarsest of these three so you let go of it leaving just pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
Pleasure is the coarser of these two so you let go of it leaving just singleness of preoccupation and equanimity
When the mind has a sense of steady equanimity firm and unwavering If you want to call it tender it's tender in that it doesn't put up any resistance to the Dhamma doesn't resist the truth of things as they are
It doesn't dispute
It's willing to accept that truth
But if you want to call it tough it's tough in that it's firm and unwavering
Normally when things are soft and tender they waver and move when they're struck by anything
But when the mind is tender in this way it becomes tough instead
No one can fool it
It doesn't waver it's not affected by anything
This is the nature of the mind in concentration
Why doesn't it waver
Because it's seen the truth
It's full
It's not hungry in any way that could make it waver that could let it get tempted
It doesn't want anything else
We human beings when we have a sense of enough we're free
For this reason meditators need a solid theme that they can hold to
If you don't know or haven't studied much Dhamma you can simply remember in brief that this body of ours is Dhamma
Every part of it is Dhamma
Conventional Dhammas formulated Dhammas all the way up to absolute Dhammas all can be found in this body
So we should pay attention to the body as it's actually present right here
When we know our own body we won't have any doubts about other people other bodies
So to give strength to the mind we should repeat to ourselves any of the meditation themes dealing with the body so that the mind will settle down and come to rest
If repeating buddho buddho is too refined for you  if you can't find anything to hold to or don't know where to focus  you can focus on the breath
It's blatant enough for you to fix your attention on it  when it comes in you know it's coming in when it goes out you know it's going out
Or if that's too refined you can focus on the parts of the body
If you want to focus on hair of the head repeat kesa kesa to yourself
You've seen head hairs you can remember them so fix the memory in your mind and then repeat kesa kesa
For hair of the body you can repeat loma loma and so on
Repeat the names of any of the parts until your awareness gathers in with the repetition and settles down into stillness
If you want you can focus on any one of the bones
Repeat atthi atthi
Where is the bone you're focusing on
It's really right there
What kinds of features does it have
It really has them  after all you've seen bones before
You can remember what the big bones and little bones are like
So call them to mind focus on them and repeat their names so as to build a firm foundation for concentration and mindfulness in the mind
Once your foundation is firm and steady from the practice of repetition you move on to investigation to insight meditation
You analyze these things to see them as aniccam or inconstant
Why does the Buddha say they're inconstant
We want them to be constant
We don't want them to change
The Buddha teaches us to let go of them but we can't let them go  because our views run contrary to the Dhamma
That's why we can't let go
The word let go here means that we don't hold onto them
Even though we still live with them we just live with them nothing more
Even though we make use of these things we simply use them nothing more
Even though we make the body move it's just movement
You have to keep this understanding in mind so that wrong views don't overwhelm you
So that delusion doesn't overwhelm you
As long as these things exist we make use of them
After all they're here to use
The Buddha and his noble disciples all made use of these things without any thought of their being anything other than what they are  that they might be constant that they might give rise to true pleasure that they might be us or ours We use these things in line with our duties as long as they're here for us to use
When they change into something else they change in line with their duties in line with the laws of the Dhamma
The Buddha thus taught us to familiarize ourselves with what's normal in life aging is normal illness is normal death is normal separation from the people and things we love is normal
When we analyze them we realize that they're all going to have to leave us
They won't stay with us forever
When even these five khandhas that we're looking after all the time aren't really ours how can our children really be ours
How can our parents really be ours
How can our possessions really be ours
They're all anatta notself
We train and exercise our minds in this way until they're adept in the same way that we memorize our lessons in school
Once they're firmly imbedded in the mind the mind won't go against the truth of the Dhamma
It will believe the truth of the Dhamma be inclined to follow the truth of the Dhamma
It won't suffer for it follows in line with the laws of truth
When we don't struggle against the truth of the Dhamma there won't be any sorrow or distress when things change for we've come to know and accept the truth
So all we have to do is come and know the truth
It doesn't lie far away
The things that will cure our sufferings the most important things that will help us cross over birth and becoming all come simply from making our knowledge of what's truly here firm and unwavering so that it can push the mind lift the mind over and above any influences that might come to make an impact on it  so that it will gain release from defilement release from sorrow release from distress
The meditation we're practicing here is simply for the purpose of knowing the truth as it actually is
As long as we haven't yet reached it we won't see it
When we don't see it all we know about it is news what we've read in books or heard on tapes or heard our teachers describe
That's simply news
The mind hasn't seen it
The ears have simply received it the eyes have simply taken it in from books but they're simply passive receptors holding it as labels and memories that's all
The reaching has to be done by the heart
The heart is what reaches the truth
And once the heart has reached it you don't have to worry
It'll be the heart's own treasure
So we have to train the heart to be intelligent so that it will gain true happiness true release from danger from suffering and stress
Practice so that your mind reaches it so that it will see it
At the moment it hasn't gotten there yet
So far it's all only in your ears and eyes
So we all have to put our hearts into the meditation
Focus on what's truly here so that the heart will reach the truth  the noble truths
Whatever suffering or stress is here in your body and mind is all part of the dukkha sacca the noble truth of stress
Whatever delusion passion or delight that depends on delusion  however much whatever the object within or without  is all samudaya sacca the noble truth of the origination of stress
All the things that we like that give rise to desire to the point of clinging when we get them we latch onto them
When we lose them we look for them again
When we don't have them we suffer
This is what makes the mind travel through all the levels of being great and small
In the teaching on dependent coarising the Buddha said that it all comes from not knowing
We don't discern contact don't discern feeling don't discern craving don't discern clinging don't discern becoming don't discern birth all of this is called avijja or unawareness
So do you discern these things yet or not
When sights strike the eye day in and day out is your mindfulness ready to handle them or not
Is your discernment up on the tricks of the defilements or not
If not you have to be observant to gather and restrict all your attention to what's right here for when defilements arise they arise right here
If discernment is to see the defilements to the point of giving rise to right view it'll have to see and know right here
If we gather and restrict our attention to what's right here we're sure to know and see
If we want to be mindful and alert we can't do it anywhere else
Remember this point well and put it into practice
When these words are spoken you hear them but when you get up you forget them
Then when the time comes to meditate again you don't know what to pick as your theme of practice
You forget everything throw it all away
So there's nothing but you  no Dhamma to know no Dhamma to see no Dhamma to put into practice
It's all you and yours your body and when the body is yours feelings are yours perceptions are yours thought constructs are yours consciousness is yours
So you get possessive of what's yours and there's nothing left to be Dhamma
That's why your practice doesn't progress
All progress has to come from a point of one Once one is firmly established then there can be two and three If one is lacking everything else will be lacking
Actually when we separate things out there is no two or three When we don't lump things together there's only one Even groups of ten or twenty people are all made up of one person  that one person this one person that one person over there
So in our practice we first have to establish one  this body of ours
What's here in the body
We have mental events and physical phenomena that's two
Then there's feeling pleasure pain neither pleasure nor pain that's three
When we separate things out there's lots of them but it's all this one person this one lump sitting here encased in skin
But when you analyze things out you have hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin Here it's already a lot
Then you can analyze the eye consciousness forms
It's a lot of things but all one thing one mass of suffering and stress
Nothing else
Just know this one thing until it's all clear
You don't have to know a lot of things just this one body
Once you really see the truth the mind will let go of its burdens
We suffer because we keep piling things on  That's us that's ours that's them that's theirs  through the power of attachment clinging to things not wanting them to change
When the mind starts meditating by mentally repeating its theme it can let things go for a while
You hold onto buddho or any of the other themes
You don't take refuge in the body
You take refuge in buddho buddho until the mind settles down
That gives you a greater sense of wellbeing than you could get from these other things
When you can let go even of this level of wellbeing you'll reach the real buddha
That's where there's purity that's where there's true wellbeing with no more need to go swimming through birth and death no more need to torment yourself by having to sit and meditate like this again  because there will be nothing to torment nothing to meditate on any more
When you let go of everything there are no more issues
So we meditate to give rise to the discernment that sees the drawbacks of things and lets go of them all
That's when there are no more burdens no more kamma
It sounds easy but you have to let go of everything
If you haven't let go of everything there's more kamma to do more work to do
So we're taught cago  renunciation patinissaggo  relinquishment mutti  release analayo  no place for the defilements to dwell
So
Keep on meditating
The edicts of King Asoka are a remarkable record of one of the most remarkable events in human history One man's efforts to rule an empire with a policy based on Dhamma
Asoka's policy had three prongs administration based on Dhamma instruction in Dhamma for the populace and personal practice of Dhamma by the ruler
The edicts are direct evidence of the second prong and for the most part present Dhamma as a series of moral principles and rational behavior that should be common to all religions
However a few of them are addressed to Buddhists in particular and one of them  the Bhabru Rock Edict  deals with themes that are of interest not only to historians but also to Buddhists of all times and places
It deals with what may be done to keep the True Dhamma alive for a long time and Asoka's recommendation is a list of passages from the Buddhist Canon that he says all Buddhists  ordained or not  should listen to and reflect on frequently
Here is the text of the edict
His Gracious Majesty King of Magadha bows down to the Sangha and  hoping that they are free from disease and living in peace  addresses them as follows You know well the extent of my reverence and faith in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
Whatever has been said by the Buddha has of course been wellsaid
But may I be permitted to point out the passages of scripture I have selected that the True Dhamma might last a long time Vinayasamukasa Aliyavasani Anagatabhayani Munigatha Mauneyasute Upatisapasine and the Instructions to Rahula beginning with falsehood as taught by the Blessed One
Reverend Sirs I would like the reverend bhikkhus and bhikkhunis  as well as the laymen and laywomen  to listen to these passages frequently and to ponder on them
For this reason Reverend Sirs I am having this enscribed so that they may know of my intention
As might be imagined this passage has given rise to a great deal of conjecture ever since it was deciphered in
Not the least of the questions is precisely which passages from the Canon Asoka is referring to or indeed if he was referring to a Canon anything like what we have today
Scholars have spilt a fair amount of ink sparring over the answer and have managed to reach a consensus on the identity of four of the passages the Aliyavasani is the Discourse on the Traditions of the Noble Ones the Anagatabhayani are the four discourses on Future Dangers the Munigatha is the Discourse on the Sage in the Sutta Nipata and the Instructions to Rahula are the CulaRahulovada Sutta
The other three passages have proven more intractable
A number of scholars have favored the Nalaka Sutta as the Mauneyasute  this in spite of the fact that there is a Moneyya Sutta in the Anguttara Nikaya
The Upatisapasine is problematic because there is no one passage of that name and because Sariputta asks so many questions in the Canon
Some scholars have proposed the Sariputta Sutta in the Sutta Nipata but archaeological evidence  votive tablets produced beginning with the time of Asoka and originating in the Buddhist pilgrim sites  show that Ven
Assaji's answer to Sariputta's first question about the doctrine the answer that sparked a vision of the Dhamma in Sariputta when he heard it has long been regarded as the ideal epitome of the Buddha's teachings
This tradition may have connections with this very edict
Ask any knowledgeable Buddhists today what Sariputta's most famous question was and they will in all likelihood answer with this one
As for the Vinayasamukase this has sparked the most fanciful conjectures because the single reference to this word in the Canon is buried in a book hardly anyone reads the Parivara
The reference itself says nothing more than that there are four vinayasamukkamsa  innate principles of the Vinaya  but the Commentary identifies them as the four Great Standards  most likely the four mentioned in the Mahavagga dealing specifically with Vinaya rather than the four in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta which deal with Dhamma and Vinaya together
This seems to settle the question of which passages Asoka was recommending but it raises another one Why these
And why in this order
Perhaps the best approach to answering these questions would be to read the passages and ponder on them as Asoka suggested
So here they are
Most of them are selfexplanatory except for the first on the innate principles of Vinaya and the poem on the sage which  being a poem  occasionally makes use of imagery that might be unfamiliar to a modern reader
Thus I include in the translation of The Sage a set of notes drawing mostly from the Commentary but also from other parts of the Canon and from works on ancient culture in general
As for the Innate Principles of the Vinaya the passage itself contains nothing unremarkable and it seems so obvious on first reading that one might wonder why anyone would call attention to it
Actually it is a fine example of the Buddha's farsightedness in setting up a system of teachings and rules
There are bound to be a number of things not touched on in the rules and this number is bound to grow as culture and technology change
An unenlightened approach to these changes would say either that anything not allowed is forbidden or that anything not explicitly forbidden is allowed
The Innate Principles of the Vinaya set forth a system of interpretation that avoids both of these extremes helping to ensure the long life of the Buddhas doctrine and discipline by setting guidelines for expanding the rules to cover new objects and situations as they arise
Otherwise as CvVII
states disagreements over what is and is not allowable can become grounds for a schism in the Sangha
And as AN
states schism within the Sangha is a major cause for the True Dhammas decline and disappearance
The Commentaries tell us that the Sangha became split during Asokas reign and his Sarnath edict gives detailed instructions on how to deal with potential schismatics in the Sangha
Given that Asoka  or his monastic advisers  saw schism as an immediate and present danger it is small wonder that he would begin his list of recommended passages with a pragmatic guide immediately applicable to promoting harmony in the Sangha and through that harmony to the long life of the True Dhamma
Now at that time uncertainty arose in the monks with regard to this and that item Now what is allowed by the Blessed One
What is not allowed They told this matter to the Blessed One
Bhikkhus whatever I have not objected to saying 'This is not allowable' if it fits in with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable this is not allowable for you
Whatever I have not objected to saying 'This is not allowable' if it fits in with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable this is allowable for you
And whatever I have not permitted saying 'This is allowable' if it fits in with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable this is not allowable for you
And whatever I have not permitted saying 'This is allowable' if it fits in with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable this is allowable for you

And furthermore a monk endowed with these four traditions of the Noble Ones if he lives in the east conquers displeasure and is not conquered by displeasure
If he lives in the west the north the south he conquers displeasure and is not conquered by displeasure
Why is that
Because the wise one endures both pleasure and displeasure
This is what the Blessed One said
Having said this he said further

Monks there are these three forms of sagacity
Which three
Bodily sagacity verbal sagacity and mental sagacity
And what is bodily sagacity
There is the case where a monk abstains from taking life abstains from theft abstains from unchastity
This is called bodily sagacity
And what is verbal sagacity
There is the case where a monk abstains from lying abstains from divisive talebearing abstains from harsh language abstains from idle chatter
This is called verbal sagacity
And what is mental sagacity
There is the case where a monk who  with the wasting away of the mental fermentations  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and now
This is called mental sagacity
These monks are the three forms of sagacity
Now at that time the wanderer Sanjaya was residing in Rajagaha with a large company of wanderers  in all
And at that time Sariputta and Moggallana were practicing the holy life under Sanjaya
They had made this agreement Whoever attains the Deathless first will inform the other
Then Ven
Assaji arising early in the morning taking his robe and bowl entered Rajagaha for alms Gracious in the way he approached and departed looked forward and behind drew in and stretched out his arm his eyes downcast his every movement consummate
Sariputta the wanderer saw Ven
Assaji going for alms in Rajagaha gracious his eyes downcast his every movement consummate
On seeing him the thought occurred to him Surely of those in this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship this is one
What if I were to approach him and question him 'On whose account have you gone forth
Who is your teacher
In whose Dhamma do you delight' But then the thought occurred to Sariputta the wanderer This is the wrong time to question him
He is going for alms in the town
What if I were to follow behind this monk who has found the path for those who seek it
Then Ven
Assaji having gone for alms in Rajagaha left taking the alms he had received
Sariputta the wanderer approached him and on arrival having exchanged friendly greetings and engaged in polite conversation stood to one side
As he stood there he said Your faculties are bright my friend your complexion pure and clear
On whose account have you gone forth
Who is your teacher
In whose Dhamma do you delight
There is my friend the Great Contemplative a son of the Sakyans gone forth from a Sakyan family
I have gone forth on account of that Blessed One
That Blessed One is my teacher
It is in that Blessed One's Dhamma that I delight
But what is your teacher's teaching
What does he proclaim''
I am new my friend not long gone forth only recently come to this doctrine and discipline
I cannot explain the doctrine in detail but I can give you the gist in brief
Then Sariputta the wanderer spoke thus to the Ven
Assaji
Then Ven
Assaji gave this Dhamma exposition to Sariputta the Wanderer
Then to Sariputta the Wanderer as he heard this Dhamma exposition there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
Then Sariputta the wanderer went to where Moggallana the wanderer was staying
Moggallana the wanderer saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said Your faculties are bright my friend your complexion pure and clear
Could it be that you have attained the Deathless
Yes my friend I have attained the Deathless

But how friend did you attain the Deathless
Just now friend I saw Ven
Assaji going for alms in Rajagaha gracious in the way he approached and departed looked forward and behind drew in and stretched out his arm his eyes downcast his every movement consummate
On seeing him the thought occurred to me 'Surely of those in this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship this is one
What if I were to approach him and question him On whose account have you gone forth
Who is your teacher
In whose Dhamma do you delight'
But then the thought occurred to me 'This is the wrong time to question him
He is going for alms in the town
What if I were to follow behind this monk who has found the path for those who seek it'
Then Ven
Assaji having gone for alms in Rajagaha left taking the alms he had received
I approached him and on arrival having exchanged friendly greetings and engaged in polite conversation stood to one side
As I stood there I said 'Your faculties are bright my friend your complexion pure and clear
On whose account have you gone forth
Who is your teacher
In whose Dhamma do you delight'
'There is my friend the Great Contemplative a son of the Sakyans gone forth from a Sakyan family
I have gone forth on account of that Blessed One
That Blessed One is my teacher
It is in that Blessed One's Dhamma that I delight'
'But what is your teacher's teaching
What does he proclaim'
'I am new my friend not long gone forth only recently come to this doctrine and discipline
I cannot explain the doctrine to you in detail but I can give you the gist in brief'
Then Ven
Assaji gave me this Dhamma exposition
Then to Moggallana the wanderer as he heard this Dhamma exposition there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Rajagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Feeding Ground
At that time Ven
Rahula was staying at the Mango Stone
Then the Blessed One arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to where Ven
Rahula was staying at the Mango Stone
Ven
Rahula saw him coming from afar and on seeing him set out a seat and water for washing the feet
The Blessed One sat down on the seat set out and having sat down washed his feet
Ven
Rahula bowing down to the Blessed One sat to one side
Then the Blessed One having left a little bit of water in the water dipper said to Ven
Rahula Rahula do you see this little bit of leftover water remaining in the water dipper
Yes sir
That's how little of a contemplative there is in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie
Having tossed away the little bit of leftover water the Blessed One said to Ven
Rahula Rahula do you see how this little bit of leftover water is tossed away
Yes sir
Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away just like that
Having turned the water dipper upside down the Blessed One said to Ven
Rahula Rahula do you see how this water dipper is turned upside down
Yes sir
Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is turned upside down just like that
Having turned the water dipper rightside up the Blessed One said to Ven
Rahula Rahula do you see how empty and hollow this water dipper is
Yes sir
Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is empty and hollow just like that
Rahula it's like a royal elephant immense pedigreed accustomed to battles its tusks like chariot poles
Having gone into battle it uses its forefeet and hind feet its forequarters and hindquarters its head and ears and tusks and tail but will simply hold back its trunk
The elephant trainer notices that and thinks 'This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king' But when the royal elephant having gone into battle uses its forefeet and hind feet its forequarters and hindquarters its head and ears and tusks and tail and his trunk the trainer notices that and thinks 'This royal elephant has given up its life to the king
There is nothing it will not do'
The same holds true with anyone who feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie There is no evil I tell you he will not do
Thus Rahula you should train yourself 'I will not tell a deliberate lie even in jest'
What do you think Rahula What is a mirror for
For reflection sir
In the same way Rahula bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions are to be done with repeated reflection
Whenever you want to perform a bodily action you should reflect on it 'This bodily action I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results then any bodily action of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do
But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then any bodily action of that sort is fit for you to do
While you are performing a bodily action you should reflect on it 'This bodily action I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it up
But if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with it
Having performed a bodily action you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life
Having confessed it you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful training day and night in skillful mental qualities
Whenever you want to perform a verbal action you should reflect on it 'This verbal action I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful verbal action with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful verbal action with painful consequences painful results then any verbal action of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do
But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful verbal action with happy consequences happy results then any verbal action of that sort is fit for you to do
While you are performing a verbal action you should reflect on it 'This verbal action I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful verbal action with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both you should give it up
But if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with it
Having performed a verbal action you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful verbal action with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life
Having confessed it you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful verbal action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful training day and night in skillful mental qualities
Whenever you want to perform a mental action you should reflect on it 'This mental action I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful mental action with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful mental action with painful consequences painful results then any mental action of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do
But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful mental action with happy consequences happy results then any mental action of that sort is fit for you to do
While you are performing a mental action you should reflect on it 'This mental action I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful mental action with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both you should give it up
But if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with it
Having performed a mental action you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful mental action with painful consequences painful results then you should feel distressed ashamed and disgusted with it
Feeling distressed you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful mental action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful training day and night in skillful mental qualities
Rahula all those contemplatives and brahmans in the course of the past who purified their bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions did it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions in just this way
All those contemplatives and brahmans in the course of the future who will purify their bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions will do it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions in just this way
All those contemplatives and brahmans at present who purify their bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions do it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions and mental actions in just this way
Therefore Rahula you should train yourself 'I will purify my bodily actions through repeated reflection
I will purify my verbal actions through repeated reflection
I will purify my mental actions through repeated reflection' That is how you should train yourself
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Rahula delighted in the Blessed One's words
Whether King Asoka selected these texts on his own or had the advice of his mentor Ven
Moggaliputtatissa no one knows
Still it is possible to derive from them a conception of Dhamma of which Asoka approved whether or not it originated with him
One of the main points of this selection is that Dhamma is a quality of a person rather than of doctrines or ideas
The central passage in the selection and its only extended poem  The Sage  paints an idealized picture of the Dhamma as embodied in the deeds words and attitudes of the person who practices it
Only if the Dhamma finds concrete expression in people's lives will it last
The selection also shows something of the educational strategy Asoka might have had his Dhamma officials use in teaching his populace  Buddhist and nonBuddhist  to make the Dhamma a reality in their lives
The texts are not listed in random order
Instead they follow a pattern to impress on their listeners first that the ideals of the Dhamma are timeless and welltested and that there is a need to realize them as quickly as possible
Then they analyze the ideal present a picture of it in action and end with the basic principles for putting it into practice
The title of the first passage  the Vinaya samukase  is explained in the Commentary as follows Samukase means that the principles are innately true established of their own accord
Whether or not a Buddha arises to point them out they are true in and of themselves
The second passage The Traditions of the Noble Ones brings in the perspective of time that is to provide a recurring theme throughout Asoka's selections
It looks back to the past to show how venerable timetested and pure the traditions of the Dhamma are
It plays on the notion of the traditions of a noble family  unadulterated not open to criticism or suspicion  that were so important in ancient India
It even plays on words The traditions of a family were supposed to enable those who followed them to conquer their enemies while the noble traditions taught by the Buddha enable one to overcome one's true enemy displeasure in the mind
Turning from the past to look at the future the third set of selections  the four discourses on future dangers  presents a warning
The practice of the Dhamma should not be put off to a later date because there is no certainty that the future will provide any opportunities for practice
First there are the dangers of death aging illness famine and social turmoil in one's own life
Secondly there are the dangers of degeneracy in the religion when those who are supposed to practice it ignore the noble traditions and teachings and instead do many unseemly inappropriate things simply for the sake of material comfort
The point of this set of passages of course is to give a sense of urgency to one's practice so that one will make the effort to take advantage of the teachings while one can
The Sage taking up the theme of danger goes on to present an ideal of inner safety in the present tense an ideal already embodied in the lives of those who have practiced the religion in full
It shows the actions and attitudes of one who finds his happiness not in relationships  and the homebuilding and foodraising they entail  but instead in the peace that comes in living a solitary life subsisting on whatever food one may receive as alms free to meditate in the wilderness
The next passage  Sagacity  analyzes this ideal into three qualities of body speech and mind and the sixth passage shows the ideal in action Ven
Assaji simply by the graciousness of his manner inspires Sariputta the wanderer to follow him and with a few wellchosen words he enables Sariputta to gain a glimpse of the Deathless
This is thus no empty ideal
This passage also contains what has long been recognized as the most succinct expression of the Four Noble Truths  suffering its cause its cessation and the path to its cessation  just as the discourse on Sagacity contains one of the most succinct expressions of the goal of training one's actions in body speech and mind
The final passage shows how this goal may be brought about focusing on the development of two qualities  truthfulness and constant reflection  that underlie every stage of the practice
Although the earlier passages focus on the monk as the ideal this one shows that the practice builds on qualities that anyone  lay or monastic man woman or child  can develop within
It also ends with a return to the theme of time and the timelessness of the Dhamma Whoever in the past future or present develops purity  or sagacity  in thought word or deed will have to do it in this way and this way only
There is no other
It is possible to search in Asoka's selection for passages that may have had personal meaning for him  the reference to the Deathless as the Sorrowless state the image of the peacock the emblem of his dynasty the image of the elephant who has given its life up to the king  but he himself would probably have preferred that Buddhists reflect on these selections to see what passages have meaning for them
The fact that the Dhamma is alive today is due in no small measure to his efforts
Buddhists today can carry on his work by doing as he asked Reading and reflecting often on these selections and consistently applying the principles of truthfulness and selfexamination to their own lives
 Knowing the Dhamma means knowing the truth
Where does the Dhamma lie
Not far off at all
Where are rupadhammas
Are there any physical phenomena within us
Are any namadhammas within us
They're both within us but we don't know how to read them to decipher them because we haven't yet studied them
Or even when we have tried to study them we still can't decipher them in line with the standards set by the Buddha
So let's try to decipher our body our actions in thought word and deed
Our actions don't lie anywhere else
They show themselves in the activity of the body
So we use the body in line with the Dhamma abstaining from the activities that defile it killing stealing engaging in illicit sex
When we abstain from these things we've begun practicing the Dhamma
We abstain from telling lies from divisive speech from abusive speech from idle chatter
When we're mindful to show restraint in what we say we won't encounter any dangers coming from our speech
There are no dangers when we practice in line with the Buddha's way
As for the mind we cleanse it by meditating
We use mindfulness to look after the heart to make sure it doesn't get involved in anything defiling or unclean
We keep it cheerful blooming and bright in its meditation in investigating the Dhamma knowing the Dhamma seeing the Dhamma until it settles down in the stillness that we've developed and kept composed
We keep it blooming and bright
Wherever you go this is how you should practice
Make your composure continuous
The mind will then gain strength so that it can let go of its external preoccupations and stay focused exclusively within at peace and at ease bright and clear staying right here
Then when you want to gain discernment you can investigate
Focus mindfulness on keeping the body in mind and then investigate it
This is called dhammavicaya investigating phenomena
You investigate the physical phenomena in the body to see them in line with the four noble truths
You look at the arising of physical phenomena right here
You look at the aging the illness the death of phenomena right here within you
If you really look for it you'll see that the body is full of death
How do we see death when the body is still breathing and able to walk around
We can see it if our discernment is subtle and precise
The Buddha saw death with every inandout breath so why can't we
He once asked Ven
Ananda how often he paid attention to death in the course of a day and Ananda answered One hundred times The Buddha's response was You're still too complacent
You should pay attention to death with every inandout breath What kind of death can you look at with every inandout breath
Whatever fades away ends and disappears that's death
As for the death of the whole body that comes closer every day closer with each inandout breath
This runs down that wears out
We have to keep creating things to replace what gets worn out
And whatever we create keeps wearing out too
So we should keep track of the wearing out  what's called vayadhamma degeneration
The Buddha saw this with every moment
This is the sort of seeing that allows us to see the noble truth that birth is stressful aging is stressful
There's no ease in aging
Look so that you see this clearly
Pain and illness are stressful death is stressful all the affairs that come with birth create hardships turmoil and stress
When you investigate in line with the Buddha's Dhamma you'll see the truth for yourself in every way just as the Buddha did
For it's all right here
You'll gain discernment and intelligence no longer deluded into grasping hold of suffering and making it your self no longer grasping hold of inconstant things and making them your self
Whatever's inconstant leave it as inconstant and don't make it you
Whatever's stressful leave it as stressful and don't make it you
There's no you in any of those things
When you aim your investigation in the direction of seeing this clearly the mind will let go and attain peace inner solitude free from clinging
It's as when we carry something heavy on our shoulder
We know it's heavy because it's weighing on our shoulder
But when we put it down it's no longer heavy on us
In the same way when we see that birth is stressful aging is stressful illness is stressful death is stressful then we should examine those things as they arise to see that they're not us
Then we'll be able to let them go
We should look after our mind to make sure that it doesn't give rise to the assumption that any of those things are us or ours or that they lie within us
Those things are just objects elements and we leave them at that
Stress then has no owner on the receiving end
It's just like when you put down a burden there's nothing heavy about it at all
So stress is nothing more than things coming together to make contact
Suppose that we have a big hunk of limestone
When we lift it up it's heavy
But if we burn it in a fire pound it into dust and the wind blows it away then where's the heaviness
It's nowhere at all
Before when the limestone was still in the ground they had to use explosives to get it out
It was so heavy that they needed cranes to lift it up
But now that it's pulverized the heaviness is gone
It's the same with suffering and stress
If we investigate them down to the details so that we can see them clearly for what they truly are there's no self there at all
We get down to the basic elements of experience and we see that they're not our self in the least little bit
If we look at the hair of the head it's not self
Fingernails and toenails are not self
Look at every part of the body in detail
Or look at its elementary properties
Exactly where are you in any of those things
There's no you in there at all
The same is true when you look at feelings
There's no you in there at all
There's simply contact the contact of objects against the senses that's all
If you let go so the mind can come to rest none of these things will touch it in a way that weighs on it
Only deluded people grab hold of these things which is why they feel weighed down
If we let them go we don't feel weighed down at all
When we let go of the aggregates they're not stressful
But we don't know how to let them go because of birth
Like the mental state you've given rise to here you've created it so that it will take birth
Once you've given rise to it then  unless you're given a good reason  there's no way you'll be willing to let it go
It's the same as when someone suddenly comes to chase us out of our home
Who would be willing to go
We'd go only if we were offered a better place to stay  a safer more comfortable place to stay
If we were offered such a place who would be willing to stay
If we had a better place to go we could abandon our old home with no problem
In the same way if we're going to let go of the blatant aggregates we need a better place to stay a home for the mind a state of concentration
Just like the Buddha and his noble disciples when they let go of the blatant aggregates they entered cessation they entered jhana
When they fully let go of all aggregates they entered nibbana
We however don't yet have anything else to depend on which is why we can't let go
We first have to create a refuge for ourselves
At the very least we should try to keep buddho buddho in mind
When we really reach buddho  when the mind is really a mind awake  then we can depend on it
At the moment though we haven't reached the mind awake
We've reached nothing but the demons of defilement and they keep haunting us
We're embroiled with nothing but demons we lie under their power
For instance maccumara the demon of death whose followers  aging and illness  we fear so much
Kilesamara delusions and defilements
These are all demons
Khandhamara our attachments to the five aggregates are all demons
Abhisankharamara the thoughts we create good or bad are all demons if we fall for them  meritorious creations demeritorious creations imperturbable creations
These are the subtle demons the demons that bedeviled the Buddha on the way to Awakening dressing themselves up as this and that
If we're going to let go of these things we first need something better to hold onto
At the very least we need jhana levels of mental stillness more refined than what we have at present
So we should all try to give rise to the refined levels of peace and ease I've mentioned here
When we get disenchanted with turmoil we can enter a state of stillness
When we get disenchanted with defilement we can cleanse the heart and make it bright with the Dhamma
We'll have our home in the Dhamma in concentration
The heart can then delight with rapture and ease as its food
We'll have no desire for coarse food
When we let go of the blatant aggregates we enter the Brahma level of refined rapture and ease
Even the sensual devas don't eat coarse food like ours
As for the Brahmas they're even clearer than that more radiant within themselves
Their jhana is pure and their concentration radiant
The food of this concentration is the rapture and ease they experience
Even here on the human level when we gain rapture from concentration we feel full and happy
If we abandon the blatant aggregates leaving just the mind in its attainment of concentration imagine how much pleasure and ease there will be
We'll no longer have to be involved in these heavy burdens of ours
We won't have to worry about the five or the eight precepts because we'll be in a pure state of jhana with no thought of getting stuck on anything defiling
The mind will be bright
When you understand this focus back on your heart
Examine it carefully
Be intent on practicing heedfully and you'll meet with prosperity and ease
In general terms Right Concentration means establishing the mind rightly
On one level this can apply to all the factors of the path
You have to start out by setting the mind on Right View
In other words you use your discernment to gather together all the Dhamma you've heard
Then when you set the mind on Right Resolve that's also a way of establishing it rightly
Then you set it on Right Speech speaking only things that are right
You set it on Right Action examining your actions and then forcing yourself watching over yourself to keep your actions firmly in line with what's right
As for Right Livelihood you set your mind on providing for your livelihood exclusively in a right way
You're firm in not making a livelihood in ways that are wrong not acting in ways that are wrong not speaking in ways that are corrupt and wrong
You won't make any effort in ways that go off the path you won't be mindful in ways that lie outside the path
You'll keep being mindful in ways that stay on the path
You make this vow to yourself as a firm determination
This is one level of establishing the mind rightly
But what I want to talk about today is Right Concentration in the area of meditation in other words Right Meditation both in the area of tranquillity meditation and in the area of insight meditation
You use the techniques of tranquillity meditation to bring the mind to stillness
When you make the mind still firm in skillful qualities that's one aspect of Right Concentration
If the mind isn't firmly established in skillful qualities it can't grow still
If unskillful qualities arise in the mind it can't settle down and enter concentration
This is why when the Buddha describes the mind entering concentration he says Vivicceva kamehi Quite secluded from sensual preoccupations
The mind isn't involved doesn't incline itself toward sights that will give rise to infatuation and desire
It doesn't incline itself toward sounds that it likes toward aromas tastes or tactile sensations for which it feels infatuation through the power of desire
At the same time it doesn't incline itself toward desire for those things
Before the mind can settle into concentration it has to let go of these five types of preoccupations
This is called vivicceva kamehi quite secluded from sensual preoccupations
Vivicca akusalehi dhammehi quite secluded from the unskillful qualities called the five Hindrances
For example the first Hindrance is sensual desire
When you sit in meditation and a defilement arises in the mind when you think of something and feel desire for an internal or an external form when you get infatuated with the things you've seen and known in the past that's called sensual desire
Or if you think of something that makes you dissatisfied to the point of feeling ill will for certain people or objects that's the Hindrance of ill will
Things from the past that upset you suddenly arise again in the present barge their way in to obstruct the stillness of your mind
When the mind gets upset in this way that's an unskillful mental state acting as an obstacle to concentration
Or sloth and torpor a sense of laziness and inattentiveness when the mind isn't intent on its work and so lets go out of laziness and carelessness
It gets drowsy so that it can't be intent on its meditation
You sit here thinking buddho buddho but instead of focusing the mind to get it firmly established so that it can gain knowledge and understanding from its buddho you throw buddho away to go play with something else
As awareness gets more refined you get drowsy and fall asleep or else let delusion overcome the mind
This is an unskillful mental state called sloth and torpor
Then there's restlessness and anxiety when mindfulness isn't keeping control over things and the mind follows its preoccupations as they shoot out to things you like and don't like
The normal state of people's minds is that when mindfulness isn't in charge the mind can't sit still
It's bound to keep thinking about different kinds of things
So when you're practicing concentration you have to exercise restraint you have to be careful that the mind doesn't get scattered about
You have to be mindful of the present and alert to the present too
When you try to keep buddho in mind you have to be alert at the same time to watch over your buddho
Or if you're going to be mindful of the parts of the body  like hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin  you should focus on only one part at a time making sure that you're both mindful and alert to your mindfulness to make sure you don't go being mindful of other things
That's how you can cut off restlessness and anxiety
As you keep being mindful of the same thing for a long time the body will gradually calm down and relax
The preoccupations of the mind will calm down too so that the mind can grow still
It grows still because you keep it under control
You weaken its unruliness  as when you pull fuel away from a burning fire
As you keep pulling away the fuel the fire gradually grows weaker and weaker
And what's the fuel for the mind's unruliness
Forgetfulness
Inattentiveness
This inattentiveness is the fuel both for restlessness and anxiety and for sloth and torpor
When you keep mindfulness and alertness in charge you cut away forgetfulness and inattentiveness
As these forms of delusion are subdued they lose their power
They gradually disband leaving nothing but awareness of buddho or whatever your meditation object is
As you keep looking after your meditation object firmly without growing inattentive restlessness will disappear
Drowsiness will disappear
The mind will get firmly established in Right Concentration
This is how you enter Right Concentration
You have to depend on both mindfulness and alertness together
Right Concentration can't simply arise on its own
It needs supporting factors
The first seven factors of the path are the supporters for Right Concentration or its requisites the things it needs to depend on
It needs Right View Right Resolve Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort and Right Mindfulness
As you keep developing the beginning factors of the path concentration becomes more and more refined step by step
When the mind is trained and suffused with these qualities it's able to let go of sensual preoccupations able to let go of unskillful mental qualities
Vivicceva kamehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi
When it's secluded from sensual preoccupations secluded from unskillful qualities it can enter concentration
It experiences stillness rapture pleasure singleness of preoccupation
Both body and mind feel light
In the first stage the mind isn't totally refined because it still has directed thought and evaluation in the factors of its concentration
If your mindfulness is in good shape and can keep its object in mind without pulling away if your effort is right and alertness keeps watching over things the coarser parts of your concentration will drop away and the mind will grow more refined step by step
Directed thought and evaluation  the coarser parts  will drop away because they can't follow into that more refined stage
All that's left is rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
As you keep on meditating without letup things keep growing more refined step by step
Rapture which is coarser than pleasure will drop away leaving the pleasure
Pleasure is coarser than equanimity
As you keep contemplating while the mind grows more refined the pleasure will disappear leaving just equanimity
As long as there's still pleasure equanimity can't arise
As long as the mind is still feeding off pleasure it's still engaged with something coarse
But as you keep up your persistent effort until you see that this pleasure still comes under the Three Characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself that it's part of the aggregate of feeling the mind will let go of that coarser aspect and settle down with equanimity
Even though equanimity too is part of the feeling aggregate it's a feeling refined enough to cleanse the mind to the point where it can give rise to knowledge of refined levels of Dhamma
When the mind reaches this level it's firm and unwavering because it's totally neutral
It doesn't waver when the eye sees a form the ear hears a sound the nose smells an aroma the tongue tastes a flavor the body feels a tactile sensation or an idea comes to the mind
None of these things can make the mind waver when it's in the factors of jhana
It maintains a high level of purity
This is Right Concentration
We should all develop tranquillity meditation which can give temporary respite from suffering and stress
But in a state like this you simply have mindfulness in charge
Discernment is still too weak to uproot the most refined levels of defilement and latent tendencies
Thus for our Right Concentration to be complete we're taught not to get carried away with the sense of pleasure it brings
When the mind has been still for an appropriate amount of time we should then apply the mind to contemplating the five aggregates for these aggregates are the basis for insight meditation
You can't develop insight meditation outside of the five aggregates  the aggregates of form feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousness  for these aggregates lie right within us
They're right next to us with us at all times
So
How do you develop the aggregate of form as a basis for insight meditation
You have to see it clearly in line with its truth that form is inconstant
This is how you begin
As you develop insight meditation you have to contemplate down to the details
What is form
Form covers hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin and all the four great elements that we can touch and see
As for subsidiary forms they can't be seen with the eye but they can be touched and they depend on the four great elements
For example sound is a type of form a type of subsidiary form
Aromas flavors tactile sensations are subsidiary forms that depend on the four great elements
The sensory powers of the eye ear nose tongue and body are subsidiary forms  they're physical events not mental events you know
Then there are masculinity and femininity which fashion the body to be male or female and create differences in male and female voices manners and other characteristics
Then there's the heart and then viññatirupa which allows for the body to move for speech to be spoken
So the Buddha taught that we should contemplate form in all its aspects so as to gain the insight enabling us to withdraw all our clinging assumptions that they're us or ours
How does this happen
When we contemplate we'll see that yam kiñci rupam atitanagatapaccuppannam all form  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is inconstant stressful and notself
It all lies under the Three Characteristics
When we remember this that's called pariyattidhamma the Dhamma of study
When we actually take things apart and contemplate them one by one to the point where we gain true knowledge and vision that's called the practice of insight meditation the discernment arising in line with the way things actually are
This is a short explanation of insight meditation focused just on the aggregate of form
As for feeling  the pleasures pains and feelings of neither pleasure nor pain within us  once we've truly seen form we'll see that the same things apply to feeling
It's inconstant
When it's inconstant it'll have to make us undergo suffering and stress because of that inconstancy
We'll be piling suffering on top of suffering
Actually there's no reason why the mind should suffer from these things but we still manage to make ourselves suffer because of them
Even though they're notself there's suffering because we don't know
There's inconstancy because we don't know
Unless we develop insight meditation to see clearly and know truly we won't be able to destroy the subtle latent tendency of ignorance the latent tendency of becoming the latent tendency of sensuality within ourselves
But if we're able to develop insight meditation to the point where we see form clearly in terms of the Three Characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself then disenchantment will arise
When the latent tendencies of ignorance and becoming are destroyed the latent tendency of sensuality will have no place to stand
There's nothing it can fabricate for there's no delusion
When ignorance disbands fabrications disband
When fabrications disband all the suffering that depends on fabrication will have to disband as well
This is why we should practice meditation in line with the factors of the noble eightfold path as set down by the Buddha
To condense it even further there are three trainings virtue concentration and discernment
Virtue  exercising restraint over our words and deeds  is part of the path
tranquillity meditation and insight meditation come under concentration
So virtue concentration and discernment cover the path
Or if you want to condense things even further there are physical phenomena and mental phenomena  ie the body and mind
When we correctly understand the characteristics of the body we'll see into the ways the body and mind are interrelated
Then we'll be able to separate them out
We'll see what's notself and what isn't notself
Things in and of themselves aren't notself for they each have an inandofthemselves
It's not the case that there's nothing there at all
If there were nothing there at all how would there be contact
Think about it
Take the fire element who could destroy it
Even though it's notself it's got an inandofitself
The same holds true with the other elements
In other words these things still exist simply that there's no more clinging
So I ask that you understand this and then put it correctly into practice so as to meet with happiness and progress
That's enough explanation for now
Keep on meditating until the time is up
Survey your body
Survey your mind
You've been practicing meditation continuously so even if your mind isn't yet quiet even though it hasn't reached a level of concentration as solid as you'd like it to be meditation is still a skillful activity in terms of developing conviction developing persistence
At the very least it will give results on the sensory level making you an intelligent person at the same time developing the perfections of your character on into the future
So try not to get discouraged
Don't let yourself think that you haven't seen any results from your meditation
When you come right down to it what do you want from your meditation
You meditate to make the mind quiet and the mind becomes quiet from letting go
That's what the meditation is letting go
If you meditate in order to get something that's craving the cause of suffering
Meditation isn't an affair of craving
The Dhamma is already here so all we have to do is study it so that we'll know the truth
The truth isn't something new
It's something that's been here from time immemorial
All the Buddhas of the past have awakened to this very same Dhamma this very same truth
Even though the cosmos has changed from one aeon to another the Dhamma hasn't changed along with the cosmos
No matter which aeon a particular Buddha was born in he awakened to the same old truth
He taught the same old truth
The same Dhamma the same truth is always right here all the time
It's simply that we don't recognize it
We haven't studied it down to its elemental properties
All I ask is that you be intent on studying it
The truth is always the truth
It's always present
The truth the Buddha taught starts with the principle that stressandsuffering is a truth
Do you have any stress and suffering
Examine yourself carefully
Is there any stress and suffering within you
Or is there none at all
As long as there's suffering within you the truth of the noble truths taught by the Buddha is still there
When you're mindful to keep your eye on the suffering appearing within you you're studying the truth in line with what it actually is
But in addition to pointing out the truth of suffering the Buddha also taught the path to the end of suffering
This too is a truth
The Buddha has guaranteed that when we develop it in full measure we'll gain release from stress and suffering
It's not the case that suffering is the only truth that we have to lie buried in stress and suffering
The Buddha found a way out of suffering like an intelligent doctor who not only understands diseases but also knows a miraculous medicine to cure them
This is why the truth of the path is so important for many many people who have put it into practice have gotten results
The truth of the path is something we put into practice to gain release from suffering  as we chanted just now
Ye dukkham nappajanati
Those who don't discern suffering
Atho dukkhassa sambhavam
Suffering's cause
Tañca maggam na janati
Who don't understand the path
Dukkhupasamagaminam
The way to the stilling of suffering
Te ve jatijarupaga
They'll return to birth and aging again
If we don't comprehend suffering and the way to the end of suffering we'll have to experience birth aging and death which are the causes not only of suffering but also of the craving leading to more suffering
We should take joy in the fact that we have all the noble truths we need
We have suffering and the path to the end of suffering doesn't lie far away
When we look into the texts we find that the Buddha and his noble disciples didn't practice anything far away
They purified the actions of their bodies and minds
They did this by knowing their own bodies and minds in line with what they actually were
When we don't know our own bodies and minds as they actually are that's a cause of suffering
When we practice knowing our own bodies our own minds as they actually are that's the path to release from suffering
Aside from this there's no path at all
We already have a body
We already have a mind  this knowing property
So we take this knowing property and put it to use by studying the body in line with its three characteristics aniccata inconstancy dukkhata stressfulness and anattata notselfnessness
Inconstancy and stressfulness lie on the side of suffering and its cause
We have to study things that are inconstant in order to see who they are who's responsible for them who really owns them
This issue of inconstancy is really important
Rupam aniccam form is inconstant
Who owns the form
Rupam dukkham form is stressful
Who's on the receiving end of the stress
Stress is something that has to depend on causes and conditions in order to arise
It doesn't come on its own
Just like sound we have to depend on contact in order to hear it
If there's no contact we won't know where there's any sound
In the same way stress depends on contact
If there's no contact we won't know where there's any stress
If stress and suffering were able to burn us all on their own the Buddha would never have been able to gain release from them
There would be no way for us to practice for no matter what suffering would keep on burning us all on its own
But the fact of the matter is that when we practice we can gain relief from suffering because suffering isn't built into the mind it's not built into this knowing property
It has to depend on contact through the sense media in order for it to arise
This is why sages study the truth
As when we chant
Ayam kho me kayo
This body of mine
Uddham padatala
From the soles of the feet on up
Adho kesamatthaka
From the crown of the head on down
Tacapariyanto
Surrounded by skin
Within this body we have all five aggregates form feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousness
Form is the coarsest of the aggregates for we can touch it with our hand and see it with our eyes
As for feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousness they're mental phenomena
Even though we can't touch them with the body we can still know them and experience them
For instance we constantly have feelings of pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain
Perception we remember things and label them
Thoughtfabrication creates thoughts and consciousness notices things
We all notice things label them fabricate thoughts about them and experience pleasure and pain because of them
The primary issue is the form of the body
The Buddha taught us to study it in order to know the noble truths in both form and mental phenomena
When he taught that birth is suffering aging is suffering death is suffering he was referring to the birth aging and death right here at the form where the five aggregates meet  this form we already have
And yet most of us don't like to reflect on the truth of these things
We think that birth is pleasurable
We get pleasure and stress all confused
It's because we don't realize the truth of these things that we don't search for a way out
The Buddha however knew this truth which was why he practiced contemplating it
He tested to see if birth is pleasurable by noticing if the mind could stay quiet with birth Are there any pains
Anything disturbing the mind
And what's paining and disturbing the mind aside from the birth the arising of things It's because of the birth of the body that we have to keep finding food for it requisites to keep it going
Greed anger and delusion arise because of birth
And once there's birth there's aging deterioration wearing down wearing down all the time
Whatever we get runs out runs out every day wears down every day
The Buddha awakened to the truth that birth isn't pleasurable at all
The only pleasure is when if we get hungry we eat enough to make the hunger go away for a little while
But soon we get hungry again
When we get hot out in the sun we take cover in the shade to cool down a bit but then we start feeling hot again
When we get tired we rest
But then if we lie down for a long time we start feeling stiff
If we walk for a long time we get weary
When this is the way things are the mind can't find any peace or rest
It gets disturbed and gives rise to defilement because of birth
And that's not the end of it
Once birth takes place it's followed by aging and deterioration
No matter how much you look after the body it won't stay with you
In the end it all falls apart
And once it dies there's no one who can stay in charge of it
If we come to our senses only at that point and realize only when it's already dead that it has to die it's too late to do anything about it
But if we gain conviction in these truths now in the present before death comes we won't be complacent about our youth or life
If we can be mindful at all times that death is inevitable that  even though we may be as strong as a bull elephant  a disease could come along at any time and oppress us to the point where we can't even sit up can't do anything to help ourselves when we realize this we're said not to be complacent in our health
Then we can act in ways truly benefiting ourselves providing us with the refuge we'll need when we can no longer take refuge in our youth health or life
Wherever you look in the body you see it wearing down
Wherever you look you see diseases
Wherever you look you see things that are unclean
Nothing at all in the body is really strong or lasting
When you see this clearly you'll no longer be fooled into clinging to it
You can analyze the body into its parts and see that they're all inconstant stressful and notself
When you develop clear insight into notself you'll be able to shake free of stress and inconstancy
That's because inconstancy is a notself affair stress is a notself affair
They're not our affairs
So what do we hope to gain by letting ourselves struggle and get defiled over them
This is why the noble ones when they see these truths call them the dangers in the cycles of samsara
You have to understand what's meant by the term cycle There's the cycle of defilement the cycle of action and the cycle of the results of action
The cycle of defilement is the ignorance that makes the mind stupid and defiled
These defilements are the cause of stress suffering and danger
Then there's the cycle of action
Any actions we do under the influence of defilement keep us spinning in the cycle acting sometimes in skillful ways sometimes in unskillful ones
Even skillful actions can lead to delusion you know
When we experience good sights sounds status or wealth as a result of our skillful actions we can turn unskillful careless and complacent because we get deluded into investing our sense of self in those things
When they start changing against our desires we grow frustrated and start acting in evil ways
When they leave us we act in unskillful ways
This causes the cycle of action in terms of both our physical and verbal acts
When we act in ways that are unskillful this causes the cycle of results to be painful
When we experience this pain and suffering the mind becomes defiled
Our vision gets obscured because the suffering overcomes us
This gives rise to anger as well as to greed for the things we want and this starts the cycle of defilement again
For this reason if we can comprehend suffering as part of this cycle we can block the cycle of defilement that would give rise to new cycles of action and results
So let's study the truth of suffering so that we can cut these cycles through discernment in the form of right view which is a factor of the noble path
Let's foster and strengthen the path by knowing the suffering in birth aging illness and death
When we comprehend suffering for what it actually is we don't have to worry about the cause of suffering for how can it arise when we see the drawbacks of its results
Once true knowledge has arisen how can ignorance arise
It's as when we're in the darkness
If we try to run around tearing down the darkness it can't be torn down
If we try to run around snatching away the darkness it can't be snatched away
The darkness can't be dispersed by us
It has to be dispersed by light
When we light a fire the darkness disappears on its own
The same with ignorance it can't be dispersed through our thinking
It has to be dispersed through clearseeing discernment
Once we give rise to discernment the cause of suffering disappears on its own without our having to get involved with it
So try to give rise to clearseeing discernment in full measure and you'll gain release from suffering without a doubt
Be really intent
That's enough for now
Keep on meditating
The practice of the Dharma is learning how to live and this is both hard and joyful work
Practice makes extraordinary demands of us
It requires that we take nothing for granted that we accept nothing on faith alone
If we practice with diligence and honesty then we must question everything about ourselves we must challenge our most basic beliefs and convictions even those we may have about the dharma itself
Of all the teachings of the Buddha the Kalama Sutta is one of my favorites precisely because it encourages such rigorous inquiry into our beliefs
Indeed if Buddhism were not infused with the spirit of this sutta  a spirit of questioning of critical examination  I'm quite sure I would not have a meditative practice today

I was raised in what you might call a tradition of skepticism
My father was the first to teach me the importance of asking questions
He came from a line of fourteen rabbis but like his own exrabbi father he rejected that heritage  although rejected actually is too weak a term
He frequently expressed contempt not only for Orthodox Judaism bur for all religions
I remember that before Hebrew school my father would pull me aside and say things like Ask the rabbi just how Moses got that river to split Well I would go along with it but as you can imagine that never went over very well
Rabbi Minkowitz was not particularly pleased to be questioned in this way
I think my father was the first in recorded history actually to pay a rabbi not to give a talk at his son's bar mitzvah
My father said Please
Here's the money
Don't give a talk But the rabbi gave the talk anyway
And my father was fuming

So my father believed in the necessity of thinking critically and he instilled this in me
His way of parenting was very similar to the scientific approach
If I got into trouble  I was usually very good at home but I got into a lot of mischief at school and in the neighborhood  I'd be put on trial when my father came home from work
He had always wanted to be a lawyer or a judge but he drove a cab so he had to settle for a court made up of my mother and me
His court was very sensitive and reasonable He would hear the accused out and sometimes after listening to all sides he would drop the charges
Of course my mother would smile and they were both happy that I got off
But my father always explained to me why I should have acted differently When you did that your Aunt Clara got aggravated then she called up your mother and now I have to listen to it
Next time just pick up the rye bread and bagels and come home
It's simple He'd always explain to me that my actions had consequences
And most important he taught me that we have the right to ask questions about anything and everything
But with that right comes a responsibility If we're going to question the actions of others we also have to be willing to question our own
The Kalamas of the Kalama Sutta were like my father a skeptical but responsible bunch
They were quite alive to spiritual matters but they were overrun with teachers and teachings each teacher competing for an audience each propounding a different philosophy or path
Their situation was not very different from ours now
We're inundated with possibilities You're interested in religion
Well what kind
Buddhism
What flavor would you like
Tibetan
Okay we have about ten flavors there
Theravada
Oh you've tried that
A little too dry for you
Too much talk about suffering and impermanence
Perhaps you'd prefer Dzogchen the innate perfection of the mind
That sounds much better doesn't it
And they have more colorful outfits
Most Vipassana teachers aren't Asian and aren't even monks they just wear sweatpants
At least the Tibetan teachers look like teachers you know
And then you get to Zen beautiful  those great stories that teach you and make you laugh
Theravada teachings go on and on but Zen is just hilarious oneliners 
So we have this great swirling spiritual marketplace with lots of claims being made
It's no wonder that many of us find it confusing
Well like us the Kalamas were confused
They went to the Buddha to hear his perspective 
So the Kalamas of Kesaputta approached the Buddha
On arrival some of them bowed down to him and sat to one side
Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and sat to one side
Some raising their joined palms sat down to one side
Some announcing their name and clan sat to one side
Some of them sat to one side in silence
As they were sitting there they said to the Buddha Lord some teachers come to Kesaputta expounding and glorifying their own doctrines
But as for the doctrine of others they abuse them disparage them deprecate them and pull them to pieces
Other teachers on coming to Kesaputta do the same thing
When we listen to them we feel doubt and uncertainty as to which of these teachers are speaking truth and which are lying
The Kalamas were overwhelmed by all these claims to exclusive truth
And when the Buddha arrived despite his reputation as a great sage they were concerned that he might be just one more teacher with a competing point of view
Actually I think their skepticism is very admirable and rather unusual
The history of the world reveals that people are drawn to those who provide a strong uncompromising teaching
We're drawn to those who say This is it and everyone else is wrong Certainly we see this pattern in contemporary politics but we also see abuse of this sort within spiritual circles
It makes you wonder Do we really want freedom
Can we handle the responsibility
Or would we just prefer to have an impressive teacher someone who can give us the answers and do the hard work for us
Of course foolishness exists within Buddhist circles as well
After all the problems that have come up in dharma centers in the past twenty years I still see Westerners who check their intelligence at the door who grovel at the feet of a teacher saying Just tell me how to live Well I've been taken a few times myself
I don't know if you have
But I deserved it
I just wanted to have my special teacher someone with special access to the truth
It felt fantastic to be their student
My spiritual life was taken care of
I didn't have to worry anymore
I was absolved of the responsibility that comes with exercising the right to ask questions
But of course I wasn't free
After hearing the concerns of the Kalamas the Buddha replied 
Come Kalamas
Don't go by reports by legend by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by consistency with your own laws by probability or by the thought 'This contemplative is our teacher' When you know for yourselves that 'these mental qualities are unskillful these mental qualities are blameworthy these mental qualities are criticized by the wise these mental qualities when acted on lead to harm and suffering' then abandon them
When you know for yourselves that 'these mental qualities are skillful these mental qualities are blameless these mental qualities are praised by the wise these mental qualities when acted on lead to wellbeing and happiness' then keep following them
There's a teaching story from China People came from far and wide to hear the dharma talks of a young teacher
Apparently he had some depth
And one day an old master came to hear him
He sat in the back of the meditation hall while the young teacher was giving a dharma talk
But the young teacher saw him and out of respect knowing that he was a renowned teacher and also much older said Please come up here sit next to me while I give my talk So the old master rose and sat next to him
The young teacher resumed his talk and every other word was a quotation from a different sutra or Zen master
The old master started to nod off in front of everyone
And the young teacher could see this out of the corner of his eye but he just continued
The more authorities he cited the sleepier the old master became
Finally the young teacher couldn't stand it anymore so he asked What's wrong
Is my teaching so boring so awful so totally off At that point the old master leaned over and gave him a very hard pinch and the young teacher screamed Ouch The old master said Ah
That's what I've come all this way for
This pure teaching
This 'ouch' teaching
Like the old master in this story the Buddha in his response to the Kalamas is trying to emphasize the importance of direct experience
He acknowledges that people rely upon many different modes of authority sometimes internal sometimes external
Some of them are reliable and others are way off the mark
The question is how do we tell which is which
How do we balance internal authority with external authority
As the Buddha says just because something is ancient doesn't mean it's true
Just because it's new doesn't mean it's true
Just because it's in the scriptures doesn't mean it's true
Just because it seems reasonable or you like the person teaching it doesn't mean it's right

What's left then
Where do we turn for authority in terms of knowing how to act
In the Kalama Sutta the Buddha is not saying that ancient teachings are irrelevant or that you have to reinvent the dharma wheel every time you think
He's not saying not to accept the guidance of teachers or not to read the scriptures
After all how else are you going to find out what's criticized and praised by the wise
No what he's saying is Don't give final authority to these teachings
Don't give final authority to your own ideas
You have to test the teachings and your ideas in the laboratory of your actions

When you put something to the test really to the test don't you find that it challenges that it stretches you too
This has certainly been my experience
Some of these wonderful teachings are inspiring
It can be intellectually satisfying and emotionally nourishing just to hear them
But you can't stop there
If you want to gain any real benefit from them you have to let them stretch your own lived experience
For the dharma to become firsthand knowledge  to feel the ouch of it  you have to live intimately with it hold it up to scrutiny and let it hold you up to scrutiny
In the end the ball is always thrown back to you Be a lamp unto yourself says the Buddha
In other words you must ultimately find the way on your own by putting your ideas of the truth to the test
Your questions light the way
So what is the test of truth
The Buddha offers a simple formula Test things in terms of cause and effect
Whatever is unskillful leading to harm and ill should be abandoned whatever is skillful leading to happiness and peace should be pursued
Apply the test of skillfulness to all teachings in all your actions
Where is this teaching taking you
Is it moving you in a direction that is wise and kind
One quick test isn't enough you know
You have to keep at it so that your sensitivity to the results of your actions grows more and more refined with practice
When you've done the hard work of asking these questions then you can decide for yourself whether a teaching or a teacher is worth following
And at the same time you've also taught yourself how to live  a learning that can bring with it joy and the energy to go even deeper
We'll now start meditating just as we've been doing every day
We have to look at this as an important opportunity
Even though our practice hasn't yet reached the Dhamma to our satisfaction at the very least it's a beginning an important beginning in gathering the strength of the mind so that our mindfulness concentration and discernment will become healthy and mature
We should try to gather these qualities together so that they can reinforce one another in washing away the stains the defilements in our minds  for when defilements arise they don't lead to peace purity or respite for the mind
Just the opposite they lead to suffering unrest and disturbance
They block any discernment that would know or see the Dhamma
There's no defilement that encourages us to practice the Dhamma to know or see the Dhamma
They simply get in the way of our practice
So whatever mental state gets in the way of our practice we should regard as a defilement  for defilements don't come floating along on their own
They have to depend on the mind
Any mental state that's sleepy or lazy any mental state that's restless angry or irritable these are all defilements
They're mental states under the influence of defilement overcome by defilement
If any of these mental states arise within us we should be aware of them
When the mind is sleepy we should get it to keep buddho in mind so that it will wake up and shake off its sleepiness
When the mind is restless and irritable we should use our discernment to reflect on things to see that these states of mind serve no purpose
Then we should quickly turn back to our concentration practice planting the mind firmly in our meditation theme not letting the mind get restless and distracted again
We focus the mind on being aware of its meditation word buddho  what's aware what's awake
We keep it in mind as if it were a post planted firmly in the ground
Don't let the mind wander from the foundation post on which you've focused
But whatever your focus don't let your focus be tense
You have to keep the mind in a good mood while it's focused
Do this with an attitude of mindfulness and discernment not one of delusion wanting to know this or to see that or to force things to fall in line with your thoughts
If that's the way you meditate your mood will grow tense and you won't be able to meditate for long
In no time at all you'll start getting irritable
So if you want to meditate for a long time you have to be neutral with equanimity as your foundation
If you want knowledge focus firmly on what you're already aware of
Keep your mind firmly in place
Find an approach that will help you stay focused without slipping away
For example make an effort to keep your mind firmly intent and apply your powers of observation and evaluation to the basis of your buddho
All of these things have to be brought together at the same spot along with whatever thinking you need to do so that mindfulness won't lapse letting unskillful outside issues come barging in or leaving an opening for internal preoccupations to arise in the heart or letting yourself get disturbed by thoughts of the past  things you knew or saw or said or did earlier today or many days many months many years ago
You have to focus exclusively on the present
If you've taken buddho as your meditation theme keep coming back to it over and over again
Buddho stands for awareness
If you can maintain awareness without lapse this will make an important difference
If you've taken the breath as your theme you have to be aware each time the breath comes in and out
You can't let yourself wander off
You have to take nothing but the breath as the focal point for mindfulness
The same principles hold in either case
You do the same things the only difference is the theme of your awareness
Why does the Buddha teach us to focus on the breath
Because we don't have to look for it don't have to guess about it don't have to think it into being
It's a present phenomenon
There's no such thing as a past breath or a future breath
There's simply the breath coming in and out in the present
That's why it's appropriate for exercising our mindfulness for gathering our mindfulness and awareness in a single place for firmly establishing concentration
So you can focus on either theme  whichever one you've already meditated on and found that mindfulness can quickly get established without lapsing and can quickly produce a sense of stillness and peace
Set that theme up as your foundation
When you're starting out focus on keeping that theme in mind
Once the mind has had enough stillness if you simply want it to become more still the mind will get into a state where it isn't doing any work because it's not distracted in any way
If this happens you have to start contemplating
In the foundations of mindfulness we're taught to contemplate the various aspects of the body in and of themselves
We don't have to contemplate anything else
If you want to contemplate from the angle of inconstancy it's here in this body
If you want to contemplate from the angle of stress it's here in this body
You can contemplate it from any angle at all
If you want to contemplate from the angle of eliminating passion and craving you can look at things that are dirty and disgusting  and you find that they fill the body
This is something requiring you to use your own intelligence
Whatever angle you use you have to look into things so that they get more subtle and refined
Contemplate them again and again until you see things clearly in a way that gives rise to nibbida or disenchantment so that you aren't deluded into latching onto things and giving them meanings the way you used to
Turn over a new mind turning your views into new views
You no longer want your old mistaken views
Turning from your old views give rise to right views
Turning from your old ways of thinking give rise to right resolves  to see the body as repulsive and unattractive
This is nekkhammasankappa the resolve for renunciation the resolve to escape from sensual passion
We don't go thinking in other directions or roaming off in other directions
We try to go in the direction of escaping from the view that the body is beautiful
What the eye sees of the body is just the outer skin
It's never seen the filthy things inside
Even though it may have seen them from time to time as when someone dies in an accident or when a patient is opened for surgery there's something in the mind that keeps us from taking it to heart and giving rise to discernment
There's something that keeps us from contemplating things down to a level more subtle than what the eye sees
We see these things and then pass right over them
We don't get to a level profound enough to give rise to disenchantment
So contemplate the body
If the mind has developed a strong enough foundation it shouldn't stay stuck just at the level of stillness
But if you haven't yet reached that level of stillness you can't skip over it
You first have to make the mind still because a firm foundation of stillness is absolutely essential
If you try to contemplate before the mind has grown still you'll give rise to knowledge that lasts only as long as you're in meditation
When you leave meditation and the mind is no longer firm your new understandings will disappear
Your old understandings will come back just as if you had never meditated
Whatever way you've been deluded in the past that's how you'll be deluded again
Whatever views you've had before won't change into anything else
Whatever ways you've thought you'll end up deluded just as before as long as your new ways of thinking aren't based on a foundation of stillness
This is why stillness is so essential
We have to get the mind to gain strength from stillness and then let it contemplate the body in and of itself in terms of its parts
You can choose any one of the parts focusing on it until it's clear
Or you can focus on the parts in sets of five
When you reach the liquid parts you can focus on them in sets of six for there are of them in all
You can contemplate them back and forth  if your mindfulness hasn't yet been exercised to the point were it's firm contemplate these things back and forth just as a preceptor teaches a new ordinand kesa loma nakha danta taco and then turning them around to taco danta nakha loma kesa
Then you can go onto the next set of five  mansam nharu atthi atthimiñjam vakkam
This is called contemplating them in sets of five
This is how we start out exercising mindfulness
If while you're practicing mindfulness in this way a visual image of any of these five parts appears catch hold of it and contemplate it so that it grows deeper and more refined
Contemplate it until you can divide the body into its parts seeing that each part is just like this
Get so that you know the body inside and out realizing that other living beings are just like this too
If you're looking to see what's unclean you'll find it here
If you're looking to see what's notself you'll find it here
Turn these things over in your mind and question yourself as to whether they're constant
What kind of pleasure is there in these things
Is it worthwhile or not
Focus on these issues often look at them often until you're adept and the mind will finally be willing to accept the truth changing from its old wrong ways of seeing things and seeing them instead in line with the Dhamma as taught by the Buddha
When your views change often in this way the mind will experience a new kind of stillness and peace
It will turn away from the fevers of the fires of passion aversion and delusion and turn into mindfulness concentration and discernment instead
Its knowledge and views will become clear
It will no longer waver
It will become brave and no longer afraid in the way it used to be  for it has come to know the truth that nothing gets pained aside from the aggregates nothing dies aside from the elements
The mind gets firmly planted
It can meditate with a snug sense of confidence with no fear of pain or illness or anything at all
You can separate things out all the way down
Even if death were to come at that point you'd be content for even though death hasn't yet come these things have separated out of their own accord
You've contemplated them and seen them for what they are each and every one
So I ask that we all have firm principles in our contemplation
Be genuine in doing it  don't just go through the motions  for all these things are genuine
If we don't meditate defilements will inhabit our thoughts deceiving us so that we don't see things as they genuinely are
If we depend just on our eyes they can fool us
The eye can see only the outside of things
It sees skin and the skin can be made up to deceive us
It sees hair of the head and hair can be made up to deceive us
It sees hair of the body  things like eyebrows and beards which can be dressed to deceive us
It sees fingernails and toenails which can be made up to deceive us
It sees teeth which can be treated to deceive us so that we make all sorts of assumptions about them
The eye has no discernment
It lets us get deceived  but it isn't what does the deceiving
The mind is what deceives itself
Once it deceives itself it makes all sorts of assumptions about itself and falls for itself
When it makes itself suffer in this way there's no help for it
This is the genuine truth
Know clearly that the mind is what deceives itself
When it doesn't have a refuge it can deceive itself all the time
So we have to develop qualities that the mind can hold to and take refuge in so that defilements won't be able to keep on deceiving it
Look so that you can see more deeply through things
Try to analyze things to see what's not genuine what's dressed and disguised
Then as soon as you look at anything you'll see what's fake and made up
You'll know The real thing doesn't have this color this smell this shape You'll see how things are always changing
This is called having the qualities of the Dhamma as your refuge as something to hold to as you look hear smell taste and make contact with things
You'll have the qualities that know and see things as they actually are  so they won't be able to deceive you
You won't be able to deceive yourself for you'd be ashamed to
The heart grows disenchanted with itself with its old ways  and why would it want to deceive itself any more
It's seen that it doesn't gain any benefit from that kind of behavior
Instead you'll see how it really benefits from its new views
They make the mind still
Clear
Set free with a sense of wellbeing
All its heavy old burdens fall away
It has no greed for gaining a lot of things for there's no more indulging
It doesn't use anything to indulge itself
All it needs is the four necessities to keep life going  that's enough
It doesn't have to invest in anything
It finds its happiness and wellbeing in the stillness that comes from meditating
The things around it that it used to fall for and build up into ignorance without realizing it when it focuses on really knowing these things its delusions disband
Ignorance disappears
The mind gains knowledge from these things in line with what they actually are
It wises up and doesn't fall for these things as it used to doesn't misunderstand them as it used to
And that's the end of its problems
Translator's note Upasika Arun Abhivanna took notes during Ajaan Lee's talk at Wat Asokaram on May and later wrote out this synopsis of the talk
It was printed with Ajaan Lee's approval as part of the book Four Years' Sermons
I'm now going to give a Dhamma talk discussing the teachings of the Buddha as an adornment to the mindfulness and discernment of all those gathered here to listen so that you will take the Dhamma and put it into practice as a way of achieving the benefits that are supposed to come from listening to the Dhamma
Today Visakha Puja is an extremely important day in the Buddhist tradition for it was on this day that the Buddha was born and years later awoke to the unexcelled right selfawakening and another years later passed away into total nibbana
In each case these events took place on the fullmoon day in May when the moon is in the Visakha asterism which is why the day is called Visakha Puja
Every year when this important day comes around again we Buddhists take the opportunity to pay homage to the Buddha as a way of expressing our gratitude for his goodness
We sacrifice our daily affairs to make merit in a skillful way by doing such things as practicing generosity observing the precepts and listening to the Dhamma
This is called paying homage to the virtues of the Triple Gem the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
The Buddha is like our father while the Dhamma is like our mother  in that it's what gives birth to our knowledge of the Buddha's teachings
At present our father has passed away leaving only our mother still alive
Both of them have been protecting us looking after us so that we've been able to stay free and happy up to the present
We're thus greatly in their debt and should find a way of showing our gratitude in keeping with the fact that we are their children
Ordinarily when people's parents die they have to cry and lament wear black etc as a way of showing their mourning
On Visakha Puja  which is the anniversary of the day on which our father the Buddha passed away  we show our mourning too but we do it in a different way
Instead of crying we chant the passages reflecting on the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
Instead of dressing up in black we take off our pretty jewels go without perfume and cologne and dress very simply
As for the comfortable beds and mattresses on which we normally lie we abstain from them
Instead of eating three or four times a day as we normally like to do we cut back to only two times or one
We have to give up our habitual pleasures if we're going to show our mourning for the Buddha  our father  in a sincere and genuine way
In addition to this we bring flowers candles and incense to offer in homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
This is called amisapuja or material homage
This is a form of practice on the external level  a matter of our words and deeds
It comes under the headings of generosity and virtue but doesn't count as the highest form of homage
There's still another level of homage  patipattipuja or homage through the practice  which the Buddha said was supreme ie meditation or the development of the mind so that it can stand firmly in its own inner goodness independent of any and all outside objects
This is the crucial point that the Buddha wanted us to focus on as much as possible for this kind of practice was what enabled him to reach the highest attainment becoming a Rightly Selfawakened Buddha and enabled many of his noble disciples to become arahants as well
So we should all take an interest and set our minds on following their example as a way of following the footsteps of our father and mother
In this way we can be called their grateful loyal heirs because we listen respectfully to our parents' teachings and put them into practice
The verse from the Mangala Sutta that I quoted at the beginning of the talk Puja ca pujaniyanam etammangalamuttamam means Homage to those deserving homage This is the highest blessing There are two kinds of homage as we've already mentioned material homage and homage through the practice
And along with these two kinds of homage people aim their hopes at two kinds of happiness
Some of them practice for the sake of continuing in the cycle of death and rebirth for the sake of worldly happiness
This kind of practice is called vattagaminikusala or skillfulness leading into the cycle
For instance they observe the precepts so that they'll be reborn as beautiful or handsome human beings or as devas in the heavenly realms
They practice generosity so that they won't have to be poor so that they can be reborn wealthy as bankers or kings
This kind of skillfulness goes only as far as the qualifications for human or heavenly rebirths
It keeps spinning around in the world without ever getting anywhere at all
The other reason that people can have for paying homage is so that they will gain release from suffering
They don't want to keep spinning through death and rebirth in the world
This is called vivattagaminikusala skillfulness leading out of the cycle
In both kinds of practice the aim is at happiness but one kind of happiness is the pleasure found in the world and the other is the happiness that lies above and beyond the world
When we pay homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha it's not the case that we have to take the results of our practice and try to push the Triple Gem any higher
Actually what we're doing is to give rise to goodness that will benefit ourselves
So in searching for goodness for our own sakes we have to keep yet another point in mind as the Buddha taught us Asevana ca balanam panditanañca sevana which means Don't associate with fools
Associate only with wise people Only then will we be safe and happy
Fools here means people whose minds and actions are shoddy and evil
They behave shoddily in their actions  killing stealing having illicit sex  and shoddily in their words telling lies creating disharmony deceiving other people
In other words they act as enemies to the society of good people at large
That's what we mean by fools
If you associate with people of this sort it's as if you're letting them pull you into a cave where there's nothing but darkness
The deeper you go the darker it gets to the point where you can't see any light at all
There's no way out
The more you associate with fools the stupider you get and you find yourself slipping into ways that lead to nothing but pain and suffering
But if you associate with wise people and sages they'll bring you back out into the light so that you'll be able to become more intelligent
You'll have the eyes to see what's good what's bad what's right what's wrong
You'll be able to help yourself gain freedom from suffering and turmoil and will meet with nothing but happiness progress and peace
This is why we're taught to associate only with good people and to avoid associating with bad
If we associate with bad people we'll meet up with trouble and pain
If we associate with good people we'll meet up with happiness
This is a way of giving a protective blessing to ourselves
This sort of protective blessing is something we can provide for ourselves at any time at any place at all
We'll gain protection wherever whenever we provide it
For this reason we should provide a protective blessing for ourselves at all times and all places for the sake of our own security and wellbeing
As for things deserving homage whether they're the sorts of things that deserve material homage or homage through the practice the act of homage provides a protective blessing in the same way
It provides happiness in the same way
The happiness that lies in the world that depends on people and external things has to suffer death and rebirth but the happiness of the Dhamma is an internal happiness that depends entirely on the mind
It's a release from suffering and stress that doesn't require us to return to any more death and rebirth in the world ever again
These two forms of happiness come from material homage and homage through the practice things that can either make us come back to be reborn or free us from having to be reborn
The difference lies in one little thing whether we want to be reborn or not
If we create long drawnout causes the results will have to be long and drawnout as well
If we create short causes the results will have to be short too
Long drawnout results are those that involve death and rebirth without end
This refers to the mind whose defilements haven't been polished away the mind that has cravings and attachments fastened on the good and bad actions of people and things in the world
If people die when their minds are like this they have to come back and be reborn in the world
To create short causes though means to cut through and destroy the process of becoming and birth so as never to give rise to the process again
This refers to the mind whose inner defilements have been polished off and washed away
This comes from examining the faults and forms of darkness that arise in our own hearts keeping in mind the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha or any of the meditation topics that are set out in the texts to the point where we can see through all mental fabrications in line with their nature as events
In other words we see them as arising remaining and then disintegrating
We keep the range of our awareness short and close to home  our own body from head to foot  without latching onto any of the good or bad actions of anyone or anything in the world
We look for a solid foundation for the mind so that it can stay fixed and secure entirely within itself with no attachment at all even for the body
When we've reached this state then when we die we won't have to come swimming back to be reborn in the world ever again
Whether we give material homage or homage through the practice if we pull the focal point of the mind out and place it in our actions  ie if we get attached to our good actions as in practicing virtue generosity etc
 then that's called vattagaminikusala skillfulness leading into the cycle
The mind isn't free
It has to become the slave of this or that thing this or that action this or that preoccupation
This is a long drawnout cause that will force us to come back and be reborn
But if we take the results of our good actions in terms of virtue generosity etc and bring them into the mind's inner foundation so that they're stashed away in the mind without letting the mind run out after external causes this is going to help cut down on our states of becoming and birth so that eventually we don't have to come back and be reborn
This is vivattagaminikusala skillfulness leading out of the cycle
This is the difference between these two forms of skillfulness
The human mind is like a bael fruit
When it's fully ripe it can no longer stay on the tree
It has to fall off hit the ground and eventually decay into the soil
Then when it's been exposed to the right amount of air and water the seed gradually sprouts again into a trunk with branches flowers and fruit containing all its ancestry in the seeds
Eventually the fruit falls to the ground and sprouts as yet another tree
It keeps going around and around in this way without ever getting annihilated
If we don't destroy the juices in the seeds that allow them to germinate they'll have to keep their genetic inheritance alive for an eon
If we want to gain release from suffering and stress we have to make our minds shoot out of the world instead of letting them fall back into the world the way bael fruits do
When the mind shoots out of the world it will find its landing spot in a place that won't let it come back and be reborn
It will stay there aloft in total freedom free from attachment of any sort
Freedom here means sovereignty
The mind is sovereign within itself
In charge of itself
It doesn't have to depend on anyone and doesn't have to fall slave to anything at all
Within ourselves we find the mind paired with the body
The body isn't all that important because it doesn't last
When it dies the various elements  earth water wind and fire  fall apart and return to their original condition
The mind though is very important because it lasts
It's the truly elemental thing residing in the body
It's what gives rise to states of becoming and birth
It's what experiences pleasure and pain
It doesn't disintegrate along with the body
It remains in existence but as something amazing that can't be seen
It's like the flame of a lit candle When the candle goes out the fire element is still there but it doesn't give off any light
Only when we light a new candle will the fire appear and give light again
When we take the body  composed of elements aggregates sense media and its parts  and the mind  or awareness itself  and simplify them to their most basic terms we're left with name and form
Form is another term for the body made up of the four elements
Name is a term for the mind residing in the body the element that creates the body
If we want to cut back on states of becoming and birth we should take as our frame of reference just these two things  name and form  as they're experienced in the present
How does form  the body  stay alive
It stays alive because of the breath
Thus the breath is the most important thing in life
As soon as the breath stops the body has to die
If the breath comes in without going out we have to die
If it goes out without coming back in we have to die
So think about the breath in this way with every moment at all times regardless of whether you're sitting standing walking or lying down
Don't let the body breathe without your mind getting some good use out of it
A person who doesn't know his or her own breath is said to be dead
Heedless
Lacking in mindfulness
As the Buddha said heedlessness is the path to danger to death
We can't let our minds run out and get stuck on external preoccupations ie thoughts of past or future whether they're good or bad
We have to keep our awareness right in the present at the breath coming in and out
This is called singleness of preoccupation
We can't let the mind slip off into any other thoughts or preoccupations at all
Our mindfulness has to be firmly established in our awareness of the present
The mind will then be able to develop strength able to withstand any preoccupations that come striking against it giving rise to feelings of good bad liking and disliking  the hindrances that would defile the mind
We have to keep our awareness exclusively in the present alert and quick to sense the arising and passing away of preoccupations letting go of both good and bad preoccupations without getting attached to them
When the mind stays firmly focused in its one preoccupation  the breath  it will give rise to concentration to the point where the eye of inner knowledge appears
For example it might give rise to powers of clairvoyance or clairaudience enabling us to see events past and future near and far
Or it might give rise to knowledge of previous lives so that we can know how we and other beings have been born died come and gone and how all these things have come about from good and bad actions
This will give rise to a sense of dismay and disenchantment with states of becoming and birth and will dissuade us from ever wanting to create bad kamma ever again
This kind of disenchantment is something useful and good without any drawbacks
It's not the same thing as its near cousin weariness
Weariness is what happens when a person say eats today to the point of getting so full that the thought of eating any more makes him weary
But tomorrow his weariness will wear off and he'll feel like eating again
Disenchantment though doesn't wear off
You'll never again see any pleasure in the objects of your disenchantment
You see birth aging illness and death as stress and suffering and so you don't ever want to give rise to the conditions that will force you to come back and undergo birth aging illness and death ever again
The important factors for anyone practicing to gain release from all stress and suffering are persistence and endurance for every kind of goodness has to have obstacles blocking the way always ready to destroy it
Even when the Buddha himself was putting his effort into the practice the armies of Mara were right on his heels pestering him all the time trying to keep him from attaining his goal
Still he never wavered never got discouraged never abandoned his efforts
He took his perfection of truthfulness and used it to drive away the forces of Mara until they were utterly defeated
He was willing to put his life on the line in order to do battle with the forces of Mara his heart solid unflinching and brave
This was why he was eventually able to attain a glorious victory realizing the unexcelled right selfawakening becoming our Buddha
This is an important example that he as our father set for his descendants to see and to take to heart
So when we're intent on training our minds to be good there are bound to be obstacles  the forces of Mara  just as in the case of the Buddha but we simply have to slash our way through them using our powers of endurance and the full extent of our abilities to fight them off
It's only normal that when we have something good there are going to be other people who want what we've got in the same way that sweet fruit tends to have worms and insects trying to eat it
A person walking along the road emptyhanded doesn't attract anyone's attention but if we're carrying something of value there are sure to be others who will want what we've got and will even try to steal it from us
If we're carrying food in our hand dogs or cats will try to snatch it
But if we don't have any food in our hand they won't pounce on us
It's the same way when we practice
When we do good we have to contend with obstacles if we want to succeed
We have to make our hearts hard and solid like diamond or rock which don't burn when you try to set them on fire
Even when they get smashed the pieces maintain their hardness as diamond and rock
The Buddha made his heart so hard and solid that when his body was cremated parts of it didn't burn and still remain as relics for us to admire even today
This was through the power of his purity and truthfulness
So we should set our minds on purifying our bodies and minds until they become so truly elemental that fire won't burn them just like the Buddha's relics
Even if we can't get them to be that hard at least we should make them like tamarind seeds in their casing even if insects bore through the casing and eat all the flesh of the tamarind fruit they can't do anything to the seeds which maintain their hardness as always
So to summarize Cutting down on states of becoming and birth means retracting our awareness inward
We have to take the mind's foundation and plant it firmly in the body without getting attached to any outside activity at all
We have to let go of every thing of every sort that follows the laws of events arising and passing away in line with its nature
We do good but don't let the mind go running out after the good
We have to let the results of our goodness come running into the mind
We pull in every thing of every sort to stash it away in our mind and don't let the mind get scattered outside getting happy or sad over the results of its actions or anything else external
We do this in the same way that the bael fruit keeps the trunk branches flowers and leaves of the bael tree curled up inside the seed
If we can then prevent outside conditions of soil and water from combining with the inside potential of the seed it won't be able to unfurl into a new bael tree
Whoever practices in the way I've discussed here is paying homage to our lord Buddha in the correct way
Such a person will be endowed with blessings providing happiness throughout time
Here I've discussed some verses from the Mangala Sutta as a way of developing our discernment so that we will take these lessons and put them into practice as a way of paying homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha on this Visakha Puja day
That's enough for now so I'll stop here
We've all come with a sense of conviction intent on studying and practicing the Dhamma so as to train our minds so that the Dhamma will appear within our minds and give them refuge
Even though the Dhamma is always present it hasn't yet become the property of the heart and mind
As long as the Dhamma is simply the property of the eye ear nose tongue and body it's a Dhamma that isn't genuine a Dhamma that isn't pure a Dhamma that isn't polished a Dhamma that can get in the way of our seeing the truth
It can let us get deceived by the preoccupations created by the process of fabrication from things the eye sees the ear hears and so on
After all the knowledge that comes from what the eye sees or the ear hears almost everyone has eyes and ears
If the knowledge that comes just from these things were enough to give rise to the most significant benefit of the Dhamma then everyone would have already experienced that significant wellbeing
They would have experienced a happiness that's genuine certain and complete
This is because all living beings with eyes can see all those with ears can hear all those with a nose tongue and body can know through these things
But to know the skillful Dhamma taught by the Buddha requires more than just eyes and ears
It requires mindfulness  the ability to keep something in mind  along with a mind equipped with the right views that have come from training in the right principles of the Buddha's teachings
This is because the Buddha's teachings are the welltaught Dhamma that people throughout the world have acknowledged as right and complete leading to peace leading to happiness leading to mental verbal and physical actions that are masterful seamless with nothing lacking
Even the devas have acknowledged that the Buddha's Dhamma is well taught
Countless people with confidence in the Dhamma practicing it earnestly have attained the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana
They've gained release from suffering through the principles of the Dhamma that they've studied and trained themselves in
All of us here are people of discernment just like them so we should take hold of these things and make them our heart's possession in a full and complete way just like them
We shouldn't content ourselves simply with hearing about or learning about the Dhamma for our knowledge on that level can still be deceived can still change so that our hearts can become uncertain and unsure so that we can make mistakes putting the heart in a position where it suffers from the impact of the things it sees or hears or from the wrong decisions it makes
We've made these mistakes and suffered from these things countless times already
This is a fact we can't deny
This is why we can't win out over our moods and preoccupations as we would like to
We see the defects in our hearts  in our thoughts words and deeds  which is why we can't maintain our peace of mind as consistently as we'd like to
So try to make use of the mind's skillful qualities
What are those qualities
You already know them virtue concentration and discernment
Maintain them so that they become clear and blatant in the heart
Come to see clearly what sufferings virtue can drive out of the heart what obstacles to happiness and peace it can drive out of the heart  to see what sorts of benefits it can bring
Ask yourself if you didn't observe this or that precept what would appear in your physical or verbal actions
A life composed of those actions in what direction would it pull you
This is something you have to see clearly you know
If you're a Buddhist meditator you're a student of the Buddha one who knows  not one who is stupid
The Buddha was never heedless or careless with life
He never let time go to waste
You should make up your mind that aside from when you sleep you want your every movement to serve a purpose you can depend on
You should live with awareness with right views
You shouldn't get infatuated with things coming in by way of the eye ear nose tongue or body
We've all been using these things for the purpose of delusion for a long time  it's not that we've just started using them for that purpose recently
So are we going to follow along in the same way forever
This is an area where we should take responsibility and come to our senses to straighten ourselves out
We have to look after our words and deeds so that they're perfectly blatant to us
This is called keeping the precepts in line with the principle silena sugatim yanti it's through virtue that beings go to the good destinations
The Buddha didn't say this without firm evidence or simply as propaganda for people to believe or put into practice in a deluded way
He said this through right discernment
Those who practice have to understand with right discernment in just the same way so as to conform to the principle of ujupatipanno those who practice straight in line with the Dhamma
If you're the sort of person who simply believes what people say right when they're right wrong when they're wrong then you can still be deceived
You need to develop the mind to a solid level seeing the Dhamma in a way that's blatant clear and informed
That's when you'll be undeceivable
That's virtue
As for concentration you have to see clearly what suffering it drives out of the heart what benefits it brings
This is something you have to learn and understand so that you'll really know
If you understand concentration it'll bring its benefits to you
It'll make the mind genuinely clear bright and pure because mindfulness will remember to choose only good preoccupations for the mind
Discernment will contemplate them and drive out from the mind any lack of stillness or peace
Discernment on the level of concentration practice  when concentration has fostered a sense of wellbeing and seclusion in the mind  will drive out any disturbance that used to cause stress for the mind
It will see the dangers and drawbacks of those disturbances
This sort of discernment will arise when we've practiced concentration correctly to the point of giving rise to peace and wellbeing
Conviction will arise when we see these results clearly in the mind
We won't have any doubts
We won't have to ask anyone what concentration is like what a still mind is like what the rewards of concentration are
We won't have to ask for the mind knows
It has entered into these things
This is what happens when we really practice using our mindfulness and persistence using our discernment correctly so as to serve a true purpose
Meditation is simply a matter of looking at what's in the heart and mind for all good and evil come from the mind
They're fabricated by the mind
When we use right views to look at the mind when we keep right mindfulness right at the mind when we apply right effort continually in our mindfulness without lapse the mind will have to be firmly established in right concentration and won't go anywhere else
That's when we'll see how much rightness is arising right there
When we don't lose focus or look anywhere else when we keep on trying to be continuous in our gaze  in the same way we read a book  we'll be able to see the entire story of what's going on
If we forget and go looking elsewhere we'll lose whole chunks of the story
We won't be able to connect the beginning with the end
It won't have any shape
But when the mind stays firmly in place it'll enter concentration
The word concentration means the firm stillness that comes from training the mind with our Dhamma theme
For example buddho we have to stay right with the word buddho
Our effort is devoted to keeping buddho in mind
Don't let it slip away to other things
Keep your efforts focused right there
Keep your mindfulness gathered right there
Don't let it forget and go elsewhere
When you keep trying to do this the counterfeit things in the mind  the defilements that deceive us  won't be able to arise for mindfulness is all there so the defilements can't establish themselves can't deceive us
This is because of the power of the mindfulness concentration and discernment that our mind has gathered together to chase away the enemies of our stillness the enemies of our happiness and wellbeing
We used to see these enemies as our friends and benefactors
But once we've studied the Buddha's teachings we realize that they're nothing but defilements
Defilements don't have any substance to them
What do they come from
From the mind
They're shadows of the mind that dwell in the mind
When in any mental moment there's a thought that goes contrary to the Dhamma that gives rise to no true knowledge or intelligence that brings us danger and suffering that thought is called a defilement
Thoughts of this sort don't come from anywhere else
Of course there are aspects of defilement that take their inspiration from outside the mind but we shouldn't trace them back in that direction or send attention outside in that direction
We're here simply for the sake of stillness for the sake of concentration
We have to focus right here in front of us
We don't have to want to know anything else  for example where the defilements come from how they can arise or where they stay
It's the same as when we come down with a sudden lethal disease
If we waste time asking the doctor where his medicine comes from or what it contains we could easily die first
We have to trust the doctor and take the medicine as he prescribes it in line with the principles he has used with good results in the past
In the same way when we're training the mind to be still we don't have to track down where things come from
We have to abstain from our desire to track things down to know in ways that will distract us from our stillness
When you want to center the mind on buddho you only have to be aware of buddho
Don't let your awareness slip away
Have the mind hold onto buddho as its refuge at all times
That's your task the task you have to do
The same holds true when you're focusing on the breath or whatever the focus of your meditation
They're all Dhamma themes
How is the breath a Dhamma theme
It's a physical dhamma  the breath or wind element here in the body
Without the breath the body wouldn't last
This isn't something we have to explain because we're already aware of it
We understand it rightly
We don't have to contemplate the ways in which the breath is important
We simply use the breath to train the mind
We're not here to train the breath
We use the breath to make the mind still which is why we don't have to analyze the body in any other way
When we want the mind to be still to settle down and rest or when we want mindfulness to work with full agility in overcoming delusion we have to exercise mindfulness fully in the duty at hand
When our effort is right our mindfulness is right and our concentration is right then they give crucial strength to the skillfulness of the mind so that it has the power and authority it needs to drive away the demons of defilement ie its own lack of skill and intelligence its delusions its tendency to float along after the preoccupations that deceive it thinking that it gains true happiness through the help of things outside
Actually those things endanger the mind
Why
Because they're nothing but fabrications that are inconstant
There's nothing constant about them at all
Visual forms are inconstant sounds are inconstant all those phenomena are inconstant
They're the Dhamma of Mara come to deceive us
But even when we understand this we shouldn't yet go thinking about them
Only when we've developed enough strength of mind to contend with them should we go out and fight with them
When our mindfulness isn't yet firmly based in concentration we can't fight them off
We're sure to get demolished by them
We've been demolished by them many many times before because our base of operations  our concentration  isn't solid enough
We keep losing out to the enemy
Do you want to keep on losing out
When are you going to gather your forces
In other words when are you going to make your conviction solid your persistence solid your mindfulness concentration and discernment all solid
These are the forces that will overcome the things that have been deceiving the mind as they like
So I ask that we all be earnest in watching over this mind of ours
As we're taught cittam dantam sukhavaham the mind when trained brings happiness
The Buddha has already done this has already succeeded in gaining this happiness
His many noble disciples have succeeded in the same way providing evidence for the truth of what he has taught
When we train ourselves so that our foundation is solid we'll have our own evidence the Dhamma that appears blatantly in our heart
We'll gain confidence accepting the fact that the Buddha's Dhamma is well taught
We'll no longer have any doubts because it will have become blatant in the heart
It's not simply that we've heard other people teach it or seen it in books
The evidence has appeared clearly in the heart that has accepted the truth within it
The mind will become solid in a way that no defilement will be able to deceive
So I ask that we all practice truly
When we practice truly the truth will truly appear to us
Practice so that these things appear clearly
When we've made virtue blatantly clear concentration blatantly clear and discernment blatantly clear where will any ignorance or craving be able to fabricate more states of being or birth for us
We'll have had enough
We won't want anything more
There won't be any more craving because we've gained a sense of the word enough This is how we reach enough  not by struggling to amass material things
The world has tried to reach enough in that way for a long time now but there's never been enough of those things
So turn around and watch over your mind so that it all becomes blatantly clear
Now that you've heard this try to remember it
You can always put it to use from this day forward
The Buddha's teachings have never grown old or worn
They're always brand new which is why we can put them to use at all times in all places
When we always keep them in mind we'll have a safe and secure refuge an auspicious refuge
Whoever attains this refuge will gain release from all suffering and stress
We've all come with a sense of conviction intent on studying and practicing the Dhamma so as to train our minds so that the Dhamma will appear within our minds and give them refuge
Even though the Dhamma is always present it hasn't yet become the property of the heart and mind
As long as the Dhamma is simply the property of the eye ear nose tongue and body it's a Dhamma that isn't genuine a Dhamma that isn't pure a Dhamma that isn't polished a Dhamma that can get in the way of our seeing the truth
It can let us get deceived by the preoccupations created by the process of fabrication from things the eye sees the ear hears and so on
After all the knowledge that comes from what the eye sees or the ear hears almost everyone has eyes and ears
If the knowledge that comes just from these things were enough to give rise to the most significant benefit of the Dhamma then everyone would have already experienced that significant wellbeing
They would have experienced a happiness that's genuine certain and complete
This is because all living beings with eyes can see all those with ears can hear all those with a nose tongue and body can know through these things
But to know the skillful Dhamma taught by the Buddha requires more than just eyes and ears
It requires mindfulness  the ability to keep something in mind  along with a mind equipped with the right views that have come from training in the right principles of the Buddha's teachings
This is because the Buddha's teachings are the welltaught Dhamma that people throughout the world have acknowledged as right and complete leading to peace leading to happiness leading to mental verbal and physical actions that are masterful seamless with nothing lacking
Even the devas have acknowledged that the Buddha's Dhamma is well taught
Countless people with confidence in the Dhamma practicing it earnestly have attained the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana
They've gained release from suffering through the principles of the Dhamma that they've studied and trained themselves in
All of us here are people of discernment just like them so we should take hold of these things and make them our heart's possession in a full and complete way just like them
We shouldn't content ourselves simply with hearing about or learning about the Dhamma for our knowledge on that level can still be deceived can still change so that our hearts can become uncertain and unsure so that we can make mistakes putting the heart in a position where it suffers from the impact of the things it sees or hears or from the wrong decisions it makes
We've made these mistakes and suffered from these things countless times already
This is a fact we can't deny
This is why we can't win out over our moods and preoccupations as we would like to
We see the defects in our hearts  in our thoughts words and deeds  which is why we can't maintain our peace of mind as consistently as we'd like to
So try to make use of the mind's skillful qualities
What are those qualities
You already know them virtue concentration and discernment
Maintain them so that they become clear and blatant in the heart
Come to see clearly what sufferings virtue can drive out of the heart what obstacles to happiness and peace it can drive out of the heart  to see what sorts of benefits it can bring
Ask yourself if you didn't observe this or that precept what would appear in your physical or verbal actions
A life composed of those actions in what direction would it pull you
This is something you have to see clearly you know
If you're a Buddhist meditator you're a student of the Buddha one who knows  not one who is stupid
The Buddha was never heedless or careless with life
He never let time go to waste
You should make up your mind that aside from when you sleep you want your every movement to serve a purpose you can depend on
You should live with awareness with right views
You shouldn't get infatuated with things coming in by way of the eye ear nose tongue or body
We've all been using these things for the purpose of delusion for a long time  it's not that we've just started using them for that purpose recently
So are we going to follow along in the same way forever
This is an area where we should take responsibility and come to our senses to straighten ourselves out
We have to look after our words and deeds so that they're perfectly blatant to us
This is called keeping the precepts in line with the principle silena sugatim yanti it's through virtue that beings go to the good destinations
The Buddha didn't say this without firm evidence or simply as propaganda for people to believe or put into practice in a deluded way
He said this through right discernment
Those who practice have to understand with right discernment in just the same way so as to conform to the principle of ujupatipanno those who practice straight in line with the Dhamma
If you're the sort of person who simply believes what people say right when they're right wrong when they're wrong then you can still be deceived
You need to develop the mind to a solid level seeing the Dhamma in a way that's blatant clear and informed
That's when you'll be undeceivable
That's virtue
As for concentration you have to see clearly what suffering it drives out of the heart what benefits it brings
This is something you have to learn and understand so that you'll really know
If you understand concentration it'll bring its benefits to you
It'll make the mind genuinely clear bright and pure because mindfulness will remember to choose only good preoccupations for the mind
Discernment will contemplate them and drive out from the mind any lack of stillness or peace
Discernment on the level of concentration practice  when concentration has fostered a sense of wellbeing and seclusion in the mind  will drive out any disturbance that used to cause stress for the mind
It will see the dangers and drawbacks of those disturbances
This sort of discernment will arise when we've practiced concentration correctly to the point of giving rise to peace and wellbeing
Conviction will arise when we see these results clearly in the mind
We won't have any doubts
We won't have to ask anyone what concentration is like what a still mind is like what the rewards of concentration are
We won't have to ask for the mind knows
It has entered into these things
This is what happens when we really practice using our mindfulness and persistence using our discernment correctly so as to serve a true purpose
Meditation is simply a matter of looking at what's in the heart and mind for all good and evil come from the mind
They're fabricated by the mind
When we use right views to look at the mind when we keep right mindfulness right at the mind when we apply right effort continually in our mindfulness without lapse the mind will have to be firmly established in right concentration and won't go anywhere else
That's when we'll see how much rightness is arising right there
When we don't lose focus or look anywhere else when we keep on trying to be continuous in our gaze  in the same way we read a book  we'll be able to see the entire story of what's going on
If we forget and go looking elsewhere we'll lose whole chunks of the story
We won't be able to connect the beginning with the end
It won't have any shape
But when the mind stays firmly in place it'll enter concentration
The word concentration means the firm stillness that comes from training the mind with our Dhamma theme
For example buddho we have to stay right with the word buddho
Our effort is devoted to keeping buddho in mind
Don't let it slip away to other things
Keep your efforts focused right there
Keep your mindfulness gathered right there
Don't let it forget and go elsewhere
When you keep trying to do this the counterfeit things in the mind  the defilements that deceive us  won't be able to arise for mindfulness is all there so the defilements can't establish themselves can't deceive us
This is because of the power of the mindfulness concentration and discernment that our mind has gathered together to chase away the enemies of our stillness the enemies of our happiness and wellbeing
We used to see these enemies as our friends and benefactors
But once we've studied the Buddha's teachings we realize that they're nothing but defilements
Defilements don't have any substance to them
What do they come from
From the mind
They're shadows of the mind that dwell in the mind
When in any mental moment there's a thought that goes contrary to the Dhamma that gives rise to no true knowledge or intelligence that brings us danger and suffering that thought is called a defilement
Thoughts of this sort don't come from anywhere else
Of course there are aspects of defilement that take their inspiration from outside the mind but we shouldn't trace them back in that direction or send attention outside in that direction
We're here simply for the sake of stillness for the sake of concentration
We have to focus right here in front of us
We don't have to want to know anything else  for example where the defilements come from how they can arise or where they stay
It's the same as when we come down with a sudden lethal disease
If we waste time asking the doctor where his medicine comes from or what it contains we could easily die first
We have to trust the doctor and take the medicine as he prescribes it in line with the principles he has used with good results in the past
In the same way when we're training the mind to be still we don't have to track down where things come from
We have to abstain from our desire to track things down to know in ways that will distract us from our stillness
When you want to center the mind on buddho you only have to be aware of buddho
Don't let your awareness slip away
Have the mind hold onto buddho as its refuge at all times
That's your task the task you have to do
The same holds true when you're focusing on the breath or whatever the focus of your meditation
They're all Dhamma themes
How is the breath a Dhamma theme
It's a physical dhamma  the breath or wind element here in the body
Without the breath the body wouldn't last
This isn't something we have to explain because we're already aware of it
We understand it rightly
We don't have to contemplate the ways in which the breath is important
We simply use the breath to train the mind
We're not here to train the breath
We use the breath to make the mind still which is why we don't have to analyze the body in any other way
When we want the mind to be still to settle down and rest or when we want mindfulness to work with full agility in overcoming delusion we have to exercise mindfulness fully in the duty at hand
When our effort is right our mindfulness is right and our concentration is right then they give crucial strength to the skillfulness of the mind so that it has the power and authority it needs to drive away the demons of defilement ie its own lack of skill and intelligence its delusions its tendency to float along after the preoccupations that deceive it thinking that it gains true happiness through the help of things outside
Actually those things endanger the mind
Why
Because they're nothing but fabrications that are inconstant
There's nothing constant about them at all
Visual forms are inconstant sounds are inconstant all those phenomena are inconstant
They're the Dhamma of Mara come to deceive us
But even when we understand this we shouldn't yet go thinking about them
Only when we've developed enough strength of mind to contend with them should we go out and fight with them
When our mindfulness isn't yet firmly based in concentration we can't fight them off
We're sure to get demolished by them
We've been demolished by them many many times before because our base of operations  our concentration  isn't solid enough
We keep losing out to the enemy
Do you want to keep on losing out
When are you going to gather your forces
In other words when are you going to make your conviction solid your persistence solid your mindfulness concentration and discernment all solid
These are the forces that will overcome the things that have been deceiving the mind as they like
So I ask that we all be earnest in watching over this mind of ours
As we're taught cittam dantam sukhavaham the mind when trained brings happiness
The Buddha has already done this has already succeeded in gaining this happiness
His many noble disciples have succeeded in the same way providing evidence for the truth of what he has taught
When we train ourselves so that our foundation is solid we'll have our own evidence the Dhamma that appears blatantly in our heart
We'll gain confidence accepting the fact that the Buddha's Dhamma is well taught
We'll no longer have any doubts because it will have become blatant in the heart
It's not simply that we've heard other people teach it or seen it in books
The evidence has appeared clearly in the heart that has accepted the truth within it
The mind will become solid in a way that no defilement will be able to deceive
So I ask that we all practice truly
When we practice truly the truth will truly appear to us
Practice so that these things appear clearly
When we've made virtue blatantly clear concentration blatantly clear and discernment blatantly clear where will any ignorance or craving be able to fabricate more states of being or birth for us
We'll have had enough
We won't want anything more
There won't be any more craving because we've gained a sense of the word enough This is how we reach enough  not by struggling to amass material things
The world has tried to reach enough in that way for a long time now but there's never been enough of those things
So turn around and watch over your mind so that it all becomes blatantly clear
Now that you've heard this try to remember it
You can always put it to use from this day forward
The Buddha's teachings have never grown old or worn
They're always brand new which is why we can put them to use at all times in all places
When we always keep them in mind we'll have a safe and secure refuge an auspicious refuge
Whoever attains this refuge will gain release from all suffering and stress
When we meditate we're training the mind for we hold the mind to be very important
But training the mind is really difficult if we don't develop the right character habits
We have to depend on refined inner qualities for the training really to go straight to the heart because the heart itself is subtle and sensitive
We have to make our character meticulous pliant tractable respectful inoffensive
We have to be willing to follow the example already set by someone who knows who's already taken the path who  on examination  we've found to be above us in terms of his training in mindfulness and discernment above us in terms of the purity of his actions
Who is this person
The Buddha  someone to whom no one else can legitimately be compared
We can't legitimately compare our views and opinions with him for he is someone who truly trained himself who sacrificed everything with no thought for his survival
The fact that we're still left hanging on in samsara after this long long time is all because of our character habits
It's because of our character habits that we keep missing the path falling off the path straying away from the path all the time
It's because of our habit of finding excuses for ourselves that we aren't willing to follow the path set out by the Buddha
What sort of path has he set out for our actions
What sort has he set out for our words
For our mind
He set out standards for us to respect to obey to put into practice
Sages have said that the Buddha's path is an easy one to follow correctly for it creates no dangers
It doesn't require that we do anything hurtful or hard
We have to examine the Buddha's teachings to see if they're worthy of obedience or not to see if they're worthy to be followed or not
Do they have any defects that we should try to avoid that we shouldn't accept
Can we find any inconsistencies in the Buddha that would justify our giving more credence to our own opinions that would justify our disobeying his teachings
And what do we have that's so special
When you look carefully you can't find anything to fault him with
So what harm would it do to listen to him and to obey his teachings
We have to study to see where our own defects lie
It's as if we're going on a journey
Our body may be in good shape but if the workings of our car are defective they can take us right off the road
So we have to meditate to examine the workings of our car in other words the preoccupations that we create in the mind and that act as views
The Buddha gave a great deal of importance to the issue of views for our views can make us defective
When our views are defective they can make our virtues defective
They can make our practice defective taking us off the path
Our views get defective when the mind is infected with delusion
There's very little alertness
There may be a lot of knowledge a lot of information but very little alertness
We may think that we're knowledgeable that we're intelligent but we don't know that our views are defective
Only those who know who've gotten past this stage can recognize what's defective in our views
So we have to make a point of training the aspect of our character related to our views to practice making our views straight
Only then will we free ourselves from defective views and replace them with impeccable ones
In order to do this we have to be scrupulous in being observant
And we have to be scrupulous in reflecting on our past actions both the things we've done right and the things we've done wrong
For the most part we don't observe our actions carefully
We make the same mistakes over and over again
We cause ourselves suffering but don't take it to heart to prevent it from happening again
This is why we keep spinning around endlessly in the cycles of samsara
We keep making mistakes but we don't recognize them as mistakes
We do things right from time to time but don't recognize why they're right
So everything gets all confused
But if we train ourselves to be observant to keep cleansing the heart so that we won't repeat our mistakes a second time won't cause ourselves to suffer in that way a second time we'll be able to make choices that really benefit us
When we look at our past beliefs and actions and then compare them with the actions of those who are wise we'll see which things are useless and we'll stop doing them
But if we don't let go of our old views we won't be able to stop doing the things we should stop
We won't be able to give up the things we should give up
As long as we hold onto our old views the same old sufferings will keep shadowing us
We'll never be able to find the path leading to the end of suffering
This is why the noble eightfold path begins with sammaditthi or right view
Right view correctly describes things right around us  within and without us  that have always been that way from time immemorial
So when you see the Dhamma  the truth of things as they already are  you'll be willing to let go of your old opinions and follow the path taught by the Buddha
For the Buddha taught these truths so that we could study and know the genuine truth
It doesn't hurt to believe the Buddha
It can only help us
His Awakening was for the benefit and happiness of the beings of the world for the purification of the beings of the world who have the wisdom and discernment to follow the path that he followed
The arising of a Buddha leads to suffering only for those whose pride prevents them from following his path
They're the only ones who don't benefit from his Awakening
We should be open and honest with ourselves about our pride our views
We shouldn't hide them from ourselves
We should bring them out and flush them out
Don't keep feeding them
For the most part they're not the sort of friends who will help make us bright clean and pure
Don't go thinking that the ideas we like will necessarily help make us bright clean and pure
We should pry them out unfurl them clean them out so that all our defective views can be cut away
When we're free of defective views we'll be left with impeccable views views that are a treasure in terms of our thinking
When our views are impeccable our virtues will be impeccable
And when our virtues form a good solid foundation training the mind becomes easy and free from difficulties
The problem right now is that our views run contrary to the truth and are always ready to make false assumptions
We see stressful things as pleasurable short things as long things that should be done as things not to be done
We see things that are filthy that should be straightened out to put them in line with the truth and we simply leave them as they are at odds with the truth
So how can we hope to gain release from suffering
How can we hope to reach purity
The mind is something subtle and sensitive easily misled by subtle misunderstandings to say nothing of blatant ones
This is why the Buddha set out a training regime for our character habits to make us compliant and respectful toward the truth even in the smallest matters seeing danger in even the slightest faults
In other words he pointed out even the slightest faults that we should avoid should abandon but we feel that we can't do without them
We don't see them as faults
This means we don't see the frightening dangers that will arise from our own wrong actions
So we're audacious in doing what's wrong
As for the things the Buddha told us to do we're not willing to do them not willing to follow him all because of our views and our pride
This is why we can't reach the stream to nibbana
If we want to practice so as to abandon our pride so as to enter the stream to the transcendent we have to straighten out our views  in particular selfidentity views
These are the very first door
If we can't straighten out these sorts of wrong views we won't be able to find the door through the wall that separates us from the Deathless
We'll simply circle around the outside perimeter
No matter how many lifetimes we practice we'll just keep walking around the perimeter of the wall if we can't straighten out these views
So we should train ourselves to examine our many subtle views in all their elaborations
We should give rise to conviction that's stronger than what we already have
We should make our respect stronger than what it already is and be willing to follow the Buddha's instructions
When he says to renounce something we should renounce it even if it means putting our life on the line even if it means dying
Only then will we come out victorious making an opening in the wall of our views
If we're not willing to make that level of sacrifice there's no way we'll succeed
So remember this If we're not willing to make that level of sacrifice there's no way we'll succeed
If you want to get through the final wall so as to gain total release from dying and birth you have to stop circling around the outside perimeter like this
If you keep acting the way you are you'll never gain release from suffering and stress
So try to be observant try to evaluate the preoccupations that lie buried in your heart
What are the obstacles the defilements you have to undo so that you can come out victorious
If you can't overcome them using one method try other methods until you can
Don't let them become you Don't let them become your self making you engage in Imaking and mymaking and selfidentity views
Once there are selfidentity views the stupidity of the mind will lead to uncertainty so that you can't come to any clear and genuine conclusions
You'll grasp at external things  this is what's called grasping at precepts and practices  like the Jains in the time of the Buddha who thought they would succeed in gaining release through external practices without training the mind to give rise to discernment
They felt that if they followed their practices external forces would come and save them some god would come and save them
But the purity of our external actions is something only we can know
As the Buddha taught there's no one else who can come and save us
Only we can save ourselves
There's no god greater than the help we give ourselves
So don't let yourself be misled
Vanquish your wrong views so that you can be genuinely compliant toward the Buddha genuinely believing in his teachings with genuine respect
Keep on meditating
When we meditate we let go of our present preoccupations
Normally the mind is always preoccupied with the various objects that the eye sees the ear hears the nose smells the tongue tastes and the body comes into contact with
But when we want peace of mind we have to see these objects as coarse and gross
We try to let go of things that are gross things that are sensual
We focus instead on things that are more refined and of more lasting value step by step
We keep on getting the mind to gather in stillness keep on letting go of everything else
It's like when we go to sleep we have to let go of distracting thoughts we have to stop thinking have to cut those things away if we're going to sleep in comfort
As long as the mind is in a turmoil over those things and can't let them go it won't be able to fall asleep
It'll have no sense of ease won't gain any strength
Even more so when we meditate we have to cut away all our other preoccupations let them all go leaving only buddho
Adjust your attitude so that you can find a sense of ease at the same time you're repeating buddho to yourself
Don't let yourself get bored or tired of the meditation
How do you develop a sense of ease
Through your conviction in what you're doing
No matter what the job if you can do it with a sense of conviction a sense of respect for your work you can keep at it continuously
Even if the sun is beating down and you're all tired and worn out you can keep on doing it
If you do it with a sense of desire for the results a sense of persistence intentness and circumspection you can keep on doing it without getting tired
When you do your work with this attitude you can keep at it always
This is why our teachers were able to live with a sense of contentment even when they were out in the mountain wilds
They put effort into their meditation with a sense of ease and wellbeing in the peace of mind they were able to maintain through restraining the mind with mindfulness
If their hearts were already inclined to stillness and seclusion then as soon as the mind had developed its foundation they were able to keep it going without any difficulties
It became automatic and they were able to experience a sense of wellbeing  the stillness the fullness the brightness of the mind
So adjusting the mind properly in this way is something very important for anyone who wants peace of mind
Keep reminding yourself to develop an attitude of conviction and this will give energy and encouragement to your efforts
If your conviction persistence and mindfulness are strong you'll be able to win out over any restless anxious sleepy or lazy states of mind
You'll be able to win out over these things through the qualities of mind you develop
The qualities of mind we're developing are like strategic weapons
We develop mindfulness
We develop alertness
We pick out our one object of meditation  This is what I'm going to fasten on  and then we both keep it in mind and stay aware of it
When we refuse to let go of it when we hold on tight to a single object it becomes the quality called singleness of preoccupation
When this singleness of mind arises it can cut through restlessness cut through anxiety
It includes both mindfulness and persistence and can keep the mind firmly gathered in one place
When this singleness of mind arises it turns into firm concentration
The mind gets more refined and can let go of everything else step by step
This singleness is the refined part that holds through all the levels of right concentration
In the first level you have to have singleness of preoccupation in charge
Even though there's also directed thought evaluation rapture and pleasure singleness of preoccupation has to be there
Directed thought and evaluation are the coarser parts of the concentration
You'll know as the mind gets more refined because it lets go of them leaving just singleness of preoccupation rapture and pleasure
Rapture is the coarsest of these three so you let go of it leaving just pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
Pleasure is the coarser of these two so you let go of it leaving just singleness of preoccupation and equanimity
When the mind has a sense of steady equanimity firm and unwavering If you want to call it tender it's tender in that it doesn't put up any resistance to the Dhamma doesn't resist the truth of things as they are
It doesn't dispute
It's willing to accept that truth
But if you want to call it tough it's tough in that it's firm and unwavering
Normally when things are soft and tender they waver and move when they're struck by anything
But when the mind is tender in this way it becomes tough instead
No one can fool it
It doesn't waver it's not affected by anything
This is the nature of the mind in concentration
Why doesn't it waver
Because it's seen the truth
It's full
It's not hungry in any way that could make it waver that could let it get tempted
It doesn't want anything else
We human beings when we have a sense of enough we're free
For this reason meditators need a solid theme that they can hold to
If you don't know or haven't studied much Dhamma you can simply remember in brief that this body of ours is Dhamma
Every part of it is Dhamma
Conventional Dhammas formulated Dhammas all the way up to absolute Dhammas all can be found in this body
So we should pay attention to the body as it's actually present right here
When we know our own body we won't have any doubts about other people other bodies
So to give strength to the mind we should repeat to ourselves any of the meditation themes dealing with the body so that the mind will settle down and come to rest
If repeating buddho buddho is too refined for you  if you can't find anything to hold to or don't know where to focus  you can focus on the breath
It's blatant enough for you to fix your attention on it  when it comes in you know it's coming in when it goes out you know it's going out
Or if that's too refined you can focus on the parts of the body
If you want to focus on hair of the head repeat kesa kesa to yourself
You've seen head hairs you can remember them so fix the memory in your mind and then repeat kesa kesa
For hair of the body you can repeat loma loma and so on
Repeat the names of any of the parts until your awareness gathers in with the repetition and settles down into stillness
If you want you can focus on any one of the bones
Repeat atthi atthi
Where is the bone you're focusing on
It's really right there
What kinds of features does it have
It really has them  after all you've seen bones before
You can remember what the big bones and little bones are like
So call them to mind focus on them and repeat their names so as to build a firm foundation for concentration and mindfulness in the mind
Once your foundation is firm and steady from the practice of repetition you move on to investigation to insight meditation
You analyze these things to see them as aniccam or inconstant
Why does the Buddha say they're inconstant
We want them to be constant
We don't want them to change
The Buddha teaches us to let go of them but we can't let them go  because our views run contrary to the Dhamma
That's why we can't let go
The word let go here means that we don't hold onto them
Even though we still live with them we just live with them nothing more
Even though we make use of these things we simply use them nothing more
Even though we make the body move it's just movement
You have to keep this understanding in mind so that wrong views don't overwhelm you
So that delusion doesn't overwhelm you
As long as these things exist we make use of them
After all they're here to use
The Buddha and his noble disciples all made use of these things without any thought of their being anything other than what they are  that they might be constant that they might give rise to true pleasure that they might be us or ours We use these things in line with our duties as long as they're here for us to use
When they change into something else they change in line with their duties in line with the laws of the Dhamma
The Buddha thus taught us to familiarize ourselves with what's normal in life aging is normal illness is normal death is normal separation from the people and things we love is normal
When we analyze them we realize that they're all going to have to leave us
They won't stay with us forever
When even these five khandhas that we're looking after all the time aren't really ours how can our children really be ours
How can our parents really be ours
How can our possessions really be ours
They're all anatta notself
We train and exercise our minds in this way until they're adept in the same way that we memorize our lessons in school
Once they're firmly imbedded in the mind the mind won't go against the truth of the Dhamma
It will believe the truth of the Dhamma be inclined to follow the truth of the Dhamma
It won't suffer for it follows in line with the laws of truth
When we don't struggle against the truth of the Dhamma there won't be any sorrow or distress when things change for we've come to know and accept the truth
So all we have to do is come and know the truth
It doesn't lie far away
The things that will cure our sufferings the most important things that will help us cross over birth and becoming all come simply from making our knowledge of what's truly here firm and unwavering so that it can push the mind lift the mind over and above any influences that might come to make an impact on it  so that it will gain release from defilement release from sorrow release from distress
The meditation we're practicing here is simply for the purpose of knowing the truth as it actually is
As long as we haven't yet reached it we won't see it
When we don't see it all we know about it is news what we've read in books or heard on tapes or heard our teachers describe
That's simply news
The mind hasn't seen it
The ears have simply received it the eyes have simply taken it in from books but they're simply passive receptors holding it as labels and memories that's all
The reaching has to be done by the heart
The heart is what reaches the truth
And once the heart has reached it you don't have to worry
It'll be the heart's own treasure
So we have to train the heart to be intelligent so that it will gain true happiness true release from danger from suffering and stress
Practice so that your mind reaches it so that it will see it
At the moment it hasn't gotten there yet
So far it's all only in your ears and eyes
So we all have to put our hearts into the meditation
Focus on what's truly here so that the heart will reach the truth  the noble truths
Whatever suffering or stress is here in your body and mind is all part of the dukkha sacca the noble truth of stress
Whatever delusion passion or delight that depends on delusion  however much whatever the object within or without  is all samudaya sacca the noble truth of the origination of stress
All the things that we like that give rise to desire to the point of clinging when we get them we latch onto them
When we lose them we look for them again
When we don't have them we suffer
This is what makes the mind travel through all the levels of being great and small
In the teaching on dependent coarising the Buddha said that it all comes from not knowing
We don't discern contact don't discern feeling don't discern craving don't discern clinging don't discern becoming don't discern birth all of this is called avijja or unawareness
So do you discern these things yet or not
When sights strike the eye day in and day out is your mindfulness ready to handle them or not
Is your discernment up on the tricks of the defilements or not
If not you have to be observant to gather and restrict all your attention to what's right here for when defilements arise they arise right here
If discernment is to see the defilements to the point of giving rise to right view it'll have to see and know right here
If we gather and restrict our attention to what's right here we're sure to know and see
If we want to be mindful and alert we can't do it anywhere else
Remember this point well and put it into practice
When these words are spoken you hear them but when you get up you forget them
Then when the time comes to meditate again you don't know what to pick as your theme of practice
You forget everything throw it all away
So there's nothing but you  no Dhamma to know no Dhamma to see no Dhamma to put into practice
It's all you and yours your body and when the body is yours feelings are yours perceptions are yours thought constructs are yours consciousness is yours
So you get possessive of what's yours and there's nothing left to be Dhamma
That's why your practice doesn't progress
All progress has to come from a point of one Once one is firmly established then there can be two and three If one is lacking everything else will be lacking
Actually when we separate things out there is no two or three When we don't lump things together there's only one Even groups of ten or twenty people are all made up of one person  that one person this one person that one person over there
So in our practice we first have to establish one  this body of ours
What's here in the body
We have mental events and physical phenomena that's two
Then there's feeling pleasure pain neither pleasure nor pain that's three
When we separate things out there's lots of them but it's all this one person this one lump sitting here encased in skin
But when you analyze things out you have hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin Here it's already a lot
Then you can analyze the eye consciousness forms
It's a lot of things but all one thing one mass of suffering and stress
Nothing else
Just know this one thing until it's all clear
You don't have to know a lot of things just this one body
Once you really see the truth the mind will let go of its burdens
We suffer because we keep piling things on  That's us that's ours that's them that's theirs  through the power of attachment clinging to things not wanting them to change
When the mind starts meditating by mentally repeating its theme it can let things go for a while
You hold onto buddho or any of the other themes
You don't take refuge in the body
You take refuge in buddho buddho until the mind settles down
That gives you a greater sense of wellbeing than you could get from these other things
When you can let go even of this level of wellbeing you'll reach the real buddha
That's where there's purity that's where there's true wellbeing with no more need to go swimming through birth and death no more need to torment yourself by having to sit and meditate like this again  because there will be nothing to torment nothing to meditate on any more
When you let go of everything there are no more issues
So we meditate to give rise to the discernment that sees the drawbacks of things and lets go of them all
That's when there are no more burdens no more kamma
It sounds easy but you have to let go of everything
If you haven't let go of everything there's more kamma to do more work to do
So we're taught cago  renunciation patinissaggo  relinquishment mutti  release analayo  no place for the defilements to dwell
So
Keep on meditating
We'll now start meditating just as we've been doing every day
We have to look at this as an important opportunity
Even though our practice hasn't yet reached the Dhamma to our satisfaction at the very least it's a beginning an important beginning in gathering the strength of the mind so that our mindfulness concentration and discernment will become healthy and mature
We should try to gather these qualities together so that they can reinforce one another in washing away the stains the defilements in our minds  for when defilements arise they don't lead to peace purity or respite for the mind
Just the opposite they lead to suffering unrest and disturbance
They block any discernment that would know or see the Dhamma
There's no defilement that encourages us to practice the Dhamma to know or see the Dhamma
They simply get in the way of our practice
So whatever mental state gets in the way of our practice we should regard as a defilement  for defilements don't come floating along on their own
They have to depend on the mind
Any mental state that's sleepy or lazy any mental state that's restless angry or irritable these are all defilements
They're mental states under the influence of defilement overcome by defilement
If any of these mental states arise within us we should be aware of them
When the mind is sleepy we should get it to keep buddho in mind so that it will wake up and shake off its sleepiness
When the mind is restless and irritable we should use our discernment to reflect on things to see that these states of mind serve no purpose
Then we should quickly turn back to our concentration practice planting the mind firmly in our meditation theme not letting the mind get restless and distracted again
We focus the mind on being aware of its meditation word buddho  what's aware what's awake
We keep it in mind as if it were a post planted firmly in the ground
Don't let the mind wander from the foundation post on which you've focused
But whatever your focus don't let your focus be tense
You have to keep the mind in a good mood while it's focused
Do this with an attitude of mindfulness and discernment not one of delusion wanting to know this or to see that or to force things to fall in line with your thoughts
If that's the way you meditate your mood will grow tense and you won't be able to meditate for long
In no time at all you'll start getting irritable
So if you want to meditate for a long time you have to be neutral with equanimity as your foundation
If you want knowledge focus firmly on what you're already aware of
Keep your mind firmly in place
Find an approach that will help you stay focused without slipping away
For example make an effort to keep your mind firmly intent and apply your powers of observation and evaluation to the basis of your buddho
All of these things have to be brought together at the same spot along with whatever thinking you need to do so that mindfulness won't lapse letting unskillful outside issues come barging in or leaving an opening for internal preoccupations to arise in the heart or letting yourself get disturbed by thoughts of the past  things you knew or saw or said or did earlier today or many days many months many years ago
You have to focus exclusively on the present
If you've taken buddho as your meditation theme keep coming back to it over and over again
Buddho stands for awareness
If you can maintain awareness without lapse this will make an important difference
If you've taken the breath as your theme you have to be aware each time the breath comes in and out
You can't let yourself wander off
You have to take nothing but the breath as the focal point for mindfulness
The same principles hold in either case
You do the same things the only difference is the theme of your awareness
Why does the Buddha teach us to focus on the breath
Because we don't have to look for it don't have to guess about it don't have to think it into being
It's a present phenomenon
There's no such thing as a past breath or a future breath
There's simply the breath coming in and out in the present
That's why it's appropriate for exercising our mindfulness for gathering our mindfulness and awareness in a single place for firmly establishing concentration
So you can focus on either theme  whichever one you've already meditated on and found that mindfulness can quickly get established without lapsing and can quickly produce a sense of stillness and peace
Set that theme up as your foundation
When you're starting out focus on keeping that theme in mind
Once the mind has had enough stillness if you simply want it to become more still the mind will get into a state where it isn't doing any work because it's not distracted in any way
If this happens you have to start contemplating
In the foundations of mindfulness we're taught to contemplate the various aspects of the body in and of themselves
We don't have to contemplate anything else
If you want to contemplate from the angle of inconstancy it's here in this body
If you want to contemplate from the angle of stress it's here in this body
You can contemplate it from any angle at all
If you want to contemplate from the angle of eliminating passion and craving you can look at things that are dirty and disgusting  and you find that they fill the body
This is something requiring you to use your own intelligence
Whatever angle you use you have to look into things so that they get more subtle and refined
Contemplate them again and again until you see things clearly in a way that gives rise to nibbida or disenchantment so that you aren't deluded into latching onto things and giving them meanings the way you used to
Turn over a new mind turning your views into new views
You no longer want your old mistaken views
Turning from your old views give rise to right views
Turning from your old ways of thinking give rise to right resolves  to see the body as repulsive and unattractive
This is nekkhammasankappa the resolve for renunciation the resolve to escape from sensual passion
We don't go thinking in other directions or roaming off in other directions
We try to go in the direction of escaping from the view that the body is beautiful
What the eye sees of the body is just the outer skin
It's never seen the filthy things inside
Even though it may have seen them from time to time as when someone dies in an accident or when a patient is opened for surgery there's something in the mind that keeps us from taking it to heart and giving rise to discernment
There's something that keeps us from contemplating things down to a level more subtle than what the eye sees
We see these things and then pass right over them
We don't get to a level profound enough to give rise to disenchantment
So contemplate the body
If the mind has developed a strong enough foundation it shouldn't stay stuck just at the level of stillness
But if you haven't yet reached that level of stillness you can't skip over it
You first have to make the mind still because a firm foundation of stillness is absolutely essential
If you try to contemplate before the mind has grown still you'll give rise to knowledge that lasts only as long as you're in meditation
When you leave meditation and the mind is no longer firm your new understandings will disappear
Your old understandings will come back just as if you had never meditated
Whatever way you've been deluded in the past that's how you'll be deluded again
Whatever views you've had before won't change into anything else
Whatever ways you've thought you'll end up deluded just as before as long as your new ways of thinking aren't based on a foundation of stillness
This is why stillness is so essential
We have to get the mind to gain strength from stillness and then let it contemplate the body in and of itself in terms of its parts
You can choose any one of the parts focusing on it until it's clear
Or you can focus on the parts in sets of five
When you reach the liquid parts you can focus on them in sets of six for there are of them in all
You can contemplate them back and forth  if your mindfulness hasn't yet been exercised to the point were it's firm contemplate these things back and forth just as a preceptor teaches a new ordinand kesa loma nakha danta taco and then turning them around to taco danta nakha loma kesa
Then you can go onto the next set of five  mansam nharu atthi atthimiñjam vakkam
This is called contemplating them in sets of five
This is how we start out exercising mindfulness
If while you're practicing mindfulness in this way a visual image of any of these five parts appears catch hold of it and contemplate it so that it grows deeper and more refined
Contemplate it until you can divide the body into its parts seeing that each part is just like this
Get so that you know the body inside and out realizing that other living beings are just like this too
If you're looking to see what's unclean you'll find it here
If you're looking to see what's notself you'll find it here
Turn these things over in your mind and question yourself as to whether they're constant
What kind of pleasure is there in these things
Is it worthwhile or not
Focus on these issues often look at them often until you're adept and the mind will finally be willing to accept the truth changing from its old wrong ways of seeing things and seeing them instead in line with the Dhamma as taught by the Buddha
When your views change often in this way the mind will experience a new kind of stillness and peace
It will turn away from the fevers of the fires of passion aversion and delusion and turn into mindfulness concentration and discernment instead
Its knowledge and views will become clear
It will no longer waver
It will become brave and no longer afraid in the way it used to be  for it has come to know the truth that nothing gets pained aside from the aggregates nothing dies aside from the elements
The mind gets firmly planted
It can meditate with a snug sense of confidence with no fear of pain or illness or anything at all
You can separate things out all the way down
Even if death were to come at that point you'd be content for even though death hasn't yet come these things have separated out of their own accord
You've contemplated them and seen them for what they are each and every one
So I ask that we all have firm principles in our contemplation
Be genuine in doing it  don't just go through the motions  for all these things are genuine
If we don't meditate defilements will inhabit our thoughts deceiving us so that we don't see things as they genuinely are
If we depend just on our eyes they can fool us
The eye can see only the outside of things
It sees skin and the skin can be made up to deceive us
It sees hair of the head and hair can be made up to deceive us
It sees hair of the body  things like eyebrows and beards which can be dressed to deceive us
It sees fingernails and toenails which can be made up to deceive us
It sees teeth which can be treated to deceive us so that we make all sorts of assumptions about them
The eye has no discernment
It lets us get deceived  but it isn't what does the deceiving
The mind is what deceives itself
Once it deceives itself it makes all sorts of assumptions about itself and falls for itself
When it makes itself suffer in this way there's no help for it
This is the genuine truth
Know clearly that the mind is what deceives itself
When it doesn't have a refuge it can deceive itself all the time
So we have to develop qualities that the mind can hold to and take refuge in so that defilements won't be able to keep on deceiving it
Look so that you can see more deeply through things
Try to analyze things to see what's not genuine what's dressed and disguised
Then as soon as you look at anything you'll see what's fake and made up
You'll know The real thing doesn't have this color this smell this shape You'll see how things are always changing
This is called having the qualities of the Dhamma as your refuge as something to hold to as you look hear smell taste and make contact with things
You'll have the qualities that know and see things as they actually are  so they won't be able to deceive you
You won't be able to deceive yourself for you'd be ashamed to
The heart grows disenchanted with itself with its old ways  and why would it want to deceive itself any more
It's seen that it doesn't gain any benefit from that kind of behavior
Instead you'll see how it really benefits from its new views
They make the mind still
Clear
Set free with a sense of wellbeing
All its heavy old burdens fall away
It has no greed for gaining a lot of things for there's no more indulging
It doesn't use anything to indulge itself
All it needs is the four necessities to keep life going  that's enough
It doesn't have to invest in anything
It finds its happiness and wellbeing in the stillness that comes from meditating
The things around it that it used to fall for and build up into ignorance without realizing it when it focuses on really knowing these things its delusions disband
Ignorance disappears
The mind gains knowledge from these things in line with what they actually are
It wises up and doesn't fall for these things as it used to doesn't misunderstand them as it used to
And that's the end of its problems
 Knowing the Dhamma means knowing the truth
Where does the Dhamma lie
Not far off at all
Where are rupadhammas
Are there any physical phenomena within us
Are any namadhammas within us
They're both within us but we don't know how to read them to decipher them because we haven't yet studied them
Or even when we have tried to study them we still can't decipher them in line with the standards set by the Buddha
So let's try to decipher our body our actions in thought word and deed
Our actions don't lie anywhere else
They show themselves in the activity of the body
So we use the body in line with the Dhamma abstaining from the activities that defile it killing stealing engaging in illicit sex
When we abstain from these things we've begun practicing the Dhamma
We abstain from telling lies from divisive speech from abusive speech from idle chatter
When we're mindful to show restraint in what we say we won't encounter any dangers coming from our speech
There are no dangers when we practice in line with the Buddha's way
As for the mind we cleanse it by meditating
We use mindfulness to look after the heart to make sure it doesn't get involved in anything defiling or unclean
We keep it cheerful blooming and bright in its meditation in investigating the Dhamma knowing the Dhamma seeing the Dhamma until it settles down in the stillness that we've developed and kept composed
We keep it blooming and bright
Wherever you go this is how you should practice
Make your composure continuous
The mind will then gain strength so that it can let go of its external preoccupations and stay focused exclusively within at peace and at ease bright and clear staying right here
Then when you want to gain discernment you can investigate
Focus mindfulness on keeping the body in mind and then investigate it
This is called dhammavicaya investigating phenomena
You investigate the physical phenomena in the body to see them in line with the four noble truths
You look at the arising of physical phenomena right here
You look at the aging the illness the death of phenomena right here within you
If you really look for it you'll see that the body is full of death
How do we see death when the body is still breathing and able to walk around
We can see it if our discernment is subtle and precise
The Buddha saw death with every inandout breath so why can't we
He once asked Ven
Ananda how often he paid attention to death in the course of a day and Ananda answered One hundred times The Buddha's response was You're still too complacent
You should pay attention to death with every inandout breath What kind of death can you look at with every inandout breath
Whatever fades away ends and disappears that's death
As for the death of the whole body that comes closer every day closer with each inandout breath
This runs down that wears out
We have to keep creating things to replace what gets worn out
And whatever we create keeps wearing out too
So we should keep track of the wearing out  what's called vayadhamma degeneration
The Buddha saw this with every moment
This is the sort of seeing that allows us to see the noble truth that birth is stressful aging is stressful
There's no ease in aging
Look so that you see this clearly
Pain and illness are stressful death is stressful all the affairs that come with birth create hardships turmoil and stress
When you investigate in line with the Buddha's Dhamma you'll see the truth for yourself in every way just as the Buddha did
For it's all right here
You'll gain discernment and intelligence no longer deluded into grasping hold of suffering and making it your self no longer grasping hold of inconstant things and making them your self
Whatever's inconstant leave it as inconstant and don't make it you
Whatever's stressful leave it as stressful and don't make it you
There's no you in any of those things
When you aim your investigation in the direction of seeing this clearly the mind will let go and attain peace inner solitude free from clinging
It's as when we carry something heavy on our shoulder
We know it's heavy because it's weighing on our shoulder
But when we put it down it's no longer heavy on us
In the same way when we see that birth is stressful aging is stressful illness is stressful death is stressful then we should examine those things as they arise to see that they're not us
Then we'll be able to let them go
We should look after our mind to make sure that it doesn't give rise to the assumption that any of those things are us or ours or that they lie within us
Those things are just objects elements and we leave them at that
Stress then has no owner on the receiving end
It's just like when you put down a burden there's nothing heavy about it at all
So stress is nothing more than things coming together to make contact
Suppose that we have a big hunk of limestone
When we lift it up it's heavy
But if we burn it in a fire pound it into dust and the wind blows it away then where's the heaviness
It's nowhere at all
Before when the limestone was still in the ground they had to use explosives to get it out
It was so heavy that they needed cranes to lift it up
But now that it's pulverized the heaviness is gone
It's the same with suffering and stress
If we investigate them down to the details so that we can see them clearly for what they truly are there's no self there at all
We get down to the basic elements of experience and we see that they're not our self in the least little bit
If we look at the hair of the head it's not self
Fingernails and toenails are not self
Look at every part of the body in detail
Or look at its elementary properties
Exactly where are you in any of those things
There's no you in there at all
The same is true when you look at feelings
There's no you in there at all
There's simply contact the contact of objects against the senses that's all
If you let go so the mind can come to rest none of these things will touch it in a way that weighs on it
Only deluded people grab hold of these things which is why they feel weighed down
If we let them go we don't feel weighed down at all
When we let go of the aggregates they're not stressful
But we don't know how to let them go because of birth
Like the mental state you've given rise to here you've created it so that it will take birth
Once you've given rise to it then  unless you're given a good reason  there's no way you'll be willing to let it go
It's the same as when someone suddenly comes to chase us out of our home
Who would be willing to go
We'd go only if we were offered a better place to stay  a safer more comfortable place to stay
If we were offered such a place who would be willing to stay
If we had a better place to go we could abandon our old home with no problem
In the same way if we're going to let go of the blatant aggregates we need a better place to stay a home for the mind a state of concentration
Just like the Buddha and his noble disciples when they let go of the blatant aggregates they entered cessation they entered jhana
When they fully let go of all aggregates they entered nibbana
We however don't yet have anything else to depend on which is why we can't let go
We first have to create a refuge for ourselves
At the very least we should try to keep buddho buddho in mind
When we really reach buddho  when the mind is really a mind awake  then we can depend on it
At the moment though we haven't reached the mind awake
We've reached nothing but the demons of defilement and they keep haunting us
We're embroiled with nothing but demons we lie under their power
For instance maccumara the demon of death whose followers  aging and illness  we fear so much
Kilesamara delusions and defilements
These are all demons
Khandhamara our attachments to the five aggregates are all demons
Abhisankharamara the thoughts we create good or bad are all demons if we fall for them  meritorious creations demeritorious creations imperturbable creations
These are the subtle demons the demons that bedeviled the Buddha on the way to Awakening dressing themselves up as this and that
If we're going to let go of these things we first need something better to hold onto
At the very least we need jhana levels of mental stillness more refined than what we have at present
So we should all try to give rise to the refined levels of peace and ease I've mentioned here
When we get disenchanted with turmoil we can enter a state of stillness
When we get disenchanted with defilement we can cleanse the heart and make it bright with the Dhamma
We'll have our home in the Dhamma in concentration
The heart can then delight with rapture and ease as its food
We'll have no desire for coarse food
When we let go of the blatant aggregates we enter the Brahma level of refined rapture and ease
Even the sensual devas don't eat coarse food like ours
As for the Brahmas they're even clearer than that more radiant within themselves
Their jhana is pure and their concentration radiant
The food of this concentration is the rapture and ease they experience
Even here on the human level when we gain rapture from concentration we feel full and happy
If we abandon the blatant aggregates leaving just the mind in its attainment of concentration imagine how much pleasure and ease there will be
We'll no longer have to be involved in these heavy burdens of ours
We won't have to worry about the five or the eight precepts because we'll be in a pure state of jhana with no thought of getting stuck on anything defiling
The mind will be bright
When you understand this focus back on your heart
Examine it carefully
Be intent on practicing heedfully and you'll meet with prosperity and ease
In general terms Right Concentration means establishing the mind rightly
On one level this can apply to all the factors of the path
You have to start out by setting the mind on Right View
In other words you use your discernment to gather together all the Dhamma you've heard
Then when you set the mind on Right Resolve that's also a way of establishing it rightly
Then you set it on Right Speech speaking only things that are right
You set it on Right Action examining your actions and then forcing yourself watching over yourself to keep your actions firmly in line with what's right
As for Right Livelihood you set your mind on providing for your livelihood exclusively in a right way
You're firm in not making a livelihood in ways that are wrong not acting in ways that are wrong not speaking in ways that are corrupt and wrong
You won't make any effort in ways that go off the path you won't be mindful in ways that lie outside the path
You'll keep being mindful in ways that stay on the path
You make this vow to yourself as a firm determination
This is one level of establishing the mind rightly
But what I want to talk about today is Right Concentration in the area of meditation in other words Right Meditation both in the area of tranquillity meditation and in the area of insight meditation
You use the techniques of tranquillity meditation to bring the mind to stillness
When you make the mind still firm in skillful qualities that's one aspect of Right Concentration
If the mind isn't firmly established in skillful qualities it can't grow still
If unskillful qualities arise in the mind it can't settle down and enter concentration
This is why when the Buddha describes the mind entering concentration he says Vivicceva kamehi Quite secluded from sensual preoccupations
The mind isn't involved doesn't incline itself toward sights that will give rise to infatuation and desire
It doesn't incline itself toward sounds that it likes toward aromas tastes or tactile sensations for which it feels infatuation through the power of desire
At the same time it doesn't incline itself toward desire for those things
Before the mind can settle into concentration it has to let go of these five types of preoccupations
This is called vivicceva kamehi quite secluded from sensual preoccupations
Vivicca akusalehi dhammehi quite secluded from the unskillful qualities called the five Hindrances
For example the first Hindrance is sensual desire
When you sit in meditation and a defilement arises in the mind when you think of something and feel desire for an internal or an external form when you get infatuated with the things you've seen and known in the past that's called sensual desire
Or if you think of something that makes you dissatisfied to the point of feeling ill will for certain people or objects that's the Hindrance of ill will
Things from the past that upset you suddenly arise again in the present barge their way in to obstruct the stillness of your mind
When the mind gets upset in this way that's an unskillful mental state acting as an obstacle to concentration
Or sloth and torpor a sense of laziness and inattentiveness when the mind isn't intent on its work and so lets go out of laziness and carelessness
It gets drowsy so that it can't be intent on its meditation
You sit here thinking buddho buddho but instead of focusing the mind to get it firmly established so that it can gain knowledge and understanding from its buddho you throw buddho away to go play with something else
As awareness gets more refined you get drowsy and fall asleep or else let delusion overcome the mind
This is an unskillful mental state called sloth and torpor
Then there's restlessness and anxiety when mindfulness isn't keeping control over things and the mind follows its preoccupations as they shoot out to things you like and don't like
The normal state of people's minds is that when mindfulness isn't in charge the mind can't sit still
It's bound to keep thinking about different kinds of things
So when you're practicing concentration you have to exercise restraint you have to be careful that the mind doesn't get scattered about
You have to be mindful of the present and alert to the present too
When you try to keep buddho in mind you have to be alert at the same time to watch over your buddho
Or if you're going to be mindful of the parts of the body  like hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin  you should focus on only one part at a time making sure that you're both mindful and alert to your mindfulness to make sure you don't go being mindful of other things
That's how you can cut off restlessness and anxiety
As you keep being mindful of the same thing for a long time the body will gradually calm down and relax
The preoccupations of the mind will calm down too so that the mind can grow still
It grows still because you keep it under control
You weaken its unruliness  as when you pull fuel away from a burning fire
As you keep pulling away the fuel the fire gradually grows weaker and weaker
And what's the fuel for the mind's unruliness
Forgetfulness
Inattentiveness
This inattentiveness is the fuel both for restlessness and anxiety and for sloth and torpor
When you keep mindfulness and alertness in charge you cut away forgetfulness and inattentiveness
As these forms of delusion are subdued they lose their power
They gradually disband leaving nothing but awareness of buddho or whatever your meditation object is
As you keep looking after your meditation object firmly without growing inattentive restlessness will disappear
Drowsiness will disappear
The mind will get firmly established in Right Concentration
This is how you enter Right Concentration
You have to depend on both mindfulness and alertness together
Right Concentration can't simply arise on its own
It needs supporting factors
The first seven factors of the path are the supporters for Right Concentration or its requisites the things it needs to depend on
It needs Right View Right Resolve Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort and Right Mindfulness
As you keep developing the beginning factors of the path concentration becomes more and more refined step by step
When the mind is trained and suffused with these qualities it's able to let go of sensual preoccupations able to let go of unskillful mental qualities
Vivicceva kamehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi
When it's secluded from sensual preoccupations secluded from unskillful qualities it can enter concentration
It experiences stillness rapture pleasure singleness of preoccupation
Both body and mind feel light
In the first stage the mind isn't totally refined because it still has directed thought and evaluation in the factors of its concentration
If your mindfulness is in good shape and can keep its object in mind without pulling away if your effort is right and alertness keeps watching over things the coarser parts of your concentration will drop away and the mind will grow more refined step by step
Directed thought and evaluation  the coarser parts  will drop away because they can't follow into that more refined stage
All that's left is rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
As you keep on meditating without letup things keep growing more refined step by step
Rapture which is coarser than pleasure will drop away leaving the pleasure
Pleasure is coarser than equanimity
As you keep contemplating while the mind grows more refined the pleasure will disappear leaving just equanimity
As long as there's still pleasure equanimity can't arise
As long as the mind is still feeding off pleasure it's still engaged with something coarse
But as you keep up your persistent effort until you see that this pleasure still comes under the Three Characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself that it's part of the aggregate of feeling the mind will let go of that coarser aspect and settle down with equanimity
Even though equanimity too is part of the feeling aggregate it's a feeling refined enough to cleanse the mind to the point where it can give rise to knowledge of refined levels of Dhamma
When the mind reaches this level it's firm and unwavering because it's totally neutral
It doesn't waver when the eye sees a form the ear hears a sound the nose smells an aroma the tongue tastes a flavor the body feels a tactile sensation or an idea comes to the mind
None of these things can make the mind waver when it's in the factors of jhana
It maintains a high level of purity
This is Right Concentration
We should all develop tranquillity meditation which can give temporary respite from suffering and stress
But in a state like this you simply have mindfulness in charge
Discernment is still too weak to uproot the most refined levels of defilement and latent tendencies
Thus for our Right Concentration to be complete we're taught not to get carried away with the sense of pleasure it brings
When the mind has been still for an appropriate amount of time we should then apply the mind to contemplating the five aggregates for these aggregates are the basis for insight meditation
You can't develop insight meditation outside of the five aggregates  the aggregates of form feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousness  for these aggregates lie right within us
They're right next to us with us at all times
So
How do you develop the aggregate of form as a basis for insight meditation
You have to see it clearly in line with its truth that form is inconstant
This is how you begin
As you develop insight meditation you have to contemplate down to the details
What is form
Form covers hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin and all the four great elements that we can touch and see
As for subsidiary forms they can't be seen with the eye but they can be touched and they depend on the four great elements
For example sound is a type of form a type of subsidiary form
Aromas flavors tactile sensations are subsidiary forms that depend on the four great elements
The sensory powers of the eye ear nose tongue and body are subsidiary forms  they're physical events not mental events you know
Then there are masculinity and femininity which fashion the body to be male or female and create differences in male and female voices manners and other characteristics
Then there's the heart and then viññatirupa which allows for the body to move for speech to be spoken
So the Buddha taught that we should contemplate form in all its aspects so as to gain the insight enabling us to withdraw all our clinging assumptions that they're us or ours
How does this happen
When we contemplate we'll see that yam kiñci rupam atitanagatapaccuppannam all form  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is inconstant stressful and notself
It all lies under the Three Characteristics
When we remember this that's called pariyattidhamma the Dhamma of study
When we actually take things apart and contemplate them one by one to the point where we gain true knowledge and vision that's called the practice of insight meditation the discernment arising in line with the way things actually are
This is a short explanation of insight meditation focused just on the aggregate of form
As for feeling  the pleasures pains and feelings of neither pleasure nor pain within us  once we've truly seen form we'll see that the same things apply to feeling
It's inconstant
When it's inconstant it'll have to make us undergo suffering and stress because of that inconstancy
We'll be piling suffering on top of suffering
Actually there's no reason why the mind should suffer from these things but we still manage to make ourselves suffer because of them
Even though they're notself there's suffering because we don't know
There's inconstancy because we don't know
Unless we develop insight meditation to see clearly and know truly we won't be able to destroy the subtle latent tendency of ignorance the latent tendency of becoming the latent tendency of sensuality within ourselves
But if we're able to develop insight meditation to the point where we see form clearly in terms of the Three Characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself then disenchantment will arise
When the latent tendencies of ignorance and becoming are destroyed the latent tendency of sensuality will have no place to stand
There's nothing it can fabricate for there's no delusion
When ignorance disbands fabrications disband
When fabrications disband all the suffering that depends on fabrication will have to disband as well
This is why we should practice meditation in line with the factors of the noble eightfold path as set down by the Buddha
To condense it even further there are three trainings virtue concentration and discernment
Virtue  exercising restraint over our words and deeds  is part of the path
tranquillity meditation and insight meditation come under concentration
So virtue concentration and discernment cover the path
Or if you want to condense things even further there are physical phenomena and mental phenomena  ie the body and mind
When we correctly understand the characteristics of the body we'll see into the ways the body and mind are interrelated
Then we'll be able to separate them out
We'll see what's notself and what isn't notself
Things in and of themselves aren't notself for they each have an inandofthemselves
It's not the case that there's nothing there at all
If there were nothing there at all how would there be contact
Think about it
Take the fire element who could destroy it
Even though it's notself it's got an inandofitself
The same holds true with the other elements
In other words these things still exist simply that there's no more clinging
So I ask that you understand this and then put it correctly into practice so as to meet with happiness and progress
That's enough explanation for now
Keep on meditating until the time is up
Survey your body
Survey your mind
You've been practicing meditation continuously so even if your mind isn't yet quiet even though it hasn't reached a level of concentration as solid as you'd like it to be meditation is still a skillful activity in terms of developing conviction developing persistence
At the very least it will give results on the sensory level making you an intelligent person at the same time developing the perfections of your character on into the future
So try not to get discouraged
Don't let yourself think that you haven't seen any results from your meditation
When you come right down to it what do you want from your meditation
You meditate to make the mind quiet and the mind becomes quiet from letting go
That's what the meditation is letting go
If you meditate in order to get something that's craving the cause of suffering
Meditation isn't an affair of craving
The Dhamma is already here so all we have to do is study it so that we'll know the truth
The truth isn't something new
It's something that's been here from time immemorial
All the Buddhas of the past have awakened to this very same Dhamma this very same truth
Even though the cosmos has changed from one aeon to another the Dhamma hasn't changed along with the cosmos
No matter which aeon a particular Buddha was born in he awakened to the same old truth
He taught the same old truth
The same Dhamma the same truth is always right here all the time
It's simply that we don't recognize it
We haven't studied it down to its elemental properties
All I ask is that you be intent on studying it
The truth is always the truth
It's always present
The truth the Buddha taught starts with the principle that stressandsuffering is a truth
Do you have any stress and suffering
Examine yourself carefully
Is there any stress and suffering within you
Or is there none at all
As long as there's suffering within you the truth of the noble truths taught by the Buddha is still there
When you're mindful to keep your eye on the suffering appearing within you you're studying the truth in line with what it actually is
But in addition to pointing out the truth of suffering the Buddha also taught the path to the end of suffering
This too is a truth
The Buddha has guaranteed that when we develop it in full measure we'll gain release from stress and suffering
It's not the case that suffering is the only truth that we have to lie buried in stress and suffering
The Buddha found a way out of suffering like an intelligent doctor who not only understands diseases but also knows a miraculous medicine to cure them
This is why the truth of the path is so important for many many people who have put it into practice have gotten results
The truth of the path is something we put into practice to gain release from suffering  as we chanted just now
Ye dukkham nappajanati
Those who don't discern suffering
Atho dukkhassa sambhavam
Suffering's cause
Tañca maggam na janati
Who don't understand the path
Dukkhupasamagaminam
The way to the stilling of suffering
Te ve jatijarupaga
They'll return to birth and aging again
If we don't comprehend suffering and the way to the end of suffering we'll have to experience birth aging and death which are the causes not only of suffering but also of the craving leading to more suffering
We should take joy in the fact that we have all the noble truths we need
We have suffering and the path to the end of suffering doesn't lie far away
When we look into the texts we find that the Buddha and his noble disciples didn't practice anything far away
They purified the actions of their bodies and minds
They did this by knowing their own bodies and minds in line with what they actually were
When we don't know our own bodies and minds as they actually are that's a cause of suffering
When we practice knowing our own bodies our own minds as they actually are that's the path to release from suffering
Aside from this there's no path at all
We already have a body
We already have a mind  this knowing property
So we take this knowing property and put it to use by studying the body in line with its three characteristics aniccata inconstancy dukkhata stressfulness and anattata notselfnessness
Inconstancy and stressfulness lie on the side of suffering and its cause
We have to study things that are inconstant in order to see who they are who's responsible for them who really owns them
This issue of inconstancy is really important
Rupam aniccam form is inconstant
Who owns the form
Rupam dukkham form is stressful
Who's on the receiving end of the stress
Stress is something that has to depend on causes and conditions in order to arise
It doesn't come on its own
Just like sound we have to depend on contact in order to hear it
If there's no contact we won't know where there's any sound
In the same way stress depends on contact
If there's no contact we won't know where there's any stress
If stress and suffering were able to burn us all on their own the Buddha would never have been able to gain release from them
There would be no way for us to practice for no matter what suffering would keep on burning us all on its own
But the fact of the matter is that when we practice we can gain relief from suffering because suffering isn't built into the mind it's not built into this knowing property
It has to depend on contact through the sense media in order for it to arise
This is why sages study the truth
As when we chant
Ayam kho me kayo
This body of mine
Uddham padatala
From the soles of the feet on up
Adho kesamatthaka
From the crown of the head on down
Tacapariyanto
Surrounded by skin
Within this body we have all five aggregates form feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousness
Form is the coarsest of the aggregates for we can touch it with our hand and see it with our eyes
As for feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousness they're mental phenomena
Even though we can't touch them with the body we can still know them and experience them
For instance we constantly have feelings of pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain
Perception we remember things and label them
Thoughtfabrication creates thoughts and consciousness notices things
We all notice things label them fabricate thoughts about them and experience pleasure and pain because of them
The primary issue is the form of the body
The Buddha taught us to study it in order to know the noble truths in both form and mental phenomena
When he taught that birth is suffering aging is suffering death is suffering he was referring to the birth aging and death right here at the form where the five aggregates meet  this form we already have
And yet most of us don't like to reflect on the truth of these things
We think that birth is pleasurable
We get pleasure and stress all confused
It's because we don't realize the truth of these things that we don't search for a way out
The Buddha however knew this truth which was why he practiced contemplating it
He tested to see if birth is pleasurable by noticing if the mind could stay quiet with birth Are there any pains
Anything disturbing the mind
And what's paining and disturbing the mind aside from the birth the arising of things It's because of the birth of the body that we have to keep finding food for it requisites to keep it going
Greed anger and delusion arise because of birth
And once there's birth there's aging deterioration wearing down wearing down all the time
Whatever we get runs out runs out every day wears down every day
The Buddha awakened to the truth that birth isn't pleasurable at all
The only pleasure is when if we get hungry we eat enough to make the hunger go away for a little while
But soon we get hungry again
When we get hot out in the sun we take cover in the shade to cool down a bit but then we start feeling hot again
When we get tired we rest
But then if we lie down for a long time we start feeling stiff
If we walk for a long time we get weary
When this is the way things are the mind can't find any peace or rest
It gets disturbed and gives rise to defilement because of birth
And that's not the end of it
Once birth takes place it's followed by aging and deterioration
No matter how much you look after the body it won't stay with you
In the end it all falls apart
And once it dies there's no one who can stay in charge of it
If we come to our senses only at that point and realize only when it's already dead that it has to die it's too late to do anything about it
But if we gain conviction in these truths now in the present before death comes we won't be complacent about our youth or life
If we can be mindful at all times that death is inevitable that  even though we may be as strong as a bull elephant  a disease could come along at any time and oppress us to the point where we can't even sit up can't do anything to help ourselves when we realize this we're said not to be complacent in our health
Then we can act in ways truly benefiting ourselves providing us with the refuge we'll need when we can no longer take refuge in our youth health or life
Wherever you look in the body you see it wearing down
Wherever you look you see diseases
Wherever you look you see things that are unclean
Nothing at all in the body is really strong or lasting
When you see this clearly you'll no longer be fooled into clinging to it
You can analyze the body into its parts and see that they're all inconstant stressful and notself
When you develop clear insight into notself you'll be able to shake free of stress and inconstancy
That's because inconstancy is a notself affair stress is a notself affair
They're not our affairs
So what do we hope to gain by letting ourselves struggle and get defiled over them
This is why the noble ones when they see these truths call them the dangers in the cycles of samsara
You have to understand what's meant by the term cycle There's the cycle of defilement the cycle of action and the cycle of the results of action
The cycle of defilement is the ignorance that makes the mind stupid and defiled
These defilements are the cause of stress suffering and danger
Then there's the cycle of action
Any actions we do under the influence of defilement keep us spinning in the cycle acting sometimes in skillful ways sometimes in unskillful ones
Even skillful actions can lead to delusion you know
When we experience good sights sounds status or wealth as a result of our skillful actions we can turn unskillful careless and complacent because we get deluded into investing our sense of self in those things
When they start changing against our desires we grow frustrated and start acting in evil ways
When they leave us we act in unskillful ways
This causes the cycle of action in terms of both our physical and verbal acts
When we act in ways that are unskillful this causes the cycle of results to be painful
When we experience this pain and suffering the mind becomes defiled
Our vision gets obscured because the suffering overcomes us
This gives rise to anger as well as to greed for the things we want and this starts the cycle of defilement again
For this reason if we can comprehend suffering as part of this cycle we can block the cycle of defilement that would give rise to new cycles of action and results
So let's study the truth of suffering so that we can cut these cycles through discernment in the form of right view which is a factor of the noble path
Let's foster and strengthen the path by knowing the suffering in birth aging illness and death
When we comprehend suffering for what it actually is we don't have to worry about the cause of suffering for how can it arise when we see the drawbacks of its results
Once true knowledge has arisen how can ignorance arise
It's as when we're in the darkness
If we try to run around tearing down the darkness it can't be torn down
If we try to run around snatching away the darkness it can't be snatched away
The darkness can't be dispersed by us
It has to be dispersed by light
When we light a fire the darkness disappears on its own
The same with ignorance it can't be dispersed through our thinking
It has to be dispersed through clearseeing discernment
Once we give rise to discernment the cause of suffering disappears on its own without our having to get involved with it
So try to give rise to clearseeing discernment in full measure and you'll gain release from suffering without a doubt
Be really intent
That's enough for now
Keep on meditating
The following selections are drawn from a collection of sermon fragments appended to the book A Heart Released as part of a commemorative volume distributed at Phra Ajaan Mun's cremation in
The collection was drawn from notes of Ajaan Mun's sermons taken by two of his students during the last two years of his life covering a wide range of topics including some standard accounts of the Buddha's life
The selections included here comprise all of the passages dealing directly with the practice of virtue and meditation
Some of Ajaan Mun's direct students have commented that the fragments would have been more subtle and insightful if the students who recorded them had been more advanced in their own meditation practice
As a result we can only guess as to what the original sermons were like
Still what has been recorded is worth reading and putting into practice and so it has been translated and offered here as a gift of Dhamma for all who are interested
Has anyone ever been ordained in the Buddha's religion without having studied meditation
We can say categorically no  there hasn't
There isn't a single preceptor who doesn't teach meditation to the ordinand before presenting him with his robes
If a preceptor doesn't teach meditation beforehand he can no longer continue being a preceptor
So every person who has been ordained can be said to have studied meditation
There is no reason to doubt this
The preceptor teaches the five meditation themes kesa hair of the head loma hair of the body nakha nails danta teeth and taco skin
These five meditation themes end with the skin
Why are we taught only as far as the skin
Because the skin is an especially important part of the body
Each and every one of us has to have skin as our wrapping
If we didn't have skin our headhairs bodyhairs nails and teeth wouldn't hold together
They'd have to scatter
Our flesh bones tendons and all the other parts of the body wouldn't be able to stay together at all
They'd have to separate to fall apart
When we get infatuated with the human body the skin is what we are infatuated with
When we conceive of the body as being beautiful and attractive and develop love desire and longing for it it's because of what we conceive of the skin
When we see a body we suppose it to have a complexion  fair ruddy dark etc
 because of what we conceive the color of the skin to be
If the body didn't have skin who would conceive it to be beautiful or attractive
Who would love it like it or desire it
We'd regard it with nothing but hatred loathing and disgust
If it weren't wrapped in skin the flesh tendons and other parts of the body wouldn't hold together and couldn't be used to accomplish anything at all  which is why we say the skin is especially important
The fact that we can keep on living is because of the skin
The fact that we get deluded into seeing the body as beautiful and attractive is because it has skin
This is why preceptors teach only as far as the skin
If we set our minds on considering the skin until we see it as disgusting and gain a vision of its unloveliness appearing unmistakably to the heart we are bound to see the inherent truths of inconstancy stress and notselfness
This will cure our delusions of beauty and attractiveness that are fixated on the skin
We will no longer focus any conceivings on it or find it appealing or desirable for we have seen it for what it is
Only when we heed our preceptors' instructions and not take them lightly will we see these inherent truths
If we don't heed our preceptors' instructions we won't be able to cure our delusions and instead will fall into the snares of enticing preoccupations  into the wheels of the cycle of rebirth
So we've already been welltaught by our preceptors since the day of our ordination
There is no reason to look for anything further
If we're still unsure if we're still looking for something more that shows that we are still confused and lost
If we weren't confused what would we be looking for
An unconfused person doesn't have to look for anything
Only a confused person has to go looking
The more he goes looking the further he gets lost
If a person doesn't go looking but simply considers what is already present he will see clearly the reality that is inherently primal and unmoving free from the yokes and fermentations of defilement
This subject is not something thought up by the preceptors to be taught to the ordinand in line with anyone's opinion
It comes from the word of the Lord Buddha who decreed that the preceptor should teach the ordinand these essential meditation themes for his constant consideration
Otherwise our ordination wouldn't be in keeping with the fact that we have relinquished the life of home and family and have come out to practice renunciation for the sake of freedom
Our ordination would be nothing more than a sham
But since the Buddha has decreed this matter every preceptor has continued this tradition down to the present
What our preceptors have taught us isn't wrong
It's absolutely true
But we simply haven't taken their teachings to heart
We've stayed complacent and deluded of our own accord  for people of discretion have affirmed that these teachings are the genuine path to purity
Virtue  normalcy  is like rock which is solid and forms the basis of the ground
No matter how much the wind may buffet and blow rock doesn't waver or flinch
If we simply hold to the word virtue though we can still go astray
We need to know where virtue lies what it is and who maintains it
If we know the factor maintaining it we will see how that factor forms the essence of virtue
If we don't understand virtue we'll end up going astray and holding just to the externals of virtue believing that we have to look for virtue here or ask for the precepts there before we can have virtue
If we have to look for it and ask for it doesn't that show that we're confused about it
Isn't that a sign of attachment to the externals of precepts and practices
People who aren't confused about virtue don't have to go looking or asking for it because they know that virtue exists within themselves
They themselves are the ones who maintain their virtue by avoiding faults of various kinds
Intention is what forms the essence of virtue
What is intention
We have to play with this word cetana in order to understand it
Change the e to an i and add another t That gives us citta the mind
A person without a mind can't be called a person
If we had only a body what could we accomplish
The body and mind have to rely on each other
If the mind isn't virtuous the body will misbehave in all sorts of ways
This is why we say that there is only one virtue that of the mind
The precepts deal simply with the flaws we should avoid
Whether you avoid the five flaws the eight the ten or the you succeed in maintaining the one and the same virtue
If you can maintain this one virtue your words and deeds will be flawless
The mind will be at normalcy  simple solid and unwavering
This sort of virtue isn't something you go looking or asking for
When people go looking and asking it's a sign they're poor and destitute
They don't have anything so they have to go begging
They keep requesting the precepts over and over again
The more they request them the more they lack them
The poorer they become
We are already endowed with body and mind
Our body we have received from our parents our mind is already with us so we have everything we need in full measure
If we want to make the body and mind virtuous we should go right ahead and do it
We don't have to think that virtue lies here or there at this or that time
Virtue already lies right here with us
Akaliko If we maintain it at all times we will reap its rewards at all times
This point can be confirmed with reference to the time of the Buddha
When the five brethren Ven
Yasa his parents and his former wife the Kassapa brothers and their disciples King Bimbisara and his following etc listened to the Buddha's teachings they didn't ask for the precepts beforehand
The Buddha started right in teaching them
So why were they able to attain the noble paths and fruitions
Where did their virtue concentration and discernment come from
The Buddha never told them to ask him for virtue concentration and discernment
Once they had savored the taste of his teachings then virtue concentration and discernment developed within them of their own accord without any asking or giving taking place
No one had to take the various factors of the path and put them together into a whole for in each case virtue concentration and discernment were qualities of one and the same heart
So only if we aren't deluded into searching outside for virtue can we be ranked as truly discerning
The traits that people have carried over from the past differ in being good bad and neutral
Their potential follows along with their traits  ie higher than what they currently are lower or on a par
Some people have developed a high potential to be good but if they associate with fools their potential will develop into that of a fool
Some people are weak in terms of their potential but if they associate with sages their potential improves and they become sages too
Some people associate with friends who are neither good nor bad who lead them neither up nor down and so their potential stays on a mediocre level
For this reason we should try to associate with sages and wise people so as to raise the level of our potential progressively higher and higher step by step
We have all come here to study of our own accord
Not one of us was invited to come
So as we have come to study and practice we should really give ourselves to the practice in line with the example set by the Buddha and his arahant disciples
At the very beginning you should contemplate all four truths  birth aging illness and death  that all the Noble Ones have contemplated before us
Birth We have already been born
What is your body if not a heap of birth
Illness aging and death are all an affair of this heap
When we contemplate these things in all four positions  by practicing sitting meditation walking meditation meditation while standing or lying down  the mind will gather into concentration
If it gathers briefly that's called momentary concentration
In other words the mind gathers and reverts to its underlying level for a short while and then withdraws
If you contemplate without retreating until an uggaha nimitta of a part of the body appears within or without contemplate that image until the mind lets go of it and reverts to its underlying level and stays there for a fair while before withdrawing again
Concentration on this level is called threshold concentration
Keep on contemplating that image until the mind reverts to a firm stance on its underlying level reaching the singleness of the first level of jhana
When the mind withdraws keep contemplating that image over and over again until you can take it apart as a patibhaga nimitta
In other words contemplate what the body will be like after it dies
It'll have to disintegrate until only the bones are left
Focus on this truth within you  as it applies to your own body  as well as without  as it applies to the bodies of others
See what the various parts of the body are This is hair These are nails These are teeth This is skin How many tendons are there
How many bones
Get so that you can see these things clearly
Visualize the body coming together again  sitting standing walking and lying down  and then dying and reverting to its original state its original properties of earth water fire and wind
When you contemplate this way repeatedly both within and without visualizing the body newly dead and long dead with dogs and vultures fighting over it your mind will eventually come to gain intuitive insight in line with your potential
The Buddha our foremost teacher taught about body speech and mind
He didn't teach anything else
He taught us to practice to train our minds to use our minds to investigate the body This is called the contemplation of the body as a frame of reference
We are taught to train our mindfulness thoroughly in the practice of investigating  this is called the analysis of phenomena  until it reaches a point of sufficiency
When we have investigated enough to make mindfulness itself a factor of Awakening the mind settles down into concentration of its own accord
There are three levels of concentration
In momentary concentration the mind gathers and settles down to a firm stance and rests there for a moment before withdrawing
In threshold concentration the mind gathers and settles down to its underlying level and stays there a fair while before withdrawing to be aware of a nimitta of one sort or another
In fixed penetration the mind settles down to a firm stance on its underlying level and stops there in singleness perfectly still  aware that it is staying there  endowed with the five factors of jhana which then become gradually more and more refined
When we train the mind in this way we are said to be heightening the mind as in the Pali phrase
The contemplation of the body is a practice that sages  including the Lord Buddha  have described in many ways
For example in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta he calls it the contemplation of the body as a frame of reference
In the root themes of meditation which a preceptor must teach at the beginning of the ordination ceremony he describes the contemplation of hairs of the head hairs of the body nails teeth and skin
In the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta he teaches that birth aging and death are stressful
We have all taken birth now haven't we
When we practice so as to opanayiko  take these teachings inward and contemplate them by applying them to ourselves  we are not going wrong in the practice because the Dhamma is akaliko everpresent and aloko blatantly clear both by day and by night with nothing to obscure it
People who have studied a lot of the Dhamma and Vinaya  who have learned a large number of approaches together with their many ramifications  when they then come to train their minds find that their minds don't settle down easily into concentration
They need to realize that they must first take their learning and put it back on the shelf for the time being
They need to train what knows  this very mind  developing their mindfulness until it is supermindfulness their discernment until it is superdiscernment so that they can see through the superdeceits of conventional truth and common assumptions that set things up naming them This is this and That is that  days nights months years earth sky sun moon constellations everything  all the things that thoughtformations the conditions or effects of the mind set up as being this or that
Once the mind can see through these effects of the mind this is called knowing stress and its cause
Once you practice this theme and develop it repeatedly until you are quick at seeing through these things the mind will be able to gather and settle down
To focus in this way is called developing the path
And when the path reaches a point of sufficiency there is no need to speak of the cessation of stress It will appear of its own accord to the person who practices  because virtue concentration and discernment all exist in our very own body speech and mind
These things are said to be akaliko everpresent
Opanayiko When meditators contemplate what already exists within them then  paccattam  they will know for themselves
In other words we contemplate the body so as to see it as unattractive and visualize it as disintegrating back into its primary properties in terms of the primal Dhamma that is blatantly clear both by day and by night
When contemplating you should keep this analogy in mind When people grow rice they have to grow it in the earth
They have to go wading through the mud exposed to the sun and rain before they can get the rice grains the husked rice the cooked rice and can finally eat their fill
When they do this they are getting their rice entirely from things that already exist
In the same way meditators must develop virtue concentration and discernment which already exist in the body speech and mind of every person
Concerning the principles of our practice there is no real problem
Opanayiko Bring the mind inward to investigate body speech and mind  things that are akaliko everpresent aloko blatantly clear both by day and by night paccattam veditabbo viññuhi to be known by the wise for themselves  just as the sages of the past such as the Buddha and the Noble Disciples knew clearly for themselves after bringing their minds inward to contemplate what was already there
It's not the case that these things exist at some times and not at others
They exist at all times in every era
This is something we as meditators can know for ourselves
In others words when we make a mistake we know it
When we do things correctly we know it within ourselves
How good or bad we are we are bound to know better than anyone else  as long as we are persistent in our contemplation and don't let ourselves grow complacent or heedless
An example from the past is that of the sixteen young students of the Brahman teacher Bavari
They had practiced jhana to the point where they were stuck on rupa jhana and arupa jhana
The Buddha thus taught them to contemplate what was already inside them so as to see it clearly with discernment  to see the level of sensuality as lying below the level of formlessness as lying above and the level of form as in the middle to see the past as below the future as above and the present as in the middle
Then he taught them to look inside themselves  from the feet below to the tips of the hair above and all around in between
Once they had contemplated in this way they came to know clearly for themselves
This ended their doubts about how to practice and they no longer had to go to the trouble of looking anywhere else
As a meditator you should use the strategy of listening to the Dhamma at all times even when you are living alone
In other words contemplate the Dhamma both by day and by night
The eye ear nose tongue and body are physical phenomena that are always present
Sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations are also present for you to see hear smell taste and touch
The mind
It too is present
Your thoughts and feelings about various topics  good and bad  are present as well
Development and decay both within you and without are also present
These things that occur naturally display the truth  inconstancy stress and notselfness  for you to see at all times
When a leaf grows yellow and falls from the tree for instance it is showing you the truth of inconstancy
So when you continually use this approach to contemplate things with your mindfulness and discernment you are said to be listening to the Dhamma at all times both by day and by night
Merit is the intention that arises in the heart beginning with your first thought of doing something good
For example today you decided that you wanted to come to the monastery
That thought in and of itself was merit arising in the mind
Then you came to the monastery received the precepts and listened to a sermon in line with your original intention
In this way your original intention succeeded in producing more merit in line with its aims
But if you think that you want to go to the monastery to receive the precepts and listen to the Dhamma but someone else happens to object or criticizes you in a way that spoils your mood the merit in your mind  the original intention  disappears
Even if someone else then invites you to come to the monastery you come here against your will and sit here like a stump with no merit arising in your mind
This is because the essence of merit in your mind has already died
The meritorious things that you do aren't the essence of merit
For example giving donations observing the precepts listening to sermons or sitting in meditation aren't the essence of merit
Still we have to keep doing these things so that our old merit can grow fat and healthy instead of dying away
For this reason when you make up your mind to do something good hurry up and do it right away
When you want to give a donation go ahead and give a donation
When you want to observe the precepts observe the precepts
When you want to listen to the Dhamma listen to the Dhamma
When you want to meditate meditate
In this way the results of your actions will grow full and complete in all three time periods
In other words your mind will feel happy joyful and satisfied in your merit when you first think of doing it while you're doing it and when you're done
The intention to do good  the first stage in your goodness  is the essence of merit
It's like planting a tree
When you give a donation it's like putting fertilizer around the tree
When you observe the precepts it's like picking away the worms and caterpillars that will eat the flowers or leaves
As for meditating that's like watering the tree with clean clear cool water
In this way your tree is sure to keep growing until it produces leaves and fruit that you can eat for your enjoyment in line with your original aim
If it's a flowering tree the flowers will be bright and colorful with large petals and a refreshing scent
If it's a fruit tree the fruits will be plentiful large and sweet
This is how generosity virtue and meditation are means of developing the merit of your original thought
But if your heart is in a sour mood then you won't get much fruit from making merit or giving donations
It's like giving fertilizer to a tree that's already died
Even if all you want is a single custard apple from the tree you won't be able to get what you want because the fertilizer you gave to the tree has all gone to nourish the grasses and herbs growing at the foot of the tree and hasn't done a thing for the custard apple you wanted
In the same way if you just go through the motions of making merit your original aim  to abandon greed aversion and delusion  won't bear fruit
The act of generosity is simply the fertilizer of merit
When the essence of merit has died there's no way that you can eat the fertilizer for it's nothing but filth  cow dung and chicken droppings
How can you ask for filthy stuff like that to come and help you in any way
But still you're better off than people who haven't fertilized anything at all  ie who haven't developed virtue concentration or discernment  for at the very least you can gather the grasses and herbs that have fed on your fertilizer to boil in a soup or fix as a salad
So whenever you do anything you have to check to see whether the essence of merit is in your heart
Some people make merit when their hearts are evil
They're like a stickyrice sweet roasted in bamboo where the rice on the top is soft and wellcooked but the rice at the bottom is raw or burnt to a crisp
When this is the case there's no way you can eat it for it's not good all the way through
People by and large act in ways that aren't in line with their minds
Some people make donations but their hearts are still greedy as when they give a gift because they want to become millionaires
Some people give one dollar expecting to get ten thousand or a hundred thousand in return
Some people observe the precepts but their hearts are still angry jealous or hateful toward this person or that
Some people meditate so that they can be beautiful and shapely in their next birth or because they want to become devas up in heaven
Other people want to be this or that  always looking for something in exchange
This kind of merit is still wide of the mark
The Buddha taught us to be generous for the sake of doing away with greed to observe the precepts to do away with anger and to meditate to do away with delusion not for the sake of feeding these defilements
Some people come here to meditate and sit here absolutely still  their eyes are closed their posture straight and unmoving everything on the outside just the way it should be  but their minds are running around all over the place to their orchards their fields some people's minds go zooming abroad in search of their children or friends thinking about all kinds of things
Their minds aren't sitting together with their bodies
This is called a mind and a body not in line with each other  like a stickyrice sweet where the top is cooked but the bottom is still raw
If you're careful to keep the essence of merit with your heart then go ahead and do whatever goodness you want
Don't come to the monastery behind the corpse of your merit
In other words if you originally want to come to the monastery but someone else yells at you so that you come here in a foul mood against your will this kind of meritmaking doesn't help you much at all
The reason we need to train our minds to be solid and strong in the Dhamma is because we're sure to face the three dangers of the world suffering illness and poverty death and enemies and foolish friends
We have to prepare ourselves so that when any of these things come our way our hearts will be strong enough to contend with them bravely and without fear
No matter what side they may attack from we have a strategy to fight them off in every way
This is why the daily blessing says Icchitam patthitam tumham khippameva samijjhatu which means Whatever you want and desire may it succeed quickly In other words when the mind is strong and powerful whatever you think of doing is bound to succeed
If you let your original thoughts of merit die or disappear from the mind before you come to give a donation observe the precepts or meditate the results of the original intention won't develop but at least you're better off than people who don't come at all
The original thought of merit is like a tree
If your tree doesn't die then the more you fertilize it the bigger it'll grow and the more it'll branch out
In other words your actions will be lovely and quiet
Whatever your hands do will be merit
Wherever your feet step will be merit
Whatever your mouth says will be merit
Whatever your mind thinks will be merit
Your whole body will be merit
When this is the case you'll meet with nothing but happiness
Virtue in terms its wording consists of undertaking the five eight ten or precepts
In terms of its meaning it consists of thinking speaking and acting in ways that harm no one
When you think you do it with a mind of good will
When you speak you do it with a mind of good will
When you act you do it with a mind of good will
In terms of its flavor virtue is coolness
For this reason the act of undertaking the precepts isn't the essence of virtue it's simply a way of fertilizing virtue  our original intention  so that it'll grow fat and strong
The Pali word for virtue  sila  comes from sela or rock so when you develop virtue you have to make your heart large like an enormous rock
What's a rock like
It's solid stable and cool
Even though the sun may burn it all day or rain may lash at it all night it doesn't tremble or shake
In addition it keeps its coolness inside
What kind of coolness is that
The coolness of bravery quick reflexes and circumspection
This kind of coolness is virtue  not the kind of coolness of a person who's slow and lackadaisical
If you're cool you have to be cool from the virtue within you
Having virtue within you is like having a pool of water in your house
When your house has a pool of water how can fire burn it down
When you have this kind of coolness looking after your heart how can anger hatred or ill will overcome it
In addition this cool rock of virtue holds fire within it  but not the fire of defilement
It's a cool fire that you can put to all kinds of good uses
When you strike one rock against another the spark can light a fire that you can use to cook your food or light your house
These are some of the benefits of virtue
When you practice concentration but your mind isn't firmly established in genuine merit Mara will come after you with a big grin on his face
What this means is the Maras of the aggregates there will be feelings of pain throughout your body your perceptions will be a turmoil your thoughtconstructs will think of different things your consciousness will be aware all over the place
When this happens your heart will be crushed and your merit snuffed out
Like a stickyrice sweet that's not cooked all the way through if you eat it you'll get indigestion
When practicing concentration you have to be careful not to force or squeeze the mind too much but at the same time you can't let it run too loose
Force it when you have to let it go when you have to
The important point is to keep directed thought and evaluation in charge at all times
In this way the mind gains quality it won't play truant or go straying off the path of goodness
The nature of goodness is that there are bound to be bad things sneaking in in the same way that when there are rich people there are bound to be thieves lying in wait to rob them
When you make merit Mara in his different forms is sure to get in the way
So when you meditate be careful not to fall into wrong mindfulness or wrong concentration
Wrong mindfulness is when your awareness leaves the four frames of reference  body feelings mind and mental qualities
Here the body means the breath feelings are sensations of comfort or discomfort the mind is the awareness of the body and the mental quality we want is the quality of the present
Wrong concentration is when you're forgetful or unaware as when you're unaware of how the body is sitting where the mind is wandering off to how it comes back
The mind lacks both mindfulness and alertness
But when your concentration gets established the mind will grow higher
And when the mind is up high nothing can reach up to destroy its goodness
Like the stars the moon or the sun that shine in the sky even though clouds may pass in front of them from time to time the clouds can't sneak up or seep up to make the brightness of the stars moon or sun grow murky or dark
Merit is a noble treasure
It's the source of all our inner wealth
When it arises in the mind don't let anyone else touch it
When you have a source of wealth like this it's like having a raw diamond which is a hundred times better than having your wealth in property cattle or workers for those things lie far away and are hard to look after
If you have a raw diamond all you have to do is wrap it in cotton and it'll keep on growing
Just make sure that you don't cut or polish it
If you turn it into a cut diamond then even if you keep it for years it won't grow any further
In the same way when concentration arises in the mind you have to look after it
Don't let any labels or concepts touch it at all
That way your concentration will develop step by step
Your mind will grow higher and higher
Happiness and coolness will come flowing your way
Everything you aspire to will succeed and eventually you'll attain the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana
When a person makes up his mind to do one thing but then turns around to do something else entirely the results of his first intention simply won't come about
A person like this has to be classed as really stupid  an ingrate to himself a traitor to himself
Like a child who says goodbye to its parents telling them that it's going to school but then goes wandering off to see a movie or a traveling show
The parents don't know what's going on
They think the child is at school
By the time they've tracked down the truth they will have wasted a lot of time
In this way the child harms itself in four ways there's the bad karma of having deceived its parents it throws away the money the parents paid for its tuition it stays ignorant and doesn't pick up any of the knowledge it would have gained at school and death keeps creeping closer day by day the child itself eventually becomes a parent and yet it can't even read or write three letters of the alphabet
In the same way when you aren't really intent on the practice  you come and sit here meditating but your mind isn't with the body it goes wandering off to think about things unrelated to the Dhamma thinking about things at home thinking about your children or grandchildren thinking about this person or that thinking about things ahead or behind your mind isn't established in stillness your eyes are closed but your mind slips off to look for fun with different kinds of preoccupations sometimes you meet up with dogs and cats so you play with the dog and cats  when this happens you harm yourself in the same ways
First there's the bad karma of deceiving your teacher telling him you're going to practice concentration but then not doing it
The teacher doesn't know what's going on and so teaches the Dhamma until his mouth runs out of saliva but with no results to show for it
You yourself stay ignorant
You sit and meditate for three years but don't get anything out of it
If people ask you about the practice they can't get any sense out of you which reflects badly on the teacher
When death comes you'll die with pain and hardship with no inner wealth to take along to the next life
So you'll keep on spinning around in death and rebirth for who knows how many lives without ever getting to nibbana
All of this comes from not really being intent
If you're really intent on practicing the Dhamma then no matter what you'll have to get results  large or small  depending on the strength of what you can do
If you're going to meditate be intent on meditating
If you're going to listen to the Dhamma be intent on listening
If you're going to speak be intent on speaking
Whatever you do be intent on what you're doing
That way you'll get the results you want from your actions
To get results your intent has to be composed of the four bases for success
In other words chanda Like what you're doing
If you're going to meditate be content to stay mindful of the breath
Viriya Be persistent and don't get discouraged
Even though there may be pains in the body you endure them
Citta Give your full mind to what you're doing
Don't just play around
Don't let your mind wander off to think of other things
Vimansa When you really do the meditation you contemplate to see what gives rise to a sense of peace and ease in the body and mind
When your meditation is composed of these four factors in full it's as if you're sitting on a chair with four good legs
You won't have to fear that the chair will start tilting or fall over
This is different from a person who's sitting on a chair with only two legs or one
If anyone happens to brush past he may tip over or fall flat on his back
But if you're sitting on a chair with four good legs then even if someone runs into you or grabs hold of the chair to give it a shake you needn't be afraid of falling off
Even if they pick up the chair and move it somewhere else you'll still be able to sit on it in comfort
You don't have fear any danger at all
This is what it's like when you make your mind fully solid and strong in the goodness of what you're doing
You can sit and lie down in ease
Whether you're in the monastery or at home you can live at your ease
You can eat or go without food and still be at ease
You can handle a lot of work or only a little and still be at ease
You can have ten million billions in money or not even a single red cent and still be at ease
When death comes you can die with ease free from suffering or hardship
When anyone can do this the devas clap their hands in joy
When anyone can't the devas screw up their faces while Mara and his gang laugh and clap their hands because they've beat another of the Buddha's disciples
Think about it do you really want to be one of Mara's disciples
We have to use skillfulness and merit to polish ourselves until we're shining and bright
In other words we polish our actions with virtue concentration and discernment
When you train your mind with concentration until it's fully tempered and strong it'll be calm and cool bright and gleaming like still water in a deep well or like the stars in the sky
The hindrances won't be able to walk all over you for the level of the mind will keep growing higher and higher at all times
When it's really up high it grows cool
Just as when we're sitting here we don't feel especially cool where we're sitting but if we go up two or three kilometers off the surface of the earth we'll feel cold right away
In addition to cooling off our eyes will be able to see things far far away
We'll be able to see the condition of human beings and animals all the dangers and difficulties of life on the world beneath us
We'll start taking these dangers to heart so that we won't want to come back down again
When we talk about the mind's being on a high level we don't mean that it's high up like an airplane simply that the quality of its awareness is heightened through training its concentration and discernment
When this happens you'll be able to see the causes and effects of everything true and false
You'll see the dangers of wandering on through death and rebirth and gain a sense of disenchantment with birth aging illness and death seeing them as nothing but pain and trouble
When you see things in this way you'll lose all hankering for sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas
You'll be intent solely on developing the heart to gain release from all defilements and mental fermentations so that you won't have to come swimming around through death and rebirth in the world ever again
When you sit in meditation focus your attention solely on a single preoccupation
If you slip off that preoccupation you fall into hell
What does hell mean here
Cakkhum adittam Any preoccupations that come in by way of the eye are said to be a ball of hellfire
Sotam adittam Any preoccupations that come in by way of the ear are a ball of fire
Any preoccupations that come in by way of the nose tongue body and mind are all balls of fire
If you focus your attention on any of these preoccupations they'll make you as hot as if you had fallen into hell in this very lifetime That's why you should cut away all perceptions of that sort
Don't let them get involved with your mind at all
The defilements are like salt water the Dhamma is like fresh water which benefits the world in three ways people can drink it it washes things clean and it helps plants to grow
As for salt water you can't drink it you can't use it to wash things clean and if you use it to water plants they'll die
A person who sits fermenting in his defilements is like a salt water fish
Salt water fish have a strong nasty smell
Once when I was in Chantaburi staying at the LotusPond Monastery a group of fishwives carried a batch of ocean fish past the monastery at a distance of about meters
Even then the smell of the fish hit my nose and seemed really foul
As for freshwater fish even though they have some smell it's not as foul as saltwater fish
In the same way people with a lot of defilements really smell no one wants them to come near and wherever they go they're despised
Ordinarily saltwater fish like to stay only in salt water
If you catch them and put them in fresh water they'll die in an instant
The same with freshwater fish if you catch them and put them in salt water they'll immediately die
But modern scientists have found a way to turn saltwater fish into freshwater fish
They put saltwater fish in salt water and then gradually mix in fresh water little by little
The fish gradually get more and more accustomed to fresh water until ultimately they can be released into a freshwater pond and they won't die
The same with freshwater fish the scientists gradually mix salt water into the tanks where they're keeping freshwater fish and the fish gradually get used to being in salty water until the scientists can throw them into the sea and they won't die
In the same way people who are full of defilements are like saltwater fish
When they first start coming to the monastery they bring all their defilements along with them
Then  as they start tasting the flavor of the Dhamma as they chant and meditate  their hearts gradually get further and further away from their concentrated saltiness their greed anger and delusion
Goodness seeps into their hearts little by little gradually diluting the evil of their defilements until their hearts are entirely fresh with the taste of the Dhamma
The restlessness and turmoil in their hearts will vanish and they'll be content to stay with the Dhamma happily and at peace like a saltwater fish that's grown accustomed to fresh water
There are four kinds of fresh water still flowing falling and shooting up
Still water is the water in lakes and wells
Flowing water is the water in rivers canals and streams
Falling water is the water of waterfalls and rain
Sometimes this type of water is so heavy and cold that it turns into hailstones which can hurt as they hit you on the head
Shootingup water is the water of fountains and geysers
In the same way there are different kinds of Dhamma  so you can choose to stay with whichever of the types of meditation themes you like
When you stay mixed up with your defilements or like to run back and forth with your external concepts and perceptions you're no different from a person floating in a boat in the middle of a stormy sea
You can't sit or lie down to get any rest because the waves are constantly striking making you dizzy and nauseous all the time
Your heart is all stirred up and can't find any peace
All you can do is cry out I'm dying
I'm dying
But when you try to pull yourself out from the mass of defilement or the balls of hellfire  bringing your mind into the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and establishing it in concentration  you free yourself from the wind and waves
You're like a person who has reached shore and is standing on firm ground
A person on firm ground can sit lie down stand walk or jump around as he likes
He's much more comfortable than a person out on the ocean
For this reason we should train our hearts to reach right concentration absolutely cutting off all our external concepts and perceptions
In this way we'll all gain shelter and rest
The flavor of the Dhamma is like ambrosia the nectar that  when you drink it  makes you immortal
If you live with the Dhamma then when you die you'll go to a good destination as a visuddhideva a deva pure in body and mind
This sort of person doesn't die easily  and doesn't die at all in the same way as people in general
If you aspire to the Deathless you should wash your thoughts and deeds with cool clean clear pure Dhamma so that they're sparkling clean
That way you'll meet with the flavor of the Deathless and go beyond death reaching the transcendent and nibbana at last
Phra Ajaan Mun Bhuridatta Mahathera was by all accounts the most highly respected Buddhist monk in recent Thai history
Ordained in he spent the major part of his life wandering through Thailand Burma and Laos dwelling for the most part in the forest engaged in the practice of meditation
He attracted a large following of students and  together with his teacher Phra Ajaan Sao Kantasila Mahathera  was responsible for the establishment of the forest ascetic tradition that has now spread throughout Thailand and to several countries abroad
Despite his fame as a teacher very few of his teachings were recorded for posterity
Only one slim book of passages drawn from his sermons Muttodaya was published during his lifetime
His students generally believed that he himself never wrote down any of his teachings but at his death the following poem was found among the few papers he left behind
As he noted on the final page he composed it during one of his brief stays in Bangkok at Wat Srapatum probably in the early 's
He was apparently inspired by an anonymous poem on the theme of meditation composed and printed in Bangkok during that period for both poems share virtually the same beginning  the lines in the following translation beginning with Once there was a man who loved himself Ajaan Mun's poem however then develops in an entirely original direction and shows by far a deeper understanding of the training of the mind
Translating the poem has presented a number of difficulties not the least of which has been getting a definitive reading of the original manuscript
Ajaan Mun wrote during the days before Thai spelling became standardized some of the passages were smudged with age and a few seem to have been corrected by a later hand
Another difficulty has been the more general problem of finding the proper English style for translating Thai poetry which depends heavily on rhyme rhythm and a strippeddown syntax somewhat like that of telegrams and newspaper headlines
This style gives Thai poetry a lightness of style combined with a richness of meaning but frustrates any attempt to pin down any one precise message for the sake of translation  an excellent lesson for anyone who feels that the truth is what is conveyed in words
The following translation is meant to be as literal as possible although I have fleshed the text out when it seemed necessary to make the English intelligible
Because the original alternates between two poetic forms  klon and rai  I tried to create a similar effect in English by alternating blank verse and free verse
The result is probably too literal to be poetry but I felt that anyone reading it would be more interested in the meaning than in verbal effects
The instances where I have taken the most liberty with the text have been included in square brackets as has one passage  ironically dealing with the error of being addicted to correcting things  where the reading of the original seems to have been doctored
The reader will notice that in a few places the poem seems to jump abruptly from one topic to another
In some cases these shifts were dictated by the rhyme scheme but in others they are not really shifts at all
Keep in mind that the poem operates on several levels
In particular two parallel themes run throughout an analysis of the external error of focusing on the faults of other people instead of one's own and a discussion of the mind's internal error of viewing the khandhas as somehow separate from its own efforts to know them
Statements made directly about one level apply indirectly to the other as well
Thus the poem covers a wider range of the practice than might appear at first glance
It's a work that rewards repeated readings
I would like to express my gratitude to Phra Ajaan Suwat Suvaco for the invaluable help he gave me in untangling some of the knottier passages in the poem
Any mistakes that may remain of course are mine
In the summer of Larry Rosenberg  one of the guiding teachers at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre Massachusetts  invited Phra Ajaan Suwat Suvaco to lead a twoweek retreat at IMS the following spring
Ajaan Suwat had been living in the United States for several years at that point founding monasteries for the Thai communities in the Seattle and Los Angeles areas but this was his first opportunity to teach large numbers of nonAsian Americans
The retreat was held in the first two weeks of May with approximately people attending
I was brought from Thailand to serve as interpreter
The format of the retreat was simple
The retreatants did sitting and walking meditation from early morning to late at night
There had been a plan to encourage them to do walking meditation in the stately forest behind the center but the weather was so chilly and rainy throughout the retreat that everyone was confined to the building
One pleasant exception was the evening of Visakha Puja  the holiday celebrating the Buddha's birth Awakening and final passing away
This occurred toward the beginning of the retreat and provided an opportunity for the retreatants to perform a candlelit circumambulation of the IMS complex as a full moon rose in the clear cold twilit sky over the pines
Throughout the retreat Ajaan Suwat led small group interviews in the afternoon and then met with all the gathered retreatants in the evening either to give a Dhamma talk or to answer questions
Larry meanwhile led individual interviews in the mornings and afternoons
Sadly the taping of Ajaan Suwat's teachings was rather haphazard
None of the afternoon sessions were taped and as for the evening sessions there were days when both the Thai and the English were recorded other days when only the English was and other days nothing
Thus our record of the retreat is fairly incomplete
Still what was recorded is extremely valuable as this sort of opportunity  for a Thai ajaan to speak directly to Westerners in their own environment and for them to ask him questions  is rare
A number of Ajaan Suwat's students have transcribed the Thai portion of the tapes and this translation is taken from that transcription
I haven't gone back to listen to the English passages on the tapes  which are available for anyone who is interested  partly out of embarrassment at my own shortcomings as an interpreter but also because I wanted to present the retreat as it sounded to Ajaan Suwat himself what he heard in the questions as they were translated to him and what points he was trying to get across
A few of the teachings he gave during the retreat are etched indelibly in my memory and yet didn't make it onto the tapes so I'd like to record them here
One was the comment he made to me after the second day of the retreat on how grim the retreatants were in their approach to the meditation
He admired their dedication but was worried that they weren't finding any joy in the practice
He attributed this to their coming directly to meditation without having first gained the sense of joyful confidence in the Buddha's teachings and in themselves that can come with a good foundation in generosity and morality
His attempts to lighten the mood of the retreat are obvious in his talks
Two exchanges in the question and answer sessions also have remained vividly in my mind
One was from an afternoon session
A man new to the practice commented You guys would have a good religion here with this Buddhism if only you had a God
That way people would have some sense of support in their practice when things aren't going well Ajaan Suwat responded If there were a God who could arrange that by my taking a mouthful of food all the beings in the world would become full I'd bow down to that God
But I haven't yet found anyone like that
The second exchange was during an evening session
A woman who had sat several retreats complained to the effect I'm finding myself frustrated in my practice of meditation
Now that I've gotten started I can't turn back and yet I don't seem to be getting anywhere Ajaan Suwat's simple response Where are you trying to go
After a brief moment of silence the woman laughed and said she was satisfied with the answer
I hope that the talks and discussions translated here will provide satisfaction for you the reader as well
 Thanissaro Bhikkhu
We've all come here through a sense of conviction intent on studying and practicing the Dhamma that will bring happiness and fulfillment to our hearts
We should understand that the Dhamma taught by the Lord Buddha doesn't lie anywhere far away
As the Canon says skillful and unskillful dhammas arise right here in the heart
If we want to study the Dhamma we have to study our own heart
When we're well acquainted with the heart we'll be well acquainted with the Dhamma
When we're well acquainted with the Dhamma we'll be well acquainted with the heart
There are times when the heart is in bad shape
Bad mental qualities get mixed up with it making it even worse making us suffer both in body and mind
These bad mental qualities are said to be unskillful
The Buddha teaches us to study these qualities so that we can abandon them
There are other times when the heart is in good shape at ease with a sense of well being
We feel at ease whether we're sitting or lying down whether we're alone or associating with our friends and relatives
When the heart gains a sense of ease in this way it's said to be staying with the Dhamma
In other words skillful mental qualities have appeared in the heart
The skillful heart is what gives us happiness
This is why the Buddha taught us to develop these skillful qualities to give rise to them within ourselves
If you were to list these skillful qualities there would be lots of them
But even though there are lots of them they all arise in our one heart
So if we want to know and see the Dhamma we have to develop mindfulness and alertness keeping watch over our heart
If the heart isn't at peace if it's distracted and turbulent we should realize that at that moment the heart is out of shape
Unskillful qualities have arisen within it
So we should try to be mindful and alert to put it back into good shape
We have to keep watch over the heart to see whether at this moment in time it's in good or bad shape
If we see that the heart isn't yet in satisfactory shape we should let go of our unskillful preoccupations and make ourselves mindful of what's good
We want to be happy so we don't want the things that will make us suffer
We should try to put the mind into good shape convinced in the practice of the Dhamma that will develop our mindfulness
We have to look after the heart so that it's confident and content in our practice
We should remind ourselves that in following this practice we're following in line with the Buddha one who knows who sees an arahant free from defilement released from suffering in the cycle of death and rebirth
The fact that we're practicing in line with the Dhamma taught by the Buddha means that we're studying in an institution of highest learning with the Buddha as our foremost teacher
So be mindful to keep your heart in good shape
Be mindful of your meditation word buddho
Or if you want you can focus on the inandout breath
When the breath comes in keep your mind at ease
When it goes out keep your mind at ease
Don't be tense don't force things don't get caught up in any desire to know or see beyond reasonable bounds
If we give rise to this kind of desire this kind of defilement it'll distract the heart
So we should be careful to be mindful to look after the mind to meditate well
Simply be mindful of the breath
When the breath comes in let it come in with ease
When it goes out let it go out with ease
Let the mind be at ease too
If anything comes along to disturb you don't get involved with it
Just keep that sense of ease going
If your mindfulness can keep maintaining your sense of contentment your sense of confidence in the practice the mind will separate from its outside preoccupations and gather into a sense of stillness
There will be a sense of lightness
Comfort
A feeling of contentment with that comfort
If it so happens that while we're trying to maintain that sense of ease in the heart disturbances come in to interfere making the mind distracted and restless we should remember that we don't have to look for that lost sense of ease anywhere else
Remember wherever there's restlessness is where there is stillness
We have to be alert to the preoccupations that have put the mind out of shape we don't want them so we shouldn't pay them any attention
We should try to remember the good preoccupations that have given us a sense of peace and calm in the past
When we can put the mind at ease in this way the things disturbing that ease will disappear right there right where the bad preoccupation was
This is like darkness no matter how long the darkness has reigned when we realize that it's darkness and that we want light we don't have to look anywhere else
If we have a lantern then as soon as we've lit it light will appear right where there was darkness before
We don't have to look anywhere else
The darkness will disappear right there where there's light
In the same way when the mind isn't at peace we don't have to look for peace anywhere else
Restlessness comes from an unskillful preoccupation peace comes from a skillful preoccupation right in the same place
When we've developed a good preoccupation that puts the mind at peace we should look after it and maintain it well
As long as this sort of preoccupation is in charge of the heart the heart will maintain its sense of ease
So we don't have to look for goodness anywhere else for that would simply distract and deceive the heart
We have to keep looking at our own heart to see if it's in good shape yet or not
Everyone has a heart and every heart has skillful and unskillful qualities
So use the quality of dhammavicaya your powers of discriminating analysis to observe the heart this sense of awareness right here within yourself
While you're sitting here listening focus your attention exclusively on your own heart
The sound of the talk will come into the heart of its own accord
You don't have to focus your attention outside on the sound or to analyze what's being said
Establish your mindfulness right at the heart
When the person speaking mentions this or that quality the awareness of that quality will arise right in your own heart
If it doesn't arise immediately then give rise to it
Say for example that the mind is in bad shape
When the person speaking mentions goodness try to give rise to a good mood within the heart
Make yourself confident content in the practice
Arouse your efforts to give rise to knowledge of things you've never before known to attain things you've never before attained to see the subtle things you've never before seen step by step within your own mind
During his lifetime the Buddha taught the Dhamma fully knowing the capabilities of his listeners aware of the level of their intelligence and potential and of which aspect of the Dhamma they'd understand most easily
He then would teach them that Dhamma
As for his listeners they would focus their attention on their own hearts and minds and would understand in line with the practices they had done in the past
When the corresponding qualities appeared in their own hearts they were able to know in line with the truth appearing within them
When the Dhamma appeared in their hearts they experienced peace and calm or gained an understanding into the truths that the Buddha taught
For example when he taught about stress and suffering his listeners focused on the stress and suffering in their own hearts
They tried to understand to the point where they saw that things couldn't be otherwise than what the Buddha taught
They really saw suffering and stress
When the Buddha taught that the flaw called the origination of stress should be abandoned they saw the suffering that comes from craving
They saw how these things are always related
Whenever craving arises suffering always follows in its wake
As a result they made an effort totally to abandon the origination of stress
The more they were able to abandon craving the weaker their suffering grew
When they were able to cut craving totally away suffering and stress totally disappeared
They then knew clearly in line with the truth
The state of their minds didn't deteriorate or fall away because they had entered into the truth
They had listened to the Dhamma and focused on their own minds in the proper way so that they could see the basic principles of the truth with their own mindfulness and discernment
As for those whose mental faculties weren't yet fully strong who had developed their faculties only to a moderate level even though they didn't reach the Dhamma while they were sitting there listening to it the Buddha taught the noble eightfold path for them to put into practice
This enabled them to gain knowledge and understanding step by step to the point where their mindfulness and discernment were strong enough to bring them to the Dhamma at a later point in line with the merit and potential they had developed on their own
As for us even though we may not reach the Dhamma while listening to it the Buddha laid down the path to the cessation of stress for us to develop by putting it into practice
This path is nothing other than the noble path right view right resolve right speech right activity right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
Having taught about the right path that we should develop he also taught about the wrong path that should be avoided
In other words he taught us
For this reason we should acquaint ourselves with both the right path and the wrong path
What sort of view ranks as the wrong view we should abandon
Wrong view starts with views about the body or physical form in general
If we view physical form in line with what the Buddha taught  that rupam aniccam physical form is inconstant rupam dukkham physical form is stressful rupam anatta physical form is notself  that's called right view
But if we see physical form as constant  or try to make it constant  that's wrong view and runs counter to the Buddha's teachings
In other words if we see that rupam niccam physical form is constant rupam sukham physical form  the body  is easeful rupam atta physical form is our self or really our own that's wrong view
If we really look at the body in line with its truth we'll see that it really is inconstant
From the moment it's born we can easily see the changes it undergoes
It ages and wears down every day
This inconstancy is why we have to keep struggling under the desire to make it constant and lasting
The nature of the body is that it's always lacking one thing or another  like a water tank that's continually leaking we have to keep adding water to it to keep it from running dry if we forget to add water it'll dry out for sure
In the same way the body is genuinely inconstant genuinely stressful
If it were constant we wouldn't have to struggle we wouldn't have to keep looking for things to keep it going we wouldn't have to work
The reason we work for money is so that we can nourish this body which is continually wasting away
The Buddha saw clearly that this work and struggle is stressful that it's intimately tied up with the inconstancy of the body
Wherever there's inconstancy there's stress
And because of that stressfulness it's inconstant
These qualities are dependent on each other
When we've contemplated so that we see this truth then we see the Dhamma
We have right view
The more the mind understands stress and suffering the more it can grow still and let down its burdens
Its greed will decrease
Its anger will decrease
Its delusion about physical form will decrease
Its burdens will decrease
This will make it brighter and more peaceful a skillful mental state arising in such a way that we can see it clearly when we contemplate the events appearing in the mind in line with their truth
When the Buddha explained right view he started with stress and suffering jatipi dukkha  birth is stressful jarapi dukkha  aging is stressful maranampi dukkham  death is stressful
These are truths found within each and every one of us  every person every living being
Whether or not we study the matter this is the way things are in actuality ever since who knows when
For hundreds and thousands of years in the past wherever there has been birth there has had to be aging illness and death in its wake
The same thing is true in the present and even on into the future every person who takes birth will have to meet with these things
This teaching is the genuine truth
It will never change into anything else
No matter how many hundreds or thousands of people will be born they will all have to meet with illness will all have to age will all have to die each and every one of them
Not one of them will remain
No matter what knowledge they attain what weapons they invent they won't be able to win out over this genuine truth
So once we've developed right view in this way we have to eliminate our defilements  in other words our intoxication with our youth our intoxication with being free from disease our intoxication with being alive
We'll then be able to behave in a way that will be to our own true benefit as long as we are still alive
As we develop mindfulness in contemplating the body in and of itself seeing its true nature and developing right view our heart will get more and more convinced of this reality and will grow farther and farther away from wrong view
We'll be able to develop right view more continually
This is the path that will lead us to attain the Dhamma the ultimate peace
As we develop right view then right resolve will be no problem because our resolve to meditate so as to develop right view is in and of itself right resolve the resolve to see the Dhamma to know the Dhamma in line with the truth that appears in our own body beginning with the truth of stress and suffering
Our body is composed of birth As soon as there's birth there has to be suffering
We suffer because of birth
Hunger desire intense heat and cold all of these things come from birth
And no matter how carefully and adequately we look after the body it has to keep on aging and wasting away
No matter how much we plead with it it won't listen to us
It just keeps on aging
And on top of that it has all kinds of diseases
If you really look at the body you'll see that diseases can arise at any time at all
It's a home for diseases
It has eyes and so there are eye diseases
It has ears and so there are ear diseases
It has a nose and so there are nose diseases
It has a tongue and so there are tongue diseases
Diseases can arise in each and every one of its parts
This is a genuine truth  which is why there are doctors and hospitals in every country
All people of all races have to depend on medicine
Even the person telling you this has diseases just like everyone else
When we look to really see the truth we'll see that the Buddha's teachings aren't in the least bit mistaken they're right here in each and every one of us
If we develop our minds properly in line with the truth so that its views are right our restlessness and distraction will grow calm
We'll see that the greed we've felt in the past has served no real purpose
When anger arises toward other people we'll see that it serves no real purpose that it's nothing but stress and suffering
We'll see that our only way out is to make the mind still this is the way to true happiness
We'll gain disenchantment seeing  given the true nature of things  that what we've busied ourselves with has served us no real purpose
It's tired us out to no real purpose created difficulties to no real purpose and has left us with nothing at all that we can truly call our own
Think about all the things you've sought and amassed from your birth up to the present moment is there anything there that you can really depend on
Anything you can really call your own
Nothing at all
None of those things can really help you
They may help you a bit but not enough to give you any real happiness
So I ask that you all work at developing right view
Meditate on the four frames of reference so as to develop discernment
As you meditate  sitting standing walking and lying down  stay mindful of the body which is filled with inconstancy
No matter where you look it's inconstant
It's also full of stress
Wherever you look you see that diseases and pains can arise at any time
It can age at any time
There's no part of it that's totally free of aches and pains
If you don't believe me take a sharp spike and stab any part of the body and you'll see that it hurts wherever you stab
You can see clearly in line with the truth that the whole body is stressful
As for buddho the awareness in the mind it'll be aware that what's really important is not the body it's the mind
When you see the drawbacks and stresses of the body then discernment clarity and calm will arise in the heart freeing it from its burdens and karma debts related to the body
In this way we let go of our heavy burden nicchato parinibbuto free from hunger unbound reaching a bliss and peace that is lasting
So I ask all of you  who have conviction who want peace who want happiness in your daytoday life  to develop mindfulness to develop right view
Look at the body in and of itself
The body in and of itself is mentioned in the Great Frames of Reference Discourse but it's not in the words
It's not there in the book
It's right here
When we practice we don't have to recite the words
We look right at our own body at what's already here
Mindfulness is something we already have all we need to do is apply it to the body
If we're not mindful of the body then it's not right mindfulness
When we're mindful of the body there's our mindfulness the mindfulness that will enable us to practice that will enable us to know
If we keep observing the body we're sure to see what's here
The more we observe the more proficient we'll become
We'll understand clearly and correctly
The more clearly we see the more effort  right effort  we'll put into knowing and seeing even more fully
Right mindfulness will be more continually mindful and right concentration more firmly established
Right speech and right activity will follow in their wake
So develop right view in your hearts by developing the frames of reference
Keep track of the body in and of itself train in line with the truth by day and by night whether you're sitting standing walking or lying down
When you practice correctly no one with any true wisdom will be able to take issue with you for you're focused on the genuine truth the inconstancy the stress and suffering all four of the four noble truths that can be seen right here in this body
These things can't be seen anywhere else
If we really develop right view with regard to these things results will arise within us
When results arise the nature of the mind is that it will know on its own
It won't have to be told
All that's necessary is that you practice rightly
Begin trying from this moment on
Don't get distracted by this person saying that or that person saying this
There's nowhere else you have to look
The evidence is your own body
How inconstant it is you'll know for yourself
It won't lie to you
How stressful it is  how many diseases aches and pains  you'll know for yourself
It won't lie to you
The truth is always there for you to see
Practicing to see in line with the truth in this way is called seeing the Dhamma the nature of reality in and of itself
We'll come to see the truth all the way through and gain release from suffering and stress
So keep at it
When you gain any understandings of any sort we can discuss them as they arise step by step until you gain genuine release from suffering and stress
But this will be enough for now
One of the principles of the Dhamma is that if you visualize anything in your meditation you should visualize only things lying within you so that you see physical fabrication in the body and mental fabrication in the mind in line with their true nature
For example at present you're not yet old but you're taught to visualize yourself as growing old in the same way you've seen other people grow old
Remind yourself that as the years pass you'll have to age in just the same way
Aging is stressful
Your eyes won't be able to see as clearly as when you were young
Your ears won't be able to hear in the same way as when you were young
It'll be painful to sit down to stand to walk
There will be all kinds of obstacles
So now before you grow old you should accelerate your efforts at developing goodness so that it will be a refuge for the heart when old age comes
In other words accelerate your efforts at practicing the Dhamma and training the mind to find peace
One of the Ten Recollections taught by the Buddha is recollection of death When you see other people dying other animals dying you should reflect on the fact that you will have to die just like everyone else
Repeat the word maranam maranam in the mind and look at yourself you're going to have to die for sure
As you reflect maranam maranam it may happen that as your mind grows still a vision of your own death will appear within you
If your mindfulness is good and you have your wits about you then the more clearly you see death in this way the more the mind will grow still with an even greater sense of well being
As you watch death clearly seeing the body decay concentration grows even stronger
If you visualize death so that you can see it clearly you'll realize that there's nothing to be gained by growing attached to the body
When you see the truth in this way you'll see that your past greed for things served no real purpose
The anger you've felt in the past what purpose did it serve
You'll see that greed anger and delusion are stressful and serve no purpose  for ultimately we'll have to let go of everything that comes along with them
You'll see that this sense of peace and ease in the mind is what serves a real purpose
When the mind is at peace in this way it doesn't want anything else
All it wants is peace and that's enough
I'll tell you a story
It's time you listened to something light for a change so that you won't be so tense and grim
It's important that you first let yourself relax
Once Ajaan Funn my teacher was wandering through the forest in Baan Phyy district Udorn Thani province and stopped to spend the night not far from a certain village
He saw that it was a congenial place and so stayed on there to practice meditation
A woman living in the village would often come in the morning to give him alms and then again in the evening to hear his Dhamma talks
Ajaan Funn taught her to meditate something she had never done before
It so happened that she was afraid of ghosts
Wherever she went she was afraid of ghosts and so she never went anywhere alone
Especially at night she was really afraid
When Ajaan Funn taught her to meditate she didn't want to because she was afraid that she'd see a corpse or a ghost
On following days Ajaan Funn asked her how her meditation was going and she couldn't answer him because she hadn't meditated
After a while she began to feel embarrassed He keeps teaching me to meditate and yet all I do is hold onto my fear of ghosts So she decided Whatever may happen I'm going to meditate So she started to meditate
At first she simply focused on repeating the word buddho as she watched her breath come in and out
As her mind began to relax it began to drift a bit and a vision arose she saw a corpse lying stretched out in front of her
When she saw the corpse she began to feel afraid
Then the corpse moved in so that it was lying on her lap
With the corpse on her lap she couldn't get up to run away
And that's when she remembered her buddho
She wanted buddho to come and help her
So she kept thinking buddho buddho more and more intensely
As she was doing this one part of her mind was afraid the other part kept recollecting buddho buddho until the corpse disappeared from her lap and turned into herself
That was when she had a vision of her chest bursting wide open
Her heart was bright very bright
In the brightness of her heart she could see all kinds of things
She could see what other people were thinking what animals were thinking
She knew all kinds of things and felt really amazed
From that point on her fear of ghosts disappeared
Her heart grew peaceful and at ease
The next day she went to see Ajaan Funn
Ajaan Funn was sick with a fever but he forced himself to get up to greet her and give her a Dhamma talk as he had on previous days just as if he wasn't sick at all
After the talk she immediately said to him Than Ajaan your heart isn't bright and blooming at all
It looks withered and dry
You must be very sick Ajaan Funn was surprised How does she know the state of my mind But he had noticed that her manner was different from what it had been on previous days
She was very composed and polite
She had bowed down very politely her words had been gentle and very respectful
When she commented on his heart that way he wondered Does she really know the state of my mind So when she returned to the village he forced himself to sit and meditate to the point where the fever broke and went away
His heart grew peaceful bright and at ease
The next day when the time came that the woman would come he decided to play sick in order to test her
When she arrived he didn't get up to greet her and stayed lying down as if he was sick
After she bowed down she sat to meditate for a moment and then said Why your lotus  meaning his heart  your lotus is really blooming That was when Ajaan Funn realized that she was really meditating well
From that point on she could come in the evening without the slightest fear of ghosts or spirits
And she continued to meditate well
Her mind never deteriorated
To tell the truth she had never studied in school and didn't know much of the Dhamma but because of her respect for Ajaan Funn when he taught her to meditate she followed his instructions
Whether it was because of her past merit or what I don't know but she gained peace of mind developed her discernment and was able to know her own heart and the hearts of other people
So those of you who have come here to meditate don't underestimate yourselves thinking that you won't gain anything or come to any insights
Don't be so sure
If you keep up your efforts and practice correctly it might very well happen that you'll gain insight
If things come together properly the day will come when you know when you see the Dhamma
It could very well happen
So keep up your efforts
After the retreat is over when you go back home keep using your mindfulness to keep watch over yourself
In your comings and goings keep training your mindfulness as you do while you're here as a means of maintaining the state of your mind through practicing restraint of the senses
This will develop your mindfulness and give it power
That way you'll find that things go more smoothly when the time comes to train the mind to be still
Are there any other questions
You can compare it to a nation at peace with no war no strife no conflicts no crime
That nation will have the sense of ease that comes with being at peace
If a family lives in harmony with no quarreling that family will have the sense of ease that comes with being at peace
If the body is free from disease strong enough to be used for whatever work you want to do it's called a body at peace and has the sense of ease that comes with being at peace
If the mind isn't disturbed by the defilements that would put it into a turmoil it's at peace in line with its nature
Even nibbana is peace  a peace that lasts and can never be disturbed
That's why nibbana is the ultimate ease
Our job at present is to know the process of fabrication as it appears in the body and mind
We shouldn't let ourselves be deluded by the fabrications of the body
We should know their true nature
The same holds true with the mental fabrications issues of good and bad that affect the mind we shouldn't be deluded by them shouldn't fall for them
When we're wise to them and can't be fooled by them we'll gain the discernment that puts an end to suffering and stress because we're no longer misled by what fabrication keeps telling us
For instance when the eye sees a beautiful form a form that we've liked in the past we tend to fall for it
We want it
This greed of ours creates a disturbance defiles the mind all over again
When the ear hears a beautiful sound we've liked that we've fallen for in the past the process of fabrication will make us like it again
Greed arises desire arises the mind gets disturbed all over again
When a good smell comes into the nose we fall for it
When the tongue touches a flavor we like we fall for it again
When our mindfulness and alertness aren't up on what's happening we like these things
We fall for them
We search for them
This is what gives rise to craving in the mind the origination of suffering and stress
And so we suffer
For this reason our discernment has to be fully aware of this aspect of fabrication as well
Once discernment is trained then when we see a form hear a sound smell an aroma taste a flavor we can recall that these things are fabrications
They're inconstant
When fabrication is inconstant the pleasure that comes from fabrication is undependable
We shouldn't get carried away by the pleasures that come from those fabrications
Otherwise when they change we'll keep experiencing pain again and again until those fabrications have disappeared
When they disappear we struggle to gain them again come into conflict with other people again fall out with them quarrel with them develop animosities develop bad kamma with them  all because we've fallen for fabrications
So we have to reflect on the fact that fabrications are inconstant
We shouldn't latch onto them grow attached to them or fall for them so much
So we should keep making an effort at training the mind using various techniques to look after it so that it'll settle down and be still
That way we'll gain the strength that will help us when pain and discomfort arise in the heart
We'll have our hideout  for when we stay with this sense of stillness we'll have an excellent hideout from danger
When meditators go wandering through the forest their teachers usually have them stay in places that are scary
If there's a place where tigers are known to frequent the teachers will have their students go stay there
There are cases where meditators have gained mindfulness gained concentration gained rapture and ease all from their fear of being eaten by tigers
But you have to be brave
Even though you may be afraid you have to be brave at the same time
If you're simply afraid and run away instead of meditating it won't accomplish anything
There are quite a few meditation masters who when they heard tigers closing in on them at night grew so afraid that they couldn't bear it
There was no way for them to escape because it was nighttime and they were staying in a place where
 In the frames of reference that we're practicing we're taught to reflect on the food we eat the other necessities of life we use to see that they're simply things for us to depend on for a short while
Don't grow attached to them
You can choose the things you buy and store up for your use but the mind should keep reflecting that they fall under the Three Characteristics
They're uncertain
When we want to use these things for our benefit we should look after them but we shouldn't let ourselves suffer when they deteriorate and change
Tell yourself this is a task you have to do with mindfulness discernment and correct awareness
You don't have to depend on desire
When you do the work correctly the results will come on their own
Even if people with no religion were to take over the government or were to gain the power to oppress the monks and people at large they'd be able to hold power only temporarily  because the type of power that knows no religion or morality that would govern in an unfair way can't really maintain peace and order in a country
There are ideologies that when they take over the government give no freedom to the people don't allow them to practice religion or to hold other beliefs
And as we've seen they can stay in power only temporarily
As time passes the people get rid of them push them out
We can see this clearly at present in almost every country where unfair ideologies are in power people are demanding the freedoms that we have here in America where the government gives weight to human rights and where the people are pleased with this system
Suppose that some groups were to try to change this system
The vast majority of the people wouldn't go along with them for sure
In the same way ninety percent of the people in Thailand are Buddhist
If the government showed no respect for Buddhism the people wouldn't go along with it for sure
There have been times in the past when the government thought somewhat along those lines but they never succeeded because the majority of the people didn't go along with them
The current king is widely loved and respected because of his reputation for developing the country and helping the people in the proper way
He holds fast to Buddhist principles both in his own personal behavior and in his dealings with the people
For this reason the power of the Buddha's teachings is still deeply embedded in the hearts of the Thai people
They are deeply appreciative of the fact that the king respects the Buddha's teachings and practices in line with them strictly observing the precepts and staying firmly established in the practice of meditation
This is why the Buddha started out teaching these basic principles  the five precepts  to lay people so as to release them from this sort of thing
It's like walking up the stairs to your house
The stairs have five steps the five levels of jhana
The first time the mind reaches a subtle level of stillness is the first step
When you haven't yet started climbing the stairs you should content yourself with getting to the first step
But when you've reached the first step you shouldn't content yourself simply with the fact that you've gotten up off the ground and stop right there  for the first step isn't your house
So you should remind yourself of the fact that it's not your house you haven't yet reached shelter and then look for the second step
When you've reached the second step you should remind yourself that you still haven't reached shelter so you have to take the next step
In the same way when you've reached a subtle level of stillness and experienced just this level of pleasure and ease you should ponder this ease to see that it's not yet constant
It can still change
There are still higher levels of ease
Today you've gotten this far the next step will be to keep moving up until you reach genuine ease
What I've explained so far should be enough for today
Talking a lot can get you confused for you're still new to this training
Your memory can handle only so much
Like students just beginning their studies if they study a lot of advanced material and stuff it into their brains it won't all stay there
It's the same when we practice meditation
Your mindfulness and discernment can take only so much
Listen to just a little bit and then put it into practice so as to strengthen your mindfulness and discernment so as to strengthen your concentration
In that way you'll be able to take in more refined levels of Dhamma
At this stage I want you to stop listening and to go back to look at your mind is it willing to accept the training
Is it able to follow it
Or is it still stubborn
If the mind isn't yet willing to accept and follow the training reason with it until it is
Get the mind to reach what you've been hearing about so that it sees the results clearly within itself
Your knowledge on this level isn't knowledge from the mind
It's knowledge from concepts
As for the mind it hasn't yet taken these things in
If when you meditate you find that your mind is still restless and distracted unwilling to do what you want it to do that's a sign that it hasn't yet accepted the teachings
So you have to reason with it over and over again
If on the other hand you can remember only one concept but can train the mind so that it can take in the truth of that concept then learning about concepts serves a purpose
If the mind isn't willing to take in the truth of that concept then knowing concepts doesn't serve any purpose
So I'll ask to stop today's questionandanswer session here
The word inconstancy for the most part is used in connection with fabrications sankhara anicca  fabrications are inconstant
The word fabrications here carries a very broad meaning on the level of theoretical Dhamma but in terms of the practice for giving rise to discernment fabrications means the body and mind
So while you listen to this talk on inconstancy focus your attention on your own body for it's something easy to know and to see
Then I'll explain the changes and inconstancy in it
What is the purpose of studying inconstancy
This is something we should look into
Studying inconstancy has many benefits
In particular the Buddha taught us to be mindful of the body mindful of the fact that once the body is born it has to keep changing day in and day out
The happiness and pleasures we get from the body on a daily basis are inconstant
If they were constant we wouldn't have to look for happiness and pleasure anywhere else
But the fact is that the pleasure we have as soon as we've experienced it for a while gives out  regardless of what kind of pleasure it is
This is why the Buddha says it's inconstant it requires us to stir ourselves to search to store things up
The things we stir ourselves to search for if we gain things that are good that we like we get possessive
And when there are things we love and like other people like them too
Many people who see what we have will want it as well
This gives rise to competition to cheating and swindling as people try to get what they want
From this comes hatred animosity and vengeance
This shows the inconstancy within the body the constant changes in the happiness we want
The mind suffers negative impacts from the pleasure and pain that are such a confusing turmoil within it
When we realize this truth the Buddha taught us to develop the discernment needed to comprehend it
And he laid down another principle Natthi santi param sukham  there is no happiness higher than peace
The peace here is peace in the Dhamma the peace that comes from practicing the Dhamma
He pointed out that peace is the highest happiness and showed us the path to that peace which we're practicing right now developing tranquillity and insight exercising restraint over our words and deeds and training our mind
So we should turn in to look at ourselves
When we understand that the body and the pleasures we experience are inconstant the mind state that used to feel attachment that used to deceive itself into thinking that it was in possession of happiness We try to change things so that our pleasure will be constant
We don't see the drawbacks of the suffering we've been through
Delusion and misunderstanding thus arise in the mind that hasn't seen the peace offering a happiness more subtle and refined than what we're generally used to
This is why we have to depend on the Dhamma depend on our conviction in the Buddha
If we look at the fabrications that the Buddha said are inconstant and stressful we'll see that what he said is really true
The pleasures we've experienced don't really suffice
We have to study to look for knowledge to find a refuge more dependable than what we've known
This is why we have to depend on the teachings of the Buddha
When we've heard them we train our minds to be still to let go
We have to give ourselves the opportunity to make our minds empty and still
When we say the mind is empty that means that it's disengaged
It's not restless and distracted
It doesn't have a lot of preoccupations
The same as when we do demanding work if we keep at it a lot the body gets tired
When it's tired we disengage it from the work
We sit down or lie down to rest
When it has rested at normalcy the tiredness goes away
We regain our strength
When we've regained our strength we can resume our work
We see that working uses up energy
When our energy is used up resting gathers energy
The resting is part of the pleasure and ease that comes when the body is empty in other words disengaged from its work
It's the same with the mind
We look for happiness all the time because we want precisely this sense of ease
When the mind isn't empty and disengaged we keep looking
We should train the mind to be still
When the mind is still here in this sense of awareness itself it's empty and disengaged
It's not thinking about anything
It's empty through its stillness
But we can't keep it empty and still like this all the time
We still have our clingingaggregates
We still have our eyes and the mind wants to see things
We still have our ears nose tongue and body
There are still sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations
We still have feelings of pleasure and pain
These things are always disturbing us
So this is why the Buddha teaches us once we've gotten the mind to settle down and be still to contemplate the inconstancy of the body
That way we'll come to understand that the body is really inconstant and stressful
As long as we're still attached to the body as me or mine we'll have to suffer from aging illness and death at all times
So we should let go of these things and hold onto the Dhamma making the mind still
That way we'll give rise to stillness and ease
We'll see that the body is inconstant aging and wasting away that stress and suffering arise because of this inconstancy
Ultimately the whole body falls apart
When it falls apart what is it like
It grows putrid and decays
It doesn't belong to anyone
This is why the Buddha taught us to yathabhutam sammappaññaya datthabbam to see things as they are with right discernment to let them go to have no attachment to the aggregates not to view them as self
When this is the case the mind won't feel any greed for it sees that greed serves no purpose
When we've seen this truth the angers we've felt in the past will grow weaker
Knowledge will arise in the place of our past delusions
When the mind contemplates and develops discernment to the point where it's able once and for all to make itself pure totally abandoning the defilements of greed anger and delusion  or passion aversion and delusion  then that's called a mind truly empty empty of defilement empty of greed anger and delusion because it's no longer carrying anything around
If you carry things they're heavy
They defile the mind
If you don't hold on and carry them the mind is empty
Pure
It doesn't have to look for anything ever again
This emptiness of the mind comes from our understanding inconstancy
So if you aspire to this emptiness you should contemplate inconstancy to see it clearly to make your discernment alert and wise to the truth
The mind  whose defilements depend on inconstant things to give rise to greed anger and delusion  won't be able to give rise to them any more because it's grown disenchanted
It doesn't want them
It will grow empty and enter into stillness
The mind is empty because its defilements are gone
To summarize the three characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself exist only in the mind with defilements
When the mind has the discernment to kill off the defilements for good there's nothing inconstant stressful or notself within it
That's why it's empty
As for our minds at present they're not empty because they haven't been able to chase the defilements all out
Even though we're able to develop mindfulness and meditate to the point where we experience stillness and ease that's only a little bit of temporary emptiness
As soon as mindfulness lapses things come in to disturb us all over again
That's because we're not empty of defilement
The ultimate defilement is unawareness
Every defilement whether blatant moderate or subtle has unawareness mixed in with it
This is why the Buddha taught us to train our minds to give rise to awareness the opponent of unawareness
Whichever side is stronger will win out and hold power over the mind
If awareness wins out the defilements have no place to stay
If unawareness wins out there's no peace and ease
No purity
The mind isn't empty
Stress and suffering arise
To know the unawareness already in the mind is awfully difficult
It's like using darkness to illuminate darkness you can't see anything
Or like two blind people leading each other along they'll have a hard time escaping from dangers and reaching their goal
This is why we have to depend on people with good eyes in other words mindfulness and discernment
These are the crucial factors that will lead us to the end of the path
An example of how we can put mindfulness to use suppose we aren't yet acquainted with anicca
We don't know where it is
When we hear that anicca refers to the inconstancy of the five aggregates beginning with physical form we apply mindfulness to keeping these things in mind to see if they really are inconstant
Or suppose we feel that we gain pleasure from holding onto the body as our self we keep on providing for it and fixing it so that we don't see its stress and inconstancy
In this way we've gone astray from the Buddha's teachings
So we use mindfulness to keep the body in mind
For example we're mindful of hair
Is our hair constant
Does it always stay the same or not
Think of the first strand of hair that grew on your head
It was cut off long ago
The hair we have now is new hair
It keeps changing
The first strand of hair no longer serves us any purpose
We don't even know where it's gone
This is one way of contemplating inconstancy
As for anatta or notself The hair that in the past we thought was ours  where is it now
If we think in this way we'll come to understand the teaching on notself
If we contemplate the things that the Buddha said are notself we'll see that what he said is absolutely true
We'll see the truth and our own mind is what sees the truth in line with what the Buddha said our body doesn't have any essence it just keeps sloughing away
And as for what he said about the body's being unclean when it dies no one can dress it up to make it really clean
As soon as it falls down dead everyone detests it
When we reflect more and more profoundly on this the mind will come to accept that what the Buddha taught is the genuine truth
When the mind accepts this its ignorance will gradually disappear
Discernment  knowledge in line with the Buddha's teachings  will gradually take shape in our minds
So when the mind contemplates hair profoundly until it knows the truth and its ignorance disappears knowledge  beginning with knowledge about the true nature of our hair  will arise
The unawareness with which we clung to the hair as us or ours seeing it as beautiful dressing it up with perfumes making it lovely and attractive we'll see that all that was an act of selfdelusion
If the true nature of these things was really good we wouldn't have to do any of that for it would already be good
It's because it's not good that we have to make it good
That's one way in which our own views have deluded us
The Buddha told us to know the truth of this matter so that the mind will be able to let go
When the mind lets go all its defilements lighten and disappear because our views are right
Defilements arise because of wrong views because of ignorance or unawareness of the truth
Ignorance gives rise to delusion and mistaken assumptions which turn into wrong views
This is why we have to make an effort to give rise to awareness
For example suppose we aren't aware that the hair nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones in our body are composed of the properties of earth water wind and fire
Actually this physical form of ours is nothing more than the four properties
The water property includes all the liquid parts of the body such as bile phlegm lymph mucus urine blood fat oil
The earth property includes all the hard and solid parts such as hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow etc
The wind property includes the breath the breath energy in the stomach the energy that rises up in the body the energy that goes down the energy that flows all over the body
The fire property includes the warmth that keeps the body from decaying the warmth that helps with the digestion and the warmth that keeps the body alive at the right temperature
Altogether the body is nothing but these four properties
When we don't realize this that's called unawareness
We aren't acquainted with the body the aggregates
When we learn about this awareness can begin to arise
This is why we're taught to contemplate the parts of the body kesa hair of the head loma hair of the body nakha nails danta teeth taco skin
New monks are taught these things from the very day of their ordination so that they can eliminate unawareness and give rise to awareness through the light of mindfulness and discernment
I ask that you develop a lot of mindfulness and discernment in this area so that your minds will reach the emptiness and freedom you want
Discernment here means the awareness that comes from studying the five aggregates
No other knowledge can destroy this defilement of unawareness
So when you want to destroy the defilement of unawareness you have to carefully study the five aggregates beginning with the body until you see the four noble truths right here in the five aggregates
Actually the five aggregates are things whose true nature is well within our power to study and know
First there's the aggregate of form or the physical body
Then there are the mental aggregates feeling perception mental fabrications and consciousness
These are things we can know
We have to study and practice so that we can know all four of these mental aggregates in line with their true nature
Each of these aggregates covers a lot of aspects
For instance physical form yankinci rupam atitanagatapaccuppannam ajjhattam va bahiddha va  there are all kinds of forms that can fool and delude us internal and external blatant and subtle past present and future
But when insight arises in full strength it'll show us the way to see without much difficulty
All that's needed is that you first start with the basic meditation themes such as the hair of the head and see them clearly in line with their nature
Then discernment will gradually arise
Do you understand this
You can say that the Dhamma is subtle but you can also say that it's right here within us within our own bodies
All the things I've discussed here when you haven't yet put them into practice but would like to see these truths you shouldn't let mindfulness wander outside the body
Contemplate things in line with their true nature
Don't let prejudice get in the way
Remind yourself that this is the Dhamma
That's enough explanation for now
When you study things but don't put them into practice your knowledge doesn't get you anywhere
So now that you know the path I'd like you to focus your intention on practicing a lot
I'll ask to stop here so that you can put your knowledge into practice and benefit from it
May you all meet with well being
When meditators' minds have reached genuine happiness in the Dhamma through their mindfulness and discernment clearly seeing the four noble truths none of them  not one  will revert to looking for happiness in the world or in material things
That's because happiness in the Dhamma is a lasting happiness solid refined and genuinely pure
If you compare worldly happiness with the happiness of the Dhamma you'll see that there's not even the least real happiness to it
It offers nothing but stress nothing but drawbacks
So why do we think it's happiness
Because we're burning with pain
We look to worldly happiness and pleasures to relieve the pain which then goes away for a while but then comes back again
For instance the Buddha said that birth is stress but ordinary people regard it as something happy
We don't see the stress and pain involved
Yet once the mind has reached the happiness of the Dhamma it can see that birth is really stressful just as the Buddha said
The reason we have to look after ourselves take care of ourselves and still can't find any peace is because these things that have been born come to disturb us
We sit down and get some pleasure and ease from sitting down but after a while it becomes painful
We say that it's pleasant to lie down but that's true only at the very beginning
After we've lain down for a long time it begins to get unpleasant
So we have to keep changing postures in order to gain pleasure
We look for this thing or that but as soon as we've gained just a little pleasure from them stress and pain come in their wake
If we have a family and home to live pleasantly together there are only little pleasures which have us fooled and deceived while there are hundreds and thousands of unpleasant things
The happiness and pleasure that come from external things material things is never enough
It keeps wearing away wearing away and wearing us out to no purpose at all
This is why those who have reached the Dhamma don't return to this world so filled with sorrows and turmoil
And this is why I want you to put an effort into meditating contemplating in line with the Dhamma
Even if you aren't yet convinced of the Dhamma at least take the teachings of the Buddha as your working principles
For example when the Buddha teaches about the Three Characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself we should train our minds to see in line with what he said
Give him a try
For example he says that this body of ours is filled with all sorts of unclean things
We may not agree but at least give it a try to see what happens when you look at things in line with what he says
He says it's not clean
Atthi imasmim kaye  in this body there is hair of the head and it's not clean hair of the body and it's unclean nails and they're not clean
Don't be in a hurry to reject the Buddha's teachings
Take a look to see whether these things really are unclean or not
When the mind focuses on these things more and more steadily and begins to feel quiet and at ease the truth of these things will gradually appear more and more clearly
Conviction in the Dhamma in the practice will arise
Energy will arise as we want to see more
As this awareness grows greater the mind will grow more luminous and still
This is the way of the practice
When you go back home remember this simple principle practice meditation by observing your body observing your mind
Use your mindfulness to keep track of the body in and of itself so as to know it in line with its truth
If you don't look at the body then look at the mind in and of itself
When you observe the movements of the body and mind the pleasures and pains that arise so often you'll develop awareness and skill
You'll learn how to handle things in line with the Buddha's teachings
You'll gain the discernment that sees and knows the truth
You'll see things more and more clearly
The more clearly you see things the stronger and more quiet the mind will grow
You'll see the body as stressful and unclean but you'll have to look after the mind keeping yourself wise to the fact that the stress and uncleanliness are an affair of the body not of the mind
The body has been unclean all along
We've lived with it all this time so there's no need to be afraid of seeing these things no need to reject them
We should contemplate the body so as to give rise to a sense of chastened dispassion
When you let go of the body let go in a discerning way
Don't let go in a way in which delusion and misunderstanding overcome the mind
Don't get disgusted with the body so that the mind becomes restless and agitated and stops meditating
That kind of dislike is wrong
When we look at things we don't like  such as the inconstancy the stressfulness and the unattractiveness of the body  remember that they're part of the noble truths
The Buddha said that they're very beneficial
Contemplating the unattractiveness of the body is very beneficial because it serves an important purpose
If we see the body properly in this way it helps the mind grow still with a sense of disenchantment
And that's what will cure our delusions and misunderstandings
This is why when ordaining a monk the very first step is to teach him the five meditation themes  kesa hair of the head loma hair of the body nakha nails danta teeth taco skin  as a way of developing discernment and knowledge of the truth
So hold onto these themes and keep contemplating them regardless of whether the mind is still or not
Whenever you have any free time contemplate them
You can contemplate them even while you're working
Contemplate them until you get down to the minute details in a way that gives rise to a sense of stillness and ease
It's similar to when we do physical work
We get wages for each hour we work
The more hours we work the higher our pay
But if you get greedy and keep working without rest then the body wears out the mind grows weak and you can't work any more
So you have to rest and eat to regain the strength of your body and nerves
Even though you don't get paid for the time you rest you're willing to take the loss for the sake of your strength of body and mind so that you can contend with the work after you've rested
It's the same when you meditate if you just keep contemplating and investigating it won't be long before the mind gets restless and agitated
So you have to bring the mind to stillness to avoid its getting restless
If it gets restless it'll have no peace
It'll get all tied up in knots and will grow weary of the meditation
So contemplate for a while until you can sense that the mind wants to stop and rest then focus back on the inandout breath or anything else that will serve as a gathering point for the mind
Gradually let go of your contemplation gradually let the mind settle down so as to gain strength from the sense of pleasure and ease that come in this way
Don't worry about how long you should stay there
Even though the mind doesn't seem to be gaining any knowledge don't worry about it
It's as when you're resting from physical labor even though your boss doesn't give you anything for the hour you rest you're willing for the sake of gaining energy  in this case strength of mind
This is why the Noble Disciples constantly practice concentration constantly get the mind to settle down
After they've contemplated to the point where the mind gets weary they let the mind grow still
After it's had enough stillness they go back to their contemplation
This is how we should practice
If we practice in this way the mind will gain energy and strength will gain discernment to the end point of all suffering and stress seeing things for what they actually are
The question asked the other day  how to practice when you go back home  was a very good question
The answer is keep looking after your mind in the way I've described here
Practice exercising your own mindfulness and discernment
When the Buddha spoke about karma after his Awakening to the truth he was referring to action
There's physical karma ie the actions of the body verbal karma the actions of speech and mental karma the actions of the mind
All human beings all living beings experience good things and bad pleasure and pain from karma  their own actions
Karma is something very subtle
When you ask about rebirth and how you'll experience pleasure and pain in future lives you should first study karma in your present life your actions in your present life
Understand your actions in the present life clearly
Once you understand them once you know the truth of action in the present then when you train the mind further you'll gradually come to the end of your doubts
There's no one who has ever resolved doubts about rebirth simply through reading or hearing the spoken word
Even among those who've practiced a long time if their discernment isn't up to the task they'll still have their same old doubts
The texts tell us that doubt is ended only with the attainment of the first of the noble paths called streamentry
Streamenterers have cut away three defilements selfidentity views doubt and attachment to precepts and practices
When the discernment of the noble path arises knowledge of birth and death rebirth and redeath arises together with it
As for our current level of discernment if we want to know about these things we need to do the preliminary work
We need to study the nature of action in the present
So today I won't speak of future lifetimes
I'll teach about the three kinds of action  physical action verbal action and mental action  in the present
These three kinds of action are divided into two sorts good and bad
Bad actions give rise to suffering
Good actions give rise to good results happiness prosperity mindfulness and discernment both in the present and on into future days future months future years
Bad actions are called unskillful karma
The Buddha taught that we should abandon this kind of karma
In the area of physical action that includes tormenting and killing living beings whether large or small
This kind of action is unskillful because it lacks good will and compassion
All living beings love their life
If we kill them it's unskillful because we have no compassion no pity no regard for their lives
This is why the Buddha told us not to do it
If we kill other human beings we get punished in the present both by the civil law and by the Dhamma
These three things  killing stealing and illicit sex  are all called unskillful physical karma
We should contemplate them to see why the Buddha told us not to do them
When we've contemplated them we'll see that they really aren't good things to do because we wouldn't want anyone to do them to us
For example the wealth that we've earned is something we're possessive of
It's something we want to use as we like
If someone were to steal it from us or cheat us out of it then even if that person used to be our friend that's the end of the friendship
We can't live with that person any longer
We're sure to have a quarrel and a falling out
That person might even have to go to jail for the theft
This is crude karma the kind whose results are visible in the immediate present
The same holds true with the third precept
Once we've decided to get married to live with another person then if that person cheats on us think of how much suffering there will be for both sides
People who want peace or who are established in morality won't praise the other person as being a good person
All of these things are unskillful physical actions that the Buddha taught us to abandon
As for verbal karma there are four kinds of unskillful action lying divisive speech harsh speech and idle chatter
And in the area of mental karma there are three greed ill will and wrong views
Whoever does any of these ten kinds of unskillful actions  the three kinds of unskillful physical karma the four kinds of unskillful verbal karma and the three kinds of unskillful mental karma  is an unskillful person
This is why we're taught that we're the owners of our actions
If we act in these mistaken ways we become mistaken people
We're the ones who are defiled by those actions no one else is defiled by what we do
This is why we're taught to reflect every day that we're the owner of our actions
If we do something bad we become bad people and we have to reap the bad results the suffering that arises from that action
That's why we're taught that we're the heirs to our actions
If we don't abandon those actions if we keep doing them often the results of those actions will follow us wherever we go
There's no way we can be regarded as good people
This is why we're taught that we're followed by our actions
Wherever we go if we don't give up that kind of behavior we'll be mistrusted by society
The reason the Buddha has us reflect on these things  that we're the owners of our actions heirs to our actions followed by our actions  is so that we'll pay attention to our actions every day so that we'll see them clearly for what they are
If we don't clearly see the nature and results of our actions we should contemplate them further Why does killing result in suffering
When a person kills why is that person a bad person
The same holds true with stealing and illicit sex
If we examine these actions carefully making our minds impartial and fair we'll see that these actions really are bad
They really result in suffering
We'll see for ourselves in line with what the Buddha taught
We don't have to look at anyone else
We just look at ourselves
If we see that what we're doing isn't good then when other people do the same things the same holds true for them
Whoever does these things is a bad person
If a lot of people do these things then there's trouble for a lot of people
If everyone in the world were to do these things the whole world would be troubled
The peace and happiness the world does experience comes totally from the good actions of good people
The ten things we've been talking about are karma on the unskillful side but there are also ten kinds of skillful karma  three physical four verbal and three mental  in just the same way
These are the actions that bring us happiness and prosperity
In terms of the three kinds of skillful physical karma we use our discernment and compassion to consider things
We have compassion for animals that are about to be killed
If we see something belonging to someone else that we'd like we have compassion for them so that we wouldn't want to steal that thing or cheat the other person out of it
If we see an opportunity for some illicit sex we reflect on the fact that we're already married and should have only one heart one love
We should have compassion for the person we live with
If we cheat on that person we'll create suffering for him or her
Having only one heart one love is meritorious for it allows us to live together for life
So if we learn to abandon the pleasures that come from taking life stealing and illicit sex we benefit
We become good people
Society doesn't mistrust us
The society of good people recognizes us as good people as clean people pure in body because our virtues are pure
This is where purity comes from
To save time I'll condense the remainder of the discussion
The ten kinds of skillful actions are the opposite of the ten kinds of unskillful ones
In terms of the three kinds of skillful physical karma we abstain from the three kinds of unskillful karma
We resolve not to do them and we follow through absolutely in line with that resolve
The same holds for the four kinds of skillful verbal karma
We resolve firmly not to lie not to engage in divisive speech in harsh speech or idle chatter
We also resolve not to be greedy not to feel ill will for anyone and to straighten out our views  ie to hold to the principle of karma seeing that if we do good we'll become good if we do bad we'll become bad
When we see things in this way our views are right in line with the truth
Unskillful actions comes from the mind's being affected by the defilements of greed anger and delusion
People kill and steal out of greed engage in illicit sex out of greed steal or kill out of anger
Sometimes they engage in illicit sex out of anger as a way of getting even
Sometimes they do these things out of delusion as when they're tricked into doing them along with other people
That's why these three defilements  greed anger and delusion  are so important
And this is why we develop mindfulness so that we'll see how these three defilements are the root of unskillfulness
If they arise they can cause us to misbehave in various ways to engage in unskillful karma
So when they arise we have to use our discernment to hold them in check
As for skillful mental states When we understand how unskillfulness comes from these three defilements  when we've heard these teachings and considered them on our own  the mind comes to feel shame at the idea of misbehaving in any of those ways
It realizes why they shouldn't be done
It also develops a sense of moral dread realizing that if we do those things we'll become bad people
Our friends  anyone who knows us  will criticize us won't want to associate with us will despise us
When we feel this kind of dread we can abandon those things
So when our discernment reaches the stage where we have this sense of shame and moral dread when we resolve not to do wrong in terms of our physical verbal and mental karma then skillful mental states have arisen within us
These states will then lead us to do all sorts of good
We'll feel compassion for others
We'll want to help them
This in turn becomes one of our perfections causing other people other beings to love us in return
The happiness that comes from this goodness is called merit
When we have a sense of shame and moral dread we exercise restraint over our physical actions so that we don't do anything wrong
This means that our body is pure
We exercise restraint over our speech not breaking our precepts and in this way our speech is pure
We exercise restraint over the mind an in this way our mind is pure
When we exercise restraint and don't do anything wrong we'll know for ourselves that we're good people  good because what we do is good
As for the good things that come from doing good our friends will love us people trust us we pose no threat to anyone anywhere
People are happy to welcome us into their society
When we act in this way we're not mistrusted wherever we go
Thus when we do good that good karma is ours
We'll be skillful people
If other people do good that good karma is theirs
As for people who don't restrain themselves in this way they don't have a share in that goodness
This is why the Buddha said that we're the owners of our actions
If we do good we'll experience good results
If we keep doing good that goodness will keep following us wherever we go
For example if a monk observes his precepts exercises restraint over his words and deeds in Thailand the people there recognize him as a good person
When he comes to America we see that he's a good person who poses no danger to us
The same holds true with us
If we behave in a skillful way we're good people
If we go to Thailand the people there will welcome us
Wherever we go people will welcome us
It's when we do evil that people want to keep us out
So we can see clearly in line with what the Buddha said Living beings are what they are in line with their actions
If we do good we're good people and experience happiness
Society welcomes us
We help bring pleasure to the world
When we see the good we've done we'll feel happy with ourselves
Esteem for ourselves
We can guarantee our own purity
Wherever we go we can go with confidence for there are no hidden weak points in our behavior or hearts
We're not afraid of being found out for anything for we have nothing to hide
It's because of our purity that we can be confident and brave
Wherever we go we know that good people will welcome us
Moreover we can help them become better people too
They can take us as an example and in this way we serve a beneficial purpose
The activities of good people are much more beneficial than those of people who aren't good
This is because their minds tend toward selfsacrifice for the sake of the world the sake of the common good
In this way they win honor praise wealth and happiness
Society spreads their name far and wide for the goodness they've done
Now that you've heard about the pleasure and pain that come in the present from good and bad karma we've done do you understand what I've said
Do you agree
Mindfulness at the point of death though is related to present karma
It's a form of skillful karma
If we've done good then our mindfulness will have the strength to recollect the goodness we've done
Normally when people are about to die two kinds of signs can appear
The first is a karmasign dealing with actions they've done in the past
If a person has done evil then there may be a sign making him relive that action
When I was a child there was a man in the village who had slaughtered a lot of cattle
When he was about to die he started screaming and sounded just like a cow being slaughtered
This is called a sign of unskillful karma
The person relives the karma he did although this time it's being done to him in the case of the man who slaughtered cattle he sees someone coming to kill him
When that sort of vision appears the mind will fall in line with it and be reborn in a state of deprivation to suffer the consequences of its evil deeds
The second kind of sign is a destinationsign
You see where you're going
You may see hell the realm of the hungry ghosts  everywhere you look you see things corresponding to the bad things you've done
If you die at that point the mind will go to that sort of destination
Enough of these bad things
Let's talk about some good ones all right
If you've done good things and skillful things then when you're about to die Especially if you've practiced meditation and attained jhana then when you're about to die the mind can enter one of the rupa jhanas and be reborn on the level of the rupa brahmas
If you've attained any of the arupa jhanas then you can enter jhana and reach the levels of the arupa brahmas in line with the mind's strength
As for more ordinary levels of skillfulness  called kamavacarakusala skillfulness on the sensual level  as when you practice generosity observe the precepts and meditate abstaining from the ten forms of unskillful karma we've mentioned when you're about to die a karmasign will arise and you'll remember meditating in the past
You'll find yourself meditating again being mindful gaining the same sense of ease you had before
The mind then holds onto its concentration and experiences rebirth in a pleasurable direction in one of the good destinations
Or you may remember the happiness you felt in doing good  paying respect to the Buddha lighting candles and incense giving donations in one way or another
You may get a karmasign that you're doing those things again together with your friends in the same way as we're meditating together here paying respect to the Buddha sitting in meditation doing walking meditation
If you pass away at that moment the mind will experience birth in one of the good destinations
In this way whatever actions you did in the course of your life will appear to you  as if you're doing them again  as you're about die
As for the good destinationsigns you may see gold and silver palaces riches things that delight you and give you pleasure things corresponding to the skillful things you've done
If you die at that point you'll go to a good destination
There's a story in the Dhammapada Commentary about a very virtuous lay disciple who liked to listen to the Dhamma and made a practice of generosity virtue and meditation
As he grew older and was on his deathbed he asked his children to invite some monks to come recite some suttas to him
As the monks were chanting  most likely the Mangala Sutta the Girimananda Sutta or the Satipatthana Sutta  devas from all the various directions came with their royal chariots to take the lay disciple back to their different heavens
This one said Come with me That one said No come with me So the devas started fighting over him
The lay disciple seeing this said Stop As soon as he said that the monks  who didn't see the devas  stopped chanting and went back to their monastery
Soon after the lay man asked his children What happened to all the monks The children answered Well you told them to stop so they stopped chanting and went back to the monastery No the lay disciple said I didn't tell them to stop
I told the devas to stop fighting The children didn't believe him that any devas had come
All they could think was that he was losing his mind
He insisted though that the devas had come to welcome him to their heavens
If you don't believe me take that garland and throw it in the air So they threw the garland in the air and it caught on the edge of one of the deva's chariots as it was about to leave
The children didn't see the chariot all they could see was the garland whizzing through the air
The only person who could see the devas was their father
This is one of the rewards of acting skillfully or serving a useful purpose in life
When you're about to die the devas come to take you to their heavens
They want you to join them  for there's happiness in living with wise people in associating with people who are good
In short the three types of skillfulness that lead to a good destination are danamaya generosity helping other people to live in pleasure and happiness silamaya virtue observing the five precepts and ten forms of skillful action and bhavanamaya meditation developing the mind
I ask that you have conviction in meditation that you set your minds on doing it
Whether or not your minds settle down doesn't really matter
Even if you don't gain release from suffering in this lifetime you're developing good habits that will act as supporting conditions in future lifetimes
The reward of your meditation is that you'll be mindful discerning and intelligent
You'll live long and feel mental wellbeing
If you get to hear the Dhamma in the future you'll more easily gain Awakening
These are some of the rewards of meditating
So don't let yourselves grow weary of the meditation
Don't tell yourselves that you don't get anything from doing it
At the very least you gain skillfulness on the sensual level you develop awareness understanding and intelligence as supporting conditions for your future happiness both in this life and on into the next
That's enough explanation for now
May each and every one of you meet with peace and prosperity
Ordination is a ceremony that the Buddha laid down both for the Bhikkhu Sangha and for the Bhikkhuni Sangha
When he had allowed women to ordain there were many women who on practicing the Dhamma reached arahantship some of them with special abilities like the Buddha's famous male disciples
For example the Buddha praised Sister Khema as foremost among the bhikkhunis in terms of her discernment just as he praised Sariputta as foremost in discernment among the bhikkhus
He praised Sister Uppalavanna as foremost among the bhikkhunis in terms of her psychic powers just as he praised Moggallana as the foremost bhikkhu in terms of his psychic powers
For a long time afterwards women continued ordaining and practicing the Dhamma but for what reason I don't know they weren't able to maintain their lineage all the way up to the present
Now the Buddha decreed that any man who wants to ordain must have a preceptor and that there must be at least five members of the Sangha sitting in on the ordination
One of the Sangha members is agreed upon by the group as the person who will question the candidate concerning his qualifications to see if he will be able to practice the Buddha's teachings on becoming ordained
When all the Sangha members see that the candidate is qualified they make a public announcement of his ordination
The same requirements were laid down for the Bhikkhuni Sangha
The candidate has to have a bhikkhuni as her preceptor and the Bhikkhuni Sangha has to question her concerning her qualifications
When they see that she is qualified they admit her into the Bhikkhuni Sangha
To govern the life of both Sanghas the Buddha laid down rules and requirements called the vinaya
In laying down these rules it wasn't the case that the Buddha called a meeting and laid them down all in advance
Only when an individual bhikkhu had misbehaved did the Buddha call a meeting of the Sangha to question the offender about what he had done
When the offender admitted his wrongdoing the Buddha would lay down a training rule one at a time
If someone else misbehaved in another way the Buddha would call another meeting and add another rule
He continued doing this in response to the actual misdeeds of the bhikkhus
The same held true for the bhikkhunis
If an individual bhikkhuni misbehaved the Buddha would call a meeting of the Sangha over which he would preside
When he had questioned the offender and she had admitted to her wrongdoing he would lay down a rule to prevent that kind of behavior from being repeated in the future
As this happened many times  as members of the Sangha misbehaved in various ways causing trouble in the Sangha  the Buddha kept adding more and more rules
After he passed away no one knows why but there's no report of the Bhikkhuni Sangha in the account of the First and Second Councils
The account of the Third Council reports that bhikkhunis were involved at that time and some of them were sent to Sri Lanka
The bhikkhunis continued their ordination lineage for centuries after that but for some unknown reason the lineage no longer exists in the present
Now that there are no longer any bhikkhunis there's no way that women can simply become bhikkhunis on their own for no one would dare certify that they'd be acting in line with the Buddha's promulgations
There are no preceptors to train them no Bhikkhuni Sangha to join
The requirements set down for women to ordain are that there must be a bhikkhuni to act as preceptor there must be a bhikkhuni to question the candidate as to her qualifications and there must be a quorum of bhikkhunis who agree to admit the candidate into the Sangha
Then they send someone to inform the Bhikkhu Sangha that the woman of thisandthis name has been ordained
When the bhikkhus are formally informed then the candidate would count as a bhikkhuni on an equal footing in the training with all the other bhikkhunis
It's right here that I would like to express my sympathy
Why weren't the bhikkhunis able to maintain their lineage
If they had maintained their lineage then women would be able to ordain just like men
No one would be able to stop them
After all the Buddha gave his permission for women to ordain
This is why I feel sympathy for those who would like to ordain
What I've said so far applies to the Theravadan tradition
The Theravadan Bhikkhuni Sangha no longer exists
The Mahayanists say that their bhikkhuni lineages still exist but if you look at their behavior and practices they've strayed very far from the vinaya
This is why the Theravadan tradition doesn't recognize them as bhikkhunis
The Mahayanists say their way is right but we don't get involved in that discussion
If on studying the matter you feel conviction in the practice of the Mahayana bhikkhunis that's one opportunity for ordination
Actually ordination is simply a formality a customary procedure in line with the rules of the Sangha
In the area of meditation the Buddha didn't forbid anyone  man or woman  from practicing
If you're really convinced of the value of the practice you don't have to put on ochre robes in line with monastic customs
Once you've developed a correct understanding of the Buddha's teachings  when you have strong conviction and want to practice the noble eightfold path in full  I'm thoroughly convinced that you can practice without having to put on monastic robes
You can go off on your own and practice to the point of developing the mindfulness and discernment needed to gain release from suffering
It's said that if lay people reach arahantship they can simply start wearing white observing the eight precepts and live apart from lay people in general
In this way they can live out their full life span without any difficulty
Lay people can attain arahantship if they're really firmly convinced and courageous
There was once a person who asked the Buddha Do those who are able to reach nibbana exist only in the Buddha's monastic Sangha or are other groups of people able to reach arahantship as well The Buddha answered Anyone  no matter what group he or she belongs to  who practices correctly in line with the noble eightfold is able to reach nibbana This shows that lay people if they practice correctly can reach nibbana as well
So you can rest assured that the Buddha wasn't prejudiced in any way
Once when the Buddha had come to a river he picked up a fistful of sand and asked the monks who were following him Which is greater this fistful of sand or the sand in all the rivers and oceans The monks answered The sand in the Blessed One's fist is a small amount lord
The sand in all the rivers and oceans is far more
The Buddha then responded In the same way monks those things that I have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are like the sand in all the rivers and oceans
The things I have taught are like this fistful of sand
Any teaching that was true but wouldn't serve a purpose  in other words things that his listeners couldn't confirm for themselves  the Buddha wouldn't teach
And he wouldn't deceive the world by teaching anything useless or untrue
He taught only the genuine truth that his listeners could understand and confirm for themselves through the practice
I've explained quite a lot already
When there's a lot of speaking there's simply a lot of breath
My hope is that you all will learn from listening in line with your mindfulness and then take what you've learned and put it into practice so that it will serve a purpose
Even though it may not be much my hope is that it's enough to serve a purpose
You've sacrificed a lot  your work all kinds of things  in coming here to practice
Coming together like this doesn't happen easily
Our interpreter has sacrificed his time too inspired by his sense that you want to practice
The organizer Larry Rosenberg has given a lot of his time and energy to the arrangements that have enabled us to come together to practice out of a similar desire the desire that all of you learn and practice the correct way to lead your lives so that you'll reach purity in line with the principles of the Buddha's teachings  the same teachings he taught his disciples in the past so that they too were able to reach purity
The teachings of the Buddha are still with us
Those of us in the present should listen to them and put them into practice so as to serve a purpose just like the people in the past
That way we'll find happiness and prosperity in our lives
So I ask that you remember what you've learned here contemplate it and put it into practice so that all of you  each and every one  will benefit in line with your aims
That's enough for now so I'll ask to stop here
The rewards of good will are it purifies the virtues of the person who develops it and it brings the mind to Right Concentration
This is why it's included in the classical forty topics of concentration
Our Lord Buddha from the time before he gained Awakening until he entered total nibbana practiced good will in his deeds good will in his words and good will in his thoughts at all times
The fact that we human beings have lived in peace through the virtues of the Triple Gem up to the present day is because of the power of the Buddha's great good will and compassion
For this reason we too should develop good will for all beings in line with his example
The power of good will can bring peace and security to the world in countless ways
There's a brief story from the time of the Buddha that illustrates this point
Once a king was returning home with his troops after having engaged in a battle
On the way they stopped off in a cool quiet forest to rest and to find water to drink and to bathe in and there in the forest they happened to come across a group of around monks practicing goodwill concentration
The monks' quiet manner  they weren't even making a sound  astonished the king
He said to himself Even in a single household of two or three people there are bound to be quarrels and commotion
But here these contemplatives are living together by the hundreds without any commotion at all
If our country could be at peace like this there probably wouldn't need to be any battles or war
Impressed he went to the head monk bowed down and asked to be taught their contemplative practice
After listening to the head monk's advice he sent his troops back to his capital while he stayed there in the forest practicing goodwill meditation for twelve years to the point where he had mastered the jhanas
Only then did he return to his capital
Immediately on his return he made a practice of spreading thoughts of good will in every direction throughout his kingdom and to the neighboring kingdoms as well
His people came thronging around him happy joyful and filled with respect for him
When he conversed with them to learn of their hardships and joys he taught them to develop good will compassion appreciation and equanimity for one another
Captivated by his words his people listened to him with trust and respect and followed his instructions
From that point on love and kindness spread through every home and village giving rise to a sense of friendship fellowship and cooperation that spread throughout the kingdom
There were no more wars with neighboring kingdoms and the people lived in happiness and peace
This story shows what the power of goodness in a single person's heart can accomplish it brings security and wellbeing to people throughout an entire nation
This is why the Buddha teaches us to develop inner goodness by meditating on good will
But you have to be earnest in really doing it if you want to get real results
Even if it's only for a short time  the wiggle of an elephant's ears or the flicker of a snake's tongue  it can give rise to amazing power like the power of an elephant or a snake in being able to kill off people or other animals in the twinkling of an eye
But if you're not truly earnest in what you do the power of truth won't appear in the mind and you won't be able to use it to get any results  like the ear of a dog or a cat It can wiggle all day long and yet it won't cause anyone any fear
With an elephant though all it has to do is wiggle his ears just once and people trip all over themselves trying to run away so fast that their legs practically fall off
Or a cobra all it has to do is wiggle its tongue once and people fall over in a faint
The power of the mind's true earnestness has the same sort of potency
The worldly crown of a king embellished with all the nine auspicious gems even though it's dazzling and priceless is still no match for a meditator's Dhammacrown embellished with the Buddha Gem the Dhamma Gem and the Sangha Gem
If we let evil come flowing into the heart goodness will have no chance to come in and take charge
Evil will seize power and take control while goodness will have to go running out to stand shivering outside the walls
Translator's note This talk is unusual in that we have two reconstructions of it a longer one by Mae Chii Arun Abhivanna and a shorter one by an unknown hand
Comparing the two reconstructions is a sobering experience giving a hint of what can sometimes get lost in the process of reconstructing a talk
Still we owe a great deal to those who went to the trouble of taking notes while Ajaan Lee explained the Dhamma
Without them we would have nothing of his spoken teachings at all
Some passages in II have already been translated in Food for Thought and The Skill of Release
Putting them in the context of the original talk shows how they function in Ajaan Lee's teaching style
As Ajaan Fuang one of his students once said Ajaan Lee could talk on three levels at once
This talk has a little something for everyone
Pleasure and purity mean two different things
They're not one and the same
Pleasure is the physical and mental ease that comes from material objects but it's not purity because the mind is still soaked and saturated with various preoccupations which defile it
As for purity that's a kind of pleasure independent of material objects
It's a pleasure that comes from the stillness and ease of the mind
Pleasure is a lower form of goodness
It's mundane
Purity is a higher form of goodness the transcendent
In concentration practice Right Effort is a supporting factor while Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration are supervising factors
These two types of factors are the basic principles of tranquillity
They're the factors that oversee and protect the mind from falling into Wrong Concentration
Some people say that tranquillity and insight are two separate things but actually they're one and the same
Tranquillity gives rise to insight
Insight gives rise to purity
And so purity comes this plain old stillness of mind
What can we do to reach purity
For the mind to become pure we have to train it
If you were to say it's easy it's easy
If you were to say it's hard it's hard
If you're true in what you do you'll get results easily
If you aren't the results will be hard
Tranquillity is like a lit candle
If it's well protected from the wind the flame will stand straight and give off a bright light
You'll be able to see anything clearly
If the candle tips over the flame will go out and you'll have to grope around with your hands
You may mistake a cat for a dog or a dog for a cat because you can't see clearly
In the same way we have to make an effort to use mindfulness to protect the mind from the wind
Don't let the Hindrances blow in and overcome the mind
Pleasure and the goodness of purity are two separate things not one and the same
Pleasure is the physical and mental ease that comes from ordinary things eating living and sleeping comfortably without any illness having plenty of wealth at your disposal and so forth
As for the goodness of purity that comes from a pleasure apart from the ordinary
It comes from your own mind without having to depend on the support of external things
This kind of pleasure takes its support from the Dhamma
And when it arises it's stable unchanging and lasting
As for ordinary pleasure it's undependable
It tends by and large to leave people disappointed
This is why we've come to look for pleasure in the area of the Dhamma which is a pleasure that won't let us down
The Dhamma is like the thatch or tiles that people put on their roofs to protect them from the sun and rain
When people are born into the world it's as if they're left out in the open without any shelter
They're sure to suffer from the sun and rain and stormy winds
Only if they have the Dhamma ensconced in their hearts will they escape from these dangers
This is why we're taught to find shelter for the heart  ie the Dhamma  to give us protection
The Dhamma here is virtue concentration and discernment
There are four types of virtue restraint of the senses restraint in terms of the Patimokkha purity of livelihood and contemplation of the requisites
These four types of virtue are like walls on all four sides which will protect us from stormy winds
Concentration  the four levels of jhana  is like a foursided roof that will protect us from the sun and rain
Discernment  transcendent discernment  is like a solid floor that will protect us from the danger of falling into the states of deprivation
When you've provided yourself with these three types of protection you have a sense of security and don't have to fear any of the sufferings that might come in this world or the next
The precepts are shelter for the body concentration is shelter for the mind
This shelter for the mind is composed of tranquillity and insight
Tranquillity means making the mind quiet and firm free from the Hindrances
Insight means using your discernment to investigate the causes and effects of all fabricated things within you so that you can see their truth to the point where you can let go of defilements level by level
When you can let go of them all your mind will gain release from mental fermentations reaching the goodness of purity
Some people say that tranquillity and insight are two separate things but actually they're one and the same
Tranquillity is making the mind still
When the mind is still it gives rise to a glow
As the glow gets brighter and brighter it turns into the light of insight
When insight arises you enter into the goodness of purity
And so this goodness this purity comes from tranquillity this plain old stillness of mind
The mind that isn't still is the mind that doesn't stay with the body
When this happens you'll meet with nothing but suffering and defilement
It's like a house in which no one is living it's bound to get dusty and messy
You don't have to look very far for an example take this meditation hall we're sitting in
Suppose all the monks novices and lay people were to go off and leave it for just a day
On your return you'd see that it was covered with dust and cobwebs simply from having no one to do the sweeping and dusting
In the same way when the mind goes off and leaves the body both the body and mind get dusty and defiled
And when the body is dusty how can the mind stay with it
It's like a dusty dirty house the owners can't live there and nobody else can either
Monks won't want to visit them
Suppose you lay people were to invite me into your home
If your home were messy and filthy filled with chicken droppings and duck droppings I wouldn't want to go in I wouldn't want to sit down I'd scarcely be able to breathe
So keep this comparison in mind if the mind doesn't have concentration isn't developing skillful qualities it's like a filthy house
Where would you find monks who would like to visit your house when it's like that
And when monks won't visit you where will you gain any blessings
When the mind is outside of the body it's the world
When it's inside the body it's Dhamma
If it's the world it has to be as hot as fire
If it's Dhamma it's as cooling as water
Skillfulness on the sensual plane is goodness on the conventional social level
It has to involve people and things outside
Transcendent skillfulness is goodness above and beyond the social level you learn to depend on yourself and can handle your problems on your own
The mind of an ordinary person can go forward and back and so it's not dependable
Sometimes after winning it turns around and loses
It wins today and loses tomorrow
As for the mind of a noble disciple when it wins it doesn't then lose
It goes forward and doesn't slide back
It keeps forging straight ahead
When the mind is undependable when it doesn't have firm principles it's a Communist mind ie one without any religion
A mind with a religion has to have principles so that it can depend on itself
It's a mind that can be its own person
When the mind isn't its own person it doesn't have complete authority
It can't give orders or exercise complete control over anything
For instance if you order the body to come and listen to a Dhamma talk it won't be willing to come
If you order it to sit in concentration it won't be willing to sit
Like being a parent only if you're the child's parent  will you have full authority over it
If you're just  its parent and it's  your child you can't exercise full control with any confidence
So the mind is like a parent the body like a child
That's why we have to train the mind to be its own person so that we can have full control over the body
When the mind has full control we can overcome any pains that arise from the body and any defilements that arise from the mind
That's when you can say that you're really your own person
Each of us is like a longplaying record
When we do good that goodness gets recorded within us
When we do bad that badness gets recorded within us  just like a record that's been used to record good and bad sounds
Whatever type of kamma we do it stays within us  it doesn't go off anywhere else
So ask yourself whether you want to keep goodness or badness within you
The mind is neither good nor bad but it's what knows good and knows bad
It's what does good and does bad
And it's what lets go of good and lets go of what's bad
The body is something that wears down and disintegrates into nothing
The mind is something that doesn't disintegrate doesn't die
So we're like a rice grain with one part that takes birth and another that doesn't take birth
The part that doesn't take birth is the plain rice flour
The part that takes birth is the white spot on its tip
If we don't want that rice grain to take birth as a plant all we have to do is demolish the little white spot and it won't be able to sprout
The same with us the body is like the plain rice flour the mind the little white spot that sprouts
If the mind contains defilements  its attachments to good and bad  without demolishing them it will cause us to sprout in new planes of being and birth
This is why we're taught to let go of our attachments to good and bad to put them both down
When the mind has nothing more to sprout it can then gain release from birth and death
When the mind leaves the body at death it vanishes in the same way that an extinguished candle flame doesn't have a shape for our physical eyes to see
But that doesn't mean that flame fire has disappeared from the world
It simply gets diffused into its property like the fire of electricity in a copper wire
If we simply look at the wire we won't see any fire in it
But if we touch it with our hand we'll immediately feel the heat
In the same way when the mind leaves the body it reappears in other places just like the fire that diffuses into its property
To hold onto the body is to hold onto old kamma
To let go of the body is to let go of old kamma
And when we can let go in this way there will be no more kamma in the body
It's the same as with a piece of property
If we take possession of it with a deed and the boundaries staked out there tend to be problems with trespassing swindling boundary disputes and cases in court
But if we don't take possession of it and simply let it be public property there will be no troubles or quarrels
This way the heart can be at its ease
The body is like a boat the river is our skillful intentions
Mindfulness is the wind that moves us along
The defilements are like sand bars
If you develop mindfulness at all times you'll be able to take your bodyboat to the other shore without running aground on the sand
Defilements are like sand bars or stumps in a river that will keep our boat from getting to shore
In other words passion is something that snags us anger is something that bumps into us and delusion is something that makes us spin around and sink
There's a story they tell of two men who were hired to row a boat along the rivers and canals to sell plowshares shovels and hoes
If they sold all the wares in the boat their employer would give them their full wages of one kahapana which was equal to about four dollars a day
The first day their employer went out with them and they sold all their wares
After that he didn't go with them so the two of them went out to sell their wares on their own
One day as they were out rowing along calling out Plowshares shovels and hoes their minds wandered and they started getting drowsy
All of a sudden they crashed smack into a stump and ran aground on a sandbar
Even after they got free they were so shaken up that instead of calling out Plowshares shovels and hoes they started calling out Sandbars and stumps
Sandbars and stumps all along the river but nobody wanted to buy
When evening came they rowed back to their employer's house their boat still full of plowshares shovels and hoes
They hadn't been able to sell a thing
So the employer gave them each only a dollar for their day's wages
One of the men took the money back to his wife who was surprised to see that she was getting only one dollar instead of the usual four
Maybe he's given the rest of the money to another woman she thought so she gave him a piece of her mind
No matter how much he tried to explain things she wouldn't listen
So he told her to go ask the employer
If what he said wasn't true he'd be willing to let her hit him once on the head
The wife impatient because she was so angry said No let me hit you first and then I'll go ask As she said this she reached for a shovel handle but all she could grab was the stick they used to drive the dog out of the house so she used that to bash her husband three times on the head
Later of course she found out the truth but by that time it was too late for the husband had already gotten three free hits on the head
This story shows the harm that can come from not being mindful
If you let your mind wander away from what you're doing you can end up getting yourself into trouble
If we were to make a comparison the man at the prow of the boat stands for the monks
The man at the tail of the boat stands for the lay people
The stumps are passion aversion and delusion while the sandbar is the Hindrances
If we're not careful to be mindful if we let our minds get entangled in defilements and covered with the five Hindrances our Dhamma practice will have a hard time succeeding
Skillfulness on the sensual plane is like a truck running along a road or a boat running along a river but in either case it's not as good as a truck stopped still at a warehouse or a boat stopped still at a dock
Now there are benefits that come when a truck runs along a road or a boat runs along a river
It can carry freight or passengers
It can collect fare from the passengers or shipping charges for the freight
But when our truck stops at the warehouse or our boat stops at the dock we get greater benefits many times over
We get time to rest our weary bones
We get to unload all our old freight and pick up new freight
If we keep stopping at the same dock often enough we'll get more and more familiar with the person who runs the dock and the people native to the area
Ultimately we'll get so that they'll share food with us without our having to pay for our dinner or let us spend the night without having to pay for our room
This is because we get more intimate and familiar with one another so that they come to like us
Ultimately they'll trust us so much that we can share the same bed
When this happens we may get to ask them their family secrets how many wives and children they have how they make their money where they keep the family treasures
They'll tell us everything
In the same way if our mind stops running after its preoccupations and stays still at its dock  the body  we'll reap the same three kinds of benefits
The mind will get to rest and recover from its weariness
It will pick up a sense of peace pleasure and ease
It will become more familiar and intimate with the four properties which are like the natives in this area
We'll come to know thoroughly the workings of the body and mind
When we stay with the earth property we'll know the affairs of the earth property
When we stay with the water property we'll know the affairs of the water property
When we stay with the wind property we'll know the affairs of the wind property
When we stay with the fire property we'll know the affairs of the fire property
We'll give rise to the three and the eight cognitive skills
We'll know all the affairs of the body to the point where we have no more doubts
That will enable us to let the body go
Knowing in line with labels in line with books or with what people say is imitation knowing not the real thing
It's like the shadow of knowing
Real knowing is the knowing that arises within yourself
It's paccattam entirely personal
It's the kind of knowing that can't be taught and can't be told
It has to arise within you
Only then will you know what's inconstant stressful and notself and what's constant easeful and self
Changeoflineage knowledge sees both sides and lets go of both
The truth of the Dhamma is Dhammathiti the aspect of mind that stays in place without changing
The movements and characteristics of the mind are simply shadows or imitations of knowing
In practicing the Dhamma you want true knowing
If you don't really practice you'll meet up only with the shadows of the Dhamma
For this reason we should practice so that true knowing will appear within us
This body of ours has parts that are constant and those that are inconstant both ease and stress both self and notself
For example the properties of earth water wind and fire are constant in that they've never turned into anything else
The earth property has never turned into water the water property has never turned into wind the wind property has never turned into fire
Whatever they've been since the beginning of the world that's what they'll be until the world falls to pieces
Take water as an example even if people freeze it until it's hard or put green yellow or red dye into it it'll still be water just the same
There's even a constant aspect to the parts of our body our hand has never turned into a foot our arm has never turned into a leg our eye has never turned into an ear our lower lip has never pushed its way up to being the upper lip
These are the aspects that are constant and self
As for the inconstant parts those are just the characteristics of these things not what they really are
The properties of earth water wind and fire are like four people
If you keep trying to acquaint yourself with them after a while they'll become your friends
In the beginning they aren't too familiar with you they don't trust you so they'll want to test you first
For instance when you start sitting in meditation they'll take a stick and poke you in your legs and shins so that your legs hurt or grow numb
If you lie down they'll poke you in the back
If you lie on your side they'll poke you in the waist
If you get up and sit again they'll test you again
Or they may whisper to you to give up
If you give in to them the King of Death will grin until his cheeks hurt
What you have to do is smile against the odds and endure everything to the end point
Keep talking with all four properties
Even though they don't respond at first you have to keep talking with them asking them this and that
After a while they'll give you a oneword answer
So you keep talking and then their answers will start getting longer until you eventually become acquaintances and can have real conversations
From that point they become your intimates and friends
They'll love you and help you and tell you their secrets
You'll be a person with friends and won't have to be lonely
You'll eat together sleep together and wherever you go you'll go together
You'll feel secure
No matter how long you sit you won't ache
No matter how long you walk you won't feel tired  because you have friends to talk with as you walk along so that you enjoy yourself and reach your destination before you realize it
This is why we're taught to practice meditation by keeping mindfulness immersed firmly in the body
Use directed thought and evaluation with your meditation themes  body feelings mind and mental qualities  without letting your mind wander astray in outside thoughts and preoccupations
Contemplate the body so as to know how all four properties are getting along where it feels pleasant painful or neutral
Notice how the mind moves around in the various things you know until you reach the mental quality that's still solid and true
This way it's like having friends go with you wherever you go and whatever you do
In other words when the body walks the mind walks with it
When the body lies down the mind lies down with it
When the body sits the mind sits with it
Wherever the body stops the mind stops too
But most of us aren't like this
The body takes two steps but the mind takes four or five  so how can it not get tired
The body lies in a mosquito net surrounded by a railing and seven thick walls but the mind can still go running outside the house
When this is the case where will it get any happiness
If it doesn't stay in its house it'll have to wander around exposed to the sun wind rain and all sorts of dangers because it has no roof no protection
If there's no concentration to act as a shelter for the heart it'll always have to meet with misery and pain
For this reason you should train your heart to stay firm in concentration and to develop full authority within yourself so that you can be your own person
This way you'll be bound to meet with the goodness of purity as mentioned above
While we meditate here on the word buddho we have to make up our minds that we're going to stay right here with someone venerable in the same way that we'd be a monk's attendant
We'll follow after him and watch out for him and not run off anywhere else
If we abandon our monk he's going to abandon us and we'll be put to all sorts of hardships
As for the monk he'll be put to hardships as well as in the story they tell
Once in the time of the Buddha there was a rich moneylender couple who had been married a long time but without any children
Both of them really wanted a son who could carry on the family line and receive their inheritance
So they talked the matter over and decided to invite a monk to their home to inform him of their predicament to see if he could use his meditative powers to help intercede with the devas so that they could have a child
When they had made their decision they told one of their male servants to go into a nearby forest to invite a meditating monk to come have a meal in their home
The next morning before dawn the servant got ready to go into the forest to a hut where a meditating monk had taken up residence
Now this servant had once been a hunter and still had all his old hunting instincts
He had even kept his crossbow and arrows and other hunting equipment and maintained them in good shape
When his master had sent him to invite the monk which would require going into the forest he was happy to go for it would give him a chance to do a little hunting on the side
So he snuck his crossbow and arrows out of the house under his shirt
When he got halfway to the monk's hut he realized that it wouldn't be proper to approach a monk while armed so he decided to hide his weapons on the side of the path
On the way back he'd be able to pick them up
So he stashed the crossbow and arrows behind a bush near the path
Then he went on his way emptyhanded until he came across an old monk sitting in front of a hut
After bowing down to the monk he said to him Venerable sir my master the moneylender and his wife have asked me to come invite you to a meal in their house this morning and have told me to take you there
Would you please be so kind as to accept their invitation
The old monk on hearing this decided to accept
Now it so happened that he didn't have an attendant of his own so he had the servant carry his bowl and shoulder bag
Then he picked up his cane and headed out in unsteady steps toward the moneylender's house
As they walked along he asked the servant Where is your master's house
How far is it from here
How do you get there The servant answered all his questions
After they had walked on a little further the servant remembered the crossbow and arrows hidden behind the bush on the side of the path
The thought occurred to him that he'd like to abandon the old monk pick up his weapons and sneak off to do a little hunting in the forest
After all he told himself he had already given explicit directions to the old monk so he'd be able to find his way on his own
Then he came up with a plan
He told the old monk I've got to go to the bathroom really bad so let me head into the woods for a moment
You can walk on ahead
When I'm finished I'll catch up with you
The old monk wasn't the least bit suspicious and thought that the servant was telling the truth so he let the servant go off while he hurried on ahead afraid that it was getting late and that he wouldn't get to the moneylender's house in time for his meal
As for the servant he turned off the path and headed for the bush where he had hidden his crossbow and arrows
But before he got there one of the forest devas decided to test his loyalty to the old monk
So the deva metamorphosed himself into a large golden swan and pretended to have a broken wing flying an erratic course under the trees near the path the servant was following
The servant heard the sound of a bird flapping its wings  flipflap flipflap  and looking up saw an enormous golden swan zigzagging back and forth looking like it couldn't get away
Seeing this he got really excited thinking that he'd have to shoot this bird for food for sure
In his excitement he forgot that he was carrying the monk's bowl and shoulder bag and thought instead that he had a quiver strapped to his back and a crossbow on his shoulder
So he reached into the shoulder bag and pulled out the old monk's betel nut crusher about two feet long and took aim with it as if it were a crossbow or a rifle
Then he took his stance and pulled back on the crusher at the same time making the sound of a gun firing byng byng byng
But of course he never hit the bird at all
As for the old monk after walking on a ways he began to forget the servant's directions so he turned left and right right and wrong and couldn't find his way out of the forest
He looked back over his shoulder to see if the servant was catching up with him but the servant never came
All he could hear was the sound  byng byng byng  echoing through the forest but no matter how much he called out there was never any answer
The later it got the hotter the sun and the more tired and hungry he got  for after all he was very old  so he made up his mind to turn around and retrace his steps staggering back to his hut
Meanwhile the servant  exhausted from trying to shoot the golden swan without success  was ready to give up
So the deva seeing that he had had enough fun with the servant pretended to be shot and fell down panting heavily on the path a little ways ahead
Thrilled the servant came running up to pick up the bird but just as he bent over to grasp hold of it it disappeared in a flash
This startled the servant and suddenly it dawned on him that some forest spirit had been deceiving him
That's when he remembered the old monk
So in his panic he dropped the bowl and shoulder bag and ran away with his arms flailing all the while calling out to the monk Help me
Help me But the monk was nowhere to be found
So the servant hurried straight home and told his master everything that had happened
The moneylender was so furious that he punished the servant by making him sleep outside the walls of the house compound and go without food for three days
On top of that he cut back his daily wage
This story shows the hardships that come when a person isn't loyal to his monk when he runs away from his responsibilities and abandons his monk
He causes all sorts of problems for himself and for others as well
The old monk had to go without food for a day
Having lost his bowl shoulder bag and betel nut crusher he was forced to search for new requisites
As for the moneylender and his wife they didn't get the things they had hoped for
When you apply this story to the Dhamma it becomes a lesson worth remembering
If you're not loyal to your meditation object or to yourself if you forget the breath you're meditating on with buddho buddho and let your mind go wandering off in thoughts and concepts it's as if you've abandoned the monk you're supposed to look after
You don't follow him you don't act the role of his student as you had intended to
The results that you had hoped for will thus get ruined
In other words your mind won't get established in concentration
All kinds of hardships  the five Hindrances  will come flowing into the heart and no peace will appear
This causes you to suffer and to miss out on the good results that you should have achieved
At the same time you cause hardships to others  ie the monk sitting up here giving you a Dhamma talk
He wastes his time talking for hours until his rear end hurts
Instead of lying around his hut at his leisure he has to sit here jabbering away with no results to show for it at all
So keep this story in mind as a lesson in teaching yourself to be intent in doing what's good
Don't be the sort of person who  like the servant in the story  is disloyal to his monk
There's another story to illustrate the good things that come from being loyal to your monk which I'll tell to you now
Once there was a moneylender couple who had a large mansion in the city of Varanasi
Both husband and wife were avid meritmakers
Every year during the Rains retreat they would invite a monk to have his meal in their home each day for the entire three months
Now the moneylender couple had a slave couple working in their household
The duty of the slave woman was to pound the rice and separate it into various grades
The highest grade rice was for giving the monk as alms
The second grade rice was for the moneylender couple to eat
The third grade rice was for the servants in the household and the fourth grade  the lowest grade rice mixed with bran  was for the slave couple to eat themselves
As for the slave woman's husband his primary duty was to cut firewood in the forest and make the fire for cooking the rice
His secondary duty was to wait at the mansion gate each morning to welcome the monk who would come for the meal and to carry his bowl and shoulder bag up to the house for him
And if I remember rightly the monk who was invited for the meal that year was a Private Buddha
At any rate when the monk had finished his meal the slave would carry his bowl and bag from the front door of the house back out to the mansion gate
As he performed this duty every day the slave came to develop a strong affection for the monk
And the monk felt compassion for the slave
If he had any fruits or other delicacies left from his meal he would always share them with the slave
This made the slave feel an even greater loyalty toward the monk  to the point where the moneylender couple allowed him to enter the house as the monk's attendant
One day the slave got to follow the monk all the way into the dining room
Before reaching the dining room he passed the bedroom the parlor and the moneylenders' private dining room
He got to see all the many beautiful and expensive things decorating the moneylender couple's home
On the way out after the meal he happened to see the moneylenders' favorite dog  a male  eating food from a dish near the door to the dining room
He couldn't help noticing that the dog's food was fine rice with curries and that the dish was made of silver
He thought to himself Look at all the merit this dog has
It gets to live in the house and doesn't have to run around looking for food on the ground outside like other dogs
When the time comes someone fixes food for it to eat and the food looks so delicious
The rice is a higher grade than what my wife and I get to eat
And its dish is a fine one made of silver
If only I could be reborn as a moneylender's dog just think of how happy I'd be
After he had accompanied the monk to the mansion gate he went back to his shack and told his wife about all the things he had seen in the moneylenders' house and especially about the dog eating high grade rice and curries from a silver dish
Then he added Neither you nor I have any real happiness or ease in our lives
You're exhausted every day from having to pound the rice
As for me I have to slash through the forest to find firewood and to make the fire for cooking the rice for everyone in the household
But all we get to eat is the lowest grade rice mixed with bran
We shouldn't have been born as human beings
If only we could be reborn like that moneylenders' dog 
From that day on the memory of the moneylenders' dog kept occupying his thoughts
At the same time though he still remained loyal to the monk
But just a few days later he had an attack of horrible cramps and died
After he stopped breathing his spirit didn't go off anywhere but kept hovering around the moneylenders' house  both because it was still fixated on the dog and because it felt attached to the monk
Every morning it would follow the monk in and out of the house
One day after offering the monk his meal the moneylender couple presented him with many additional offerings
When he had finished eating he carried all the offerings out the door where the dog was lying on guard
Seeing the monk with his arms all full of things the dog thought that he had stolen them from the moneylender couple
So it rushed at him and started to bark
The spirit of the slave hovering behind the monk slipped right into the dog's open mouth and into its stomach  and then couldn't get out
So now it was stuck
It couldn't follow the monk in and out of the house as it had every morning
Instead it could only stir around restlessly in the dog's stomach which of course had an effect on the dog's behavior
It couldn't lie still and kept getting into places it didn't belong
The moneylender couple noticed it acting abnormally and mystified had one of their servants put it outside in a pen with the other dogs of the household
Before too long the dog mated with a female and the female became pregnant
And so now the slave was reborn as a puppy in the female's womb
While it was in the womb it still wanted to follow the monk in and out of the house but it couldn't get out
All it could do was thrash around in its mother's womb causing her all sorts of misery and pain
When her time came the female finally gave birth to a male puppy much larger and stronger than normal
This was because the puppy's consciousness had such a strong desire to get out and see the monk all along
As soon as it was born it opened its eyes wide and started to run  because actually it had been running ever since its time in the womb
So the next morning when it saw the Private Buddha come to the mansion gate it was overjoyed
It ran up and jumped all over him grabbing his shoulder bag from his hand and running after him all the way into the dining room in the moneylenders' house
This amazed the moneylender couple and made them feel strong affection for it
The next morning happened to be the last day of the Rains retreat which was the final day of the monk's invitation to eat in the moneylender couple's home
So before leaving the house after he had finished his meal the monk said to the moneylender couple Because today is the last day of your invitation I would like to give you my blessing and take my leave to return to the seclusion of my hermitage in the forest Then he turned to the puppy Tomorrow I won't be coming to your masters' home any more now so I want you to stay here and guard your masters with loyalty
Don't follow me out into the forest okay
When the puppy heard the Private Buddha say this it was so heartbroken that it dropped dead on the spot
Through the power of its love and loyalty for the Private Buddha it was reborn as a deva's son in heaven with a large following and many divine treasures
His palace was more lovely than that of anyone else's his looks more handsome than any other deva's son in heaven
His voice was alluring his fragrance like that of flowers
Any female deva who heard his voice or smelled his fragrance wanted to see him
On seeing him she would want him as her mate
All of this was the result of the goodness of the slave's sincere loyalty to the Private Buddha
The only bad part of his story was that moment he got fixated on the moneylenders' dog which was why he had to spend one lifetime as a puppy
But because the good kamma of his mind was stronger it was able to wipe out the kamma of his animal birth and take him to heaven
This story is another example that you should take to heart in your practice of training the mind
You have to be very very careful
Don't let any Hindrances come in and take over your mind while you're practicing concentration
Don't let your monk run away from you and don't you abandon your monk to go running after dogs
If your mind doesn't stay with your monk  ie the factors of your meditation  all sorts of troubles will result as in the stories I've told you here
As for the goodness that comes from keeping track of your monk it will send you to good states of becoming and birth and will raise your mind ultimately to the level of the transcendent
Wrong concentration is concentration lacking mindfulness and alertness
Wrong release is when you get beyond distractions by falling asleep
Another form of wrong concentration is when you lose track of your breath and your body
Another form is when you don't lose track of them but you get deluded  as when you get fixated on signs or light and assume yourself to have gained some special attainment
You fall for these things and hold onto them as being trustworthy and true
In this way they turn into the corruptions of insight and all sorts of skewed perceptions
A pure mind is one that has grown dispassionate to thoughts of past and future and has no hankering for any sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations or ideas at all
The goodness we've been developing here don't forget it
It's bound to bear fruit
Don't underestimate it thinking that the little things we've been doing here won't bear much fruit
Don't underestimate it at all
There are examples from the time of the Buddha
Some of the monks and novices after ordaining weren't able to cut through their defilements
They were only able to thin them out a bit so they got discouraged and disrobed
After disrobing they had to find a livelihood sometimes in ways that were honest sometimes in ways that were not
Those who got involved in dishonest ways were caught by the civil authorities and imprisoned
One example was a student of Sariputta
He ordained to develop his goodness but when he didn't get the results he had hoped for he disrobed and became a thief
After a while he was caught and sentenced to death
Before he was to be executed the civil authorities decided to torture him for seven days as an example to the general public so as to discourage other people from breaking the law
The king ordered his officials to sharpen some wood and iron spears to a superfine point to plant them in rows and then to have the thief sit and lie on the spear points so that they would skewer his body causing him to be bathed in blood and to experience excruciating pain
They would do this three times a day  morning noon and evening  calling the people of the city to come and see an example of how thieves have to suffer
The plan was to have the thief tortured like this for seven days and then to behead him but the thief still had some good karma left over from the time he had studied with Sariputta
Sariputta had taught him to follow some of the ascetic practices and to meditate and he had been able to develop his mind to the level of the first jhana
But the first jhana wasn't enough to withstand his defilements and cravings which is why he had disrobed
It so happened that on the sixth day Sariputta through his great compassion  after all there were times when he in the Buddha's stead had helped teach the populace to practice the Dhamma  used the powers of his meditation to check up on his students who were still ordained as well as those who had disrobed to return to the lay life to see where they were and how they were doing
Because of the goodness that the thief had developed with Sariputta a light appeared to Sariputta in which he saw that his student was being tortured and was scheduled to be beheaded the next day
On seeing this Sariputta contemplated the student's reserves of goodness seeing that he still had some potential but that it had all withered
Even so some of the goodness he had developed was still buried there inside him
Even though defilements had enwrapped his heart there was still some goodness there
On realizing this Sariputta went on his almsround in the early morning to the area where his student was being tortured
His student was lying on his bed of spears as Sariputta came near
The place was thronged with people running around in excitement some of them excited about seeing Sariputta some of them excited about seeing the thief being tortured
It so happened that the crowd parted briefly enough for Sariputta's student to see the edge of his teacher's robe
Sariputta spread thoughts of good will which the student could feel and which served as a guarantee of his presence but that was as close as he could get
On seeing Sariputta the student felt overjoyed thinking Tomorrow I'm going to have to take my leave of my teacher  I'm going to be executed At the thought of bowing down to his teacher he remembered Sariputta's meditation instructions and so he started to practice jhana stilling his mind in concentration
When his mind grew still he reflected on death thinking Tomorrow they're going to get me for sure
There's no doubt about that So he reflected further Where is death
Where does death happen And he came to the realization that death lies at the end of your nose If the breath stops that's it
But as long as you're still breathing then even if you're being brutally tortured you're not dead
So he started to practice mindfulness of breathing
As soon as he got focused on the breath the breath grew absolutely still and his blood stopped flowing from his wounds
When the blood stopped flowing his wounds closed up and healed
When his wounds were healed he felt a sense of rapture and joy over how much his meditation had been able to overcome the pain
So he surveyed the parts of his body  hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin  back and forth over and over again until all the severed parts of his body connected back up again
When the parts of his body gained strength like this he was able to sit up in full lotus on the tips of the spears and to enter into jhana the first jhana the second the third and the fourth
On entering into the fourth jhana his body became as light as a tuft of cotton and stronger than the wood and iron spears
The tips of the spears couldn't penetrate his body any more
Finally his mind entered fixed penetration and he made a vow If I escape with my life I'm going back to live with my teacher He focused his mind in the fourth jhana with its two factors
The first was singleness of preoccupation not involved with anything at all the thought that they were going to execute him had disappeared completely
The second factor was mindfulness bright and dazzling
And in that light of mindfulness he was able to see his teacher
So he made another determination I'm going to go stay with my teacher As soon as he made this determination his body levitated up into the air and went to where Sariputta was
After rejoining his teacher he vowed he would never do anything evil ever again
So he practiced meditation and came out of the whole affair alive
He didn't become an arahant or anything but he did come out alive
This goes to show that even though the goodness we develop doesn't meet with our expectations right away we shouldn't underestimate it
Goodness is like fire
You shouldn't underestimate fire for a single match can destroy an entire city
Goodness has power in just the same way
This is why the Buddha taught us not to underestimate the goodness we develop
Even though it seems to be just a tiny bit it has the power to ward off unfortunate events to turn heavy into light and to keep us safe and secure
This is one point to remember
Another point is that people are like plants
Say that you plant some squash seeds in the ground You want the seeds to grow and give you squash right away but they can't do that
Still the nature of what you've planted will grow bit by bit and after a while will give you the squash you want
But if you sit there and watch it to see how much the squash plant grows in a day an hour a minute to see how many centimeters the shoot will grow can you measure it
No of course not
But do you believe that it's growing every day
Sure
If it weren't growing how would it get so long over time
The same holds true with however much or little goodness we develop Even though we don't see the results right away they're sure to come
You can't measure how much good you've done in a day or how much goodness has resulted from your actions in a day but if you ask whether there are results you have to answer Yes
It's like the squash plant You can't see it growing but you know that it grows
Even though the goodness you've been doing doesn't seem to be developing you shouldn't underestimate it
Another point is that some people are like banana trees
The nature of banana trees is that if you cut them off at the trunk and then come back in an hour you'll see that a new shoot has grown a whole inch from the top
In two or three days the shoot will have grown a foot or two
Some people are like this
They get fast results extraordinary results and develop all kinds of abilities
For example they can get quickly into jhana and then clearly explain what they've experienced to other people
The same thing happened in the time of the Buddha
Take Culapanthaka for example He had worked at developing goodness for a long time but when he finally got the hang of the meditation practicing with a sense of wounded pride after being scorned by his friends he got results right away
The story is this Once when he was staying with a group of monks headed by the Buddha a moneylender invited the whole group for a meal at his home
Culapanthaka's older brother Mahapanthaka was the meal distributor
Whoever came with an invitation it was Mahapanthaka's duty to inform the other monks
Now Mahapanthaka was ashamed of his younger brother for being so lazy and torpid in his meditation nodding off all the time
So thinking that Culapanthaka didn't deserve to eat food in anyone's home Mahapanthaka decided not to include him in the invitation
He invited only the remaining monks headed by the Buddha to go to the moneylender's meal
When the group arrived at the moneylender's home and all the monks were served one tray of food was left over
So the moneylender asked Mahapanthaka why the monks didn't number the full he had asked for Mahapanthaka informed him that Culapanthaka hadn't been included in the invitation
The moneylender then went to the Buddha
The Buddha knowing that Culapanthaka was meditating back at the monastery told the moneylender that Culapanthaka was an important monk The moneylender would have to send one of his servants to invite him to the meal
But because the Buddha wanted the moneylender to see the powers Culapanthaka had developed he didn't explain how to go about making the invitation
He let the moneylender's servant go to see for himself only then would he explain
As for Culapanthaka his pride had been so wounded that he decided to go without food and to sit in meditation that day
It so happened that he entered the fourth jhana Never since the day of his birth had his meditation progressed so far
On reaching the fourth jhana he entered the fifth making his mind clear bright and blooming and giving rise to supernormal strengths both in body and mind
It was at that point that the moneylender's servant arrived at the monastery
Culapanthaka saw him and made a mental determination causing monks  all of them images of himself  to fill the monastery
Some were sitting in meditation some were doing walking meditation some were washing their robes
The servant went to ask one of the monks where Culapanthaka was and the monk pointed to another part of the monastery
He went to that part of the monastery and asked one of the monks there who pointed to still another part of the monastery
This kept up until the time for the meal was almost over and yet the servant couldn't locate Culapanthaka at all
So he ran back to the moneylender's house
The Buddha at this point knew that Culapanthaka had perfected his psychic powers and from now on wouldn't be scorned by his friends so he told the servant to go back and make the invitation again but this time he told him how to do it
How was that
When the servant asked one of the monks where Culapanthaka was then as soon as the monk was about to open his mouth the servant should grab him by the arm before he had a chance to speak
So the servant did as he was told
He went back to the monastery which was still filled with monks and asked one of the monks where Culapanthaka was
As the monk started to point to another part of the monastery the servant grabbed hold of his arm
The instant he grabbed the monk by the arm all the other monks in the monastery disappeared leaving only the monk he was holding
So he invited that monk to the meal at the moneylender's home
From that point on Culapanthaka became one of the prominent monks of the Sangha with all sorts of extraordinary psychic abilities
He was able to stand in the sun without getting hot to walk in the rain without getting wet to travel great distances in no time at all
He could make himself appear in many places at once in forests cemeteries and other places as well
He developed all kinds of powers
As a result he was able to get over his wounded pride from being scorned by his friends and instead became one of the more extraordinary of the Buddha's prominent disciples
This is the power of goodness
Some people gain extraordinary powers and wideranging abilities mature in their concentration mature in their insight able to reach nibbana in this very life
All of this comes from the goodness the perfections they've developed
So we should take pride in the goodness we've been developing too
There's another story about an old woman who went to a monastery one day and saw that the walking meditation paths were dirty
She swept the paths clear of the dirt and rubbish so that the monks could walk conveniently on the paths
She did it only this once but she did it with an attitude of love an attitude of conviction an attitude of respect and a pure state of mind
The dirt and rubbish had made her feel dispirited so she swept it all away and set out water for washing the feet as a result her mind felt clean and refreshed
Soon after she returned home she had a heart attack
After she died she was reborn as a deva with a large following a palace divine food and all kinds of abundant wealth
Living in her palace she began to remember her previous life and thought to herself If I had done lots of merit I'd be even richer than I am now
It'd be good to go back and do good things for just a little bit longer so that I could get even more abundant results than what I have now
Before I had no idea that goodness would give results like this
So she left heaven and came down to earth prowling around in search of monks in the forest and wilderness
She came across one monk who was about to enter concentration so she stood there staring at him looking for a way to be of service
But when he saw her he chased her away What kind of deva is this trying to horn in on human beings' merit
Before you underestimated merit but now that you've received good results you want even more
How greedy can you get
Go away
I won't let you do anything
Let human beings have a chance to do good
There are lots of people who don't have any of the good things you do
Don't come horning in on their chance for goodness
Chagrined the deva fled back up to heaven and had to content herself with the results she already had
She had wanted to make more merit but they wouldn't let her
Why was that
We human beings tend to underestimate little acts of merit but after you die it's hard for you to make any more merit at all
How is it hard
Your body is no longer like a human body
You can't talk with human beings at all
You can't even put food in monks' bowls
The best you can do is simply stand around rejoicing in the merit of others
Only human beings with good eyes can see you
Those without that kind of eye won't detect you at all
If you encounter those with the right mental powers they can teach you to some extent
But if you don't encounter that kind of person when you're a deva you have no way of developing any more goodness
So you shouldn't underestimate the power of goodness
As long as you've got the time and the opportunity then whenever you notice the chance to do goodness of which you're capable you should hurry up and make the effort trying to develop that goodness as soon as you can
If death were to come right now what would you have left
Nothing
All you could do is wrap up the trail mix you've put aside  in other words the goodness you've done in the past
When you remember it that goodness will nourish your spirit helping you reach one of the good destinations in the heavenly worlds
If you've developed your mind in strong concentration you'll be able to gain release from the range of worldliness and take your heart to the transcendent
So those of us who haven't yet developed the goodness we've hoped for Don't underestimate what you've got
Regard what you've done as your wealth
This wealth of yours is what will prevent your life from falling into low places
As long as you stay in this world you can depend on the good you've done to determine the course of your life
If you leave this world your goodness will follow you like a shadow at all times
Here I've been talking about the goodness we've joined our hearts together in developing here
Take the advice I've given and remember it as part of your recollection of the Dhamma
Translator's note This is one of Ajaan Lee's few tape recorded talks dating from October just six months before he passed away
In the talk he covers the eight classical forms of knowledge and skill that come from the practice of concentration discussing how they relate to the methods of science and other forms of worldly knowledge
Three of the knowledges toward the end of the list are barely touched on and the end of the talk is fairly abrupt
This may have been due to the tape's running out for he had quite a lot to say on these knowledges in his other talks and writings
Still the heart of the talk  the role of thinking and notthinking in developing concentration and liberating insight  is discussed in considerable detail making this an extremely helpful guide to the how of concentration and insight practice
I'm going to talk about knowledge  the highest level of knowledge not ordinary knowledge
Ordinary knowledge is adulterated with a lot of defilements and mental fermentations and so it's called hethimavijja lower knowledge
Lower knowledge is something everyone has Buddhist and nonBuddhist alike the various branches of worldly knowledge that people study from textbooks so as to run their societies and administer their nations
And then there are the special branches of knowledge the scientific ways of thinking that people use to invent all sorts of amazing contraptions for the human race  things like clairvoyance clairaudience and powers of levitation
They've gotten to the point where these contraptions can work in place of people
During the last war for instance I heard that they were able to drop bombs on other countries without sending people along with them
With a push of a button they could tell the missile where to go what to do and when it had finished the job to their satisfaction have it come back home
This is what's called progress in worldly knowledge  or lokiya vijja
This kind of knowledge is common all over the world and falls into the two sorts that I've mentioned the sort that comes from studying books and the sort that comes from thinking things through or cintamayapañña
This second kind of knowledge arises within the mind itself
People with a lot of education in the theoretical sciences work with their thinking
They think to the point where an idea appears as a picture in the mind like an uggahanimitta
When the picture appears in the mind they may sketch it down on paper and then experiment with physical objects to see if it works
If it doesn't work they make adjustments creating a new idea from their old idea  adjusting it a bit here expanding it a bit there  keeping at it until they find what works in line with their aims
If we think about this on a shallow level it's really amazing
But if we think a little bit deeper it's not so amazing at all
They take their starting point with something really simple for example how to make a small person large or a large person small  something really really simple
Then they take a mirror and bend it in so that a tall person will turn into a small person
They bend it out so that a small person will become tall
That's all to begin with
Then they keep thinking along these lines until they can take a faraway object and make it appear up close
The people who get these things started tend to be military strategists
They're the ones who usually get these ideas first
Another important branch of science is medicine
People in both these branches have to think deeper than people in general
For example people in ships out at sea got it into their heads that they'd like to see the ships approaching them from a distance
How can we see them
How can we get their image to appear in our ship They worked on this idea until they succeeded
First they started out really simpleminded just like us
Simpleminded in what way
They thought like a mirror that's all nothing special
They put a mirror up high on a mast and then had a series of mirrors pick up the image in the first mirror and send it on down into the ship
They didn't have to look in the first mirror
They could look at a little tiny mirror down in the ship and see ships approaching from far away
That's all they used in the beginning
After a while they made a single mirror in waves
When an image hit the top wave the next wave picked it up and sent it on down the waves of the mirror into the ship
They kept thinking about this until now no more They have radar a tiny little box that doesn't use a series of mirrors and doesn't use a mirror in waves but can still pull the image of a faraway ship and make it appear in your ship
This is how knowledge develops to a high level in the sciences
As for medicine doctors these days are researching into how they can keep people from dying
Lots of people are doing the research but no one has found the solution
No matter how much research they do people are still dying
They haven't succeeded in making people live longer than their ordinary span
This is another branch of knowledge that comes from thinking and not from textbooks
And there's still another branch that's moving even further out but how far they'll get is hard to say
These are the people who want to go and live on Mars
It must be really nice up there
But the chances of their succeeding are small
Why are they small
Because the people aren't really sincere
And why aren't they sincere
Because they're still unsure and uncertain
The idea isn't really clear in their heads
This uncertainty is what gets in the way of success
So this is the second level of worldly knowledge the level that comes from thinking and ideas or cintamayapañña
But in the final analysis neither of these two levels of knowledge can take us beyond suffering and stress
They're the type of knowledge that creates bad kamma about percent of the time
Only percent of the time do they actually benefit the human race
Why only percent
If another war gets started total disaster
The kinds of knowledge that are really useful that give convenience to human transportation and communication are few and far between
For the most part worldly knowledge is aimed at massive killing at amassing power and influence
That's why it doesn't lead beyond suffering and stress doesn't lead beyond birth aging illness and death
Take for instance the countries at present that are clever in building all kinds of weapons
They sell their weapons to other countries and sometimes those other countries use the weapons to kill people in the countries that built them
There are countries that can't build their own weapons yet they declare war on the countries who gave them military aid
That's about as far as the results of worldly knowledge can take you
This is why the Buddha taught us a higher level of knowledge Dhamma knowledge
Dhamma knowledge arises in two ways through thinking and through not thinking
The first level of thinking is called appropriate attention
When we hear the Dhamma we have to use appropriate attention to consider things before we're asked to believe them
For instance suppose we want to make merit
We simply hear the word merit and we want some but usually without stopping to think about what sorts of things are appropriate to give as donations and what sorts of people are appropriate to receive our meritorious offerings
You have to consider things carefully consider yourself then consider the object you want to give and then consider the recipient of the object to see if all these things go together
Even if they don't you can still go ahead and give the object of course but it's best that you know what you're doing that you're not acting out of delusion not simply acting out of desire
If you want merit and simply act without giving appropriate attention to things you're lacking the kind of discernment that comes from thinking cintamayapañña
You have to reflect on things on many levels if you want your act of meritmaking to lead to purity
This is called doing good based on discernment
This is what's meant by kusala dhamma the quality of skillfulness
Kusala dhamma is a name for discernment but we usually don't translate that way in Thai
We think of kusala as just another word for merit
Actually kusala can be a noun and it can also be an adjective
As a noun it means the demeanor by which a person acts in good ways in body speech and mind
As an adjective it refers to this and that kind of act leading to this and that kind of purity
When we apply it to discernment it means kusalopaya a skillful strategy
When we do anything at all we have to use our discernment to consider things from every angle before we act so that our actions will give complete results
This is called having a skillful strategy for giving rise to goodness within ourselves in full purity
This is why the Buddha taught us to start out by using appropriate attention in considering things over and over around and around many times
Only then  when things are really clear in the mind  should we act
It's the nature of things that the more you walk back and forth on a path the more smooth it gets worn
When the path gets worn really smooth you can see the door at the far end
If you walk back and forth many times the grass and weeds on the path all die
And knowledge arises you learn which plants growing on the side of the path can be eaten and which ones can't
As the path gets worn more and more smooth you gain all sorts of benefits
One it doesn't hurt your feet to walk on it
Two you learn what's growing along the side of the path which plants can be eaten and what uses there are for the plants that can't
You might be able to make them into compost
As for the plants that can be eaten if there's more than enough for you to eat you can take what's left and sell it on the market
These are called side benefits
In addition when you're in a hurry you can run easily along the path
If you need to rest it doesn't hurt to sit on it
If you're sleepy and the path is really smooth you can lie right down on it
If a snake or an enemy crosses your path you can run quickly in the other direction
So there are all sorts of good benefits
In the same way when we plan to make merit or do anything skillfully we should think things over back and forth many many times before acting and we'll get good results
This is the first level of thinking called cintamayapañña
The next level goes deeper
It's called directed thought and evaluation
This level isn't said to be a part of cintamayapañña but it's a similar sort of thing only with a difference
That's why it has to be given another name bhavanamayapañña the discernment that comes with meditation
When you meditate you have to think
If you don't think you can't meditate because thinking forms a necessary part of meditation
Take jhana for instance
Use your powers of directed thought to bring the mind to the object and your powers of evaluation to be discriminating in your choice of an object
Examine the object of your meditation until you see that it's just right for you
You can choose slow breathing fast breathing short breathing long breathing narrow breathing broad breathing hot cool or warm breathing a breath that goes only as far as the nose a breath that goes only as far as the base of the throat a breath that goes all the way down to the heart
When you've found an object that suits your taste catch hold of it and make the mind one focused on a single object
Once you've done this evaluate your object
Direct your thoughts to making it stand out
Don't let the mind leave the object
Don't let the object leave the mind
Tell yourself that it's like eating Put the food in line with your mouth put your mouth in line with the food
Don't miss
If you miss and go sticking the food in your ear under your chin in your eye or on your forehead you'll never get anywhere in your eating
So it is with your meditation
Sometimes the 'one' object of your mind takes a sudden sharp turn into the past back hundreds of years
Sometimes it takes off into the future and comes back with all sorts of things to clutter your mind
This is like taking your food sticking it up over your head and letting it fall down behind you  the dogs are sure to get it or like bringing the food to your mouth and then tossing it out in front of you
When you find this happening it's a sign that your mind hasn't been made snug with its object
Your powers of directed thought aren't firm enough
You have to bring the mind to the object and then keep after it to make sure it stays put
Like eating Make sure the food is in line with the mouth and stick it right in
This is directed thought The food is in line with the mouth the mouth is in line with the food
You're sure it's food and you know what kind it is  main course or dessert coarse or refined
Once you know what's what and it's in your mouth chew it right up
This is evaluation examining reviewing your meditation
Sometimes this comes under threshold concentration examining a coarse object to make it more and more refined
If you find that the breath is long examine long breathing
If it's short examine short breathing
If it's slow examine slow breathing  to see if the mind will stay with that kind of breathing to see if that kind of breathing will stay with the mind to see whether or not the breath is smooth and unhindered
This is evaluation
When the mind gives rise to directed thought and evaluation you have both concentration and discernment
Directed thought and singleness of preoccupation fall under the heading of concentration evaluation under the heading of discernment
When you have both concentration and discernment the mind is still and knowledge can arise
If there's too much evaluation though it can destroy your stillness of mind
If there's too much stillness it can snuff out thought
You have to watch over the stillness of your mind to make sure you have things in the right proportions
If you don't have a sense of 'just right' you're in for trouble
If the mind is too still your progress will be slow
If you think too much it'll run away with your concentration
So observe things carefully
Again it's like eating
If you go shoveling food into your mouth you might end up choking to death
You have to ask yourself Is it good for me
Can I handle it
Are my teeth strong enough
Some people have nothing but empty gums and yet they want to eat sugar cane It's not normal
Some people even though their teeth are aching and falling out still want to eat crunchy foods
So it is with the mind As soon as it's just a little bit still we want to see this know that  we want to take on more than we can handle
You first have to make sure that your concentration is solidly based that your discernment and concentration are properly balanced
This point is very important
Your powers of evaluation have to be ripe your directed thought firm
Say you have a water buffalo tie it to a stake and pound the stake deep into the ground
If your buffalo is strong it just might walk or run away with the stake and then it's all over the place
You have to know your buffalo's strength
If it's really strong pound the stake so that it's firmly in the ground and keep watch over it
In other words if you find that the obsessiveness of your thinking is getting out of hand going beyond the bounds of mental stillness fix the mind in place and make it extra still  but not so still that you lose track of things
If the mind is too quiet it's like being in a daze
You don't know what's going on at all
Everything is dark blotted out
Or else you have good and bad spells sinking out of sight and then popping up again
This is concentration without directed thought or evaluation with no sense of judgment Wrong Concentration
So you have to be observant
Use your judgment  but don't let the mind get carried away by its thoughts
Your thinking is something separate
The mind stays with the meditation object
Wherever your thoughts may go spinning your mind is still firmly based  like holding onto a post and spinning around and around
You can keep on spinning and yet it doesn't wear you out
But if you let go of the post and spin around three times you get dizzy and  Bang
 fall flat on your face
So it is with the mind If it stays with the singleness of its preoccupation it can keep thinking and not get tired not get harmed
Your thinking is cintamayapañña your stillness bhavanamayapañña they're right there together
This is the strategy of skillfulness discernment on the level of concentration practice
Thinking and stillness keep staying together like this
When we practice generosity it comes under the level of appropriate attention when we practice virtue it comes under the level of appropriate attention and when we practice concentration we don't lose a beat  it comes under the same sort of principle only more advanced directed thought and evaluation
When you have directed thought and evaluation in charge of the mind then the more you think the more solid and sure the mind gets
The more you sit and meditate the more you think
The mind becomes more and more firm until all the Hindrances fall away
The mind no longer goes looking for concepts
Now it can give rise to knowledge
The knowledge here isn't ordinary knowledge
It washes away your old knowledge
You don't want the knowledge that comes from ordinary thinking and reasoning Let go of it
You don't want the knowledge that comes from directed thought and evaluation Stop
Make the mind quiet
Still
When the mind is still and unhindered this is the essence of all that's meritorious and skillful
When your mind is on this level it isn't attached to any concepts at all
All the concepts you've known  dealing with the world or the Dhamma however many or few  are washed away
Only when they're washed away can new knowledge arise
This is why we're taught not to hold onto concepts  all the labels and names we have for things
You have to let yourself be poor
It's when people are poor that they become ingenious and resourceful
If you don't let yourself be poor you'll never gain discernment
In other words you don't have to be afraid of being stupid or of missing out on things
You don't have to be afraid that you've hit a dead end
You don't want any of the insights you've gained from listening to others or from reading books because they're concepts and therefore inconstant
You don't want any of the insights you've gained by reasoning and thinking because they're concepts and therefore notself
Let all these insights disappear leaving just the mind firmly intent leaning neither to the left toward selftorment or being displeased nor to the right toward sensual indulgence or being pleased
Keep the mind still quiet neutral impassive  set tall
And there you are Right Concentration
When Right Concentration arises in the mind it has a shadow
When you can catch sight of the shadow appearing that's vipassana insight meditation
Vipassanañana is the first branch of knowledge and skill in the Buddha's teaching
The second branch is iddhividhi the power of mind over matter
The third is manomayiddhi the power of mindmade images
The fourth is dibbacakkhu clairvoyance
The fifth is dibbasota clairaudience
The sixth is cetopariyañana the ability to read minds
The seventh is pubbenivasanussatiñana knowledge of previous lifetimes
And the eighth asavakkhayañana knowledge of the ending of mental fermentations
All eight of these branches are forms of knowledge and skill that arise from concentration
People without concentration can't gain them that's an absolute guarantee
No matter how smart or clever they may be they can't gain these forms of knowledge
They have to fall under the power of ignorance
These eight branches of knowledge come from Right Concentration
When they arise they're not called thoughts or ideas
They're called Right Views
What looks wrong to you is really wrong
What looks right is really right
If what looks right is really wrong that's Wrong View
If what looks wrong is really right again  Wrong View
With Right View though right looks right and wrong looks wrong
To put it in terms of cause and effect you see the four Noble Truths
You see stress and it really is stressful
You see the cause of stress arising and that it's really causing stress
These are Noble Truths absolutely undeniably indisputably true
You see that stress has a cause
Once the cause arises there has to be stress
As for the way to the disbanding of stress you see that the path you're following will without a doubt lead to Liberation
Whether or not you go all the way what you see is correct
This is Right View
And as for the disbanding of stress you see that there really is such a thing
You see that as long as you're on the path stress does in fact fall away
When you come to realize the truth of these things in your heart that's vipassanañana
To put it even more simply You see that all things inside as well as out are undependable
The body is undependable aging is undependable death is undependable
They're slippery characters constantly changing on you
To see this is to see inconstancy
Don't let yourself be pleased by inconstancy
Don't let yourself be upset
Keep the mind neutral on an even keel
That's what's meant by vipassana
Sometimes inconstancy makes us happy sometimes it makes us sad
Say we hear that a person we don't like is going to be demoted or is sick or dying
It makes us gleeful and we can't wait for him or her to die
His body is impermanent his life is uncertain  it can change  but we're glad
That's a defilement
Say we hear that a son or daughter has become wealthy influential and famous and we become happy
Again our mind has strayed from the noble path
It's not firmly in Right Concentration
We have to make the mind neutral not thrilled over things not upset over things not thrilled when our plans succeed not upset when they don't
When we can make the mind neutral like this that's the neutrality of Right View
We see what's wrong what's right and try to steer the mind away from the wrong and toward the right
This is called Right Resolve part of vipassanañana
The same holds true with stress whether it's our stress and pain or somebody else's
Say we hear that an enemy is suffering
'Glad to hear it' we think
'Hope they hurry up and die' The heart has tilted
Say we hear that a friend has become wealthy and we become happy or a son or daughter is ill and we become sad
Our mind has fallen in with suffering and stress
Why
Because we don't have any knowledge
We're unskilled
The mind isn't centered
In other words it's not in Right Concentration
We have to look after the mind
Don't let it fall in with stress
Whatever suffers let it suffer but don't let the mind suffer with it
The people in the world may be pained but the mind isn't pained along with them
Pain may arise in the body but the mind isn't pained along with it
Let the body go ahead and suffer but the mind doesn't suffer
Keep the mind neutral
Don't be pleased by pleasure either  pleasure is a form of stress you know
How so
It can change
It can rise and fall
It can be high and low
It can't last
That's stress
Pain is also stress double stress
When you gain this sort of insight into stress  when you really see stress  vipassana has arisen in the mind
As for anatta notself Once we've examined things and seen them for what they really are we don't make claims we don't display influence we don't try to show that we have the right or the power to bring things that are notself under our control
No matter how hard we try we can't prevent birth aging illness and death
If the body is going to be old let it be old
If it's going to hurt let it hurt
If it has to die let it die
Don't be pleased by death either your own or that of others
Don't be upset by death your own or that of others
Keep the mind neutral
Unruffled
Unfazed
This is sankharupekkhañana letting sankharas  all things fashioned and fabricated  follow their own inherent nature
The mind like this is in vipassana
This is the first branch of knowledge  vipassana  in brief You see that all things fashioned are inconstant stressful and notself
You can disentangle them from your grasp
You can let go
This is where it gets good
How so
You don't have to wear yourself out lugging sankharas around
To be attached means to carry a load and there are five heaps we carry
rupupadanakkhandho physical phenomena are the first load
vedanupadanakkhandho feelings that we're attached to are another
saññupadanakkhandho the concepts and labels that we claim are ours are a pole for carrying a load on our shoulder
sankharupadanakkhandho the mental fashionings that we hang onto and think are ours
viññanupadanakkhandho our attachment to sensory consciousness
Go ahead Carry them around
Hang one load from your left leg and one from your right
Put one on your left shoulder and one on your right
Put the last load on your head
And now Carry them wherever you go  clumsy encumbered and comical
The Buddha taught that whoever lacks discernment whoever is unskilled whoever doesn't practice concentration leading to liberating insight will have to be burdened with stress will always be loaded down
It's pathetic
It's a shame
They'll never get away
When they're loaded down like this it's really pathetic
Their legs are burdened their shoulders burdened  and where are they going
Three steps forward and two steps back
Soon they'll get discouraged and then after a while they'll pick themselves up and get going again
Now when we see inconstancy  that all things fashioned whether within us or without are undependable when we see that they're stressful when we see that they're not our self that they simply whirl around in and of themselves When we gain these insights we can put down our burdens ie let go of our attachments
We can put down the past  ie stop dwelling in it
We can let go of the future  ie stop yearning for it
We can let go of the present  ie stop claiming it as the self
Once these three big baskets have fallen from our shoulders we can walk with a light step
We can even dance
We're beautiful
Wherever we go people will be glad to know us
Why
Because we're not encumbered
Whatever we do we can do with ease
We can walk run dance and sing  all with a light heart
We're Buddhism's beauty a sight for sore eyes graceful wherever we go
No longer burdened no longer encumbered we can be at our ease
This is vipassanañana the first branch of knowledge
So
Now that we've cleared away these splinters and thorns so that everything is level and smooth we can relax
And now we're ready for the knowledge that we can use as a weapon
What's the knowledge we use as a weapon
Iddhividhi
We can display powers in one way or another and give rise to miraculous things by way of the body by way of speech or by way of the mind
We have powers that we can use in doing the work of the religion
That's called iddhividhi
But in the Canon they describe it as different kinds of walking walking through the water without getting wet walking through fire without getting hot staying out in the rain without getting chilled staying out in the wind without getting cold resilient enough to withstand wind rain and sun
If you're young you can make yourself old if old you can make yourself young
If you're tall you can make yourself short if short you can make yourself tall
You can change your body in all kinds of ways
This is why the Buddha was able to teach all kinds of people
If he was teaching old people he'd make his body look old
Old people talking with old people can have a good time because there's no distrust or suspicion
If he met up with pretty young women he could make himself look young
He'd enjoy talking with them they'd enjoy talking with him and not get bored
This is why the Dhamma he taught appealed to all classes of people
He could adapt his body to fit with whatever type of society he found himself in
For instance if he met up with children he'd talk about the affairs of children act in a childlike way
If he met up with old people he'd talk about the affairs of old people
If he met up with young men and women he'd talk about the affairs of young men and women
They'd all enjoy listening to what he had to say develop a sense of faith become Buddhists and even ordain
This is called iddhividhi
Next is manomayiddhi power in the area of the mind
The mind acquires power
What kind of power
You can go wherever you want
If you want to go sightseeing in hell you can
If you want to get away from human beings you can go sightseeing in hell
It's nice and relaxing
You can play with the denizens of hell fool around with the denizens of hell
Any of them who have only a little bad kamma can come up and chat with you to send word back to their relatives
Once you get back from touring around hell you can tell the relatives to make merit in the dead person's name
Or if you want you can travel in the world of common animals and chat with mynah birds owls  any kind of bird  or with fourfooted animals twofooted animals
You can go into the forests into the wilds and converse with the animals there
It's a lot of fun not like talking with people
Talking with people is hard talking with animals is easy
You don't have to say a lot simply think in the mind tell them stories ask them questions like Now that you're an animal what do you eat
Do you get enough to stay full and content You find that you have a lot of companions there people who used to be your friends and relatives
Or if you want you can travel in the world of the hungry shades
The world of the hungry shades is even more fun
Hungry shades come in all different shapes and sizes  really entertaining the hungry shades
Some of them have heads as big as large water jars but their mouths are just like the eye of a needle that's all no bigger than the eye of a needle
Some of them have legs six yards long but hands only half a foot
They're amazing to watch just like a cartoon
Some of them have lower lips with no upper lips some of them are missing their lips altogether with their teeth exposed all the time
There are all kinds of hungry shades
Some of them have big bulging eyes the size of coconuts others have fingernails as long as palm leaves
You really ought to see them
Some of them are so fat they can't move others so thin that they're nothing but bones
And sometimes the different groups get into battles biting each other hitting each other
That's the hungry shades for you
Really entertaining
This is called manomayiddhi
When the mind is firmly established you can go see these things
Or you can go to the land of the nagas the different lands on the human level  sometimes when you get tired of human beings you can go visit the heavens the heaven of the Four Great Kings the heaven of the Guardians of the Hours the Thirtythree gods all the way up there to the Brahma worlds
The mind can go without any problem
This is called manomayiddhi
It's a lot of fun
Your defilements are gone your work is done you've got enough rice to eat and money to spend so you can go traveling to see the sights and soak up the breezes
That's manomayiddhi
Dibbacakkhu clairvoyance
You gain eyes on two levels
The outer level is called the mansacakkhu the eye of the flesh which enables you to look at human beings in the world devas in the world
The eye of discernment allows you to examine the defilements of human beings those with coarse defilements those with thick defilements those with faith in the Buddha's teachings those with none those who have the potential to be taught those with no potential at all
You can consider them with your internal discernment
This is called paññacakkhu the eye of discernment
In this way you have eyes on two levels
Most of us have eyes on only one level the eye of the flesh while the inner eye doesn't arise
And how could it arise
You don't wash the sleep out of your eyes
What are the bits of sleep in your eyes
Sensual desire an enormous hunk
Ill will another big hunk
Sloth and torpor a hunk the size of a hammer head
Your mind calms down and begins to grow still but this hunk of sleep in your eyes is so heavy it makes you nod
This is called sloth and torpor
All you can think about is lying down to sleep
Then there's restlessness and anxiety another hunk of sleep and uncertainty still another
When these things get stuck in the heart how can it possibly be bright
It's dark on all sides
Now when you develop your meditation and bring the mind to stillness that's called getting the sleep out of your eyes
Directed thought loosens it up and evaluation rinses it out
Once your eyes gets rinsed and washed clean this way they can see clearly
The eye of your mind becomes the eye of discernment
This is called dibbacakkhu
Dibbasota clairaudience
There are two levels of ears as well
The outer ears are the ones made of skin
The inner ear is the ear of the heart
The ear of the heart doesn't appear for the same sort of reason its full of earwax
You never clean it out
You don't build up any goodness in the area of the mind
The mind isn't centered in concentration
When it's not in concentration and hears an attractive sound it can't stay still
Your ears are full of wax
You hear people gossiping or cursing each other out and you love to hear it
This is a humongous hunk of wax stuck in your ear
As for the Dhamma you're not really interested in listening which is why there's nothing but earwax earwax stuck in your mind earwax all over everything outside
This is why your powers of clairaudience don't arise
Clairaudience is really refreshing
You don't have to waste your time listening
If you feel like listening you can hear anything
What the hungry shades are talking about what common animals are talking about what the devas are talking about  how fantastic it is to be in heaven  you can hear it all unless you don't want to listen
Like a radio If it's turned on you can hear it loud and clear
If it becomes a nuisance you don't have to keep it on
If you have this skill you can turn it on to listen for the fun of it if you don't want to listen you can turn it off in an instant
This is called clairaudience one of the skills of concentration practice
Another skill is cetopariyañana the ability to read minds to see if people are thinking good thoughts or bad high low crude evil you can use this insight to know
This is called cetopariyañana an important skill
Then there's pubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember previous lives and asavakkhayañana the ability to clean out the mind washing away all the ignorance craving and clinging inside it
You can keep ignorance from arising in the heart
You can keep craving from taking charge of the heart
You can make sure that there's no clinging or attachment
When you can let go of your defilements  kamajaho when you're not stuck on sensual objects or sensual desires ditthijaho when you're not stuck on views and opinions avijjajaho when you don't mistake ignorance for knowledge and can let it go without any attachment  when you don't latch onto evil when you don't latch onto your own goodness when you can spit out evil and goodness without holding onto them as your own letting them go in line with their nature That's called asavakkhayañana the knowledge of the ending of the fermentations in the mind
This is the third noble truth the truth of cessation achieved through the practices that give rise to knowledge and skill
These are the skills that arise from meditation practice
They're uparimavijja higher learning in the area of the religion
When you've got them you can be at your ease  at ease if you die at ease if you don't
You don't have to build a rocket to go to Mars
You can live right here in the world and nothing will be able to harm you
In other words you know what things are dangerous what things are harmful and so you leave them alone and don't touch them
This way you can live in safety and peace
The heart can stay blooming and bright like this at all times
This is why we should be earnest and strict with ourselves in the practice so that we can achieve the aims we all want
Here I've explained the eight knowledges in brief
If I were to go into detail there would be lots more to say
To boil it down All these forms of knowledge come from stillness
If the mind isn't still they don't arise
At best if the mind isn't still you can gain knowledge only from listening reading or thinking things over
But the person who can stop thinking stop pondering and yet can still be intelligent That's something really amazing something that goes against the currents of the world
Normally people in the world have to study and read think and ponder if they want to be intelligent
But with the Dhamma you have to stop thinking stop writing stop memorizing stop doing in order to gain the highest level of knowledge
This is something that goes against the currents of the world and that human beings find hard to do
But when you become intent in the practice that gives rise to knowledge you'll succeed in line with your aspirations
Having talked on the theme of vijjacaranasampanno I'll end right here
Every human being falls under the same conditions
In the beginning we're born then in the middle we change and in the end we fall apart and die
Death is something no one aspires to and yet no one can escape it
We all have death at the end of our path
Thinking about death gives rise both to benefits and to harm
For shortsighted people it's harmful because it makes them so depressed and discouraged that they don't want to do any good in the world
In other words all they see is the part that dies
They don't see the part that doesn't
Actually there are two parts to every person the part that can die and the part that doesn't die
For example the nature of the body is to keep changing until it falls apart
You can say that it dies and you can say that it doesn't
The word dies applies to the fact that the person disappears from his or her friends and relatives but the elements of the body simply go back to their original form
The earth returns to being earth the water to water the fire to fire and wind to wind
It's like a cube of ice if you keep the ice long enough it'll return to its original condition of being water
So you can say that the body dies and you can say that it doesn't die  simply that it doesn't maintain the same form it had
According to the conventions of the world this is called death but wise people don't see death as anything strange or out of the ordinary
The only question is whether death is accompanied by merit or not
This brings us to the mind that used to stay with the body
This is the important part because it doesn't die
It simply changes in line with the way good and evil arrange things for it
In other words they arrange the level of the mind the place where it takes rebirth
If you do good you'll have to go to a good destination
If you do evil you'll have to go to a bad destination
If you develop goodness to the ultimate degree so that you can let go of good and evil the mind will become changeless or what's called deathless
But most of us can't conceive of the truth
We tend to overlook it so that we never reach the deathless
This is because of our own stupidity and lack of discernment
Our ignorance hides the truth from us
The nature of the mind is very subtle
You can't see it with your eyes
Some people say it doesn't exist which is why people who don't consider things carefully say that death is followed by annihilation
We can make a comparison with the fire element in the air
The mind is like the fire element
The body is like a lit candle
When the candle runs out of its wax and wick the fire has to go out
But when the fire goes out that doesn't mean that no fire is left in the world
We're able to light another candle because of the fire element still there throughout the air
That's the way it is with us when the body falls apart the mind gives rise to a new level of being for itself as long as it still has the fuel of ignorance craving and clinging
This is why the Buddha taught his disciples not to be heedless to develop as much merit and skillfulness as possible for merit and skillfulness are what bring happiness both in this world and in the next
This is in line with the sayings
The word merit here means the happiness or wellbeing that results from doing good
The good we can do comes in many forms but in short there are two kinds
The merit that acts as a cause comes in three types danamaya the merit of being generous silamaya the merit of observing the precepts and bhavanamaya the merit of meditating
In the Abhidhamma these three types are divided into ten meritorious activities
Generosity is expanded to include pattidanamaya the merit of dedicating merit to others and pattanumodanamaya the merit of appreciating other people's merit
These three go together in that they all counteract jealousy and stinginess
The merit of observing the precepts is expanded to include apacayanamaya the merit of showing respect to people worthy of respect such as our elders and those to whom we should be grateful veyyavaccamaya the merit that comes in helping others in skillful activities sharing your strength wealth and intelligence
These three all go together in that they're related to interpersonal virtue
As for the merit of meditation that's expanded to include dhammassavanamaya the merit of listening to the Dhamma dhammadesanamaya the merit of teaching the Dhamma and ditth'ujukamma making one's views straight
All four of these go together in that they are all sources of discernment
These forms of merit can arise only when they are rooted in mental states free of greed aversion and delusion
As the Pali says alobho danahetu lack of greed is the basis for generosity adoso silahetu lack of aversion is the basis for virtue and amoho bhavanahetu lack of delusion is the basis for developing the mind in meditation
The merit you do gives you ease in body and mind
Whenever you think of the good you've done it will always make you happy
It's a noble treasure that follows you just as your shadow follows you at all times
Even when you die the merit you've done will follow you and arrange a good place for you to be reborn
This is called puññabhisankhara merit as a fabricating factor
When people are about to die they are like travelers getting ready to abroad
Before they go they have to prepare themselves
Only then will the trip be comfortable
For example they have to put money in the bank exchanging their Thai currency for foreign currency so they can use it when they're abroad
If they simply take their Thai money along with them they won't be able to use it to buy anything
In the same way when people leave this world at death they can't take along their wealth or possessions to use in the next world
Instead while they're still alive here they have to deposit their money in the bank for Buddhists and exchange it for noble treasures or inner wealth
What this means is that they make donations for example in homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
That way they'll be able to use their wealth in the next world
If they have only counterfeit money  ie if they've done nothing but evil and unskillful things  they won't be able to go to anywhere comfortable or prosperous because they lack the funds needed to take themselves there
They won't be able to return to the human world because they lack the funds  the human values  needed to take themselves there
So they'll have to turn into hungry ghosts wandering around losing their way haunting people and possessing them suffering all kinds of hardships
For this reason being generous is like depositing your money in a bank so that you'll be able to use it when you go abroad
That's the first step
The second step is to get a passport as proof of your nationality
What this means is that you establish yourself in the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha observing the precepts to get rid of the gross defilements in your words and deeds as proof of your status as a member of the Buddha's following
The third step is to learn foreign languages
In other words you have to practice tranquillity meditation and insight meditation so as to get rid of the intermediate and refined defilements  the Hindrances  in the heart straightening out the heart so that you can give rise to three forms of knowledge
These three forms of knowledge count as the foreign languages you'll need for your journey
Your trip will be easy and fun dazzling bright with plenty of treasures along the way
You'll see sights you've never seen before such as the heavens and brahma worlds
This is what it means to be wellgone Even as you stay here you'll stay well
If you want to come back you'll be able to
If you don't you can continue your studies and go all the way to nibbana released from having to swim around in the cycle of death and rebirth
You'll reach security joyful and free from danger of every sort
The practice of generosity virtue and meditation thus results in three types of treasure  the treasure of the human state the treasure of the heavenly state and the treasure of nibbana  in line with your abilities to do the practice
People who are complete in all three of these forms of skillfulness are said to go well come well and stay well because their thoughts words and deeds have been trained well
Wherever they go they are free from animosity and danger for they are loved and respected by all beings human and divine
So we should each look at our condition realizing that we're on a journey leading day by day minute by minute to death
There's no escaping this
For this reason we should develop the three forms of skillfulness and merit  generosity virtue and meditation  so that the happiness and security resulting from goodness will arise for us taking us beyond death in line with our abilities
The Dhamma is something that cleanses the mind so that it's bright clean and happy
People differ in their temperaments some are crude others intermediate and others refined
This is why the Buddha elaborated on the Dhamma in various ways in line with the character of his listeners
In other words he took short things and explained them until they were long
For example sometimes he'd explain the rewards of generosity sometimes the rewards of virtue and sometimes the rewards of polishing the heart what's called meditation
But his real aim was to teach people to make their minds pure
Everything else was just elaboration
Each of us human beings is like a person sitting in a boat in the middle of an ocean filled with wind waves and storms
Some people are floating so far out they can't even see the shore
Some are bobbing up and down so that sometimes they see the shore and sometimes they don't
This stands for the people who are repeating buddho buddho
Some people are floating closer to land so that they can see the fish traps the sailboats and the green trees on shore
Some have struggled to swim closer to shore but they still haven't made it to land
As for the Buddha he's like a person standing on the shore free from all the dangers of being at sea
He's seen the dangers that people are subject to which is why he has the great compassion to want to help us get out of the sea and safely on land
This is why he teaches us to practice generosity virtue and meditation for these are the things that will pull us safely on to shore
When we set our minds on practicing the Dhamma we have to set our sights on the Dhamma's true aim
Don't go wandering off in other directions
You have to know which path is the wrong one the dangerous one and which one is the right one the safe one
It's like steering a ship across the ocean
The captain has to watch for the signals of the lighthouse
Or you can make a comparison with driving a car The traffic police have their red yellow and green lights as traffic signals at the major intersections
If when the signal has its red light on you don't stop then if you keep on driving there's bound to be danger and you're sure to get pulled over
If the green light is on but you don't go that's wrong too
This is why when you're driving you have to understand the signals so that you'll reach your destination safely
It's the same when you're traveling to the Dhamma
You have to know the Buddha's traffic signals
His red lights are his prohibitions the things he doesn't allow
Anyone who lets his or her boat or car go through the red light will have to meet with danger
So while we're meditating here we have to make sure we don't go through the red light of our defilements
The Buddha compared our defilements to fire
The heat of our single sun can make the world as hot as it is
Think of how hot it would be if there were five or six suns
The defilements around each of our senses are like the heat of the sun
Cakkhum adittam the eye is a mass of fire
Sotam adittam the ear is a mass of flame
Ghanam adittam the nose is a mass of fire
Jivha aditta the tongue is a mass of flame
Kayo aditto the body is a mass of fire
Mano aditto the heart is a mass of flame
Don't let these six masses of fire burn you
Normally the sensual desires arising around the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind are red masses of flame burning away at the heart
If while we're meditating we stick our minds into these preoccupations it's like taking a burning match and sticking it into some kerosene or gasoline
For this reason while you're meditating don't stick your mind into the affairs of your family your home your belongings or absolutely anybody or anything at all
This is the Buddha's red light where he tells you not to go
The other signal is the green light the Dhamma being explained
When the light is green that's a sign for you to go ahead
The green light here stands for the Dhamma you've already studied as well as the Dhamma you're training yourself in right now
When the light is green then whether we're fast or slow we have to go
Don't just loiter around and block the way or the police will arrest you
In other words when the Dhamma arises by way of our eyes ears nose tongue body and mind we have to pursue that goodness
The Dhamma is what pushes or pulls as to goodness and peace
The green light is the Dhamma arising in a heart that's clean and pure
Right now have our minds entered the quality of buddha
This is an important point
We have to be observant to see whether the affairs of our minds are heading toward the green light or toward the red light
If we're not heading in the right direction we have to turn ourselves around
It's like picking flowers washing them and then putting them in a vase
We have to make sure there aren't any worms or caterpillars eating away at them
Make the mind like a pure blooming lotus in a vase
This qualifies as the quality of buddha
Or think of it in another way the mind is cool and refreshed like a lotus blooming in the middle of a pond
It's surrounded by nourishing water cool and with an appealing scent
If you're sitting here in the meditation hall without any hindrances in the mind it's like a lotus in the middle of a pond
This is also called the quality of buddha
This is called the radiant mind or in simpler terms the quality of inner worth
When the mind is saturated in inner worth like this it's happy and at ease
The Dhamma is a preoccupation that gives the mind a sense of rapture fullness and ease
When it arises we're taught to develop it and cultivate it as much as possible
Keep the mind in this preoccupation until it attains a state of oneness that's the Dhamma
Whatever is good in the heart we try to raise that goodness to a higher and higher level
Keep evaluating it focusing your mindfulness on it at all times to see how the mind enters into this state of goodness
This is called developing a foundation of mindfulness
If you keep your mindfulness focused on a single path  as when you think buddho buddho  without sending your mind off on other paths the mind grows deeper and deeper into a state of inner worth
Just as when we walk along a path on the ground if we keep walking back and forth on the same path it's bound to get worn smooth
The grasses and weeds will die away and the path will get worn deeper into the ground to the point where when it rains it becomes a watercourse watering our crops so that they grow abundant
We'll be able to sell them for a living and grow rich freed from poverty
This is why this quality of merit or inner worth is called noble wealth
Things deep and refined tend to be high in quality
If the breath is refined the mind refined and mindfulness refined then the brightness of our awareness will spread wider and wider like the electric lights that spread their light throughout the capital
This is different from lantern light which  if we want to see all around us  we have to carry and run around
When the mind is refined and the breath is refined we'll be able to know the breath energies throughout the world
We'll see how things are going with all the elements
The heart will grow even broader so that our foundation of mindfulness becomes the great frame of reference
The mind grows even deeper and cooler
More full and rapturous
Blooming and at ease
When the mind matures in this way you've got noble wealth
You're no longer poor
Coolness is like water
Wherever the ground has water there are bound to be fish crabs crayfish and shellfish grasses and vegetables all of which can be converted to wealth
The Buddha saw the fullness of this mind state which is why he told the monks Don't farm for a living
Don't get involved in receiving gold and silver
Focus on doing only one thing  be intent on really practicing the Dhamma making your minds into the single unified path  and then whatever you want you'll be sure to get
This is because when the mind is full of virtue and Dhamma you'll always have wealth
This is the power that comes from making your goodness deep  like the Chao Phraya River which is deeper and broader than any other river in Thailand
It's full of everything boats rafts motor boats steamboats big boats little boats so that travel and commerce are convenient
In the river will be fish in the fields will be rice melons cucumbers corn wheat  all of these things will be within you
You'll be wealthy in everything
If you don't give rise to goodness then no matter what you won't be wealthy
This is why the Buddha taught the monks Don't be farmers of merchants
And don't worry you won't be poor
Simply build up a lot of goodness in your hearts and all forms of wealth will come flowing your way on their own
But we don't really believe him
We believe our defilements instead and so our minds keep sliding toward red masses of flame rather than to the clear mass of purity
This is why we're taught sukkam bhavetha pandito the wise person develops the clear Dhamma of purity
All I've mentioned so far deals with the qualities of the Buddha and Dhamma
The quality of the Sangha means making the mind go forward without sliding back
We keep putting our mind into good shape
For instance when the eye sees something that isn't good our mind is in good shape
The ear hears something that isn't good yet our mind is in good shape
The nose smells an aroma that isn't good the tongue tastes a flavor that isn't good the body touches a tactile sensation that isn't good yet our mind is still in good shape
This is called supatipanno practicing rightly
When we keep the mind straight on the right path that's called ujupatipanno practicing straightforwardly
When we bring the mind to the level of insight meditation attaining the transcendent that's ñayapatipanno practicing for the sake of knowledge
As for samicipatipanno practicing masterfully that means making our goodness even better and better
For example when defilement arises in the heart we have to use the Dhamma to pen it in
Defilement is like a rabid dog running around in misery
Whoever it sees it runs right up to bite indiscriminately until eventually it gets killed or falls down dead on its own
In the same way when our defilements arise we have to pen them in quickly and keep them under our thumb
Don't bring them out to put them to use
Greed anger and delusion are intoxicants
When we're intoxicated our minds are in the dark
When we're in the dark we stagger around back and forth dizzy and confused not knowing what way to go and as a result we never get to the destination we want
The Buddha's green light takes us to the clear light of the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
When we have these three gems and are sitting on the crystal throne of the seven forms of noble wealth what suffering will we have
When we make our minds into Dhamma the various defilements that lie fermenting in the heart will have to disappear
There will be nothing to spoil the heart
We'll be able to escape from the sea
Once we get on land we can have all kinds of fun for there are a lot of things we never saw at sea
It's like when we come into the mouth of the Chao Phraya River where there are marsh trees and fresh green plants
We become enchanted and keep walking further inland to Sukhumvit Road
There we see bicycles and trucks and jeeps and pretty automobiles of different colors
This gets us even more excited and some of us get smitten with what we see on land
In other words we fall for the visions and signs that come in meditation
For instance we may begin to remember previous lifetimes
If we remember bad things we become sad
If we remember good things we get happy
This turns into craving the desire to be this or that and some people get really deluded thinking they actually are the things they see
If our discernment isn't strong enough then whatever we see will turn into the corruptions of insight  like people who get all excited the first time they see a car
They go running to the car wanting to ride in it wanting to drive it but without looking right or left or stopping to take note of anything
They run right out into the middle of the road get run over and either die or break an arm or a leg
After all the trouble they went to in order to get out of the sea they get deluded and put themselves in danger all over again
Like the example that happened a few days ago
An old monk came into the monastery so some lay people asked him where he was from and whom he wanted to meet
He told them You all don't know a thing
Ajaan Lee used to be King Asoka which is why he built Wat Asokaram
I'm King Pasenadi the Kosalan his old friend
That's why I've come to visit him today He had his student come in to inform me and so I told the student Quick
Quick
Go back and tell him to go away
He's absolutely forbidden to come in here Even this sort of thing can happen
This is called getting smitten with being on land ie falling for the visions you see
That old monk probably had a few ideas of one sort or another arising in his mind and so got carried away
If you start seeing things when your discernment isn't strong enough it turns into a corruption of insight  as when a person gets excited at the sight of a car because he's never seen one before
He wants to ride in it to drive it so without looking left or right he goes running toward it right into the middle of the road
And so he gets run over by a car and killed or else crippled with a broken leg
This too is a kind of delusion a danger
But if our discernment is strong enough whatever we see will turn into noble treasures
If we see a forest of marsh tress we can put them to use
We can cut them into firewood to use ourselves or sell in the market
If the land is a tangle of weeds we can clear it and turn it into fields
If we don't let it lie fallow it's sure to yield crops
Falling for visions is also called skewed perception The right way to act when you see a vision is to remember to evaluate it and then let it go in line with its true nature
Don't latch onto what you see because all things are inconstant
If you're born poor you suffer from your desire to be rich
If you're born rich you suffer in looking after your possessions afraid that they'll wear out afraid that you'll get cheated out of them afraid that thieves will break in and steal them
There's nothing certain or dependable at all
The same holds true with visions
So whatever you see you have to let it go in line with its nature
Leave the trees in the forest the grass in the meadows and the rice in the fields
If you can do this you can be at your ease because you know what it's like on land what it's like in the water when to get in and when to get out
Once you're skilled you can travel on water or land at ease in every way
You can go forward or back without any obstacles
This is called lokavidu knowing the world
You can stay with what you know but you're not stuck on it
You can live in the ocean without drowning
You can live in the world without getting sunk in the world  like a lotus leaf in the water the water doesn't seep into the leaf at all
Fabricated things belong to no one have no one in charge
If you contemplate them and let go of them in line with their nature  in the same way that you put down a knife without holding onto it  the mind will reach an important point the level of the radiant mind
The Dhamma is something constant and true
The reason we don't see the truth is because we're always spinning around
If we're riding in a car we can't clearly see the things that pass near by us on the road such as how big the stones on the ground are what color they are
We look at trees mountains and fields and they all seem to be on the move
If we've been in a car since birth without stopping to get out and walk around on our own we're sure to think that cars run trees run and mountains run
The fact is though that the truth and our spinning around aren't in line with each other
The running lies in us in the car not in the trees or mountains
Everything that's Dhamma stays firm and constant
That's why it's called the truth
Whatever isn't true isn't Dhamma
In the area of the Dhamma one of the Buddha's highest aims was discernment
He wasn't just out after a sense of peace and ease for simple peace of mind isn't really peaceful isn't really easeful isn't really restful
It still has some unrest mixed in with it
The highest happiness lies above not only peace of mind but also above discernment as well
Most of us when we feel at peace and at ease tend to get heedless and careless
As a result we don't develop any discernment
We can take a lesson from the people of Japan their land is poor their crops grow slowly and the landscape is full of volcanoes
As a result the people have to exert themselves to make a living and always be on the alert ready to evacuate whenever there's danger
This is why they're so active and intelligent solving all their difficulties so that they can bring progress to their country
People who have it easy though tend to be stupid because they have no sense of how to exert themselves to get rid of suffering
People nowadays have studied a lot but they're still stupid
Stupid in what way
Stupid in that they don't know how to fix their own rice sew their own clothes or wash their own clothes
They don't have any skills
The time will have to come when this causes them to suffer and fall into difficulties
Most of us Thai people complain that foreigners are taking over our economy but actually the fault lies with our own stupidity
We can't even make one big toe's worth of happiness for ourselves and instead sit staring off into the distance
Other people run and jump and do everything necessary for the sake of their happiness but we just sit around and create difficulties for our families
Then when we suffer that opens the way for corruption
We get up from a meal and don't wash our own dishes or put them away
If all our discernment is in knowing how to eat how will we ever get anywhere
This is why the Buddha taught the Dhamma both in terms of causes and results skills and their rewards
He taught first about things that lie immediately around us
Once we put ourselves into good shape it will spread to help everyone who comes after us
Whatever causes whatever skills will give rise to peace ease and convenience for ourselves we have to do
The results are sure to follow
On the good side virtue is a cause for concentration
Concentration is a cause for discernment
On the bad side suffering comes from craving
And what does craving come from
From our own stupidity
It's because we're stupid in so many ways that we suffer so much
When craving arises it damages people all around us
This is why we should develop the causes for happiness and ease so as to prevent these kinds of dangers  for when difficulties arise the mind will start spinning in all sorts ways that will cause us to suffer
For this reason you should examine yourself whenever you get the chance at all times
If you start feeling ill at ease you should trace back to the causes
Ask yourself What have I been doing since I got up this morning
What have I been thinking about When you try to cut down a tree but can't cut all the way through you have to look at your machete to see if it's nicked or dull
If you try to cut the tree down with your teeth you won't get anywhere
You have to trace back to the causes of your problems if you want to figure out how to solve them
When you do that all your difficulties will vanish
Knowledge has to come from the discernment we give rise to within ourselves
The lowest or weakest level of discernment knows neither causes nor results
The middle level knows results without knowing their causes or causes without knowing their results
The highest level of discernment knows causes before they give rise to their results
In other words you know what kind of results you'll get from your actions
But most of us don't even know what causes we're creating which is why the results we get aren't good at all
When we want to progress in life we have to give rise to the causes for peace and ease
In other words we have to practice meditation in line with the factors of the noble path
Sammakammanta right action is the cause for peace and ease
Our actions come in all sorts of forms
The way we stand is an action
The movement of the body is an action
The actions the various kinds of work in the world require us to run to pick things up with our body
But in the area of the Dhamma simply sitting still with the right intention is a form of work or action
Lying down with the right intention is a form of work or action
Sitting standing walking lying down all of our movements and postures if done with the right intention are a form of work or action
When our actions are right we'll experience peace and ease
And then how will suffering come our way
The reason we suffer is because our actions are wrong
We sit stand walk and lie down in ways contrary to the Dhamma
And then when we take on other work in addition to our basic actions that work is bound to turn into wrong action as well
This was why the Buddha improved his manners in how he sat stood walked and lay down so that they were all pure in terms of the intentions of his mind
What this means is that he kept practicing tranquillity meditation in all his activities
His mind had to stay with what the body was doing
If the mind told the body to do something but didn't do it along with the body then he didn't succeed in what he wanted to do
He couldn't let the body work on its own
The mind had to work along with the body
Otherwise his old manners would come back and take charge of the mind
Wrong action means thoughts of sensuality thinking in terms of sensual objects that give rise to sensual defilements
Sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas come from the body and mind acting together
If the mind then wants any of these things that's called greed
You want them to be good but when they aren't good in line with your thoughts that gives rise to aversion
If you get carried away by your aversion that's delusion
But if you direct your thinking to the breath that will kill off sensual desires
Evaluate your breath and that will kill off ill will
There are two kinds of evaluation evaluating the in and out breath and evaluating the inner breath sensations of the body until they interact with the other properties of the body
When you reach this point you forget any feelings of ill will
Once the mind and body are full you feel a sense of ease
Rapture and pleasure are thus the results of directed thought and evaluation
Directed thought and evaluation thus count as right action
The principle of cause and effect applies to all your activities both inside and out
The reason we suffer is because we eat
How is eating suffering
Because we never can get full
The body isn't full the mind isn't full
It never has a sense of enough with its preoccupations
This gives rise to hunger
But when the mind stops worrying about eating and instead stays with its right actions then you can be at your ease
Sometimes while you meditate you focus on the cause the sense of seclusion without any thought for the results
Sometimes you stay with the results viharadhamma the ease of staying in the home of the mind
Even though the work this requires may be difficult you aren't worried or concerned
The mind keeps staying with its sense of ease
When you get skilled you gain a sense of when to focus on the causes and when to focus on the results
This is called acting with a sense of causes and results
You're not stuck on any of the baits of the world
You stay exclusively with the ease of the Dhamma
Even though the work may require effort you're not worked up about it
You do it with a sense of wellbeing
When there's a sense of wellbeing the mind doesn't get stirred up
When it's still in this way liberating insight can arise
Our work turns into the work of insight
You watch the properties of sensation when sights strike the eye there arise feelings of liking and disliking
You watch while these things stay for an instant disintegrate and disappear
You see sights as properties that move
The eye is a property that moves
Consciousness  the awareness of these things  is a property that moves
This applies to all the sense media they all lie under the characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself
Discernment is what stays still enough to see what moves and what doesn't
And then there's a lettinggo of both
That's when you see that ease on the conventional level from the point of view of the Dhamma is a falsehood  for there's an ease on the ultimate level that's true
The happiness to which every human being aspires is attained solely through the heart
Some of these forms of happiness though aren't clean or clear
The happiness that is clear and clean is the highest happiness in the Buddha's teachings in other words nibbana
Any form of happiness aside from this is neither clean nor clear
For the mind to attain happiness it has to depend on the Dhamma as its foundation
This is why the Buddha taught us to become acquainted with the Dhamma so that we can put it to use in developing the goodness that brings us the beneficial happiness we want
In what way is the practice of the Dhamma so important
It's important in that when a person practices the Dhamma it gives cool shelter to the person who practices it and to others at large
If the world lacked the Dhamma there's no way we could find happiness anywhere at all
This is why we have to seek out Dhamma for the heart because the current situation of the world is such that all kinds of events are sure to come seeping into the heart
Anything protected by the Dhamma contains the causes that will bring about happiness
Anything not protected by the Dhamma contains the causes for disturbance and unrest
We human beings are like trees
If a tree has an abundance of flowers and fruits thick branches and leaves and a firmly rooted trunk that doesn't fall down in the wind it gives pleasure to the birds who come and live in it to the travelers who pass by and rest in its shade
This is like a person who has the Dhamma as a firmly rooted foundation in the heart
Such a person gives shelter both to himself and to others as well
The Dhamma is like a rainy mist that keeps plants fresh and green
People protected by the Dhamma have a cool sense of ease within themselves and are able to spread and share it with others at large
Take the Buddha as an example When he was still a lay person he was the son of a powerful king with great wealth and a large following
His palace was enormous
He had everything he could wish for without the least thing lacking
But even then he saw that this sort of happiness was like a ripe banana on a tree there's no way it could escape from the beaks of the hawks and ravens who wanted to eat it
This is why he abandoned his great wealth and went forth in search of a happiness lasting and true  in other words the path to release from suffering
When he found it he kept exclaiming in his heart What bliss
What bliss Even though there were times when he had to encounter situations that were difficult to bear  for instance when there were hardships in gaining food or in the external conditions of his life  he never saw these things as troublesome in any way at all
He kept repeating to himself What bliss
What bliss to the point where he was rumored to be crazy
Still when he had found a happiness this true he naturally felt compassion for the stupidity of human beings and other living beings at large who still kept themselves sunk in suffering in such a pitiful way without knowing the means for gaining release from it
Feeling this compassion the Buddha thus wandered from city to city village to village to teach people the Dhamma and the way to practice by which they could release themselves from suffering and reach the same kind of happiness he had found himself
When people listened to the Buddha's Dhamma many of them gained conviction and confidence in what he taught
So they put it into practice to the point where they attained many of the highest levels of happiness
They then brought their children grandchildren and friends to hear the Buddha's Dhamma and so everincreasing numbers of people saw the results appearing in their hearts
This is how the Buddha's teachings spread far and wide in every direction
At present Buddhism seems to be most predominant in Thailand in that those who respect the Buddha's teachings are found in every level of society from the lowest to the highest
The study of the Dhamma is found on every level from the lowest to the highest
The same is true of the practice of the Dhamma it occurs on low levels intermediate levels up to the highest level
The lowest levels are those of us sitting here training ourselves in meditation
The intermediate levels start with the attainment of streamentry on up
On the highest level are the arahants
You have to be very observant to know this
There are lots of people on the low levels but only a few on the intermediate and highest levels
The really low levels are those who want to develop goodness but whose motivation is bad
In this way our practice depends on what we want to choose Do you want to eat leaves flowers or the actual fruit
If we want the kind of intelligence that can gather flowers and fruit to eat we have to use our discernment  the inner brightness called the eye of the mind or the inner eye
As for the outer eye that's the eye of flesh
For the brightness of the inner eye to arise and see the truth we need concentration
The outer eye keeps deceiving the mind all the time making us see things in this way or believe things in that
This is why the Buddha taught us to develop the inner eye so that our vision can penetrate far
There are actually two parts to each person
The outer part is the body the inner part is the heart and mind
The outer part is like a puppet or a mannequin built out of the elements of stress
No matter how much we fawn over it caring for it at great expense it won't stay with us
In the end it'll have to turn into ashes and sink into the ground
As for the mind which is the more lasting part we don't give it much care or attention at all
This is why the Buddha said that people are very deluded
We don't see our substantial part and instead see only the deceptive part
We're like a monkey who sees its reflection in a mirror and assumes that there's another monkey
So it sticks out its tongue and makes faces at its reflection trying to scare its reflection  and so scaring itself until it gets all worn out to no purpose at all
Our substantial part is the mind
Our fake part is the body
Even if we were to decorate the body with crowns and headdresses to make it look really fancy it wouldn't change its basic nature
Once it's born it ages then it starts to hurt and then it dies
No matter how much we study and gain degrees from universities all over the world we still can't divert the body from its basic nature
There's no way it can escape dying
This is why discerning people focus their attention on the substantial part of themselves in other words the part that's responsible for all things the mind
The body isn't responsible for good or evil at all
For example if we murder or steal the body doesn't go to hell
No matter how much good we do the body doesn't go along with us to heaven
The mind we can't see that's what goes
We can't see the process of its going but it's nevertheless capable of moving from place to place
The act of going to the good or bad destinations is entirely an affair of the heart and mind
This is why those who train their own hearts and minds are said truly to love themselves
Those who don't train their own hearts and minds are said to be in a place of darkness or unawareness
When the light of awareness or cognitive skill arises in the mind the mind will have the arms legs hands and eyes it needs to succeed in its aims
If it doesn't have this awareness it's in so much darkness that it can't see anything at all
It has to depend totally on the body
But when you practice so as to give rise to the eye of the mind you'll see that the body is one thing the mind another
They're not one and the same
At the moment our minds are still like children which is why we have to depend on the body to be our guardian
But once the mind is trained it will grow into an adult and be able to let go of the body
The nature of children is that they still have to depend on their guardians
But once a child is raised to adulthood it can go out on its own without the guardian
There's no need to carry the child around any more
If we don't know how to train the mind it'll simply stay at the childish level
The reason we all suffer so much in our lives is that our minds are still children
This is why the Buddha taught us to find the Dhamma as a refuge or shelter for the mind
At present our minds don't have a home to stay in
No matter where we sit or lie down the mind won't stay put
The only thing that does stay put is the body
And this is why the mind knows no happiness like a person who always has to keep wandering without rest tired and hot from the sun
The phrase home for the mind here means the foundation of concentration
Just as a person with lots of possessions but no safe place to keep them can find no rest in the same way people with no concentration  the foundation for the mind  can't find any peace no matter how many meritorious things they do
This is why we should train the mind to attain concentration
Training the mind is like eating a meal when you've finished eating you have to wash the dishes and put them away in an orderly fashion so that the next time you want to eat you'll have them right at hand
When we want to use the mind in any of our activities we have to keep washing it and putting it in order in just the same way
Tell yourself while you're sitting here that you're on your way to the shade of a Bodhi tree ie the refuge of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
When you develop your inner goodness in this way you can't entrust your mind to the world to any people or any material things at all
You're going to entrust it entirely to someone venerable
In other words you keep your mind flowing in the recollection of the Buddha without getting snagged on anything else
Use your alertness to survey your heart and take the body as your playground
Keep mindfulness always in charge of the mind thinking buddho with the in and outbreath
You know what the breath is like when it comes in you know what it's like when it goes out
This is called getting established in the recollection of the Buddha
That's the first step
The second step is to clean up the mind
You don't focus on anything involved with the Hindrances such as loving this person hating that person liking and disliking good and bad
You have to be intent on releasing the mind from these things
In this way the Dhamma will arise in the heart with a cool sense of relief
Then you can look at the cleanliness of the mind to see whether the way you live from day to day is clean or not
Being unclean means having a mind mixed up with defilements
As you sit here calming the mind don't go thinking about sights sounds smells etc in ways that lead to sensual desire ill will or thoughts of harmfulness
If greed arises try to wash it away
Don't let it arise again
If anger arises try to wash it away
Don't let it arise again
The same holds true with delusion
Try to chase out every form of evil
This is called mental purity
Once the mind comes to a stop that's when purity will arise  like a traveler who stops and rests under the shade of a tree
His weariness will disappear and he won't have any sweat
Passion aversion and delusion are like sweat that moistens and stains our mind
Whoever can stop sweating in this way  by entering the shade of the Bodhi tree through practicing recollection of the Buddha  will become clean like a person sitting under a tree
When the mind is established in good qualities it'll be sheltered and at ease
As the mind grows more and more clean it will become as clear and transparent as water giving rise to an inner brightness
Sometimes it's clean but not bright
In other words it keeps moving forward and back without staying in place
Once the mind is bright and clear though it'll give rise to awareness
Cakkhum udapadi ñanam udapadi pañña udapadi vijja udapadi Vision arises knowledge arises discernment arises awareness arises
You'll give rise to three eyes the eye of the past is recollection of past lives the eye of the future is knowledge of the death and rebirth of living beings and the eye of the present is knowledge of the ending of mental fermentations
You'll be able to let go of all things poisonous
You won't be stuck on the past present or future at all
This is why when you develop concentration you'll end up with three eyes
In other words your outer left eye will see good things your outer right eye will see bad things and they'll send them in to the inner eye which will remain at equilibrium
You'll also have three ears Your outer left ear will hear praise your outer right ear will hear criticism and they'll send them in to the inner ear which will stay at equilibrium
This is how you can receive all the guests the world sends your way
As for the eye of the mind  intuitive insight  it'll receive your defilements
Once it really understands them it'll be able to send them packing
That way you'll be able to live comfortably in the world with nothing to disturb your eyes ears nose tongue body or mind
You'll meet with nothing but brightness and purity
The mind that hasn't been trained is like a child
When it's trained it turns into an adult
As for the body which used to seem so large and mature you'll now see that it's really a child
It's inconstant stressful and notself
But the mind trained to the point of adulthood won't be troubled by these things
Even though the body is inconstant inconstancy won't appear in the mind
Even though the body is stressful stress won't appear in the mind
Even though the body is notself nothing troubling will appear in the mind
The mind will stay still and at equilibrium equanimous without latching onto any of these things at all
Once the mind is trained to a point of real strength it's able to let go of the body
For this reason when we develop our goodness by practicing the recollection of the Buddha as our constant preoccupation we'll reach the point where we can let go of all attachments
Our minds will enter the current of the Dhamma with true intuitive insight and we'll ultimately meet with the brightness coolness and ease I've described
When you're sitting in concentration don't think that you're sitting here in this meditation hall
Tell yourself that you're sitting alone in the deep deep forest
Cut away all your commitments and concerns
Don't think about the group or about anyone at all
Thoughts of what's good what's bad what you have or what you lack you don't have to think them
Think just about what's in your body and establish your mindfulness exclusively on the breath
Or you can tell yourself that you're sitting facetoface with the Buddha so that you have to keep careful watch over the manners of the mind
Don't let it fidget around picking its ears and nose or scratching itself here and there
Keep the body straight and the mind focused steadily on the Buddha ie exclusively on your meditation word buddho
Be mindful with each and every inandout breath
Don't go slipping off anywhere else
If you aren't genuinely intent on what you're doing you're deceiving your teacher deceiving the people around you and deceiving yourself as well
The deceit here is that you close your eyes and act like you're in concentration but the mind isn't still like the body
When this is the case you'll suffer
The results of not genuinely being intent are that things sometimes go well sometimes they don't sometimes you're aware sometimes you're not
In other words the good results you're looking for aren't constant
That's the first result
The second is absentmindedness
The mind thinks about other people other things and doesn't stay with the body doesn't stay with the present
You're like a person eating a meal
You intend for your hand to put rice in your mouth but you gaze around absentmindedly
You think you're eating a spoonful of soup but it turns out to be a spoonful of pepper sauce
You reach for a sweet but grab and bite into a clod of dirt or a piece of gravel instead
Or you can make a comparison with a blind person eating a meal
A person with good eyesight sends you your food telling you that This is rice
This is curry
This is a sweet but you don't take note of what she says and so you get them all mixed up
Then you go blaming her for your own absentmindedness
The third result of not genuinely being intent is forgetfulness
You lose track of your mindfulness lose track of the breath lose track of yourself
All three of these results are obstacles to the practice
They're signs of not being sincere in your duties
There are two kinds of knowing genuine knowing and deceptive knowing
Genuine knowing is what stays right here and now within you without going anywhere else
You know when you're standing you know when you're lying down speaking thinking etc
As for deceptive knowing that's the knowledge going after labels and perceptions
Labels are an act of knowing but they're not the knowing itself
They're like the shadow of knowing
Genuine knowing is being mindful of the present seeing causes and effects
This is discernment
For this reason we should each try to train ourselves to give rise to discernment the genuine knowing that won't deceive us into falling for a mass of suffering
We do this by training the mind to stay firmly in concentration by being mindful and circumspect in our breathing by being alert in our every movement by being genuinely intent in our duties and by showing respect for our teachers and for ourselves
These are the factors that will lead us to the happiness and wellbeing to which we aspire
The Dhamma is what gives peace shelter and happiness to the world
If the world were deprived of the Dhamma we couldn't find any peace here at all
If people individually or as a group have the Dhamma constantly in their hearts they're like fresh green grass growing in a springfed meadow or mountain valley constantly watered by the rain
If people lack the Dhamma  if they're evil or unskillful in their behavior  they're like grass in the dry season or in a desert lying dead on the ground
They have nothing to attract the hearts of other people to like them or respect them
Instead they'll simply get stepped all over and thrown away
They'll reap nothing but suffering and misfortune
People with the Dhamma in their hearts are like trees whose flowers are beautiful and fragrant
Everyone wants to be near them to associate with them
As for people who are shoddy in their behavior they're like the kind of tree whose flowers may be pretty but are surrounded by thorns or have no fragrance or are downright foul smelling
Other people are sure to detest them and won't want to come near
The Dhamma can also be compared to the flame of a lantern which by its nature is dazzling bright
Our mind is like the globe around the lantern
If the globe hasn't been washed and is covered with soot then no matter how bright the light of the flame may be it won't be able to radiate that brightness outside of the globe
In the same way if our mind is clouded and obscured with evil intentions then no matter how much good we try to do it won't be clean or pure because our hearts are still soiled with defilements in the same way that the soot soils the globe of the lantern
We've come to this place which is a peaceful place so we should try to be peaceful and pure in our behavior pure in our words and deeds and pure in our thoughts
When we're pure both inwardly and outwardly like this we fit in with the peacefulness of the place
Peace comes from causes and gives rise to results
If the causes aren't present the results won't come
The kind of happiness coming from a lack of peacefulness lasts only as long as a quick catch in your breath
But the happiness coming from peace lasts for a long long time
If where we live isn't peaceful it won't help us benefit from our activities
For instance if we want to read write or memorize a passage from a book we'll have a hard time
This is why peacefulness is something very important that we should all work together to foster
Our body is like a large water jar the mind like the water in the jar and our defilements like sediment in the water
If we take an alum crystal and swish it around in the water the bits of sediment will gather as a precipitate on the sides or bottom of the jar leaving the water clean and clear
The Dhamma is like an alum crystal that can make our minds clean and clear
When we listen to the Dhamma and take it home to ponder so as to benefit from it it will filter out all our unskillful tendencies which are defilements so that they separate out as a precipitate in the mind
When the Dhamma stays with the mind in this way then even when there are feelings of anger we won't get angry along with them
When there are feelings of hatred we won't get worked up along with them
When there are feelings of infatuation we won't get infatuated along with them
But even so these feelings are still lying in wait there in the mind which is why we have to develop higher forms of goodness so as to remove the precipitates completely from our water jar
The higher forms of goodness that we have to develop are the practices for giving rise to peace in the mind
When the heart is at peace it gives rise to an inner quality within itself in the same way that water allowed to sit still will become more clear
We people have three instigators within us our eyes our ears and our mouth
This is on the physical level
On the mental level the instigator within us is our heart
These are the things that create a lack of peace within us
So you have to be careful not to let poison into your system through any of these things
If you realize that you've ingested poison you have to spit it out right away
Otherwise it'll harm you
In other words your eyes ears and mouth are areas where you have to exercise a lot of restraint
Normally our eyes are always looking for trouble our ears are looking for trouble and our mouth has a habit of saying things that cause trouble
To speak in ways that won't cause trouble requires wisdom and discernment
When you have discernment then when you ingest good food you won't be harmed
Even if you ingest poison you won't die
The discernment I'm referring to here is knowledge of past lives knowledge of how people die and are reborn and the knowledge that puts an end to the fermentation of defilement in the heart
If you don't yet have these kinds of discernment you have to be extra careful in looking after yourself so that you can gain knowledge of what's skillful and what's not
In looking after yourself you have to watch out for evil so that it doesn't arise watch out for your goodness so that it doesn't fall away and put your goodness to use so that it gives rise to benefits
When you speak speak in a way that leads to peacefulness
If you speak in a way that gives rise to trouble it's as if you had eaten poison
And in this way you harm not only yourself but other people as well in the same way as when you sprinkle poison in an aquarium of fighting fish
One fish bites another so that the wound becomes poisoned and when all the fish have bitten one another they end up floating dead like a raft on the surface of the water
So when you realize that you still have greed anger and delusion in your mind you have to be extra careful in what you say
When you're mindful to speak only the things that should be said and hold back when you're about to say anything you shouldn't you'll be looking out for your goodness to make sure it doesn't fall away at the same time that you prevent evil from arising
In addition you have to watch out for your ears
Sometimes other people speak with good intentions but we hear them as bad
Sometimes we speak with good intentions but other people misunderstand
When this is the case it's no different from playing a flute in the ears of a water buffalo
It serves no purpose at all
When we live together in a group like this there are bound to be all kinds of sounds when we come into contact with one another
If you were to make a comparison we're no different from an orchestra which has to include the sound of the oboes the sound of the gong the sound of the xylophones high sounds low sounds treble and bass
If all the instruments had the same sound there would be no fun in listening to the orchestra for a onesound orchestra wouldn't be pleasing at all
In the same way when lots of people live together there are bound to be good sounds and bad arising in the group
So each of us has to look after his or her own heart
Don't let yourself feel anger or dislike for the bad sounds because when there's a lot of disliking it's bound to turn to anger
When there's a lot of anger it'll turn to ill will
When there's ill will it'll lead to quarrels and trouble
For this reason we should spread thoughts of good will to people above us below us and on the same level
When people below us show disagreeable attitudes in their words or actions we should forgive them
When we can do this we'll be contributing to the peace and calm of the group
Our human minds rarely have any time to rest and relax
We all have things we keep thinking about
You could say that ever since we've learned human language we've kept on thinking without any time to stop and rest
The mind keeps itself busy until it dies
If our bodies were this industrious we'd all be millionaires
But when the mind doesn't have any time to rest it's filled with the Hindrances
That's why it knows no peace
So we're taught to practice concentration letting go of thoughts about sensuality
In other words we close off our sense doors so that the mind isn't involved with anything external and we set our mind still and tall in the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
We don't let it fall down into any sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensations which are sensual objects
As for sensual defilements we don't let the mind fall into passion aversion or delusion
Sometimes our concentration practice goes as we want it to and we get pleased and oblivious
Sometimes it doesn't go as we'd like it to and we get irritated and annoyed
These are cases of passion and aversion
As for delusion sometimes when we sit we lose track of what we're doing or where we are
We get distracted or absentminded and don't know what's going on good or bad right or wrong
This causes the mind to become dark and obscure
Sometimes we drift off into thoughts of the past and think about people who have done us wrong so that we fall into ill will wanting to get revenge and to settle an old score
In this way we harm ourselves by spoiling our practice
All three of these defilements  passion aversion and delusion  are piles of dried timber just waiting to catch fire so we have to clear them completely out of the heart
Mindfulness and alertness are the quality of the Buddha
The cool sense of happiness they give is the quality of the Dhamma
If you can maintain that coolness until it hardens into a block of ice  in other words you make that goodness solid and strong in your heart  that's the quality of the Sangha
Once you've got a solid block of goodness like this you can pick it up and put it to any use you like
Whatever you say will give good results
Whatever you do will give good results
Your solid block of goodness will turn into a wishfulfilling gem bringing all sorts of happiness your way
When water is subjected to the heat of the sun or the heat of a fire to the point where it has evaporated away leaving just the dry kettle or pot can you say that that's the end of the water
Actually it still exists simply that the heat has turned it into a vapor that has dispersed into the air
So you can't say that the water no longer exists
It still exists somewhere else in another condition
The same holds true with the mind
When the body dies the mind doesn't die along with it
It simply moves to a new place in line with your good or bad kamma
The fact that it still exists in another condition that's what we mean when we say that it doesn't die
Still when it's subjected to a lot of fire it degenerates
Just like the body when the body is subjected to the fires of aging illness and death it degenerates
When the mind is subjected to the fires of defilement  passion aversion and delusion  it degenerates
The more these three masses of flame burn away at the mind the more it degenerates in terms of its goodness
It's because we have fire burning the body and the mind from both sides that they end up having to fall apart and going their separate directions
This we call the process of birth and death
So if you want happiness you have to train the heart to get rid of its defilements
Only then will you be done with birth and death
But if you were to ask where that place of no birth and no death is located it would be hard to point out
Just like pointing at an albino elephant or water buffalo to get a blind person to look at it it would be a waste of effort
In the same way describing the place of no birth and no death so that an ignorant person would understand it is a waste of time
Only when you develop discernment will you understand where people go after they die and whether or not there's really a place of no birth and no death
This is because a person of discernment has an inner eye  the ñanacakkhu or eye of knowledge
What this means is that he or she has seen the true Dhamma
That's what gives such a person the ability to understand this issue
The Buddha said Whoever sees the Dhamma sees me In other words when we see the Dhamma that doesn't die we'll be able to see those who don't die what it is that doesn't die
So when we reach the Dhamma that doesn't die we meet with the place that doesn't die
As long as we haven't met with that place we have to keep practicing so as to give rise to the eye of the mind
The problem is that even though most of us have clear eyesight our minds are still dark and blurry
The Dhamma of the Buddha that we're taught every day is like a lens for casting some light into the eye of the mind so that we can feel our way along without falling into pits or wells
Even then though our minds are still blurry
This is why we have so many differing opinions our eyes are still blurry  but at least we're not blind
We can still see vague shapes and shadows
There's a saying samanañca dassanam etammangalamuttamam
Seeing a contemplative is the highest blessing What this means is that whoever sees a noble one  a streamenterer a oncereturner a nonreturner or an arahant  sees a grand auspicious sight
But you really have to see a genuine noble one for this to be true
So where are you going to look for a noble one
What sorts of features help you recognize a noble one
If you look at a noble one from the outside there's no way you can know for sure
The only way to know for sure is to practice the Dhamma so as to give rise to the qualities of a noble one within yourself
As long as you don't have those qualities within you you can't see a genuine noble one
Your eyes are still blurry so everything you see is blurry
Your mind is an ordinary mind so everywhere you look all you can see are ordinary people
To help us see the truth in this way the Buddha teaches three guidelines for practice
With regard to the first guideline  having a sense of moderation in consuming food  there are two kinds of consumption consuming food for the body and consuming food for the mind
Two sorts of food for the body should be avoided anything that's been obtained through bad kamma and anything that doesn't really nourish the body
When you avoid these two sorts of food that's called having a sense of moderation in consuming food
As for food for the mind there are three kinds
A person without a sense of moderation in food is like an ill person who doesn't know what foods will aggravate his illness
He's bound to have a short life and an early death
Not only that he also creates burdens for the people around him his parents spouse children and relatives
They're put to all sorts of trouble
When he dies they have to find the money to pay for the funeral and make merit to dedicate to him
Before he dies they have to pay for medical care
The doctors and nurses have to look after him until way late into the night giving him medicine cleaning up his urine and feces all kinds of things
But if you gain a sense of how to look after yourself and are careful about how you consume your food you'll have few diseases
You yourself will be at ease and the people around you won't be burdened
The five Hindrances are like germs
If they get established in your heart they'll multiply and spread and eat away at your heart continually to the point where you mind falls to such a low level that you can't lift it up again
The food of consciousness means the consciousness at the six sense doors that arises when sights strike the eyes sounds strike the ears and so forth
Pleasing sights are like sugar molasses or honey which are sure to be teeming with ants gnats and flies
Disagreeable sights are like filth In addition to carrying germs they're sure to attract all sorts of other bad things too because they're crawling with flies and worms
If we don't notice the ants flies and filth we'll go ahead and eat the food  and it will be toxic to our health
Like a person without any teeth who finds chicken bones in his food he can't chew them so he tries to swallow them whole and ends up with his eyes bulging out of their sockets
If you aren't discerning you'll gobble down the filth together with the worms and smelly parts and the sugar together with the ants and flies
So you have to pay careful attention
Before you eat look to see what you can handle and what you can't what you have to be wary of and what you don't
This is called having a knife and a chopping board for your food
When you examine things for yourself in this way you'll get to eat food that's well prepared and cooked  not like a monster that eats things raw
If you don't examine things you'll misunderstand what's happening thinking that good things are bad and bad things are good
The mind won't be clear about these things because you lack mindfulness and discernment
You'll swallow toxic food right into your heart
This is called being very greedy very deluded because you're careless in your eating and this creates hazards for your heart
The same holds true with the food of earconsciousness
The sounds you like are like sugar or delicious sweets
The sounds you don't like are food that's rotten and spoiled
If you don't use discernment don't use restraint and don't pay proper attention you'll end up eating food that's all rotten and wormy
Whatever's sweet you'll swallow down whole and all the ants worms and flies will go down with it
This will cause pain and trouble for your intestines and turmoil for your heart
Your heart is already in poor health and yet you go gobbling down things that are toxic
When this happens no one can cure you but you yourself
The same thing applies in the area of the nose tongue body and mind
Whatever food you plan to swallow you first have to pay careful attention as monks do when they chant the passage for reflection before using any of the four requisites
At the same time we have to reflect on whether the person bringing us these things suffers from wrong views and practices wrong livelihood as well
Otherwise our own virtues will be compromised
So we have to be firmly intent using mindfulness to gain evidence and our discernment to pass judgment
That way we'll get to eat food that's just and fair
Anyone who doesn't use mindfulness and discernment is like an ogre that eats dead things rotten things and raw
Bones wings skins and feathers everything you swallow right down like a savage who doesn't know any better
Scientists nowadays are smart
They can take things you normally couldn't eat and then distil and process them so that you can eat them and they're good for you too
People without discernment who allow themselves to get overcome with greed and hunger will eat everything wings tails bones fins
The things they like get stuck in their hearts
The things they don't like get stuck in their hearts
Wherever they go it's as if they have bones stuck in their throats
But if we have virtue concentration and discernment in our consumption of the food of consciousness it's as if we have a fire a stove and a knife to prepare our food the right way
The next kind of food is the food of mental intentions
If we set our hearts on the wrong things it can be toxic to us
If you sit here thinking about someone you hate or who makes you angry telling yourself that if you meet that person you'll have to say this or that this is called setting your heart on the wrong object
If you set your heart on the right things it will flow in the right direction
Forgetfulness and delusion won't be able to arise
For instance you can think about the virtues or the generosity you've practiced or about your teachers
This is called setting your heart on the right object
The heart will begin to blossom
Just like the people in the time of the Buddha when their hearts were inclined toward recollection of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha they entered the refuge of the noble attainments
For this reason we should incline our hearts toward the people or things that will cause our hearts to flourish and grow
This is what will give them the strength they need to gain release from the Hindrances which are like curtains of fog or like worms that swarm over and eat away at the heart
This is what will give us the strength to shoot our way up to the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana
In this way we'll be good cooks for ourselves
But if we don't know how to chop boil or fry our own food we'll have to eat it raw just like a monster
The third mouthful of food is the food of contact
Whatever sights come in by way of the eyes whatever sounds come in by way of the ears whatever smells comes in by way of the nose and so forth you have to be careful
Pay attention at all times to whatever will be of use and avoid anything poisonous
Whatever will be meritorious or skillful even if it may be painful you have to endure and stick with it as when you have to endure heat cold or rain in the practice
As for anything that will be unskillful you have to shake it right off
The same applies to the ideas that make contact in the mind
When you can act in this way good food will keep flowing in to benefit your eyes ears nose tongue and body and will seep in to bathe your heart
You'll be secluded from evil secluded from defilements
Adhicitte ca ayogo You'll be committed to the heightened mind
Mind states heading to the level of the lower realms will disappear and those of the noble ones will arise in their place
The mind will be in a firm steady state heading straight for nibbana
That's how it gets beyond the reach of the fires that consume the cosmos
This is a work in progress
Eventually I hope to make available in English a much larger collection of Ajaan Lee's talks to add to the collections already available Lessons in Samadhi Food for Thought Inner Strength and The Skill of Release
But for the moment in keeping with the title of the collection I'd like to start out small
The passages translated here had their beginnings in talks that Ajaan Lee gave to groups of people while they were meditating
In some cases the people were his followers in others total strangers
In every case Ajaan Lee found it necessary to cover the sorts of questions that occur to people new to meditation  Why meditate
How should I meditate
And why in that particular way
 and in his own style he provided not only straightforward answers to these questions but also vivid analogies to help his listeners relate their meditation to familiar activities so that they would feel less intimidated by the uncharted areas of the minds they were trying to tame
One aspect of Ajaan Lee's teachings that might strike you as foreign is his analysis of the body into four properties earth fire water and wind
This mode of analysis dates back to the time of the Buddha although Ajaan Lee develops it in a distinctive way
Think of this analysis not as an attempt at biology or chemistry  the sciences we use to analyze the body from the outside  but as a way of analyzing how the body feels from the inside
This is an aspect of awareness that we often overlook and that in English at least we have a poor vocabulary for describing
As you gain through meditation a greater familiarity with this aspect of your awareness you'll come to see how useful Ajaan Lee's method of analysis is
The passages included here have taken a fairly circuitous route from Ajaan Lee's mouth to your eyes
One of his followers  a nun Mae Chii Arun Abhivanna  took notes during the talks from which she later worked up reconstructed versions of what Ajaan Lee had said
Ajaan Lee had a chance to review and revise the reconstructions of the talks dated prior to
As for the talks made after that year Mae Chii Arun didn't get around to making reconstructions until after Ajaan Lee's death in and so these were printed without his input
Although the talks make for great reading they make for even better listening
If you meditate with a group of friends try arranging for one member of the group to read a passage while the others are meditating
In that way you can best recreate the context for which the talks were originally intended
For people to be happy or sad good or bad all depends on the heart
The heart is what's in charge the most important thing to be found in our body
That's because it's lasting and responsible for all the good and evil we do
As for the body it knows nothing of pleasure or pain happiness or sadness and it's not at all responsible for anyone's good or evil actions
Why is that
Because the body isn't lasting
It's empty
To say that it's empty means that as soon as it's deprived of breath its four properties of earth water wind and fire separate from one another and return to their original nature
The parts coming from the earth property return to be earth as they originally were
The parts coming from the water property return to be water as they originally were
The parts coming from the wind and fire properties return to be wind and fire as they originally were
There's nothing about them that's woman or man good or bad This is why we're taught rupam aniccam physical form is inconstant
Rupam dukkham it's hard to bear
Rupam anatta it's notself empty and doesn't stay under anyone's control
Even if we try to forbid it from growing old growing sick and dying it won't behave in line with our wishes
It has to fall in line with the processes of arising and wasting away in accordance with the nature of natural fabrications
This applies to everyone
But you can't say that the body is entirely anatta for some parts of it are atta
In other words they lie somewhat under our control
For instance if you want the body to walk it'll walk
If you want it to lie down it'll lie down
If you want it to eat it'll eat
If you want it to take a bath it'll take a bath
This shows that it lies somewhat under your control
So the body is both anatta and atta
But even so both aspects are equal in the sense that they're empty and not responsible for the good or evil things we do
No matter how much good or evil you do the body doesn't have any part in the rewards
When it dies it gets cremated and turns into ashes either way
It's not responsible for anyone's happiness or sadness at all
When people do good or evil the results of their good and evil all fall to their own minds
The mind is what's responsible for all our actions and it's the one that experiences the results of its actions as well
This is why the Buddha taught us to cleanse our hearts and minds to make them pure as a way of leading us to future happiness
What do we use to cleanse the heart and mind
We cleanse the heart and mind with skillfulness  in other words by developing skillful qualities within it through practicing concentration
We cut away all the thoughts of greed anger and delusion within the mind such as the Hindrances of sensual desire ill will torpor  lethargy restlessness  anxiety and doubt
All of these qualities are things that soil the mind
When the mind is soiled in this way it's bound to suffer
It's headed for darkness because of its own actions
Our unskillful actions can be divided into the different ways they're dark
Some are dark like the darkness of night ie totally devoid of any brightness
Some are dark like clouds ie they alternate between being dark and bright just as when the moon is bright at some times and covered by clouds at others
Some of our unskillfulness is dark like haze obscuring all our vision whether by day or by night
This third kind of unskillfulness is ignorance or avijja
It obscures the mind at all times so that we can't recognize which of the mind's objects are past which are future and which are present
This is why the mind concerns itself with past present and future so that it can't stay firmly in any one place
It has no certainty about anything
This is ignorance
From ignorance comes craving the cause of all stress and suffering
To get rid of this haze we have to meditate getting rid of thoughts and concepts of past and future by seeing them as inconstant stressful and notself seeing all the aggregates of form feeling perception thoughtfabrication and consciousness as inconstant stressful and notself to the point where there is no past no future no present
That's when the mind is released from the clouds and haze of its Hindrances and enters into brightness
There are two kinds of people in the world
Some are like those with good eyes
They're the ones who develop skillful qualities within themselves and so they see the brightness of the world both by day and by night
Then there are those who don't develop skillful mental qualities
They're like people born blind even though the light of the sun and moon may be shining these people are in the darkness  in this case the darkness of their own minds
This is why the Buddha taught us to remove the darkness from our minds to remove our minds from darkness as in the Pali verse
which means Having abandoned dark qualities the wise person develops the bright When people develop brightness within themselves they can use that brightness to illuminate all their activities
This will bring them success in all they do
But if they're in the dark it's as if they were blind so that the things they do won't succeed in full measure
For example they may listen to the Dhamma but if their minds are still wandering out all over the place it's as if they were obscured by the clouds and haze of their Hindrances
This is why we're taught to practice tranquillity meditation fixing the mind on a single preoccupation
Tell yourself that the qualities of the Buddha aren't separate from the qualities of the Dhamma which aren't separate from the qualities of the Sangha
They're actually one and the same as the Pali verse tells us
Although the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha may be different as objects seemingly separate from one another they are actually one in meaning
Thus when we make the mind firm in its awakened awareness it contains the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha all in one
That's when our concentration will develop in the proper way
So I ask that you abandon unskillful mental qualities and cleanse the mind so that it's clean and pure
Brightness will then arise within your heart
This way you'll experience ease and happiness without a doubt as the Pali passage guarantees Citte sankilitthe duggati patikankha
Citte asankilitthe sugati patikankha
When the mind is defiled a bad destination can be expected
When the mind is undefiled a happy destination can be expected
Our discernment is like light and there are three levels to it lowlevel discernment which is like the light of a torch intermediate discernment which is like the light of a candle or a kerosene lantern and highlevel discernment which is like electric light
To get light from a torch you need to use a lot of fuel
And even though it's bright it creates smoke
This is like the discernment that comes from being generous it requires a lot of financial resources and you sometimes have to contend with resistance from people outside
The light of a candle or gas lantern is like the discernment that comes from observing the precepts
You have to exercise a lot of care and use your powers of endurance to keep them pure
Lanternlight requires fuel and a wick
As for candlelight it requires a wick and some wax
If you have wax but no wick you can't get any light
And both lanternlight and candlelight create smoke and soot so neither of them counts as being entirely good
As for electric discernment there's no need for fuel and it doesn't create smoke or soot
It's easy to use whenever you want it by day or by night just flip on the switch
This refers to the discernment that comes from developing concentration
The power of the mind when it's pure and firmly established gives rise to the light of knowledge  liberating insight  enabling us to see events clearly both in the area of the world and of the Dhamma
When we can make the mind clean and pure it gives rise to concentration and to the light of discernment  paññapajjoto  which is like electric light or the light of the sun which shines all twelve hours of the day
This kind of discernment is the discernment of the noble ones
All three forms of merit  generosity virtue and meditation  depend on discernment
When we develop discernment we'll know how to look for merit on our own
And what kind of light will we want  torch light candlelight lanternlight or electric light
Death is like darkness
When the time comes to die outside light won't be of any use to us
Our speech hands feet arms and legs won't be of any use to us
They won't be able to help us at all
Our eyes won't be able to see any light
No one will hear what we have to say
Our hands and feet won't be able to move
Our possessions won't be able to help us
The only resource that will be able to help us is our discernment making sure that greed aversion and delusion don't get provoked maintaining the mind in a state free from greed free from aversion free from delusion
We'll be able to separate these three things  body mind and defilement  out from one another in the same way that we separate the wick of a candle from its wax
The fire of defilement will then have to go out because the wick and the wax lie in separate places and don't make contact
In the same way if we can separate the body from the mind our normal awareness will have to go out
But when it goes out that doesn't mean that awareness is annihilated
It's still there but as a special form of awareness that doesn't depend on the body or mind and yet can still be aware
It's just like fire going out from a candle it's not annihilated
There's still plenty of fire potential left in the world
It's there by its nature simply that it isn't involved with any fuel
This kind of fire is better than the kind that requires fuel because it doesn't wear anything out
It's simply there by its nature
This kind of merit is more wonderful than anything else
If we can separate the body the mind and defilement from one another there'll be no more heat
The mind won't be hot and instead will be cool at all times
The light of fire arises from the spinning of waves
If there are no waves there'll be no spinning
The waves are like defilement
If we can cut through the waves the spinning will stop
There will be no more birth
Greed aversion and delusion are like waves  or like the wick of a candle
If we cut out the wick leaving only the wax fire will have no place to catch hold and so will have to go out
When the candle goes out it's like the death of human beings the fire leaves the candle but the fire potential isn't annihilated
In the same way the mind that goes out from the body isn't annihilated
If it can remain on its own without having to depend on a body it doesn't appear in any way shape or form anywhere at all
That's the awareness of nibbana
This is the kind of awareness that's really like electric light
Whenever we want it it's there for us to know
Sometimes even if we don't want to know we still end up knowing
As for ordinary people even if they want to know things they often don't know they often don't see even when they want to see
That's like torch light or candlelight if there's no fuel there's no way it can be bright
This is why we're taught to train our minds to be firmly established in concentration  for the mind welltrained is what gives rise to the light of discernment that doesn't get deluded the discernment that knows for sure
Clinging is the cause of all suffering and stress
It's what gives rise to states of becoming and birth
It's not at all safe
Whatever appears and takes shape is bound to create suffering
Just as when a person's money appears in a way that other people can see there are bound to be thieves who will steal it away
When you have money you're afraid if people see it
You're afraid even if they don't
In the same way when people cling to the five aggregates as their self in this world they suffer
When they die and go to the next world they suffer still
The clinging we feel has three kinds or three time frames past present and future
In each time frame there are five aggregates which means that each of us has aggregates
And when we have so many aggregates to carry around it's no wonder we suffer
When we look ahead we start wondering If I live until or what's it going to be like
If I fall into poverty what will I do When we think like this we start worrying in all kinds of ways
If we think about good things we get enthralled
If we think about bad things we get disheartened
Some people think about bad things so much that they get really discouraged and despondent
That's because they cling to their thoughts and preoccupations
This is called having five heavy stones placed in front of us
Then we turn around and look behind us When we die what will happen to our children and grandchildren We might think of giving them part of the family fortune so that they'll be able to set themselves up in life
But then we think of how foolish they can be
If they take our family fortune and gamble it all away what will we do When we think like this it makes us discouraged
Other times we think of our own good qualities our children's good qualities in the present and it makes us happy
That's another five heavy stones
So altogether we have five stones in front of us five stones behind us and five stones in the present
Our right hand clings to physical phenomena our left hand to mental phenomena
We hold on to form feeling perception thoughtconstructs and consciousness as our self
So we carry a burden in our right hand a burden in our left hand and more burdens placed on a pole over our shoulder
If we keep carrying these things around without ever putting them down we'll meet with nothing but suffering
Then we grab onto the suffering so that we suffer even more to the point where our faces are all contorted and our shoulders twisted out of shape
This is why the Buddha had such compassion for us and taught us to cago patinissago to relinquish and let go
Whoever doesn't put down the pole on his or her shoulder will never get away
If we can first let go of our thoughts of past and future things will be somewhat lighter
If we're only carrying things in our hands there's some hope that we'll be able to keep going
In other words if we don't practice concentration keeping our minds still and away from the Hindrances we're still carrying a pole over our shoulders with burdens in front of us and behind us all because we can't let go of our thoughts of past and future
Thoughts of past and future are things we don't need to think about
Whether they're our own affairs the affairs of our children or grandchildren or our business or financial affairs when we've come to meditate like this there's no need to think about anything at all
Be intent on sitting still
Keep your body straight focus on watching only the present  the breath  and light will appear
Even though your right and left hands are still holding onto physical and mental phenomena at least you've put down both burdens that were on your shoulders
As for the physical phenomena that are still heavy that's because the King of Death keeps sprinkling poison on them
For example our eyes At first they are clear
Everything we see is sharp and bright
But then the King of Death sprinkles his poison in them making them murky and dark or giving us cataracts
So we have to go running to have our eyes examined to get glasses for them to put medicine in them to go in for surgery
They make us suffer in every way so that our tiny little eyes start weighing as much as a fist in the face
As for our ears at first they can hear all kinds of sounds
Then the King of Death comes and sprinkles his poison in them so that they start ringing or going deaf
We can hardly hear what other people are saying we can't understand what they're getting at and this makes us irritable
They say bad things and to us they sound good
Or they say good things and to us they sound bad
We get things right and wrong and this gives rise to quarrels and disagreements
The same with our nose
At first it's in good shape but then the King of Death sprinkles poison in it so that tumors and growths develop
We have to go looking for medicinal snuff and inhalers or for doctors to zap the growths with electricity
Our nose starts smelling bad and disfigures our face
As for the tongue body and mind they pile us high with pain in just the same way
This is why we're taught rupam aniccam all physical forms are unstable and inconstant
If we get stuck on thinking about these things it sets us on fire
Our skin and flesh grow flabby and wrinkled our backs get bent and as we grow older like this it's a burden both to our own hearts and to the hearts of our children and grandchildren
In addition it's a burden in terms of the money we need to spend to look after ourselves
Whoever holds onto unstable things as being his or her self will have to walk in an unstable way
Most of us tend to cling to the body and other physical things as being ours
Sometimes we cling to mental phenomena  feelings perceptions thoughtconstructs and consciousness  as being ours
This is called carrying things in both hands
Still it's better than carrying loads on a pole over our shoulder for as long as our burdens are only in our hands we're able to sit or lie down
But if we have burdens on a pole over our shoulder we can't sit down
We have to keep standing
For this reason we should train our hearts to be peaceful and still  in other words to develop concentration
When the heart's tranquil and still discernment will arise
When discernment arises we'll understand our own birth When we were born we didn't bring along even a single tooth or piece of cloth
However we came is how we'll have to return
We won't be able to take a single thing along with us aside from the good and evil that will take us to be reborn in good or bad destinations or that will send us to nibbana
People who can meditate in this way will become light and unburdened for they'll be able to let go of what they're carrying in their hands
In that way they'll be happy for they've received three jewels to adorn themselves
When they get to the other side they'll be able to sell them for a good price
As long as they stay here they'll have good things to dress up with
Whoever has the intelligence to practice letting go in this way will receive wealth that's of value everywhere  like gold No matter what country you go to gold is recognized as having value
It's not like paper money which is recognized only in your own country
For this reason when we can train the mind to let go  so that it's released from holding on to the future the past and the present  it's as if we've received an entire ingot of pure gold
We'll be happy at all times
But if we're stupid enough to hold onto things as our own we'll set the mind on fire so that it won't know any peace
This is why the Buddha has warned us Whoever clings to physical or mental phenomena or to mental labels and thoughts will have to be so burdened that they won't be able to get anywhere
Ultimately they'll have to die stuck in the world like the monkey who stole melons from the old couple's field and ended up getting stuck in a tar trap and dying on the spot
It's a story they tell as an analogy of how painful and difficult clinging can be
The story goes like this Once an old couple lived at the edge of the forest near the foot of a mountain
It so happened that their rice fields were flooded and they couldn't grow any rice so they cleared fields on the mountainside and planted them with corn beans watermelons and cantaloupes to have enough food to make it through the year
At night though porcupines and other animals kept coming to eat their crops while during the day birds and monkeys would come and harass them
So eventually the old couple decided that they'd have to sleep out in the fields to keep watch over them and set out traps to protect them
The old man would keep watch at night while the old woman would keep watch by day
One day a troop of monkeys came and invaded the field
No matter how much the old woman tried to chase them away they wouldn't leave her alone
They'd jump from that tree to this teasing and pestering her to the point where she had no time for her midday rest
So she came up with an idea
She went into the forest and found some tree sap that she boiled until it was a nice sticky tar
Then she took the tar and spread it all over any trees or stumps that the monkeys liked to use as their perches
The next day a huge troop of monkeys came stealing watermelons and cantaloupes and eating their fill
Now one of the monkeys a female had two babies
One of her babies was sick so she left it home with her husband for him to look after while she came along with the troop with the other baby hanging down in front of her chest
While eating the melons she thought of her sick baby so she decided to take some back for the baby and her husband
When she had eaten her fill she stuffed two tiny melons into her cheeks for her baby and grabbed a largish melon that she hugged to her chest for her husband
As for the baby hanging in front of her she had it hang onto her back
Just as she was all set to go the old woman  carrying a shovel  happened to come across the monkeys and gave chase
Startled the monkeys all ran off  except for the mother monkey who could do nothing but jump back and forth because she was so weighed down weighed down in front weighed down in back weighed down in her mouth
She tried calling for help but no sound came out
She happened to jump up onto a stump that the old woman had smeared with a thick soft glob of tar
The old woman came straight at her with the shovel so the monkey decided to jump away but she couldn't budge
Her tail was curled up and stuck in the tar
She tried to pry her tail loose with one of her paws but the paw got stuck
She used her other paw to pry off the tar but that one got stuck too
Seeing that the tar on her paw was black and sticky she sniffed it only to get her paw stuck to her nose
With one of her back feet she tried to push herself off the stump but the foot got stuck
Then she used the other foot to wipe the first one off but her two feet got stuck together as if they were tied up with a rope
She couldn't move
All she could do was look around grimacing just like a monkey
After a moment's thought she bent down and bit the tar in furious anger
She wanted to bite the old woman but all she could do was bend down and bite tar
As for the old woman when she saw the monkey all stuck in the tar like this she called the old man to come and see
Then the two of them found a red ants' nest and broke it over the monkey
Then they set fire to her hair tormenting her there on the stump
Finally one of them took a hoe handle while the other took a shovel handle and the two of them beat the monkeys  mother and baby  to a miserable death
This is the result of clinging and attachment clinging to the future clinging to the past clinging to the present the baby on her back and the melon she was holding to her chest
That's why she had to suffer so much
For this reason the Buddha taught us to let go of labels and thoughts of past and future and all five aggregates in the present
Physical phenomena are like the melon the monkey held to her chest mental phenomena like the baby hanging from her back
We can't get away because of our heavy burdens
Whoever clings is said to be heavily burdened
As long as we're alive we have trouble finding true goodness
When we die we have heavy burdens lying in our way
This is why the Buddha teaches us to let go
Don't grasp onto thoughts of past future or present
Make the mind like water on a lotus leaf which doesn't seep in
It reaches a quality that doesn't die doesn't come back to be born in this world or any other
Free from suffering and stress it reaches the highest most excellent ease
So we should all try our best to lighten our burdens
Letting go
One of the important reasons why the Buddha taught the Dhamma was to teach us to let go not to hold on to things
The more we really know the Dhamma the more we can let go
Those who know a little can let go of a little those who know a lot can let go of a lot
As a first step we're taught dana  to be generous to give donations  as a strategy for getting us to learn how to let go
The next step is caga  renouncing rights of possession  which is letting go at a higher level than dana
And finally on a more refined level we're taught to relinquish all our upadhi or the acquisitiondefilements in the mind
This is the level on which we examine and explore until we can gain total release
Dana means giving away material things
If we don't give them away they're hard to let go
For the most part if we don't give things away we hold rights over them and regard them as belonging to us
But if we give them away we no longer have any rights over them
Things we hold onto are dangerous
They can cause us harm
They cause harm to people who steal them from us
And once those people have stolen them then they claim rights over them
The Buddha saw these dangers which is why he taught us to be generous to learn how to give things away
People who develop the habit of being generous reap many rewards
Their act of generosity comes back to them both in the present and on into the future
They have lots of friends
Other people trust them
Their hearts are light  they aren't weighed down with worries about looking after the things they've given away
And these same results will keep coming in the future just as when we have a bucket of rice grains if we plant them in a field we'll reap ten buckets of rice in return
The same holds true with the goodness we develop in this lifetime
It gives enormous returns
That's how people of discernment understand it
Caga is the next step
Dana is something that even crazy people can do but caga is a type of giving that only wise people can do because their sense of personal possession has to end immediately in the act of giving
They see that all material things are common property things don't really belong to us they don't really belong to other people
If you see things as belonging to you that's addiction to sensuality
If you see things as belonging to others that's addiction to selfaffliction
When we're born we didn't bring anything along with us when we came
When we die we won't take anything along when we go
So what really belongs to us
Our sense of possession has to fall away from the heart if our giving is to count as caga
The third level of letting go is relinquishing what's in the heart
Whether or not we give things away we let go of them in the heart every day
We let go of the things we have
We let go of the things we don't have
Just as a person has to wash his mouth and hands every day after he eats if he wants to stay clean at all times
What this means is that we're not willing to let anything act as an enemy to the heart by making us stingy or grasping
If we don't do this we're the type of person who doesn't wash up after a meal
We're not clean
We stay asleep without ever waking up
But when we let go in this way it's called viragadhamma or dispassion
The lower levels of letting go are things we can do only from time to time
Dispassion is something we can develop always
Ordinarily our defilements tie us down hand and foot and then nail us to the floor
It's hard to get free which is why we need a high level of skill called bhavanamayapañña  the discernment that comes from developing the mind in meditation  to gain release
Dispassion is a mental quality that's really delicious and nourishing
Whoever hasn't reached this level of the Dhamma has eaten only the rind of the fruit without knowing the taste and nourishment of the flesh
The good part of the flesh lies deep
The upadhikilesas or acquisitiondefilements in the mind are ignorance craving and clinging
If we reach the level where we see the Dhamma for ourselves within us then we take responsibility for ourselves
We can take care of these things on our own just as when we come of age in terms of the law
If we can get our minds into the first jhana we can let go of the five hindrances
Most of us are like inexperienced children when we eat fish or chicken we eat the bones along with the flesh because we haven't developed any intuitive insight
When this insight arises it's more dazzling than the light of a fire sharper than a spear
It can consume anything meat bones rice husks  anything  because it's smart enough to pound everything into a powder
It can consume sights sounds smells flavors tactile sensations and ideas
Good or bad it isn't picky
It can eat them all
If people praise us we can use it to nourish the heart
If they criticize us we can use it to nourish the heart
Even if the body is in terrible pain the heart can be at its ease for it has all the utensils it needs to fix its food properly grinders mixers steamers pots and pans
The fog of ignorance will scatter
Everything that ties us down  the nails of the five clingingaggregates the three ropes and the eight chains of the affairs of the world  gain loss status loss of status praise criticism pleasure and pain  will all fall away
Stupid people think that staying in jail is comfortable which is why they keep on doing more and more evil
They see the world as pleasant and so they're like prisoners who don't want to get out of jail
As for people with discernment they're like the caged quail who keeps looking for a way to get out of the cage
As a result the chains that hold them down will fall away one link at a time
The eight affairs of the world are like the chains put on criminals to keep them bound
Stupid people think these chains are necklaces of gold to wear as ornaments
Actually they're things that defile the mind
People who get tied down by them will never get away because they're afraid they'll lose their wealth and status afraid of criticism and pain
Anyone who is stuck on pleasure who is afraid of criticism will never manage to come to the monastery to practice
The Buddha saw that we're like monkeys tied to a chain
If we don't develop liberating insight we'll never get free from our chains
We'll never make it to dispassion
In the first stage we let go of evil and start doing good
In the second stage we let go of evil and some forms of good
In the third stage we let go of everything good and evil because everything is fabricated by nature and thus undependable
We do good but we're not attached to it
When you let go you have do it intelligently and not in a ruinous way  ie by not doing good
You can't hold on even to your opinions much less to material things
When you do good you do it for the sake of the living beings of the world for your children and grandchildren
You do everything in the best way possible but you're not attached to it because you know that all things fabricated are inconstant
This way your heart can be clear and bright like a jewel
If you get caught up on criticism or praise you're foolish
It's like drinking other people's saliva
When you act rightly there are people who will say that you're right and those who will say that you're wrong
When you act wrong there are people who will say you're wrong and those who will say you're right
There's nothing constant about good or bad for they're all nothing but fabrications
In brief there are three principles that are really basic to meditation
The right intention You have to make up your mind that you're going to let go of all thoughts and preoccupations dealing with the world
You aren't going to keep them to think about
Every thought and concept dealing with the past or future is an affair of the world and not of the Dhamma
Make up your mind that you're going to do one thing right now the work of the religion and nothing else
In other words you're going to work on the immediate present
This is called the right intention
The right object This means the right theme or focal point for the mind
The theme here is dhatuvavatthana or resolution into the properties one of the themes in taking the body as a frame of reference
In short we're going to look at the four properties that make up the body the properties of earth water wind and fire
The earth property covers the hard parts of the body such as the bones
The water property covers the liquid parts such as urine saliva blood and pus
The fire property covers the heat and warmth in the body
The wind property covers the feelings of energy that flow in the body such as the breath
Of all these properties the most important one is the wind property or the breath
If other parts of the body get damaged  say if our eyes go blind our ears go deaf our arms and legs get broken  it can still survive
But if it doesn't have any breath it can't last
It'll have to die
So the breath is an important object because it forms a basis for our awareness
The right quality This means the feelings of comfort or discomfort that arise in the body
When you take care of the inandout breath so that it flows freely through the various parts of the body it'll give rise to results
Take good note of whether the results that the body and mind reap from the breath are good or bad
Does the body feel open and at ease or does it feel tight and constricted
Does the mind feel calm quiet and pleasant or is it irritable distracted and chaotic
If the body and mind feel at ease that counts as good results
If the opposite is true then that counts as bad results
So you have to gain a sense of how to adjust the breath so that it becomes comfortable
As for the right qualities of the mind those are mindfulness and alertness
Try to keep following these three basic principles every time you practice concentration
Only then will you get results that are full and correct
As for the rewards of concentration there are lots of them
They arise in line with the power of the mind of the person meditating as I'll explain at a later date
If you've never meditated these two easy principles are all you have to understand Think of the qualities of the Buddha and think of bringing them into your mind
What this means is be mindful to make the mind firmly established solely in the breath without forgetting it or letting yourself get distracted
Not forgetting the breath means being mindful of the inandout breath at all times
Not getting distracted means that you don't grab hold of anything else to think about
If the mind is focused but you're thinking about something else it's not called Right Concentration
Your mindfulness has to keep within the bounds of the work you're doing in other words staying with the breath
Don't put pressure on the breath tense it up or hold it
Let it flow easily and comfortably as when you put a fresh egg in cotton batting
If you don't throw it or push it down the egg won't get dented or cracked
This way your meditation will progress smoothly
The breath is one thing mindfulness is another and your awareness still another
You have to twist these three strands together so that they don't break away from one another
In other words your awareness has to stay with the act of mindfulness thinking about the breath
And both your awareness and mindfulness have to stay with the breath
Only then can you say that these things are factors of meditation
When you can twist these three strands into a single rope focus your awareness on observing the inandout breath to see whether it's comfortable or not expansive or confined broad or narrow
Whichever way of breathing feels comfortable keep breathing in that way
If the breath isn't comfortable keep changing it until it is
If you force the mind too much it's bound to pop away
If you loosen your grip too much it's going to get lost
So try to tend to it in a way that's just right
The important point is that your mindfulness and alertness be circumspect making adjustments throughout the breath
Don't let the mind go flowing out after other preoccupations
Mindfulness is like a person who's awake and alive
If the mind lacks mindfulness it's like we're sleeping with dead bodies in a cemetery
There's nothing but foul smells and fear
This is why we're taught to be mindful of ourselves in the present moment at all times
Cut away all thoughts of past and future without grabbing onto them to think about for these things are deceitful and illusory like spirits and demons
They waste your time and pull you down
So be aware simply of the breath for the breath is what gives life and leads you to higher happiness
Mindfulness is like a magic soap that scrubs the breath
Alertness is another bar of magic soap for scrubbing the mind
If you constantly have mindfulness and alertness in conjunction with the breath and the mind your body and mind will be valuable and pure so that as long as you live in the world you'll be at your ease when you die you won't be put to difficulties
If the mind is focused but forgets the breath and goes thinking about other things that's called Wrong Concentration
If the mind drops some of its Hindrances such as sensual desire by falling asleep that's called Wrong Release
Only if the mind is firmly focused on mindfulness and the breath is it in Right Concentration
Only if it drops its Hindrances by being wise to their tricks is it called Right Release
If mindfulness and alertness are constantly established in the mind our views will become straight our concentration will become right just as when two beams of light meet they give rise to the bright light of discernment
There are times when discernment arises for only a tiny moment in the mind and yet it can kill off enormous defilements
For example it can let go of all the clingingaggregates
It can abandon selfidentity views by letting go of the body it can abandon attachment to practices and precepts by letting go of feeling and it can abandon uncertainty by letting go of perception mental fabrications and consciousness
We're taught to develop this sort of discernment by practicing Right Concentration
Even if it arises only for the flash of an eye it can bring us many many benefits
Just like an atomic bomb even though it's only a tiny thing it can bring destruction to the world in an awesome way
The discernment arising from within the mind is something that can't be described
It's a tiny little thing not like the knowledge that comes from studying and memorizing in school
That's why we can't talk about it
The Buddha even laid down training rules for the monks forbidding them from talking about their spiritual attainments
This is why we can't know if other people are noble disciples
It's something that each noble disciple can know only for him or herself alone
I'd like to recommend the basic principles of sitting in meditation for newcomers who've never done it before
Be firmly mindful of the breath thinking bud with the inbreath and dho with the out
Or if you want you can simply think buddho buddho in the mind
Make the mind still and then drop the word buddho so that you can simply observe nothing but the inandout breath
It's like standing at the gate of a cattlepen and keeping watch over the cattle to see their characteristics as they come in and out of the pen
What color are they  black
red
white
spotted
Are they old or young
Are they calves or fully grown
Make sure you don't go walking in with the cattle yet for they might kick you and break your shins or gore you to death with their horns
Stay right at the gate
What this means is that you keep your mind still in one point
You don't have to make it go in and out with the breath
Observing the characteristics of the cattle means learning how to observe the breath Does breathing in short and out short feel good or does in long and out long feel good
How about in long and out short or in short and out long
Learn to recognize which type of breathing is most comfortable and then stick with it
So there are three steps you have to follow the first step is to stay mindful of the word buddho
The second is to be mindful of the breath thinking bud with the in breath and dho with the out
Don't forget
Don't get distracted
The third step when the mind is still is to drop the word buddho and to be observant of nothing but the inandout breath
When you can do this the mind will grow still
The breath will be still too like a dipper floating in a barrel of water the water is still the dipper is still because no one is pressing on it tipping it or hitting against it
The dipper will keep floating in perfect stillness on the surface of the water
Or you can say that it's like climbing up to the top of a very tall mountain or like floating up above the clouds
The mind will feel nothing but a cool sense of pleasure and ease
This is the root the heartwood the apex of all that is skillful
It's called the root because it's a good quality that runs deep and tenacious right down the middle of the heart
It's called the heartwood because it's solid and resilient like the heartwood of a tree that insects can't burrow into and destroy
Even though insects may be able to nibble away at the tree they can go only as far as the bark or the sapwood
In other words even though distractions may come and bother us they can reach only as far as the sense doors our eyes ears nose tongue and body
For example when sights strike against the eye they go only as far as the eye
They don't get into the heart
When sounds strike the ear they go only as far as the ear and not into the heart
When smells strike the nose they go only as far as the nose
They don't enter the heart
This is why we say that the goodness of meditation is the heartwood of what's skillful because the various forms of evil can't easily destroy the goodness of the heart when it's solid and stable in the same way that insects can't bore into heartwood
The skillfulness of a mind in concentration is called the apex of all that's skillful because it's high in quality
It can pull all other forms of goodness into the mind as well
When the mind is still its goodness spreads out to cover the entire body so that we stop doing unskillful things with the body
It will cover our speech so that we stop saying unskillful things with our mouth
The unskillful things we've done with our eyes ears hands will all get washed away
In this way the goodness that comes from meditating will wash out our eyes and ears will wash our hands and all the various parts of our body so that they all become clean
When we have cleanliness in charge of our body it's a goodness that's high in quality  just as rain falling from high up in the sky spreads to cover everything
The higher it comes from the more territory it covers
When the mind is high in quality its goodness spreads to cover our eyes ears nose tongue and body
It spreads to cover sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations
It spreads to cover our thoughts of past and future
In this way this goodness spreads out until eventually it covers the entire cosmos
These in short are a few of the rewards that come from meditation
The highquality goodness coming from meditation is like rain falling from high in the sky
Not only does it wash away the dirty things on the ground but it also nourishes the plants so that human beings can depend on them
In addition it refreshes people with its coolness
The Buddha showered his goodness on the world beginning from the very day of his Awakening and his goodness is still raining on us years later
The Buddha was a Great Being because of the highquality goodness he developed through his meditation  the same meditation we're doing right now
To put it simply every aspect of meditation is good
No matter how much you do even if you don't seem to be getting any results it's all good regardless
Even when you simply repeat the word buddho it's good for the mind
When you're mindful of the breath it's good for the mind
When you can make the mind still with the breath it's good for the mind
For this reason meditation is something you should do at all times
Don't let the time and opportunity to meditate pass you by
The power of the Buddha is more tremendous than that of all other beings human and divine
His body is enormous in that we've been making representations of it from ancient times up to the present and yet still haven't finished the job
His mouth is enormously wide
Many are the things that he said only once but that other people have repeated without ceasing here I'm talking about his teachings which members of the Sangha have copied down into texts and delivered as sermons for us to hear up to the present
The Buddha's physical mouth was small but his words are amazingly great which is why we say that his mouth is wide
His eyes are wide as well they've seen the true nature of the entire cosmos
This is the way it is with people who are really good they tend to have this kind of enormous greatness
Big things like this have to come from small things
Before the Buddha could become enormous in this way he first had to make himself small
In other words he cut himself off from his royal family and went alone into the forest to sit under the branches of the Bodhi tree on the banks of the Nerañjara River
He let his inandout breathing grow smaller and smaller until it was extremely subtle and there the fire of his defilements and mental fermentations went totally out without trace
He awakened to the foremost right selfawakening becoming a Buddha
His heart which he had let grow so extremely subtle and small exploded outward in goodness in a way that is still blatant to us even today
So I ask that we all set our minds on really practicing concentration
Don't worry about the past or the future or anything else
When the mind is firmly set in concentration knowledge and discernment will arise without our having to worry about them
Don't let yourself think that you want to know this or see that
These things will come on their own
As the proverb says Those with a lot of greed get only a little to feed on those content with only a pinkie's worth will get a whole thumb Keep bearing this point in mind
For the mind to range far and wide wandering after outside concepts and preoccupations saps the strength it needs to deal with its various affairs
Whatever it then thinks of doing will succeed only with difficulty
It's like a gun with a broadgauged barrel
If you put tiny bullets into it they rattle around inside and don't come out with much force
The narrower the gauge of the barrel the more force the bullets will have when you shoot them out
It's the same with the breath The more you narrow its focus the more refined the breath will become until eventually you can breathe through your pores
The mind at this stage has more strength than an atomic bomb
Intelligent orchard owners get their bananas to help them plant their orchard get their mangoes to help them plant their orchard
They don't have to invest a lot of capital
In other words they clear the land bit by bit plant it bit by bit harvest bit by bit sell bit by bit until the orchard grows larger and larger all the time
This way they don't need to invest much in terms of labor or capital but the results they get are large and lasting
As for stupid people when they start an orchard no matter how large they pour all their money into it hiring people to clear the land plow it and plant it all at once
If they run into a drought for three days or seven days running their plants all wither and die
Grass and weeds spring up and overrun the place
At that point there's nothing the owners can do because the orchard is way too big for them
They don't have the money to hire the workers again because they used up all their funds right at the beginning
All they can do is sit with their arms around their knees blinking back the tears
They've lost all their capital and have no profits to show
That's the way it is with people who are greedy
As for those who keep at their work steadily bit by bit the results keep growing bigger and bigger all the time
When we sit and meditate there are three things we have to work with
Mindfulness think of the meditation word bud with the inbreath and dho with the out
The mind keep the mind both with the breath and with the meditation word
Let the breath flow comfortably
Let the mind be at ease
Don't force the breath or try to put the mind into a trance
Keep the mind firm and upright and don't let it slip off here or there
These are the things we have to study  not just so that we'll know them
We study them so that we can put them into practice ie we practice them so that we'll come to the knowledge we really want
In keeping the mind pure we have to cut away perceptions so that they don't stick in the heart
It's like looking after a white sheet spread on our bed
We have to watch out for any dust that will blow in on the wind and land on the sheet and for any insects  such as ants or bed bugs  that will come to live there
If we see any dust we have to take the sheet and shake it out
Wherever there are any stains we have to launder it immediately
Don't let them stay long on the sheet or else they'll be hard to wash out
If there are any insects we have to remove them for they may bite us and give us a rash or keep us from sleeping soundly
When we keep looking after our sheet in this way it will have to stay clean and white and be a comfortable place for us to sleep
The dust and insects here are the Hindrances that are the enemies of the heart
We have to look after our heart in just the same way we look after our bedding
We can't let any outside perceptions come in and stick to the heart or nibble at it
We have to brush them all away
That way the mind will become calm free from distractions
When we meditate we're giving rise to skill in three ways we aren't harming anyone with our body we aren't badmouthing anyone with our speech and we're getting the mind to stay with good intentions
In other words we're staying with buddho with every inandout breath so we're not thinking of doing anything evil and we don't think thoughts of anger or hatred about anyone
This way our body speech and mind are pure
This is what gives rise to merit and skill for we're not doing any evil at all
When we think of the breath in this way it's as if we're painting a picture on a piece of white cloth
Our mind in its ordinary state is like a plain piece of cloth with no patterns or designs
When we raise the mind to a higher level and think of the factors of meditation it's like drawing a mental picture on it
For example the word buddho is a mental picture inasmuch as we can't see it with our eyes but we can see it through our thinking
If we think of it constantly it's as if our ink or paint seeps deep into the cloth
If we don't think buddho or think of it in only a superficial way it's like drawing with a pencil
The picture won't stick and seep into the heart
It might get smeared or entirely erased
Then we add details to our picture this is what's meant by evaluation
If we keep at it our picture will become more and more elaborate
As the picture becomes more and more elaborate we'll notice whether the inandout breath has become comfortable or not
If it's easy and comfortable keep it that way
Sometimes you'll notice that the mind is comfortable but the body isn't sometimes the body is comfortable but the mind is irritable and distracted sometimes the body is reasonably comfortable and at ease and the mind has settled down and isn't jumping about
So when you see any aspect that isn't comfortable you should fix it in the same way that a rice farmer has to keep careful watch over the sluice gates in his field clearing out any branches or stumps that will cut off the flow of the water
When you see anything that isn't good you should get rid of it
You have to stay observant of the breath to see if it's too slow or too fast or if it's making you tired
If it is change it
This is like plowing or harrowing your field
When the big clods of earth get broken up and spread around the field will be level
When the body gets level and smooth keep it going that way
The mind will then become level and smooth as well  for it lives with the body and now it gets to stay in a place of comfort
Whether it's good in every part or only in some parts you'll know
When we give rise to skill in the mind like this it's as if we've gained wealth
And when we gain wealth things are bound to come and disturb us just as a tree with beautiful fragrant flowers tends to have caterpillars or insects disturbing its flowers
When the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha arise in the heart there are bound to be things that will disturb or destroy them such as visions or Hindrances just as when a flower is pestered by insects it may fall away from the tree
When it falls off the tree it won't be able to bear fruit
The same with your mind Don't let your goodness fall away under the influence of the Hindrances
You have to keep after it to make sure that it stays still and established in the body until there's no sense of anything disturbing it or trying to destroy it
The mind will then be like a spray of mango flowers nourished with drops of mist
In no long time it will bear fruit and you'll be able to harvest the fruit and eat it in comfort
In the Dhammapada the Buddha says that a person who is forgetful or heedless is like a dead person
In other words if mindfulness lapses for a moment you've passed out for a moment
If it lapses for a long time you've passed out for a long time
So if you realize that it's lapsed you have to correct things immediately
In other words you reestablish mindfulness right away
If you've realized it's lapsed there's at least some hope for you
Some people don't even know that it's lapsed those are the ones who are hopeless
As the Buddha said pamado maccuno padam heedlessness is the path of death
This is because heedlessness is delusion the root of unskillfulness
When delusion arises it opens the way for all kinds of evil and unskillful things
So we should try to uproot it immediately before it starts growing and spreading its branches far and wide
When mindfulness lapses it opens the way for us to think of all kinds of things making it hard for us to finish our work
To say nothing of keeping track of the breath if mindfulness keeps lapsing we couldn't even finish writing a single letter
So we have to be especially careful to maintain mindfulness
Don't let yourself forget or lose track of what you're doing
When you sit in concentration you have to keep being observant to see whether the mind is established in all the component factors of meditation
Your practice of concentration has to be composed of three component factors for it to count as correct in line with the principles of meditation that will give rise to the full results that we all want
The component factors of meditation are
The right intention
Once we've focused our awareness on the inandout breath we have to keep our mindfulness fixed solely on the breath by thinking bud in with the inbreath and dho out with the out
We have to keep doing this until the mind is still and in place
Then we can drop the meditation word
Once the mind is still and doesn't go wandering off in other places mindfulness will stay snug with the breath without slipping away or growing absent minded
This is the intention the kamma of our kammatthana
The right quality
This refers to the skill with which we can improve adjust and spread the breath so that it becomes comfortable
For example if short breathing is uncomfortable change it so that it's a little longer
If long breathing is uncomfortable change it so that it's a bit shorter
Observe long breathing short breathing fast or slow breathing and then keep on breathing in whichever way is most comfortable
If any problem or discomfort arises make further changes
But don't tense up the breath or try to hold it
Let the body breathe in and out with a sense of ease
The breath will then feel wide open agile and spacious
It won't get bottled up in any one spot won't feel heavy or confined
When this is the case a sense of fullness and refreshment a cool sense of ease will arise in the mind
As for the body it'll feel at ease as well
This is the essence of what is good the skillfulness that we all desire
When we can train the mind to stay firmly in these three factors of meditation it'll become tame and obedient and no longer stubborn  because once our mind becomes skillful and intelligent it'll gain a sense of what's good for us what's not what are the affairs of other people what are our own affairs
When this happens there won't be a lot of confusion
It's the same as when we've trained an ox
We can put it to good work and won't have to waste a lot of rope to keep it tied down
That's when we can be at our ease
Even if we let it wander off on its own it won't get lost
When it goes away it'll come back to its pen on its own for it knows which pen belongs to its owner which pens belong to other people which person is its owner and which people are not which plants are the grasses it can eat which plants are the rice plants it shouldn't
This way it won't invade the fields of other people trampling their crops and eating their rice which would give rise to all sorts of controversies and bad feelings
That way we can live in peace
It's the same with the mind
Once it's trained it'll become tame
It won't go traipsing off after external thoughts and preoccupations
Normally the mind doesn't like to stay with the body in the present
Sometimes it goes flowing out the eyes sometimes out the ears sometimes out the nose the tongue and the body so that it splits into five different currents just like a river that splits into five channels instead of staying in one the force of the current gets weakened
And in addition to leaking out the five sense doors after sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations the mind also goes flowing out after thoughts of the past and thoughts of the future without ever staying firmly in the present
This is why it knows no peace because it doesn't get any time to rest
As a result its strength begins to fail and when the strength of the mind grows weaker so does the strength of the body
When this is the case we can't bring any of our projects to completion either in the area of the world or of the Dhamma
When this happens we're like a sick person who's a burden on his doctors and nurses
The doctors have to keep making visits to check up on his symptoms
The nurses have to feed him give him medicine and take him to the bathroom
When he tries to sit up he needs someone to support him
The people looking after him have to go without sleep both by day and by night and can never leave him alone
As for the people financially responsible they have to run around trying to find money to pay the medical bills
The whole family is worried and concerned and the sick person himself can find no comfort
He can't go anywhere can't do anything can't eat solid food can't get any sleep everything becomes a problem
In the same way when our minds aren't quiet and still and instead keep flowing out after concepts and preoccupations we're like sick people
We don't have the strength to bring our work to completion
This is because the untrained mind goes wandering off as it likes and is very stubborn
You can't tell it to do anything at all
If you tell it to lie down it'll sit down
If you tell it to sit down it'll get up and walk
If you tell it to walk it'll start running
If you tell it to run it'll stop
You can't really control it at all
When this is the case all sorts of unskillful qualities  ignorance and defilements like greed anger and delusion or the five Hindrances  will come flowing into the mind overcoming it and possessing it in the same way that people get possessed by spirits
When this is the case we're in all sorts of trouble and turmoil  all because the mind doesn't have the strength it needs to withstand ignorance or to drive it out of the heart
The Buddha saw that this is the way things are for people by and large causing them to suffer which is why he taught us to gather up the strength of body and strength of mind we need to fight off these various forms of suffering
In other words he taught us to practice concentration so as to make the strength of our mind firm and solid
Practicing concentration means training the mind to be quiet and still
As the mind stays quiet and still for longer and longer periods of time it'll become clear
When it's clear the light of discernment will arise within it
This discernment is the strength that will enable the mind to contend with all sorts of events both good and bad for it'll have the intelligence enabling it to wise up to all the preoccupations coming in by way of the eyes ears nose tongue body and intellect
It will be able to identify perceptions of past present and future
It will be acquainted with the properties aggregates and sense media knowing what's good what isn't what's worth thinking about what's not what's untrue what's true
When it knows this it'll become dispassionate disenchanted and will let go of all thoughts and concepts let go of its attachments to the body let go of its attachments to things outside all of which arise from the process of fabrication and have no real enduring essence
When the mind can let go of all thoughts and preoccupations it'll become light and agile like a person who has put down all the burdens she's been carrying on her shoulders and in her hands
She can walk run and jump with agility
She can sit down or lie down with ease
Wherever she goes she's comfortable
When the mind has experienced a sense of comfort it'll become happy and full
It won't feel hungry
When it's full and happy it can rest
Once it's rested it'll have strength
Whatever tasks it undertakes in terms of the world or the Dhamma will succeed
If the mind lacks a sense of fullness though it'll be hungry
When it's hungry it's in a lousy mood irritable and upset
When this is the case it's like a sick person who doesn't have the strength to complete any task with ease
As for people who have practiced concentration to the point where their minds are quiet and still they're no longer hungry for they have a sense of fullness within them
This gives them five kinds of strength  conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment  which will enable them to advance to even higher levels of goodness
When the mind is still it develops mental serenity
When the body is still it develops physical serenity as well the various properties within it are peaceful and harmonious and don't quarrel with one another
The whole body is then bathed in the purity that comes flowing out the currents of the mind through the properties of earth water fire and wind caring for them and protecting them
When things are protected and cared for they don't run down
In this way the properties of the body reach a state of harmony giving them the strength they need to withstand feelings of pain and weariness
As for the mind it'll develop greater and greater strength enabling it to withstand all sorts of mental torments
It'll keep getting more and more powerful like the gunpowder used to make rockets and fireworks
When it's lit it explodes and shoots all the way up to the sky
When we practice concentration it's as if we were gathering provisions for a trip
The provisions here are the skillful qualities we develop in the mind
The more provisions we have the more comfortably we can travel and the further we can go
We can go to the human world the deva worlds the brahma worlds or all the way to nibbana
When we have a lot of provisions our traveling is easy for we can afford to go by car or by boat
We can stay in comfortable places and have plenty of food to eat
The trip won't tire us and we can go far and fast
As for people with meager provisions they can't afford the carfare so they have to go barefoot walking on gravel and stepping on thorns exposed to the sun and rain
They can't stay in comfortable places they're lacking in food their progress is tiring and slow
By the time they reach their destination they're ready to give up for they're all out of strength
But whether we travel quickly or slowly we're all headed to the same destination
For example suppose we're all going to Bangkok
Those who go by foot will get there in three months those who go by car in three days while those who get on a plane will arrive in three minutes
For this reason you shouldn't get discouraged in your efforts to do what's good
Develop as much strength as you can so that you'll have the provisions and vehicles you'll need to help speed you along to your goal
Once you've arrived you'll experience nothing but happiness and ease
When you practice the Dhamma even if you don't reach the paths their fruitions or nibbana in this lifetime at the very least you're developing the conditions that will help you along the way in the future
When we meditate it's as if we were driving a car on a trip
If you have a sense of how to adjust and improve your breath it's like driving along a smooth paved road
The car won't run into any obstacles and even a long trip will seem short
As for people who aren't centered in concentration whose minds are slipping and slithering around with no sense of how to improve their breathing they're driving their car along a bumpy unpaved road full of potholes
In some spots the bridges have collapsed
In others the road is washed out
What this means is that their mindfulness lapses and they let their minds fall into thoughts of the past and future
They don't stay put in the present
If they don't know how to repair their road they'll keep running into dangers and obstacles
Their car will keep getting bogged down
Sometimes they spend weeks and months stuck in one place and their short trip turns into a long one
Sometimes they go back to the beginning point and start all over again
Running back and forth like this around and around in circles they'll never be able to get to the goal
So I ask that you all remember this discussion of the Dhamma and take it to heart
Try using it to make adjustments in your mind and see what happens
If you train the mind correctly in line with the three factors of meditation that I've mentioned here you may well meet with the peace and happiness for which you aim
When meditators get into position exactly what are they doing
Getting into position means making the mind stay in place making it stay with the body not letting it go stay with other people or think about anything else at all
If the mind stays outside of the body it's like a battery without any current
You can't get any use out of it
You can't use it to produce heat or give off light
So this is why we're taught to keep the mind inside
When trees are withered and dry it's because they don't have any water to nourish them
The same holds true with us
If the mind doesn't stay inside the body the body won't flourish
It'll have to wither and wear out grow ill in one way or another and eventually die because of this disease or that
So the mind is like water that permeates the body to give it nourishment
If the mind focuses its attention outside of the body then the body won't be able to gain any sense of freshness fullness or ease
This is because the mind is the most important factor influencing the body
It's our most valuable resource
Now when the mind is a valuable resource in this way we should learn how to look after it
We have to hand it over to someone we can trust
In other words we entrust it to somebody venerable
But the word venerable here doesn't mean the external venerables like monks because not all monks are trustworthy
Some of them are good monks some of them aren't
If we let them cheat us out of our valuables we end up even worse off than before
