what is risky is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on relinquishmentThe training rule on hasteclothAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time a government official who was going away sent a message to the monksCome Venerables I wish to give a robe to those who have completed the rainyseason residenceThe Buddha has allowed such robes only for those who have completed the rains residenceand being afraid of wrongdoing they did not goThat government official complained and criticized themHow can you not come when I send a messageIm going out with the armyIts hard to know whether Ill live or dieThe monks heard the complaints of that government officialand they told the BuddhaSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks I allow you to receive hastecloth and then store itKnowing that the Buddha had made this allowancemonks received hastecloth and stored them beyond the robe seasonin bundles on a bamboo roberackWhile walking about the dwellings Venerable nanda saw that cloth and he asked the monksWhose cloth is thisIts our hasteclothHow long have you stored itThey told himand nanda then complained and criticized themHow can these monks receive hastecloth and then store it beyond the robe seasonAfter rebuking those monks in many ways nanda told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that some monks do thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticized them Monks how can those foolish men receive hastecloth and then store it beyond the robe seasonThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisWhen there are ten days left to the Kattika full moon that ends the first rainyseason residence and hastecloth is given to a monk he may receive it if he regards it as urgent He may then store it until the end of the robe seasonIf he stores it beyond that he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confessionThere are ten days leftthe invitation procedure is ten days in the futureThe Kattika full moon that ends the first rainyseason residencethe Kattika full moon of the invitation procedure is what is meantHasteclothwhen someone wants to go out with the army when someone wants to go away when someone is sick when someone is pregnant when someone without faith acquires faith when someone without confidence acquires confidenceif that person sends a message to the monks saying Come Venerables I wish to give a robe to those who have completed the rainyseason residence this is called hasteclothHe may receive it if he regards it as urgent He may then store it until the end of the robe seasonestablishing the perception of it as a hastecloth he may store itThe robe seasonfor one who has not participated in the robemaking procedure it is the last month of the rainy seasonfor one who has participated in the robemaking procedure it is the five month periodIf he stores it beyond thatfor one who has not participated in the robemaking procedure if he goes beyond the last day of the rainy season he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confessionFor one who has participated in the robemaking procedure if he goes beyond the day on which the robemaking season ends the cloth becomes subject to relinquishmentThe cloth should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individualAnd monks it should be relinquished like thisVenerables this hastecloth which I have kept

hastecloth and he does not perceive it as such there is no offenseif within the robe season the hastecloth is determined transferred to another given away lost destroyed burnt stolen or taken on trustif he is insaneif he is the first offenderThe eighth rule the training rule on hastecloth is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on relinquishmentThe subchapter on silkThe training rule on six yearsAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time monks were having blankets made every yearThey kept on begging and askingGive woolwe need woolPeople complained and criticized themHow can the Sakyan ascetics have blankets made every year begging and askingGive wool we need woolWe only make blankets for ourselves every five or six years even though our children defecate and urinate on them and they are eaten by ratsThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleand the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monksHow can those monks act like thisAfter rebuking those monks in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that some monks are acting like thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticized themHow can those foolish men have blankets made every year begging and askingGive wool we need woolThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk has had a new blanket made he should keep it for six yearsWhether that blanket has been given away or not if he has another new blanket made in less than six years he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confessionIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksAt one time a certain monk at Kosambī was sickHis relatives sent him a messageCome Venerable well nurse youOther monksurged him to gobut he saidThe Buddha has laid down a training rulethat a monk who has had a new blanket made must keep it for six yearsBecause Im sick Im not able to take my blanket when I travelAnd because Im not comfortable without itI cant goThey told the BuddhaSoon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks I allow you to give a blanketpermission to a sick monkAnd it should be given like thisAfter approaching the Sangha the sick monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks He should then squat on his heels raise his joined palms and sayVenerables Im sickIm not able to take my blanket when I travelI ask the Sangha for a blanketpermissionAnd he should ask a secondand a third timeA competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk soandso is sick He is not able to take his blanket when he travelsHe is asking the Sangha for a blanketpermissionIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should give a blanketpermission to monk soandsoPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk soandso is sick He is not able to take his blanket when he travelsHe is asking the Sangha for a blanketpermissionThe Sangha gives a blanketpermission to monk soandsoAny monk who approves of giving a blanketpermission to monk soandso should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has given a blanketpermission to monk soandsoThe Sangha approves and is therefore silentI will remember it thusAnd so monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk has had a new blanket made he should keep it for six yearsWhether that blanket has been given away or not if he has another new blanket made in less than six years except if the monks have agreed he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confessionnewly made is what is meantA blanketit is made by strewing not by weavingHas had madehas made or has had madeHe should keep it for six yearshe should keep it for a minimum of six yearsIn less than six yearsfewer than six yearsThat blanket has been given awayit has been given to othersit has not been given to anyoneexcept if the monks have agreedIf he makes another new blanket or has one made unless the monks have agreed then for the effort there is an act of wrong conductWhen he gets the blanket it becomes subject to relinquishmentThe blanket should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individualAnd monks it should be relinquished like thisVenerables this blanket which I had made after less than six years without the agreement of the monks is to be relinquishedI relinquish it to the Sangha the Sangha should give you should give I give this blanket back to youIf he finishes what he began himself he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and

rules and their analysisThe chapter on relinquishmentThe subchapter on robesThe training rule on receiving robeclothAt one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuaryAt that time the nun Uppalavaṇṇā was staying at SāvatthīOne morning she robed up took her bowl and robe and entered Sāvatthī to collect almsfoodWhen she had finished her almsround and had eaten her meal she went to the Blind Mens Grovewhere she sat down at the foot of a tree for the days meditationJust then some bandits had stolen a cow and slaughtered it and were taking the meat to the Blind Mens GroveThe head bandit saw Uppalavaṇṇā sitting at the foot of that treeHe thoughtIf my sons and brothers see this nun theyll harass herand he took a different pathSoon afterwards when the meat was cooked he took some of the best meat tied it up in a palmleaf packet hung it from a tree not far from Uppalavaṇṇā and saidWhatever acetic or brahmin sees this gift please take it And he leftUppalavaṇṇā had just emerged from stillness when she heard the head bandit making that statementShe took the meat and returned to her dwelling placeThe following morning she prepared the meat and made it into a bundle with her upper robe She then rose into the air and appeared in the Bamboo GroveWhen she arrived the Buddha had already entered a village to collect almsfoodbut Venerable Udāyī had been left behind to look after the dwellingsUppalavaṇṇā approached Udāyī and saidVenerable wheres the BuddhaHe has entered the village to collect almsfoodPlease give this meat to the BuddhaYoull please the Buddha with that meatIf you give me your sarong youll please me tooIts hard for women to get material support and this is one of my five robesI dont have any otherI cant give it awaySister just as a man giving an elephant might decorate its girthso you giving meat to the Buddha should decorate me with your sarongBeing pressured by Udāyī Uppalavaṇṇā gave him her sarong and then returned to her dwelling placeThe nuns who received Uppalavaṇṇās bowl and robe asked herVenerable wheres your sarongAnd she told them what had happenedThe nuns complained and criticized UdāyīHow can Venerable Udāyī receive a robe from a nun Its hard for women to get material supportThose nuns told the monksThe monks of few desires complained and criticized UdāyīHow can Venerable Udāyī receive a robe from a nunAfter rebuking him in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned UdāyīIs it true Udāyī that you did thisIts true SirIs she a relative of yoursFoolish

exchangeThe nuns complained and criticized themHow can they not receive robes from us in exchangeThe monks heard the criticism of those nunsand they told the BuddhaSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks if it is part of an exchange I allow you to receive things from five sources from monks from nuns from trainee nuns from novice monks and from novice nunsAnd so

then returned to Upananda and saidIve instructed the lay follower you pointed out to mePlease approach him at the right time and hell give you a robeLater on that government official sent a message to Upananda sayingPlease use the robe we wish you to use the robeBut Upananda did not say anything to that lay followerThe government official sent the same message a second timebut again Upananda did

ninth rule the training rule on trading with money is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing expulsionThe third training rule on expulsionAt one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great WoodAt that time the Buddha spoke to the monks in many ways about unattractivenesshe spoke in praise of unattractiveness in praise of developing the mind in unattractiveness and in praise of the attainment of unattractivenessThe Buddha then addressed the monksMonks I wish to go into solitary retreat for half a monthNoone is to approach me except the one who brings me almsfoodYes Venerable Sir they replied and noone approached him except the one who brought him almsfoodThe monks thought The Buddha has talked in many ways about unattractivenessand they devoted themselves to the development of the mind in unattractiveness in its many different facetsAs a consequence they became troubled by their own bodies ashamed of them disgusted with themJust as a young woman or mansomeone fond of adornments who had just washed her hairwould be ashamed humiliated and disgusted if the carcase of a snake a dog or a man were hung around her neckjust so those monks were troubled by their own bodiesThey took their own lives took the lives of one anotherand they approached Migalaṇḍika the ascetic lookalike and saidPlease kill usThis bowl and these robe will be yoursAnd hired for a bowl and robes Migalaṇḍika killed a number of monks He took his bloodstained knife to the river Vaggumudāand while he was washing it he became anxious and remorsefulThis is truly bad for meIve made much demerit by killing virtuous monksThen walking across the water a god from the realm of the lord of death said to MigalaṇḍikaWell done superior man youre truly fortunateYouve made much merit because youve brought across those who hadnt yet crossedAnd Migalaṇḍika thoughtSo it seems that Im fortunate that Ive made much meritHe then went from dwelling to dwelling from precincts to precincts and saidWho hasnt crossed yet Whom do I bring acrossThe monks who still had sensual desire became fearful and terrified with their hair standing on endOnly those who were free from desires were unaffectedThen on a single day Migalaṇḍika killed one monk two monks three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty even sixty monksAt the end of that halfmonth the Buddha came out of seclusion and said to Venerable nandananda why is the Sangha of monks so diminishednanda told him what had happenedadding Venerable Sir please give another instruction so that the Sangha of monks may become established in perfect insightWell then nanda bring together in the assembly hall all those monks who live supported by VesālīWhen he had done so he approached the Buddha and saidSir the Sangha of monks is gatheredPlease do as you think is appropriateThe Buddha then went to the assembly hall sat down on the prepared seat and addressed the monksMonks when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it is peaceful and sublime a satisfying state of bliss And it stops and settles bad unwholesome qualities on the spot whenever they ariseJust as a great unseasonal storm in the last month of the hot season stops and settles the dust and dirt in the airjust so when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it is peaceful and sublime and it stops and settles bad unwholesome qualities on the spot whenever they ariseAnd how is stillness by mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated like thisA monk sits down in the wilderness at the foot of a tree or in an empty hut He crosses his legs straightens his body and establishes mindfulness in front of himSimply mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes outWhen he breathes in long he knows it and when he breathes out long he knows thatWhen he breathes in short he knows it and when he breathes out short he knows thatWhen breathing in he trains in having the full experience of the breath when breathing out he trains in having the full experience of the breathWhen breathing in he trains in calming the activity of the body when breathing out he trains in calming the activity of the bodyWhen breathing in he trains in experiencing joy when breathing out he trains in experiencing joyWhen breathing in he trains in experiencing bliss when breathing out he trains in experiencing blissWhen breathing in he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind when breathing out he trains in experiencing the activity of the mindWhen breathing in he trains in calming the activity of the mind when breathing out he trains in calming the activity of the mindWhen breathing in he trains in experiencing the mind when breathing out he trains in experiencing the mindWhen breathing in he trains in gladdening the mind when breathing out he trains in gladdening the mindWhen breathing in he trains in stilling the mind when breathing out he trains in stilling the mindWhen breathing in he trains in freeing the mind when breathing out he trains in freeing the mindWhen breathing in he trains in contemplating impermanence when breathing out he trains in contemplating impermanenceWhen breathing in he trains in contemplating fading away when breathing out he trains in contemplating fading awayWhen breathing in he trains in contemplating ending when breathing out he trains in contemplating endingWhen breathing in he trains in contemplating relinquishment when breathing out he trains in contemplating relinquishmentMonks when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated like this it is peaceful and sublime a satisfying state of bliss and it stops and settles bad unwholesome qualities on the spot whenever they ariseThe Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that some monks have taken their own lives have killed one another and have said to MigalaṇḍikaPlease kill us this bowl and these robes will be yoursIts true SirThe Buddha criticized themMonks its not suitable for these monks its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable it should not be doneHow could those monks take their own lives kill one another and say to MigalaṇḍikaPlease kill us this bowl and these robes will be yoursThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk intentionally kills a human being or seeks an instrument of death for himhe too is expelled and excluded from the communityIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksAt one time a lay follower was illHe had a beautiful and pleasant wifeand the monks from the group of six had fallen in love with herThey said to each otherIf this lay follower lives we wont get this womanCome lets praise death to himThey then went to that lay follower and saidYouve done whats good and wholesome youve made a shelter against fear You havent done anything bad you havent been greedy or immoralWhats the point of this miserable and difficult lifeDeath is better for you than lifeWhen you have passed away youll be reborn in a happy place in heavenThere youll be able to enjoy the pleasures of heavenThat lay follower thoughtThe venerables have spoken the truthfor Ive done whats good and avoided whats badand after death Ill be reborn in a happy placeFrom then on he ate various kinds of detrimental food and drank detrimental drinksand as a consequence he became seriously illBut his wife complained and criticized those monksThese Sakyan ascetics are shameless and immoral liarsThey claim to live according to the Truth to be celibate and of good conduct to be truthful moral and of good characterBut they dont have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmintheyve lost the plotThey praised death to my husbandand because of them my husband has diedAnd other people complained and criticized them in the same wayThe monks heard the criticism of those peopleThose monks who had few desires and a sense of conscience who were contented afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training complained and criticized those monksHow could they praise death to that lay followerAfter criticizing those monks in many ways they told the Buddha Is it true monks that you praised death to that lay followerIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked themFoolish men its not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable it should not be doneHow could you praise death to that lay followerThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And so monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk intentionally kills a human being or seeks an instrument of death for him or praises death or incites someone to die sayingMy friend whats the point of this miserable and difficult life Death is better for you than lifethinking and intending thus if he praises death in many ways or incites someone to diehe too is expelled and excluded from the community The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this caseknowing perceiving having intended having decided

disadvantage in living and speaks in praise of deathOr incites someone to diehe says Kill yourself with a knife Eat poison Die by hanging yourself with a ropeMy friendthis is a form of addressWhats the point of this miserable and difficult lifeMiserable lifethe life of the poor is miserable compared to the life of the richthe life of the impoverished is miserable compared to the life of the wealthythe life of humans is miserable compared to the life of the godsDifficult lifethe life of one whose hands are cut off whose feet are cut off whose hands and feet are cut off whose ears are cut off whose nose is cut off whose ears and nose are cut offBecause of this sort of miserableness and because of this sort of difficult life one says Death is better for you than lifemind and thought are equivalentIntendingperceiving death intending death aiming at deathIn many waysin various mannersHe praises deathhe shows the disadvantage in living and speaks in praise of death sayingWhen youve

entailing expulsion is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing expulsionThe first training rule on expulsionThe chapter on VerañjāHomage to the Buddha the Perfected One the fully Awakened OneAt one time the Buddha was staying at Verañjā at the foot of Naḷerus Nimba tree with a large sangha of five hundred monksAnd a brahmin in Verañjā was toldSir the ascetic Gotama the Sakyan who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan is staying at Verañjā at the foot of Nalerus Nimba tree with a large sangha of five hundred monksThat Buddha Gotama has a good reputationHe is indeed a Master perfected and fully awakened complete in insight and conduct happy knower of the world supreme trainer of tamable people teacher of gods and humans the Master the BuddhaWith his own insight he has seen this world with its gods its lords of death and its supreme beings this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans and he makes it known to othersHe has a Teaching that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end It has a true goal and is well articulated He sets out a perfectly complete and pure spiritual lifeIts good to see such perfected onesThen that brahmin went to the Buddha exchanged pleasantries with him sat down and saidI have heard good Gotamathat you dont bow down to old brahmins stand up for them or offer them a seatNow Ive seen that this is indeed the caseThis isnt properBrahmin in the world with its gods its lords of death and its supreme beings in this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans I dont see anyone to whom I should bow down for whom I should rise up or to whom I should offer a seatIf I bowed down to anyone rose up for him or offered him a seat his head would explodeGood Gotama lacks tasteThere is a way one could rightly say about me that the ascetic Gotama lacks tasteFor the taste for forms sounds smells flavors and material objects has been abandoned by me cut off at the root made like a palmstump so utterly done away with that it is incapable of reappearingBut thats not what you meantGood Gotama is unlikeableThere is a way one could rightly say about me that Im unlikeableFor the liking of forms sounds smells flavors and material objects has been abandoned by the Buddha cut off at the root made like a palmstump so utterly done away with that it is incapable of reappearingBut thats not what you meantGood Gotama teaches nonactionThere is a way one could rightly say about me that the ascetic Gotama teaches nonactionFor I teach the nondoing of misconduct by body speech and mindI teach the nondoing of various sorts of bad unwholesome actionsBut thats not what you meantGood Gotama is an annihilationistThere is a way one could rightly say about me that the ascetic Gotama is an annihilationistFor I speak of the annihilation of sensual desire ill will and confusionI speak of the annihilation of various sorts of bad unwholesome qualitiesBut thats not what you meantGood Gotama is detestableThere is a way one could rightly say about me that I am detestableFor I detest misconduct by body speech and mindI detest being possessed of various sorts of bad unwholesome qualitiesBut thats not what you meantGood Gotama is an exterminatorThere is a way one could rightly say about me that Im an exterminatorFor I teach for the sake of the extermination of sensual desire ill will and confusionfor the extermination of various sorts bad unwholesome qualitiesBut thats not what you meantGood Gotama is austereThere is a way one could rightly say about me that Im austereFor I say that bad unwholesome qualitiesmisconduct by body speech and mindare to be disciplinedOne who has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be disciplined who has cut them off at the root made them like a palmstump done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of reappearingsuch a one I call one who is austereNow I have abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be disciplined have cut them off at the root made them like a palm tree done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of reappearingBut thats not what you meantGood Gotama is withdrawnThere is a way one could rightly say about me that Im withdrawnFor one whose future conception in a womb whose rebirth in a future life is abandoned and cut off at the root made like a palmstump so utterly done away with that one is incapable of reappearingsuch a one I call one who is withdrawnNow my future conception in a womb my rebirth in a future life has been abandoned and cut off at the root made like a palmstump so utterly done away with that Im incapable of reappearingBut thats not what you meantBrahmin suppose there were a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggswhich she had properly covered properly warmed and properly incubatedIs the first chick that hatches safelyafter piercing through the eggshell with its claw or its beakto be called the eldest or the youngestHes to be called the eldestfor hes the eldest of thoseJust so in this deluded population enveloped like an egg I alone in the world have split the eggshell of delusion and reached the supreme full awakeningI brahmin am the worlds eldest and bestI was firmly energetic and had clarity of mindfulness my body was tranquil and my mind unifiedFully secluded from the five senses secluded from unwholesome mental qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which consists of joy and bliss born of seclusion and is accompanied by movement of the mindThrough the stilling of the movement of the mind I entered and remained in the second absorption which has internal confidence and unification of mind and consists of joy and bliss born of stillnessThrough the fading away of joy I remained evenminded mindful and fully aware experiencing bliss directly and I entered and remained in the third absorption of which the noble ones declareOne is evenminded mindful and abides in blissThrough the abandoning of bliss and suffering and the earlier ending of joy and aversion I entered and remained in the fourth absorption which has neither suffering nor happiness and consists of purity of mindfulness and evenmindednessThen with my mind collected purified cleansed flawless free from defilements supple wieldy steady and imperturbable I directed it to the knowledge which is the recollection of former livesI recollected many past lives that isone birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births and many eons of world dissolution many eons of world evolution and many eons of both dissolution and evolution and I knewThere I had such a name such a family such appearance such food such experience of happiness and suffering and such a lifespanPassing away from there I was reborn elsewhereand there I had such a name such a family such appearance such food such experience of happiness and suffering and such a lifespanPassing away from there I was reborn hereIn this way I recollected many past lives with their characteristics and particularsThis was the first true insight attained by me in the first part of the nightDelusion was dispelled and true insight arose darkness was dispelled and light aroseas happens to one who remains heedful energetic and diligentThis brahmin was my first breaking out like a chick from an eggshellThen with my mind collected purified cleansed flawless free from defilements supple wieldy steady and imperturbable I directed it to the knowledge of the arising and passing away of beingsWith superhuman and purified clairvoyance I saw beings passing away and getting reborn inferior and superior beautiful and ugly gone to good destinations and to bad destinations and I understood how beings pass on according to their actionsThese beings who engaged in misconduct by body speech and mind who abused the noble ones who had wrong views and acted accordinglyat the breaking up of the body after death have been reborn in a lower realm a bad destination a world of misery hellBut these beings who engaged in good conduct of body speech and mind who did not abuse the noble ones who held right view and acted accordinglyat the breaking up of the body after death have been reborn in a good destination a heaven worldIn this way with superhuman and purified clairvoyance I saw beings passing away and getting reborn inferior and superior beautiful and ugly gone to good destinations and to bad destinations and I understood how beings pass on according to their actionsThis was the second true insight attained by me in the middle part of the nightDelusion was dispelled and true insight arose darkness was dispelled and light aroseas happens to one who remains heedful energetic and diligentThis brahmin was my second breaking out like a chick from an eggshellThen with my mind collected purified cleansed flawless free from defilements supple wieldy steady and imperturbable I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the corruptionsI knew according to reality This is suffering This is the origin of suffering This is the end of suffering This is the path leading to the end of sufferingI knew according to reality These are the corruptions This is the origin of the corruptions This is the end of the corruptions This is the path leading to the end of the corruptionsWhen I knew and saw this my mind was freed from the corruption of sensual desire from the corruption of existence from the corruption of views and from the corruption of delusionWhen it was freed I knew it was freedand I understood that birth had come to an end the spiritual life had been lived the job had been done there was no further state of existenceThis was the third true insight attained by me in the last part of the nightDelusion was dispelled and true insight arose darkness was dispelled and light aroseas happens to one who remains heedful energetic and diligentThis brahmin was my third breaking out like a chick from an eggshellThat brahmin then said to the BuddhaGood Gotama is the eldest good Gotama is the bestWonderful good Gotama wonderfulJust as one might set upright what had been overturned or reveal what had been hidden or show the way to one who was lost or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see whats therejust so have you made the Teaching clear in many waysGood Gotama I go for refuge to you and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monksPlease accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeAnd please consent to spend the rainyseason residence at Verañjā together with the Order of monksThe Buddha consented by keeping silent and the brahmin understoodHe then got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and leftAt that time Verañjā was short of food and afflicted with hunger with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw It was not easy to get by on almsfoodJust then some horsedealers from Uttarāpatha had entered the rainyseason residence at Verañjā with five hundred horsesIn the horsepen they prepared many portions of steamed grain for the monksThen after robing up in the morning the monks took their bowls and robes and entered Verañjā for alms Being unable to obtain anything they went to the horsepen They then brought the portions of steamed grain back to the monastery pounded them and ate themVenerable nanda crushed a portion of steamed grain on a stone took it to the Buddha and the Buddha ate itThe Buddha heard the sound of the mortarWhen Buddhas know what is going on sometimes they ask and sometimes notthey know the right time to ask and the right time not to askBuddhas ask when it is beneficial not when it is unbeneficialfor Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficialBuddhas question the monks for two reasons to give a teaching or to lay down a training ruleAnd so the Buddha said to nanda nanda whats this sound of a mortarnanda told him what was happeningWell done nandaYou who are superior people have conquered the problems of famine later generations will despise even rice and meatThen Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached the Buddha bowed sat down and saidAt present Venerable Sir Verañjā is short of food and afflicted with hunger with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to strawIts not easy to get by almsfoodSir the undersurface of this great earth is abounding with food which tastes just like pure honeyIt would be good if I inverted the earth so that the monks may enjoy the nutrition in the sproutsBut what will you do Moggallāna with those creatures who are living thereI will transform one of my hands to be just like the great earth and Ill make those creatures go thereThen with the other hand Ill invert the earthLet it be Moggallāna please dont invert the earthThose creatures might lose their mindsIn that case Sir it would be good if the whole Sangha of monks could go to Uttarakuru for almsLet it be Moggallāna please dont pursue thisAt this time while Venerable Sāriputta was in seclusion he thoughtFor which Buddhas did the spiritual life not last longFor which Buddhas did the spiritual life last longIn the evening after coming out of seclusion Sāriputta approached the Buddha bowed sat down and saidJust now Sir while I was in seclusion I thoughtFor which Buddhas did the spiritual life not last long and for which ones did it last longSāriputta the spiritual life established by Buddha Vipassī Buddha Sikhī and Buddha Vessabhū didnt last longBut the spiritual life established by Buddha Kakusandha Buddha Konāgamana and Buddha Kassapa did last longAnd whats the reason why the spiritual life established by Buddha Vipassī Buddha Sikhī and Buddha Vessabhū didnt last longBuddha Vipassī Buddha Sikhī and Buddha Vessabhū were disinclined to give detailed teachings to their disciplesThey gave few discourses in prose and in prose and verse few expositions verses inspired exclamations quotations birth stories amazing accounts and analysesand they didnt lay down training rules or recite a monastic codeAfter the disappearance of those Buddhas after the disappearance of the disciples awakened under them those who were the last disciplesof various names clans and social standing who had gone forth from various familiesallowed that spiritual life to disappear rapidlyIts just like flowers not tied with a string to a wooden plank theyre scattered about whirled about and destroyed by the windWhys thatBecause theyre not held together by a stringJust so after the disappearance of those Buddhas after the disappearance of the disciples awakened under them those who were the last disciples allowed that spiritual life to disappear rapidlyBut those Buddhas were untiring in instructing their disciples after reading their mindsAt one time Sāriputta while staying in a certain frightening forest grove Buddha Vessabhū the Perfected and the fully Awakened One instructed an sangha of a thousand monks reading their minds and sayingThink like this not like thispay attention like this not like thisabandon this having attained this abide in itWhen those thousand monks had been instructed by Buddha Vessabhū their minds were freed from the corruptions without graspingBut when anyone with sensual desire entered that frightening forest grove usually their hair would stand on endThis is the reason why the spiritual life established by Buddha Vipassī Buddha Sikhī and Buddha Vessabhū didnt last longWhat then is the reason why the spiritual life established by Buddha Kakusandha Buddha Konāgamana and Buddha Kassapa lasted longBuddha Kakusandha Buddha Konāgamana and Buddha Kassapa were diligent in giving detailed teachings to their disciplesThey gave many discourses in prose and in prose and verse many expositions verses inspired exclamations quotations birth stories amazing accounts and analysesand they laid down training rules and recited a monastic codeAfter the disappearance of those Buddhas after the disappearance of the disciples awakened under them those who were the last disciplesof various names clans and social standing who had gone forth from various familiesmade that spiritual life last for a long timeIts just like flowers tied with a string to a wooden plank they are not scattered about whirled about or destroyed by the windWhy is thatBecause they are held together by a stringJust so after the disappearance of those Buddhas after the disappearance of the disciples awakened under them those who were the last disciples made that spiritual life last for a long timeThis is the reason why the spiritual life established by Buddha Kakusandha Buddha Konāgamana and Buddha Kassapa lasted longThen Sāriputta got up from his seat put his upper robe over one shoulder raise his joined palms and saidThis is the right time Venerable Sirfor laying down training rules and reciting a monastic code so that this spiritual life may last for a long timeHold on Sāriputtathe Buddha will know the right time for thatThe Teacher doesnt lay down training rules and recite a monastic code until the causes of corruption appear in the SanghaAnd they dont appear until the Sangha has attained long standinggreat sizean abundance of the best material supportor great learningWhen this happens then the Teacher lays down training rules for his disciples and recites a monastic code in order to hold back those causes of corruptionSāriputta the Sangha of monks is devoid of immorality devoid of danger stainless pure established in the essenceEven the least developed of these five hundred monks is a streamenterer not subject to rebirth in the lower world fixed in destiny bound for awakeningThen the Buddha said to nanda nanda its the custom for Buddhas not to go wandering in the country without taking leave of those who invited them to spend the rainyseason residenceLets go to the brahmin of Verañjā and take leaveYes SirThe Buddha robed up took his bowl and robe and with nanda as his attendant went to that brahmins house where he sat down on the prepared seatThe brahmin approached the Buddha bowed and sat downAnd the Buddha said Brahmin weve completed the rains residence according to your invitation and now we take leave of youWe wish to depart to go wandering in the countryIts true good Gotama that youve completed the rains residence according to my invitation but I havent given a giftThats not goodIts not because I didnt want to but because household life is so busyWould you and the Sangha of monks please accept a meal from me tomorrowThe Buddha consented by keeping silentThen after instructing inspiring and gladdening that brahmin with a teaching the Buddha got up from his seat and leftThe following morning the brahmin prepared various kinds of fine food in his own house and then had the Buddha informed that the meal was readyThe Buddha robed up took his bowl and robe and together with the Sangha of monks he went to that brahmins house and sat down on the prepared seatAnd that brahmin personally served and satisfied the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha with various kinds of fine food When the Buddha had finished his meal the brahmin gave a set of three robes to the Buddha and two pieces of cloth to each monkThe Buddha instructed inspired and gladdened him with a teaching and then got up from his seat and leftAfter remaining in Verañjā for as long as he liked the Buddha traveled to Payāgapatiṭṭhāna via Soreyya Saṅkassa and Kaṇṇakujja There he crossed the river Ganges and continued on to BenaresAfter remaining at Benares for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward VesālīWhen he eventually arrived at Vesālīhe stayed in the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roofThe section for recitation on Verañjā is finishedThe first raining rule on expulsionOrigin storyAt one time Sudinna the son of a prominent merchant lived in a village called Kalandaka not far from VesālīOn one occasion Sudinna went to Vesālī on some business together with a number of friendsJust then the Buddha was seated surrounded by a great gathering of people giving a teachingWhen Sudinna saw this he thought Why dont I listen to the TeachingHe then approached that gathering and sat downAs he was sitting there he thoughtThe way I understand the Buddhas Teaching its not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shellWhy dont I cut off my hair and beard put on the ocher robes and go forth from home into homelessnessWhen those people had been instructed inspired and gladdened by the Buddha they got up from their seats bowed down circumambulated him with their right side toward him and leftSudinna then approached the Buddha bowed sat down and saidVenerable Sir the way I understand the Buddhas Teaching its not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shellI want to cut off my hair and beard put on the ocher robes and go forth from home into homelessnessSir please give me the going forthBut Sudinna do you have your parents permissionNo SirSudinna Buddhas dont give the going forth to anyone who hasnt gotten their parents permissionIll do whatever is necessary Sir to get my parents permissionThen after finishing his business in Vesālī Sudinna returned to Kalandaka There he approached his parents and saidMum and dad the way I understand the Buddhas Teaching its not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pureI want to cut off my hair and beard put on the ocher robes and go forth from home into homelessnessPlease give me permission to go forthBut Sudinna youre our only childYoure dear to us and we love you You live in comfort and are well cared for you have no experience of sufferingEven if you died we would lose you against our wishesSo how can we allow you to go forth from home into homelessness while youre still livingSudinna asked his parents a secondand a third timebut got the same replyHe then lay down on the bare ground and saidIll either die right here or go forthAnd he did not eat at the next seven mealsHis parents said Dear Sudinna youre our only child Youre dear to us and we love you You live in comfort and are well cared foryou have no experience of sufferingEven if you died we would lose you against our wishesSo how can we allow you to go forth from home into homelessness while youre still livingGet up Sudinna eat drink and enjoy yourselfEnjoy worldly pleasures and do acts of meritWe wont allow you to go forthBut Sudinna did not respondHis parents said the same thing a secondand a third timebut Sudinna remained silentThen Sudinnas friends approached him and repeated three times what his parents had saidBut Sudinna made no responseSudinnas friends approached his parents and saidSudinna says hell either die right there on the bare ground or go forthIf you dont allow him to go forth hell die thereBut if you allow him to go forth youll see him again afterwardsAnd if he doesnt enjoy the going forth what alternative will he have but to come back hereSo allow him to go forthWe allow him they saidAnd Sudinnas friends said to himGet up Sudinna your parents have given you permission to go forth from home into homelessnessSudinna thought They say that my parents have given me permission to go forth and he got up excited and joyful stroking his limbs with his handsAfter spending a few days to regain his strength he went to the Buddha bowed sat down and saidVenerable Sir Ive gotten my parents permission to go forth from home into homelessnessPlease give me the going forthHe then received the going forth in the presence of the Buddha and he received the full ordinationNot long afterwards he practiced these kinds of ascetic practices he stayed in the wilderness ate only almsfood was a ragrobe wearer and went on continuous almsroundAnd he lived supported by a certain Vajjian villageAt that time the Vajjians were short of food and afflicted with hunger with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw and it was not easy to get by on almsfoodVenerable Sudinna considered this and thoughtI have many relatives in Vesālī who are richWhy dont I live supported by themBecause of me my relatives will be able to make offerings and make merit the monks will get material support and Ill have no trouble getting almsfoodHe then put his dwelling in order took his bowl and robe and set out for VesālīWhen he eventually arrived he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great WoodHis relatives heard that he had arrived in Vesālī and they presented him with an offering of sixty servings of foodSudinna gave the sixty servings of food to the monks He then took his bowl and robe and entered the village of Kalandaka for almsfoodAs he was going on continuous almsround he came to his own fathers houseJust then a female slave of Sudinnas relatives wanted to throw away the previous evenings porridgeSudinna said to herIf thats to be thrown away sister put it here in my almsbowlAs she was putting the porridge into his bowl she recognized his hands feet and voiceShe then went to his mother and saidPlease know madamthat master Sudinna is backIf you speak the truth Ill make you a free womanAs Sudinna was eating the previous evenings porridge at the base of a certain wallhis father saw him as he was coming home from workHe approached him and saidBut Sudinna isnt there  and youre eating old porridgeIsnt there your own home to go toWe went to your house householderThats where we received this porridgeSudinnas father took him by the arm and said Come lets go to the houseSudinna went to his fathers house and sat down on a prepared seatHis father said to him Eat SudinnaTheres no need Ive finished eating for todayThen please come back for the meal tomorrowSudinna consented by keeping silent and he got up from his seat and leftThe next morning Sudinnas mother had the ground smeared with fresh cowdung and she piled up two heaps one with money and one with goldThe heaps were so large that a man standing on one side could not see a man standing on the otherHiding the heaps behind screens and preparing a seat between them surrounded by a curtain she said to Sudinnas former wifeNow please adorn yourself in the way our son Sudinna found you especially attractiveYes madamThen after robing up Venerable Sudinna took his bowl and robe and went to his fathers house where he sat down on the prepared seatHis father approached him uncovered the heaps and saidThis dowry dear Sudinna is the fortune from your mother and its yours Another is the fortune from your father and another the fortune from your ancestorsIts possible Sudinna to return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make meritPlease do soI cant father Im enjoying the spiritual lifeSudinnas father repeated his request and Sudinna replied as beforeSudinnas father then repeated his request a third time and Sudinna repliedIf you wouldnt get offended I could tell you what to doSpeak SudinnaWell then make some large sacks of sunnhemp cloth put all the money and gold inside take it all away in carts and dump it in the middle of the GangesBecause that way you would avoid the danger fear and terror that it will cause you as well as the trouble with protectionHis father became displeased and thought How can our son Sudinna say such thingsHe then said to Sudinnas former wifeNow then since you were dear to him perhaps our son Sudinna will listen to youSudinnas former wife took hold of his feet and saidWhat are these nymphs like sir for which you lead the spiritual lifeSister I dont lead the spiritual life for the sake of nymphsHis former wife thought From today Sudinna calls me sister and she fainted on the spotSudinna said to his fatherIf theres food to be given householder give itbut dont annoy meEat Sudinna he saidAnd Sudinnas mother and father personally served and satisfied him with various kinds of fine foodWhen Sudinna had finished his meal his mother said to himDear Sudinna this family is richIts possible to return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make meritPlease do soMother I cant Im enjoying the spiritual lifeHis mother repeated her request a second time but got the same replyShe then saidThis family Sudinna is richPlease give us an offspringso that the Licchavīs dont take over our heirless propertyYes mother I can do thatWhere are you staying at presentIn the Great WoodAnd he got up from his seat and leftSudinnas mother said to his former wifeNow then as soon as you reach your fertile period please tell meYes madam she repliedNot long afterwards Sudinnas former wife reached her fertile periodand she reported it to Sudinnas motherNow please adorn yourself in the way that our son Sudinna found you especially attractiveYes madamThen Sudinnas mother together with his former wife approached Sudinna in the Great Wood and she said to himThis family dear Sudinna is richIts possible to return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make meritPlease do soMother I cantIm enjoying the spiritual lifeHis mother repeated her request a second time but got the same replyShe then said thisThis family Sudinna is richPlease give us an offspringso that the Licchavīs dont take over our heirless propertyYes mother I can do that he saidHe then took his former wife by the arm plunged into the Great Wood andthere being no training rule and he seeing no dangerhad sexual intercourse with her three timesAs a result she conceivedThe earthgods cried outSirs the Sangha of monks has been stainless and free from dangerBut Sudinna of Kalanda has produced a stain has produced dangerHearing the cry of the earthgods the gods belonging to the heaven of the four great kings also cried out the Tāvatisa gods the Yāma gods the Tusita gods the gods who delight in creation the gods who control the creation of others the gods belonging to the retinue of the supreme beings also cried outSirs the Sangha of monks has been stainless and free from dangerBut Sudinna of Kalanda has produced a stain has produced dangerThus in that moment in that instance the news spread as far as the world of the supreme beingsThe pregnancy of Sudinnas wife developed and she eventually gave birth to a sonSudinnas friends called this boy Offspringthey called Sudinnas former wife Offsprings motherand they called Venerable Sudinna Offsprings fatherAfter some time they both went forth from home into homelessness and they realized perfectionBut Sudinna was anxious and remorseful and he thoughtThis is truly bad for methat after going forth on such a wellproclaimed spiritual path I wasnt able to practice for life the perfectly complete and pure spiritual lifeAnd because of his anxiety and remorse he became thin haggard and pale his veins protruding all over his limbs he became sad sluggish miserable depressed remorseful weighed down by griefThe monks who were Sudinnas friends said to himFormerly Sudinna you were satisfied with a good color a bright face and clear skinBut now youre thin haggard and pale your veins protruding all over your limbs and youre sad sluggish miserable depressed remorseful weighed down by griefCould it be that you are dissatisfied with the spiritual lifeI am not dissatisfied with the spiritual lifebut Ive done a bad deedIve had sexual intercourse with my former wifeThats why Im so miserableI wasnt able to practice for life the perfectly complete and pure spiritual lifeSudinna no wonder youre anxious no wonder you feel remorse in that having gone forth on such a wellproclaimed spiritual path you werent able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual lifeHasnt the Buddha taught in many ways for the sake of dispassion not for the sake of passionfor the sake of freedom from bondage not for the sake of bondagefor the sake of nongrasping not for the sake of graspingWhen the Buddha has taught in this way how can you be intent upon passion bondage and graspingHasnt the Buddha given many teachings for the fading away of sensual desirefor the clearing away of intoxication for the removal of thirst for the uprooting of attachment for the cutting off of the round of birth and death for the stopping of craving for fading away for ending for extinguishmentHasnt the Buddha in many ways taught the abandoning of worldly pleasuresthe full understanding of the perception of worldly pleasuresthe removal of thirst for worldly pleasuresthe elimination of thoughts of worldly pleasuresthe stilling of the fever of worldly pleasuresThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have itbut it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their mindsAfter rebuking Sudinna in many ways they told the BuddhaThe Buddha then had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned SudinnaIs it true Sudinna that you had sexual intercourse with your former wifeIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked himFoolish man its not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow could you go forth on such a wellproclaimed spiritual path and not be able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual lifeHavent I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion not for the sake of passionfor the sake of freedom from bondage not for the sake of bondagefor the sake of nongrasping not for the sake of graspingWhen I have taught in this way how can you be intent upon passion bondage and graspingHavent I given many teachings for the fading away of sensual desirefor the clearing away of intoxication for the removal of thirst for the uprooting of attachment for the cutting off of the round of birth and death for the stopping of craving for fading away for ending for extinguishmentHavent I in many ways taught the abandoning of worldly pleasuresthe full understanding of the perception of worldly pleasuresthe removal of thirst for worldly pleasuresthe elimination of thoughts of worldly pleasuresthe stilling of the fever of worldly pleasuresIt would be better foolish man for your penis to enter the mouth of a terrible and poisonous snake than to enter a womanIt would be better for your penis to enter the mouth of a black snake than to enter a womanIt would be better for your penis to enter a blazing charcoal pit than to enter a womanWhy is thatBecause for that reason you might die or experience deathlike suffering but you wouldnt because of that be reborn in a bad destinationBut for this reason you mightFoolish man you have practiced what is contrary to the true Teaching the common practice the low practice the coarse practice that which ends with a wash that which is done in private that which is done wherever there are couplesYou are the forerunner the first performer of many unwholesome thingsThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have itbut it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their mindsThen the Buddha spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain in dispraise of great desires discontent socializing and laziness but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain of fewness of wishes contentment selfelimination ascetic practices serenity reduction in things and of being energeticAfter giving a teaching on what is right and proper he addressed the monksWell then monks I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasonsfor the wellbeing of the Sangha for the comfort of the Sangha for the restraint of bad people for the ease of good monks for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives to give rise to confidence in those without it to increase the confidence of those who have it for the longevity of the true Teaching and for supporting the trainingAnd monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk has sexual intercourse he is expelled and excluded from the communityIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksThe section for recitation on Sudinna is finishedSecond substory the account of the female monkeySome time later in the Great Wood near Vesālī a certain monk befriended a female monkey by giving her food and then had sexual intercourse with herSoon afterwards after robing up in the morning he took his bowl and robe and entered Vesālī for almsJust then a number of monks who were walking about the dwellings came to this monks dwellingThe female monkey saw the monks comingShe went up to them shook her buttocks in front of them wagged her tail presented her buttocks and made a gestureThe monks thought This monk must be having sexual intercourse with this monkey and they hid to one sideThen when that monk had finished his almsround in Vesālī and had returned with his almsfoodhe ate one part himself and gave the rest to that female monkeyAfter eating the food the monkey presented her buttocks to the monk and he had sexual intercourse with herThose monks said to that monk Hasnt a training rule been laid down by the BuddhaWhy then do you have sexual intercourse with a monkeyIts true that a training rule has been laid down by the Buddha but it refers to human women not to animalsBut thats just the sameIts not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow could you go forth on such a wellproclaimed spiritual path and not be able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual lifeHasnt the Buddha taught in many ways for the sake of dispassion the stilling of the fever of worldly pleasuresThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have itbut it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their mindsAfter rebuking that monk in many ways they told the BuddhaThe Buddha then had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned that monkIs it true monk that you had sexual intercourse with a monkeyIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked himFoolish man its not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow could you go forth on such a wellproclaimed spiritual path and not be able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual lifeHavent I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion the stilling of the fever of worldly pleasuresIt would be better foolish man for your penis to enter the mouth of a terrible and poisonous snake than to enter a womanIt would be better for your penis to enter the mouth of a black snake than to enter a womanIt would be better for your penis to enter a blazing charcoal pit than to enter a womanWhys thatBecause for that reason you might die or experience deathlike sufferingbut you wouldnt because of that be reborn in a bad destinationBut for this reason you mightFoolish man youve practiced what is contrary to the true Teaching the common practice the low practice the coarse practice that which ends with a wash that which is done in private that which is done wherever there are couplesFoolish man this wont give rise to confidence in those without it And so monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk has sexual intercourse even with a female animal he is expelled and excluded from the communityIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksThe account of the female monkey is finishedThird substory the section for recitation on coveringAround the same time a number of Vajjian monks from Vesālī ate slept and bathed as much as they likedDoing so and not reflecting properly they had sexual intercourse but without first renouncing the training and revealing their weaknessAfter some time they were affected by loss of relatives loss of property and loss of health They then approached Venerable nanda and saidVenerable nanda we dont blame the Buddha the Teaching or the Sanghawe only blame ourselvesWe were unfortunate and had little meritafter going forth on such a wellproclaimed spiritual path we were unable for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual lifeIf we were now to obtain the going forth and the full ordination in the presence of the Buddha we would have clarity about wholesome qualities and would be devoted day after day to developing the aids to awakeningVenerable nanda please tell the Buddha about thisYes he replied And he went to the Buddha and told himIts impossible nanda that the Buddha should abolish a training rule that entails expulsion because of the VajjiansThe Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks if a monk without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness has sexual intercourse he may not receive the full ordinationBut monks if someone has sexual intercourse after first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness he may receive the full ordinationAnd so monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk after taking on the monks training and way of life without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness has sexual intercourse even with a female animal he is expelled and excluded from the communitywhoever of such a kind of such activity of such social standing of such name of such family of such conduct of such behavior of such association who is senior who is junior or who is of middle standingthis is called ahe is a

offense entailing expulsionThe first offense entailing expulsion is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing expulsionThe second training rule on expulsionAt one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture PeakAt that time a number of monks who were friends had made grass huts on the slope of Mount Isigili and had entered the rainyseason residence thereAmong them was Venerable Dhaniya the potterAfter three months when they had completed the rainyseason residence the monks demolished their grass huts put away the grass and wood and left to wander in the countryBut Venerable Dhaniya also spent the winter and the summer thereThen on one occasion while Dhaniya was in the village to collect almsfood some women gathering grass and firewood demolished the grass hut and took away the grass and sticksA second time Dhaniya collected grass and sticks and made a grass hutand again the hut was demolished in the same wayThe same thing happened a third timeDhaniya thoughtThree times this has happenedBut Im welltrained and experienced in my own craft of potteryWhy dont I knead mud myself and make a hut consisting of nothing but clayThen Dhaniya did just that And he collected grass wood and cowdung and he baked his hutIt was a beautiful and charming little hut and it was red just like a scarlet rainmiteAnd when hit it sounded just like the sound of a bellSoon afterwards the Buddha was descending from the Vulture Peak with a number of monks and he saw that hutHe said to the monksMonks whats this beautiful and charming thing which is red like a scarlet rainmiteThe monks told the Buddhaand the Buddha criticized DhaniyaIts not suitable monks for that foolish man its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow can he make a hut out of nothing but clayCertainly that foolish man can have no consideration compassion and mercy for living beingsGo monks and demolish this hutso that future generations dont take up the destruction of living beingsAnd monks you should not make a hut consisting of nothing but clayIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductYes Venerable Sir the monks replied and they went to that hut and demolished itDhaniya said to themWhy are you demolishing my hutThe Buddha has asked us toDemolish it if the Lord of the Truth has said soThen Dhaniya thoughtThree times while I was in the village to collect almsfood women gathering grass and firewood demolished my hut and took away the grass and sticksAnd now my hut made of nothing but clay has been demolished at the Buddhas requestBut the caretaker of the woodyard is a friend of mineWhy dont I ask him for timber and make a hut out of thatDhaniya then went to the caretaker of the woodyard and told him what had happenedadding Please give me some timberI want to make a wooden hutTheres no such timber Sir that I could give youThis timber is held by the King and its meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of an emergencyYou can only take it if the King gives it awayIts been given by the KingThe caretaker of the woodyard thoughtThese Sakyan ascetics live according to the Truth They are celibate and their conduct is good and they are truthful moral and have a good characterEven the King has faith in themThese venerables wouldnt say something is given if it were notAnd he said to DhaniyaYou may take it SirDhaniya then had that timber cut into pieces removed it by means of carts and made a wooden hutSoon afterwards the brahmin Vassakāra the chief minister of Magadha while inspecting the works in Rājagaha went to the caretaker of the woodyard and said to himWhats going onWheres the timber held by the King thats meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of an emergencySir that timber was given by the King to Venerable DhaniyaThe brahmin Vassakāra was upset and thoughtHow could the King give away this timber to Dhaniya the potterThe brahmin Vassakāra then went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and saidIs it true sir that the timber held by the King meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of an emergency was given by the King to Dhaniya the potterWho said thatThe caretaker of the woodyard sirWell then brahmin send for the caretaker of the woodyardAnd Vassakāra had the caretaker of the woodyard bound and taken by forceDhaniya saw the caretaker of the woodyard being bound and taken by forceand he said to himWhy is this happening to youBecause of that business with the timber SirGo and Ill come tooPlease come before Im done forDhaniya then went to King Bimbisāras house and sat down on the prepared seatThe King approached Dhaniya bowed sat downIs it true Venerable that I have given the timber held by the Kingmeant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of an emergencyto youYes great kingWe kings are very busywe may give and not rememberPlease remind meDo you remember great king when you were first anointed speaking these wordsI give the grass sticks and water for the ascetics and brahmins to enjoyI rememberThere are ascetics and brahmins who have a sense of conscience who are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the trainingThey are afraid of wrongdoing even in regard to small mattersWhat was uttered by me was meant for these and it concerned whats ownerless in the wildernessYet you imagine that you can take timber not given to you by means of this pretextBut how could I presume to beat imprison or banish an ascetic or a brahmin living in my kingdomGo youre free because of your statusbut dont do such a thing againBut people complained and criticized himThese Sakyan ascetics are shameless and immoral liarsThey claim to live according to the Truth to be celibate and of good conduct to be truthful moral and of good characterBut they dont have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmintheyve lost the plotThey even deceive the Kingwhat then other peopleThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleThe monks of few desires who had a sense of conscience who were contented afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training complained and criticized Venerable DhaniyaHow can he take timber belonging to the King that hasnt been given to himAfter criticizing Dhaniya in many ways they told the BuddhaThe Buddha then convened the Sangha of monks and questioned Venerable DhaniyaIs it true Dhaniya that youve taken timber belonging to the King that wasnt given to youIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked himFoolish man its not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow can you take timber belonging to the King that hasnt been given to youThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have itbut it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their mindsJust then a former judge who had gone forth with the monks was sitting near the BuddhaThe Buddha said to himFor what amount of stealing does King Bimbisāra beat imprison or banish a thiefFor a pāda coin Sir for the worth of a pāda or for more than a pādaAt that time in Rājagaha a pāda coin was worth five māsaka coinsAfter rebuking Venerable Dhaniya in many ways for being difficult to support  And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk intending to steal takes what has not been given to himthe sort of stealing for which kings having caught a thief would beat imprison or banish him saying Youre a bandit youre a fool youve gone astray youre a thiefhe too is expelled and excluded from the communityIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksAt one time monks from the group of six went to the dyers spread of cloth took the dyers goods to the monastery and shared it outOther monks saidYou have great meritsince youve obtained so much robeclothHow is there merit for usJust now we went to the dyers spread of cloth and took the dyers goodsHasnt a training rule been laid down by the BuddhaWhy then do you take the dyers goodsIts true that a training rule has been laid down by the Buddhabut it concerns inhabited areas not the wildernessBut thats just the sameIts not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow can you take the dyerss goodsThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have itbut it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their mindsAfter rebuking those monks in many ways they told the BuddhaThe Buddha convened the Sangha of monks and questioned those monksIs it true monks that you went to the dyers spread of cloth and took the dyers goodsIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked themIts not suitable foolish men its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow can you go to the dyers spread of cloth and take the dyers goodsThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have itbut it will hinder confidence in those

Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing expulsionThe fourth training rule on expulsionAt one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great WoodAt that time a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainyseason residence on the banks of the river VaggumudāJust then Vajjī was short of food and afflicted with hunger with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to strawand it was not easy to get by on almsfoodThe monks considered the difficult circumstances and they thoughtHow can we remain united and in harmony have a comfortable rainy seasonand get almsfood without troubleSome saidWe could work for the householdersand theyll give something in returnIn this way well be united and in harmony and well spend the rainy season in comfortand have no trouble getting almsfoodSome saidTheres no need to work for the householdersLets instead take messages for themand theyll give something in returnIn this way well be united and in harmony and well spend the rainy season in comfortand have no trouble getting almsfoodSome saidTheres no need to work for the householdersnor to take messages for themLets instead praise one anothers superhuman qualities to the householdersSuch a monk has the first absorptionsuch a monk the second absorptionsuch a monk the thirdsuch a monk the fourthsuch a monk is a streamenterersuch a monk a oncereturnersuch a nonreturnersuch a perfected onesuch a monk has the three true insightsand such the six direct knowledgesThen theyll give to usIn this way well be united and in harmony and well spend the rainy season in comfortand have no trouble getting almsfoodIndeed this is the better way that we praise one anothers superhuman qualities to the householdersThen those monks praised one anothers superhuman qualities to the householdersSuch a monk has the first absorption such a monk has the six direct knowledgesAnd those people thoughtWere fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rainyseason residenceSuch monks as these who are virtuous and of good character have never before entered the rains residence with usAnd they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves or give to their parents to their wives and children to their slaves servants and workers to their friends and companions or to their relativesIn this way those monks were satisfied with a good color a bright face and clear skinNow it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainyseason residence to go and visit the BuddhaSo when they had completed the rains residence and the three months had elapsed those monks put their dwellings in order took their bowls and robes and left for VesālīWhen they eventually arrived at Vesālī they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood There they approached the Buddha bowed and sat downAt that time the monks who had completed the rains residence in that region were thin haggard and pale their veins protruding all over their limbsBut the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā were satisfied with a good color a bright face and clear skinSince it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monksthe Buddha said to themI hope youre keeping well monks I hope youre comfortableI hope you had a comfortable rains residence in concord and harmony without dispute and that you had no trouble getting almsfoodWere keeping well Venerable Sir were comfortablewe had a comfortable rains residence in concord and harmony without dispute and we had no trouble getting almsfoodWhen Buddhas know what is going on sometimes they ask and sometimes not they know the right time to ask and the right time not to ask Buddhas ask when it is beneficial not when it is unbeneficial for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficialBuddhas question the monks for two reasons to give a teaching or to lay down a training ruleAnd the Buddha said to those monksIn what way monks did you have a comfortable rains residence without having any trouble getting almsfoodThen those monks told the BuddhaBut had you really achieved those superhuman qualitiesNo SirThe Buddha rebuked themIts not suitable foolish men its not proper its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its should not be doneHow can you for the sake of your stomachs praise one anothers superhuman qualities to householdersIt would be better for your bellies to be cut open with a sharp butchers knife than for you to praise one anothers superhuman qualities to householdersWhy is thatBecause for that reason you might die or experience deathlike sufferingbut you wouldnt because of that be reborn in a bad destinationBut for this reason you mightThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it  After rebuking them and giving a teaching he addressed the monksMonks there are these five great gangsters to be found in the worldWhat fiveA great gangster thinks like thisOh when will I with a following of a hundred or a thousand men wander among villages towns and royal capitalskilling and making others kill destroying and making others destroy tormenting and making others tormentThen after some time he does just thatJust so monks a bad monk thinks like thisOh when will I with a following of a hundred or a thousand people go wandering among villages towns and royal capitalsbe honored respected and revered by both lay people and those gone forth and obtain robes almsfood dwellings and medicinesThen after some time he does just thatThis is the first great gangster to be found in the worldAgain a bad monk learns the spiritual path proclaimed by the Buddha and takes it as his ownThis is the second great gangster to be found in the worldAgain a bad monk groundlessly charges someone who lives the spiritual life in purity with not abstaining from sexualityThis is the third great gangster to be found in the worldAgain a bad monk takes valuable goods and requisites belonging to the Sanghaa monastery the site of a monastery a dwelling the site of a dwelling a bed a bench a mattress a pillow a metal pot a metal jar a metal bucket a metal bowl a machete a hatchet an ax a spade a chisel a creeper bamboo reed grass clay wooden goods earthenware goodsand uses them to win over and create a following among householdersThis is the fourth great gangster to be found in the worldBut in this world with its gods its lords of death and its supreme beings in this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans this is the greatest gangster one who untruthfully and groundlessly boasts about a superhuman qualityWhy is thatMonks youve eaten the countrys almsfood by theftWhoever should declare himselfto be other than he truly isHas eaten this by theftlike a cheater who has deceivedMany ochernecks of bad qualitiesuncontrolled and wickedBy their wicked deedsthey are reborn in hellIts better to eat an iron ballheated like a burning flameThan for the immoral and uncontrolledto eat the countrys almsAfter rebuking the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā in many ways for being difficult to maintain difficult to support  And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk falsely claims for himself a superhuman quality knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones saying This I know this I seebut after some timewhether questioned or not but having committed the offense and seeking purificationshould say Not knowing I said that I know not seeing that I see what I said was empty and falsehe too is expelled and excluded from the communityIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksAt one time a number of monks thinking they had seen what they had not attained what they had not achieved what they had not realized what they had not declared final knowledge because of overestimationAfter some time their minds inclined to sensual desire ill will and confusionThey became anxious thinkingThe Buddha has laid down a training ruleyet we declared final knowledge because of overestimationCould it be that weve committed an offense entailing expulsionThey told Venerable nandawho told the BuddhaHe said nanda these monks declared final knowledge because of overestimation thinking they had seen what they had not attained what they had not achieved what they had not realized what they had notbut this is negligibleAnd so monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk falsely claims for himself a superhuman quality knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones saying This I know this I seebut after some timewhether he is questioned or not but having committed the offense and seeking purificationshould say Not knowing I said that I know not seeing that I see what I said was empty and false thenexcept if it is due to overestimationhe too is expelled and excluded from the community The monk who has been given

entailing expulsion is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing confessionThe training rule on had preparedAt one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuaryAt that time the nun Thullanandā was associating with a family from which she received a regular mealOn one occasion the head of that family had invited some senior monksJust then the nun Thullanandā robed up in the morning took her bowl and robe and went to that family And she asked the head of the familyWhy have you prepared so much foodBecause Venerable Ive invited the senior monksBut who are those senior monksVenerable Sāriputta Venerable Mahāmoggallāna Venerable Mahākaccāna Venerable Mahākoṭṭhika Venerable Mahākappina Venerable Mahācunda Venerable Anuruddha Venerable Revata Venerable Upāli Venerable nanda and Venerable RāhulaBut why do you invite such inferior monks instead of the great onesWho are these great monksVenerable Devadatta Venerable Kokālika Venerable Kaṭamodakatissaka Venerable Khaṇḍadeviyāputta and Venerable SamuddadattaWhile this conversation was still taking place the senior monks enteredThullanandā said Is it true that youve invited these great monksJust before you called them inferior monks and now you call them great monksAnd that lay person threw her out of the house and made an end of her regular mealThe monks of few desires complained and criticized DevadattaHow can Devadatta eat almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared Is it true Devadatta that you did thisIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him Foolish man how can you eat almsfood knowing that a nun had it preparedThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk eats almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared he commits an offense entailing confessionIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksSoon afterwards a monk who had earlier left Rājagaha returned to see his familyBecause it was long since he had last returned people prepared food for him respectfullyAnd the nun who was associating with that family said to themGive food to that monkThe monk thoughtThe Buddha has prohibited us from eating almsfood when we know that a nun had it prepared and being afraid of wrongdoing he did not accept itAnd because he was not able to walk for alms he missed his mealAfter returning to the monastery he told the monks what had happenedand they in turn told the BuddhaSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks I allow you to eat almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared if the householder had already intended to prepare it And so monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk eats almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared except if the householder had already intended to prepare it he commits an offense entailing confession The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this

Gotamī we hope youre getting betterIm not bearing up Venerables and Im not getting betterPlease give me a teachingIts not allowable for us to go and teach a nun at her dwelling place And being afraid of wrongdoing they did not teach herSoon afterwards after robing up in the morning the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Mahāpajāpati Gotamī where he sat down on a prepared seatAnd he said to herI hope youre bearing up Gotamī I hope youre getting betterPreviously Venerable Sir the senior monks would come and teach meand because of that I would be comfortableBut now that this has been prohibited by the Buddha they dont teach because theyre afraid of wrongdoingAnd because of that Im not comfortableAfter instructing inspiring and gladdening her with a teaching the Buddha got up from

that time Hatthaka the Sakyan had been beaten in debateWhile talking with the ascetics of other religions he would assert things after denying them and he would deny things after asserting them He evaded the issues lied and made sham appointmentsThe ascetics of other religions complained and criticized him When Hatthaka talks with us how can he assert things after denying them deny things after asserting them evade the issues lie and make sham appointmentsThe monks heard the complaints of those ascetics of other religionsand they went to Hatthaka and saidIs it true Hatthaka that youre acting like thisThese ascetics of other religions should be beaten whatever it takesThey shouldnt be allowed to winThe monks of few desires complained and criticized himWhen Hatthaka talks with the ascetics of other religions how can he assert things after denying them deny things after asserting them evade the issues lie and make sham appointmentsAfter rebuking Hatthaka in many ways they told the

finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing confessionThe subchapter on plantsThe training rule on evasive speechAt one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghositas MonasteryAt that time Venerable Channa was misbehaving Then when he was examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha he spoke evasivelyWho has committed an offense What offense has been committed In regard to what has an offense has been committed How has an offense been committed Who are you talking about What are you talking aboutThe monks of few desires complained and criticized himHow can Venerable Channa speak evasively like this when he is examined about an offense in the midst of the SanghaIs it true Channa that you are speaking like thisIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him Foolish man when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha how can you speak evasively like thisWho has committed an offense What offense has been committed In regard to what has an offense has been committed How has an offense been committed Who are you talking about What are you talking aboutThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it and after rebuking him he gave a teaching and addressed the monksWell then monks the Sangha should charge Channa with evasive speechAnd he is to be charged like thisA competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk Channa speaks evasively when examined about an offense in the midst of the SanghaIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should charge him with evasive speechPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk Channa speaks evasively when examined about an offense in the midst of the SanghaThe Sangha is charging him with evasive speechAny monk who approves of charging him with evasive speech should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has charged the monk Channa with evasive speechThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusAfter rebuking Channa in many ways for being difficult to support the Buddha said And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk speaks evasively he commits an offense entailing confessionIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksLater when Channa was again being examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha he thoughtBy speaking evasively Ill commit an offenses and he instead harassed the Sangha by remaining silentThe monks of few desires complained and criticized himWhen hes examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha how can Venerable Channa harass the Sangha by remaining silentIs it true Channa that you are acting like thisIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him Foolish man when youre examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha how can you harass the Sangha by remaining silentThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it and after rebuking him he gave a teaching and addressed the monksWell then monks the Sangha should charge Channa with harassmentAnd he is to be charged like thisA competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk Channa when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha harasses the Sangha by remaining silentIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should charge him with harassmentPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk Channa when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha harasses the Sangha by remaining silentThe Sangha is charging him with harassmentAny monk who approves of charging him of harassment should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has charged the monk Channa with harassmentThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusAfter rebuking Channa in many ways for being difficult to support the Buddha said And so monks this

Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing confessionThe subchapter on eatingThe training rule on KāṇamātuAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time there was a female lay follower Kāṇamātā who had faith and confidenceShe had a daughter Kāṇā who had been given in marriage to a man in a certain villageOn one occasion Kāṇā went to her mothers house on some businessKāṇās husband sent her a message Please come Kāṇā I want you backKāṇamātā thought Its shameful to go emptyhanded and she baked pastriesJust when the pastries were finished an almscollecting monk entered Kāṇamātās house and she gave him pastriesAfter leaving he told another monk and he too was given pastriesAnd the same happened a third timeAt that all the pastries were goneA second time Kāṇās husband sent her the same message and everything unfolded as beforeA third time he sent the same messageadding If Kāṇā doesnt come Ill find another wifeBut once again all the pastries were given to monksKāṇās husband found another wifeand when Kāṇā heard what had happened she criedSoon afterwards after robing up in the morning the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Kāṇamātās house where he sat down on a prepared seatKāṇamātā approached the Buddha bowed and sat downThe Buddha asked her why Kāṇā was crying and she told him what had happenedAfter instructing inspiring and gladdening her with a teaching the Buddha got up from his seat and leftSoon afterwards a certain caravan was ready to go south from RājagahaAn almscollecting monk approached that caravan to get almsfoodand a lay follower gave him flourAfter leaving that monk told another monk and he too was given flourAnd the same happened a third timeAt that all the flour was goneThat lay follower said to the other people in the caravanSirs please wait one day Ive given my provisions to the monksand I need to prepare more provisionsWe cant wait the caravan is going already And they leftAfter preparing provisions that lay follower followed after the caravan but he was robbed by thievesPeople complained and criticized themHow can the Sakyan ascetics receive without moderationThis man gave to them and then because he was following after the caravan he was robbed by thievesThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleand they told the BuddhaSoon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monksWell then monks I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasonsfor the wellbeing of the Sangha for the comfort of the Sangha for the restraint of bad people for the ease of wellbehaved monks for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives to give rise to confidence in those without it to increase the confidence of those who have it for the longevity of the true Teaching and for supporting the trainingAnd monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk approaches a family and is invited to take pastries or baked goods he may accept two or three bowlfuls if he wishes If he accepts more than that he commits an offense entailing confessionIf he accepts two or three bowlfuls he should take it away and share it with the monksThis is the proper procedureA monk approaches a familya family there are four kinds of family

did soThat monk then went to Sāvatthī where he told the monks what had happenedThe monks of few desires complained and criticized himHow could a monk travel by appointment with a woman Is it true monk that you did thisIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him Foolish man how could do thisThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk travels by appointment with a woman even just to the next village he commits an offense entailing confession The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this casea human female not a female spirit not a female ghost not a

Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuaryAt that time a family that was supporting Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had invited him to a mealand they had invited other monks tooBut since Upananda was visiting other families before that mealthe other monks said to that familyPlease give the mealPlease wait Sirs until Venerable Upananda arrivesA second time A third time those monks saidPlease give the meal before the time for eating comes to an endBut we made the meal because of Venerable UpanandaPlease wait until he arrivesThen after visiting those families Upananda arrived lateand those monks did not eat as much as they had intendedThe monks of few desires complained and criticized UpanandaHow can Venerable Upananda visit families first when invited to a meal Is it true Upananda that you did thisIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him Foolish man how can you visit families first when invited to a mealThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand he commits an offense entailing confessionIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksSoon afterwards a family that was supporting Upananda sent nonstaple food to the SanghaThey gave instructions that the food should be shown to Upananda and then given to the SanghaOn that occasion Upananda had entered the village for almsWhen those people arrived at the monasterythey asked for Upanandaand they were told where he wasThey said Venerables after showing it to Venerable Upananda this nonstaple food is to be given to the SanghaThe monks told the Buddhawho then gave a teaching and addressed the monksWell then monks receive it and put it aside until Upananda returnsKnowing that the Buddha had prohibited visiting families before the meal Upananda visited them after the meal instead As a consequence he returned late to the monastery and the food had to be returned to the donorsThe monks of few desires complained and criticized UpanandaHow can Venerable Upananda visit families after the meal Is it true Upananda that you do thisIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him Foolish man how can you visit families after the mealThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And so monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand or afterwards he commits an offense entailing confessionIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksSoon afterwards it was the robegiving season But being afraid of wrongdoing the monks did not visit familiesAs a result they only obtained a small amount of robeclothThey told the Buddha Monks I allow you to visit families during the robegiving seasonAnd so monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand or afterwards except on an appropriate occasion he commits an offense entailing confessionThis is the appropriate occasion it is the robegiving seasonIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksSoon afterwards the monks were making robes and they

asked himUdāyī why are you stretching the sitting mat on all sidesas if an old hideBecause Venerable Sir the sitting mat youve allowed for the monks is too smallSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a

banks of the river VaggumudāJust then Vajjī was short of food and afflicted with hunger with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw and it was not easy to get by on almsfoodThe monks considered the difficult circumstances and they thought How can we remain united and in harmony have a comfortable rainy season and get almsfood without troubleSome said We could do work for the householders and theyll give something in returnIn this way well be united and in harmony and well spend the rainy season in comfort and have no trouble getting almsfoodSome said Theres no need to do work for the householdersLets instead take messages for them and theyll give something in returnIn this way well be united and in harmony and well spend the rainy season in comfort and have no trouble getting almsfoodSome said Theres no need to do work for the householders nor to take messages for themLets instead praise one anothers superhuman qualities to the householdersSuch a monk has the first

has the three true insights and such the six direct knowledgesThen theyll give to usIn this way well be united and in harmony and well spend the rainy season in comfort and have no trouble getting almsfoodIndeed this is the better way that we praise one anothers superhuman qualities to the householdersThen they praised each others superhuman qualities to the householdersSuch a monk has the first absorption  such a monk has the six direct knowledgesAnd those people thought Were fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rainyseason residence Such monks as these who are virtuous and of good character have never before entered the rains residence with usAnd they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves or give to their parents to their wives and children to their slaves servants and workers to their friends and companions or to their relativesIn this way those monks became satisfied with a good color a bright face and clear skinNow it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainyseason residence to go and visit the BuddhaSo when they had competed the rains residence and the three months had elapsed those monks put their dwellings in order took their bowls and robes and left for VesālīWhen they eventually arrived at Vesālī they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great WoodThere they approached the Buddha bowed and sat downAt that time the monks who had completed the rains residence in that region were thin haggard and pale their veins protruding all over their limbsBut the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā were satisfied with a good color a bright face and clear skinSince it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monksthe Buddha said to themI hope youre keeping well monks I hope youre comfortableI hope you had a comfortable rains residence in concord and harmony without dispute and that you had no trouble getting almsfoodWere keeping well Venerable Sir were comfortablewe had a comfortable rains residence in concord and harmony without dispute and we had no trouble getting almsfoodWhen Buddhas know what is going on sometimes they ask and sometimes notthey know the right time to ask and the right time not to askBuddhas ask when it is beneficial not when it is unbeneficialfor Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficialBuddhas question the monks for two reasons to give a teaching or to lay down a training ruleAnd the Buddha said to those monks In what way monks did you had a comfortable rains residence without having any trouble getting almsfoodAnd they told the Buddha what had happenedBut had you really achieved those superhuman qualitiesYes SirThe Buddha rebuked themMonks how can you for the sake of your stomachs praise one anothers superhuman
