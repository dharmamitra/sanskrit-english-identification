If it is less than six days and he perceives it as less there is no offense

if he is insane
if he is the first offender
The ninth rule the training rule on what is risky is finished
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on relinquishment
The training rule on hastecloth
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time a government official who was going away sent a message to the monks
Come Venerables I wish to give a robe to those who have completed the rainyseason residence
The Buddha has allowed such robes only for those who have completed the rains residence
and being afraid of wrongdoing they did not go
That government official complained and criticized them
How can you not come when I send a message
Im going out with the army
Its hard to know whether Ill live or die
The monks heard the complaints of that government official
and they told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks I allow you to receive hastecloth and then store it
Knowing that the Buddha had made this allowance
monks received hastecloth and stored them beyond the robe season
in bundles on a bamboo roberack
While walking about the dwellings Venerable nanda saw that cloth and he asked the monks
Whose cloth is this
Its our hastecloth
How long have you stored it
They told him
and nanda then complained and criticized them
How can these monks receive hastecloth and then store it beyond the robe season
After rebuking those monks in many ways nanda told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that some monks do this
Its true Sir
The Buddha criticized them
 Monks how can those foolish men receive hastecloth and then store it beyond the robe season
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
When there are ten days left to the Kattika full moon that ends the first rainyseason residence and hastecloth is given to a monk he may receive it if he regards it as urgent He may then store it until the end of the robe season
If he stores it beyond that he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
There are ten days left
the invitation procedure is ten days in the future
The Kattika full moon that ends the first rainyseason residence
the Kattika full moon of the invitation procedure is what is meant
Hastecloth
when someone wants to go out with the army when someone wants to go away when someone is sick when someone is pregnant when someone without faith acquires faith when someone without confidence acquires confidenceif that person sends a message to the monks saying Come Venerables I wish to give a robe to those who have completed the rainyseason residence this is called hastecloth
He may receive it if he regards it as urgent He may then store it until the end of the robe season
establishing the perception of it as a hastecloth he may store it
The robe season
for one who has not participated in the robemaking procedure it is the last month of the rainy season
for one who has participated in the robemaking procedure it is the five month period
If he stores it beyond that
for one who has not participated in the robemaking procedure if he goes beyond the last day of the rainy season he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
For one who has participated in the robemaking procedure if he goes beyond the day on which the robemaking season ends the cloth becomes subject to relinquishment
The cloth should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individual
And monks it should be relinquished like this
Venerables this hastecloth which I have kept beyond the robe season is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the Sangha 
the Sangha should give 
you should give 
I give this cloth back to you
If it is hastecloth and he perceives it as such and he keeps it beyond the robe season he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it is hastecloth but he is unsure of it and he keeps it beyond the robe season he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it is hastecloth but he does not perceives it as such and he keeps it beyond the robe season he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it has not been determined but he perceives that it has 
If it has not been transferred but he perceives that it has 
If it has not been given away but he perceives that it has 
If it has not been lost but he perceives that it has 
If it has not been destroyed but he perceives that it has 
If it has not been burnt but he perceives that it has 
If it has not been stolen but he perceives that it has and he keeps it beyond the robe season he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he uses a cloth which should be relinquished without first relinquishing it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is not hastecloth but he perceives it as such he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is not hastecloth but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is not hastecloth and he does not perceive it as such there is no offense
if within the robe season the hastecloth is determined transferred to another given away lost destroyed burnt stolen or taken on trust
if he is insane
if he is the first offender
The eighth rule the training rule on hastecloth is finished
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on relinquishment
The subchapter on silk
The training rule on six years
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time monks were having blankets made every year
They kept on begging and asking
Give wool
we need wool
People complained and criticized them
How can the Sakyan ascetics have blankets made every year begging and asking
Give wool we need wool
We only make blankets for ourselves every five or six years even though our children defecate and urinate on them and they are eaten by rats
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks
How can those monks act like this
After rebuking those monks in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that some monks are acting like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha criticized them
How can those foolish men have blankets made every year begging and asking
Give wool we need wool
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk has had a new blanket made he should keep it for six years
Whether that blanket has been given away or not if he has another new blanket made in less than six years he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
At one time a certain monk at Kosambī was sick
His relatives sent him a message
Come Venerable well nurse you
Other monks
urged him to go
but he said
The Buddha has laid down a training rule
that a monk who has had a new blanket made must keep it for six years
Because Im sick Im not able to take my blanket when I travel
And because Im not comfortable without it
I cant go
They told the Buddha
Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks I allow you to give a blanketpermission to a sick monk
And it should be given like this
After approaching the Sangha the sick monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks He should then squat on his heels raise his joined palms and say
Venerables Im sick
Im not able to take my blanket when I travel
I ask the Sangha for a blanketpermission
And he should ask a second
and a third time
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The monk soandso is sick He is not able to take his blanket when he travels
He is asking the Sangha for a blanketpermission
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should give a blanketpermission to monk soandso
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The monk soandso is sick He is not able to take his blanket when he travels
He is asking the Sangha for a blanketpermission
The Sangha gives a blanketpermission to monk soandso
Any monk who approves of giving a blanketpermission to monk soandso should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has given a blanketpermission to monk soandso
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent
I will remember it thus
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk has had a new blanket made he should keep it for six years
Whether that blanket has been given away or not if he has another new blanket made in less than six years except if the monks have agreed he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
newly made is what is meant
A blanket
it is made by strewing not by weaving
Has had made
has made or has had made
He should keep it for six years
he should keep it for a minimum of six years
In less than six years
fewer than six years
That blanket has been given away
it has been given to others
it has not been given to anyone
except if the monks have agreed
If he makes another new blanket or has one made unless the monks have agreed then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct
When he gets the blanket it becomes subject to relinquishment
The blanket should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individual
And monks it should be relinquished like this
Venerables this blanket which I had made after less than six years without the agreement of the monks is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the Sangha 
the Sangha should give 
you should give 
I give this blanket back to you
If he finishes what he began himself he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he gets others to finish what he began himself he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he finishes himself what was begun by others he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he gets others to finish what was begun by others he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
if he makes one after six years
if he makes one after more than six years
if he makes one or has one made for the sake of another
if he obtains what was made by another and then uses it
if he makes a canopy a floor cover a cloth screen a mattress or a pillow
if he has the permission of the monks
if he is insane
if he is the first offender

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time a certain man said to his wife
Ill give a robe to Venerable Upananda
An almscollecting monk heard that man making that statement
He then went to Upananda the Sakyan and said
Upananda you have much merit
In suchandsuch a place I heard a man telling his wife
that hell give you a robe
Hes my supporter
Upananda then went to that man and said
Is it true that you desire to give me a robe
thats just what I was thinking
If thats the case give me suchandsuch a robe
For whats the point of giving a robe that I wont use
That man complained and criticized him
These Sakyan ascetics have great desires they are not content
Its no easy matter to give them a robe
How can Venerable Upananda come to me and specify the kind of robe he wants without first being invited by me
The monks heard the complaints of that man
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How can Venerable Upananda approach a householder and specify the kind of robe he wants without first being invited
After rebuking him in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda
Is it true Upananda that you acted like this
Its true Sir
Is he a relative of yours
Foolish man people who are not related dont know whats appropriate and whats inappropriate in dealing with each other whats right and whats wrong
And still you went to an unrelated householder and specified the kind of robe you wanted without first being invited
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a male or female householder has set aside a robe fund for an unrelated monk thinking
With this robe fund I will buy a robe and give it to monk soandso
and if that monk without first being invited approaches them and specifies the kind of robe he wants saying
It would be good if you would use this robe fund to buy suchandsuch a robe and then give it to me
and he does so because he wants something nice he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
For a monk
for the benefit of a monk making a monk the object of consideration one desires to give to him
Unrelated
anyone who is not a descendant of ones male ancestors going back seven generations either on the mothers side or on the fathers side
A male householder
any man who lives at home
A female householder
any woman who lives at home
A robe fund
money gold a pearl a gem a coral a crystal cloth thread or cotton wool
With this robe fund
with that which is at ones disposal
I will buy
having swapped
I will give
If that monk
the monk for whom the robe fund has been set aside
Without first being invited
he or she has not said beforehand Venerable what kind of robe do you need What kind of robe can I buy for you
Approaches them
having gone to their house or having gone wherever
Specifies the kind of robe he wants
please make it long or wide or closely woven or soft
This robe fund
that which is at ones disposal
Suchandsuch
long or wide or closely woven or soft
having swapped
Because he wants something nice
wanting something nice wanting something expensive
If that lay person buys a robe that is long wide closely woven or soft because of the monks statement then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct
When he gets the robe it becomes subject to relinquishment
The robe should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individual
And monks it should be relinquished like this
Venerables this robe which I received after approaching an unrelated householder and specifying the kind of robe I wanted without first being invited is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the Sangha 
the Sangha should give 
you should give 
I give this robe back to you
If the householder is unrelated and the monk perceives them as such and without first being invited he approaches them and specifies the kind of robe he wants he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If the householder is unrelated but the monk is unsure of it and without first being invited he approaches them and specifies the kind of robe he wants he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If the householder is unrelated but the monk perceives them as related and without first being invited he approaches them and specifies the kind of robe he wants he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If the lay person is related but the monk perceives them as unrelated commits an offense of wrong conduct
If the lay person is related but the monk is unsure of it commits an offense of wrong conduct
If the lay person is related and the monk perceives them as such there is no offense
if it is from those who have given an invitation
if it is for the benefit of another
if it is by means of his own property
if the lay person wishes to buy something expensive but the monk gets them to buy something inexpensive
if he is insane
if he is the first offender

The training rule on receiving robecloth
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuary
At that time the nun Uppalavaṇṇā was staying at Sāvatthī
One morning she robed up took her bowl and robe and entered Sāvatthī to collect almsfood
When she had finished her almsround and had eaten her meal she went to the Blind Mens Grove
where she sat down at the foot of a tree for the days meditation
Just then some bandits had stolen a cow and slaughtered it and were taking the meat to the Blind Mens Grove
The head bandit saw Uppalavaṇṇā sitting at the foot of that tree
He thought
If my sons and brothers see this nun theyll harass her
and he took a different path
Soon afterwards when the meat was cooked he took some of the best meat tied it up in a palmleaf packet hung it from a tree not far from Uppalavaṇṇā and said
Whatever acetic or brahmin sees this gift please take it And he left
Uppalavaṇṇā had just emerged from stillness when she heard the head bandit making that statement
She took the meat and returned to her dwelling place
The following morning she prepared the meat and made it into a bundle with her upper robe She then rose into the air and appeared in the Bamboo Grove
When she arrived the Buddha had already entered a village to collect almsfood
but Venerable Udāyī had been left behind to look after the dwellings
Uppalavaṇṇā approached Udāyī and said
Venerable wheres the Buddha
He has entered the village to collect almsfood
Please give this meat to the Buddha
Youll please the Buddha with that meat
If you give me your sarong youll please me too
Its hard for women to get material support and this is one of my five robes
I dont have any other
I cant give it away
Sister just as a man giving an elephant might decorate its girth
so you giving meat to the Buddha should decorate me with your sarong
Being pressured by Udāyī Uppalavaṇṇā gave him her sarong and then returned to her dwelling place
The nuns who received Uppalavaṇṇās bowl and robe asked her
Venerable wheres your sarong
And she told them what had happened
The nuns complained and criticized Udāyī
How can Venerable Udāyī receive a robe from a nun Its hard for women to get material support
Those nuns told the monks
The monks of few desires complained and criticized Udāyī
How can Venerable Udāyī receive a robe from a nun
After rebuking him in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī
Is it true Udāyī that you did this
Its true Sir
Is she a relative of yours
Foolish man a man and a woman who are not related dont know whats appropriate and whats inappropriate in dealing with each other whats right and whats wrong
And still you received a robe directly from an unrelated nun
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk receives a robe directly from an unrelated nun he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Then being afraid of wrongdoing the monks did not receive robes from nuns even in exchange
The nuns complained and criticized them
How can they not receive robes from us in exchange
The monks heard the criticism of those nuns
and they told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks if it is part of an exchange I allow you to receive things from five sources from monks from nuns from trainee nuns from novice monks and from novice nuns
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk receives a robe directly from an unrelated nun except if it is an exchange he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
Unrelated
anyone who is not a descendant of ones male ancestors going back seven generations either on the mothers side or on the fathers side
she has been given the full ordination by both Sanghas
one of the six kinds of robecloth but not smaller than what can be transferred to another
Except if it is an exchange
unless it is an exchange
If he accepts then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct
When he gets the robecloth it becomes subject to relinquishment
The robecloth should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individual
And monks it should be relinquished like this
Venerables this robecloth which I received without anything in exchange directly from an unrelated nun is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the Sangha 
the Sangha should give 
you should give 
I give this robecloth back to you
If she is unrelated and he perceives her as such and he receives robecloth from her except if it is an exchange he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If she is unrelated but he is unsure of it and he receives robecloth from her except if it is an exchange he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If she is unrelated but he perceives her as related and he receives robecloth from her except if it is an exchange he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he receives robecloth directly from a nun who is fully ordained only on one side except if it is an exchange he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If she is related but he perceives her as unrelated he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If she is related but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If she is related and he perceives her as such there is no offense
if much is exchanged with little or little is exchanged with much
if he takes it on trust
if he borrows it
if he receives any requisite apart from robecloth
if it is a trainee nun
if it is a novice nun
if he is insane

At one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery
At that time the monks from the group of six got nuns to wash dye and comb wool
Because of this work the nuns neglected recitation questioning the higher morality the higher mind and the higher wisdom
Mahāpajāpati Gotamī then approached the Buddha and bowed down to him
And the Buddha said to her Gotamī I hope the nuns are heedful energetic and diligent
How could the nuns be heedful Venerable Sir
And she told him what was happening
The Buddha then instructed inspired and gladdened her with a teaching
She bowed down circumambulated him with her right side toward him and left
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks from the group of six
Is it true monks that you do this
Its true Sir
Are they your relatives
Foolish men people who are not related dont know whats appropriate and whats inappropriate in dealing with each other whats inspiring behavior and whats not

The chapter on relinquishment
The long training rule on weavers
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time a man who was going away said to his wife Weigh some thread take it to the weavers have them weave robecloth and put the robecloth aside
When I return Ill give it to Venerable Upananda
An almscollecting monk heard that man speaking those words
He then went to Upananda the Sakyan and said Upananda you have much merit
In suchandsuch a place I heard a man as he was about to go away tell his wife to have robecloth woven so that he could give it to you when he returned
Hes my supporter
And the weaver was Upanandas supporter too
Upananda then went to that weaver and said
This robecloth that youre weaving for me make it long and wide
And make it closely woven wellwoven wellstretched wellscraped and wellcombed
Venerable theyve already weighed the thread and given it to me saying
Weave the robecloth with this thread
I wont be able to make it long wide or closely woven
But Im able to make it wellwoven wellstretched wellscraped and wellcombed
Just make it long wide and closely woven
There wont be any lack of thread
Then when all the thread had been used up that weaver went to that woman and said Madam I need more thread
But didnt I tell you to weave the robecloth with that thread
But Venerable Upananda told me to make it long wide and closely woven
And he said there wouldnt be any lack of thread
That woman then gave him as much thread again as she had done the first time
Soon Upananda heard that that man had returned from his travels and he went to his house and sat down on a prepared seat
That man approached him bowed and sat down
He then said to his wife Has the robecloth been woven
Yes it has
Please bring it Ill give it to Venerable Upananda
She then got the robecloth gave it to her husband and told him what had happened
After giving the robecloth to Upananda he complained and criticized him
These Sakyan ascetics have great desires theyre not content
Its no easy matter to give them robecloth
How could Venerable Upananda go to the weavers and specify the kind of robecloth he wanted without first being invited by me
The monks heard the complaints of that man
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda
How can Venerable Upananda go to a householders weavers and specify the kind of robecloth he wants without first being invited
After rebuking him in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda
Is it true Upananda that you did this
Its true Sir
Is he a relative of yours
No Sir
Foolish man people who are not related dont know whats appropriate and whats inappropriate in dealing with each other whats right and whats wrong
And still you went to the weavers of an unrelated householder and specified the kind of robecloth you wanted without first being invited
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a male or female householder is having robecloth woven by weavers for an unrelated monk and without first being invited that monk goes to those weavers and specifies the kind of robecloth he wants saying
This robecloth that you are weaving for me make it long and wide make it closely woven wellwoven wellstretched wellscraped and wellcombed
and perhaps I will even give you a small gift
then in saying that and afterwards giving them a small gift even if it is only a bit of almsfood he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
For a monk
for the benefit of a monk making a monk the object he wishes to give to the monk
Unrelated

without it first being said Venerable what kind of robecloth do you need What kind of robecloth should I get woven for you
Goes to those weavers
having gone to their house or having gone wherever
Specifies the kind of robecloth he wants
This robecloth that you are weaving for me make it long and wide
make it closely woven wellwoven wellstretched wellscraped and wellcombed
and perhaps I will even give you a small gift
Then in saying that and afterwards giving them a small gift even if it is only a bit of almsfood
rice porridge a meal nonstaple food a bit of bath powder a toothbrush a piece of string and even if he gives a teaching
If the weaver makes it long or wide or closely woven because of the monks statement then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct
When he gets the robecloth it becomes subject to relinquishment
The robecloth should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individual
And monks it should be relinquished like this
Venerables this robecloth for which I went to the weavers of an unrelated householder and specified the kind of robecloth I wanted without first being invited is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the Sangha 
the Sangha should give

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on relinquishment
The subchapter on silk
The training rule on money
The man of the house approached Upananda bowed sat down and said
How can Venerable Upananda receive money
Whenever that family obtained food they put aside a portion for Upananda
And thats what they did when one evening they obtained some meat
The following morning one of their children got up early and cried Give me meat
The man said to his wife Give the venerables portion to the child
Well buy something else for the venerable
On the same morning Upananda robed up took his bowl and robe and went to that family where he sat down on the prepared seat
Yesterday evening Venerable we obtained some meat and we put aside a portion for you
But then in the morning our child got up early and cried Give me meat and we gave your portion to the child
What can we get you for a kahāpaṇa
Are you giving up a kahāpaṇa coin for me
Then just give me that kahāpaṇa
After giving a kahāpaṇa to Upananda that man complained and criticized him Just as we accept money so do the Sakyan ascetics
The monks heard the complaints of that man
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him
After rebuking him in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda
Is it true Upananda that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you receive money
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk takes gets someone else to take or consents to gold and silver being deposited for him he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
the color of the Teacher is what is meant
a kahāpaṇa coin a copper māsaka coin a wooden māsaka coin a resin māsaka coin whatever is used in commerce
if he takes it himself he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
Gets someone else to take
if he gets another to take it he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
Consents to  being deposited for him
if someone says This is for you and he consents to it being deposited for him it becomes subject to relinquishment
It should be relinquished in the midst of the Sangha
And monks it should be relinquished like this
After approaching the Sangha that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks He should then squat on his heels raise his joined palms and say
Venerables I have received money
It is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the Sangha
After relinquishing it he is to confess the offense
The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk
If a monastery worker or a lay follower is available you should tell him
Look into this
If he says
What can I get you with this
you should not say
Get this or that
you should point out what is allowable
ghee oil honey or syrup
If he makes a purchase and brings back what is allowable everyone may enjoy it except the one who received the money
If this is what happens all is well
If not you should tell him
Discard this
If he discards it all is well
If he does not a monk who has five qualities should be appointed as the money discarder
one who is not swayed by desire ill will confusion or fear and who knows what has and has not been discarded
And monks this is how he should be appointed
First the monk should be asked
and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha it should appoint monk soandso as the money discarder
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The Sangha appoints monk soandso as the money discarder
Any monk who agrees to appointing monk soandso as the money discarder should remain silent
Any monk who doesnt agree should speak up
The Sangha has appointed monk soandso as the money discarder
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent
I will remember it thus
The appointed monk should drop it without taking note of the location
If he takes note of where he drops it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is money and he perceives it as such and he receives it he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it is money but he is unsure of it and he receives it he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it is money but he does not perceive it as such and he receives it he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it is not money but he perceives it as such he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is not money but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is not money and he does not perceive it as such there is no offense
if within a monastery or a house he takes it or gets someone to take it and then puts it aside with the thought
Whoever this belongs to will fetch it
if he is insane
if he is the first offender

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time Venerable Udāyīs former wife had become a nun
She frequently visited Udāyī
and he frequently visited her
And Udāyī shared his meals with that nun
One morning Udāyī robed up took his bowl and robe and went to her He then uncovered his genitals in front of her and sat down on a seat
She too uncovered her genitals in front of him and sat down on a seat
Udāyī lustfully stared at her genitals and he emitted semen
He then said to that nun
Sister get some water Ill wash the robe
Give it to me Venerable Ill wash it
She then took some of the semen in her mouth and inserted some into her genitals
Because of that she became pregnant
The nuns said
This nun isnt abstaining from sexuality shes pregnant
She said Venerables I do abstain from sexuality and she told them what had happened
The nuns complained and criticized Udāyī
How can Venerable Udāyī have a nun wash a used robe
They then told the monks
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him

The training rule on wool
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time a certain monk who was walking through the Kosalan country on his way to Sāvatthī was given some wool
He bound it into a bundle with his upper robe and went on
People who saw him teased him
Venerable how much did this cost you
How much will the profit be
As a result he was humiliated
When he arrived at Sāvatthī he threw the wool to the ground
The monks asked him why
People have been teasing me because of this wool
But how far have you carried it
More than  kilometers
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How can a monk carry wool more than  kilometers
After rebuking that monk in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monk that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you carry wool more than  kilometers
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If wool is given to a monk who is traveling he may receive it if he wishes
If he receives it and there is no one else to carry it he may carry it himself for at most  kilometers
If he carries it further than that even if there is no one else to carry it he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
To a monk who is traveling
one walking on a road
If wool is given
if it is given by the Sangha by a group by a relative by a friend or if it is discarded wool or if it is by means of his own property
If he wishes
if he desires he may receive it
If he receives it he may carry it himself for at most  kilometers
he may carry it himself no further than  kilometers
There is no one else to carry it
there is no other person who can carry it either a woman or a man either a lay person or a monastic
If he carries it further than that even if there is no one else to carry it
when he goes beyond  kilometers with the first foot he commits an offense of wrong conduct
When he goes beyond with the second foot he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he stands within the  kilometer limit but drops it beyond the  kilometer limit he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he places it in the vehicle or among the goods of another without their knowledge and it goes more than  kilometers it becomes subject to relinquishment
The wool should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individual
And monks it should be relinquished like this 
Venerables this wool which I have taken more than  kilometers is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the Sangha 
the Sangha should give 
you should give 
I give this wool back to you
If he takes it more than  kilometers and he perceives it as more he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he takes it more than  kilometers but he is unsure of it he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he takes it more than  kilometers but he perceives it as less he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he takes it less than  kilometers but he perceives it as more he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he takes it less than  kilometers but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he takes it less than  kilometers and he perceives it as less there is no offense
if he carries it  kilometers
if he carries it less than  kilometers
if he carries it  kilometers and then carries it back
if he takes it  kilometers with the intention of staying there but then takes it further
if he gets back what had been taken from him and then carries it on
if he gets back what he had given up and then carries it on
if he gets someone else to carry it
if it is a finished article
if he is insane
if he is the first offender

The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on relinquishment
The subchapter on robes
The training rule on kings
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time a government official who was a supporter of Venerable Upananda the Sakyan sent a robe fund to Upananda by messenger saying
Buy a robe with this fund and give it to Venerable Upananda
The messenger went to Upananda and said
Venerable Ive brought a robe fund for you
Please accept it
We dont receive robe funds but we do receive allowable robes at the right time
Is there anyone who provides services for you
Just then a lay follower had come to the monastery on some business
Upananda told the messenger
This lay follower provides services for the monks
The messenger instructed that lay follower and then returned to Upananda and said
Ive instructed the lay follower you pointed out to me
Please approach him at the right time and hell give you a robe
Later on that government official sent a message to Upananda saying
Please use the robe we wish you to use the robe
But Upananda did not say anything to that lay follower
The government official sent the same message a second time
but again Upananda did nothing
The government official then sent the message a third time
On that occasion the householder association was having a meeting
They had made an agreement that whoever came late would be fined fifty coins
Just then Upananda went to that lay follower and said
I need a robe
Venerable please wait one day for today theres a meeting of the householder association
They have made an agreement that whoever comes late gets fined fifty coins
Saying Give me the robe today he grabbed him by the belt
Being pressured by Upananda the lay follower bought him a robe and as a consequence he was late for the meeting
People asked him
Sir why are you late Youve just lost fifty coins
That lay follower told them what had happened
And they complained and criticized him
These Sakyan ascetics have great desires they are not content
Even to provide them with a service isnt easy
How can Venerable Upananda not agree when hes asked by a lay follower
to wait for a day
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How can Venerable Upananda not agree when asked by a lay follower
to wait for a day
After rebuking him in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda
Is it true Upananda
that you acted like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you not agree when asked by a lay follower
to wait for a day
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a king a kings employee a brahmin or a householder sends a robe fund for a monk by messenger saying
Buy a robe with this robe fund and give it to monk soandso
and the messenger goes to that monk and says
Venerable I have brought a robe fund for you please accept it
then that monk should reply
We dont receive robe funds but we do receive allowable robes at the right time
If that messenger says
Is there anyone who provides services for you
the monk if he needs a robe should point out a monastery worker or a lay follower and say
They provide services for the monks
If the messenger instructs that serviceprovider and then returns to the monk and says
Venerable I have instructed the serviceprovider you pointed out please approach them at the right time and they will give you a robe
then if that monk needs a robe he should approach that serviceprovider and prompt them and remind them two or three times saying
I need a robe
If he then gets a robe all is well
If he does not get it he should stand in silence for it at most six times
If he then gets a robe all is well
If he makes any further effort and then gets a robe he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he does not get a robe he should go to the owners of that robe fund or send a message
That monk hasnt received any benefit from the robe fund you sent for him
Please take action over whats yours so that it doesnt get lost
This is the proper procedure
For a monk
for the benefit of a monk making a monk the object of consideration one desires to give to him
whoever rules
A kings employee
whoever gets food and wages from a king
A brahmin
a brahmin by birth
A householder
anyone apart from a king a kings employee and a brahmin
A robe fund
money gold a pearl or a gem
With this robe fund
with that which is at ones disposal
having swapped
And the messenger goes to that monk and says
Venerable I have brought a robe fund for you please accept it
then that monk should reply
We dont receive robe funds but we do receive allowable robes at the right time
If that messenger says
Is there anyone who provides services for you
the monk if he needs a robe should point out a monastery worker or a lay follower and say
They provide services for the monks
he should not say Give it to them Theyll put it aside Theyll do the swap Theyll buy it
If the messenger instructs that serviceprovider and then returns to the monk and says
Venerable I have instructed the serviceprovider you pointed out please approach them at the right time and theyll give you a robe
then if that monk needs a robe he should approach that serviceprovider and prompt them and remind them two or three times saying
I need a robe
he should not say Give me a robe Get me a robe Swap me a robe Buy me a robe
He should say it a second
and a third time
If he gets it all is well
If he does not get it he should go there and stand in silence for it
He should not sit down on a seat
He should not accept food
He should not give a teaching
If he is asked Why have you come he should say Think about it
If he sits down on a seat or he accepts food or he gives a teaching he loses one allowance to stand
He should stand a second
and a third time
If he prompts four times he can stand four times
If he prompts five times he can stand twice
If he prompts six times he cannot stand at all
If he makes any further effort and the robe then appears
then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct
When he gets the robe it becomes subject to relinquishment
The robe should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individual
And monks it should be relinquished like this 
Venerables this robe which I got after prompting more than three times and standing more than six times is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the Sangha 
the Sangha should give 
you should give 
I give this robe back to you
If he does not get a robe he should go to the owner of that robe fund or send a message
That monk hasnt received any benefit from the robe fund you sent for him
Please take action over whats yours so that it doesnt get lost
This is the proper procedure
this is the right method
If he prompts more than three times and stands more than six times and he perceives it as more and he gets a robe he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he prompts more than three times and stands more than six times but he is unsure of it and he gets a robe he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he prompts more than three times and stands more than six times but he perceives it as less and he gets a robe he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he prompts less than three times and stands less than six times but he perceives it as more he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he prompts less than three times and stands less than six times but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he prompts less than three times and stands less than six times and he perceives it as less there is no offense
if he prompts three times and stands six times
if he prompts less than three times and stands less than six times
if it is given without prompting
if the owners prompt and then it is given
if he is insane
if he is the first offender

The second training rule on what is set aside
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time a certain man said to another man
Ill give a robe to Venerable Upananda
And he replied
I too will give a robe to Venerable Upananda
An almscollecting monk heard that conversation
He then went to Upananda the Sakyan and said
Upananda you have much merit
In suchandsuch a place I heard two men telling each other
that they will each give you a robe
They are my supporters
Upananda then went to those men and said
Is it true that you both desire to give me a robe
thats just what we were thinking
If thats the case then give me suchandsuch a robe
For whats the point of giving robes that I wont use
Those men complained and criticized him
These Sakyan ascetics have great desires they are not content
Its no easy matter to give them robes
How can Venerable Upananda approach us and specify the kind of robe he wants without first being invited
The monks heard the complaints of those men
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How can Venerable Upananda approach householders and make a suggestion about a robe without first being invited
After rebuking him in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda
Is it true Upananda that you acted like this
Its true Sir
Are they relatives of yours
Foolish man people who are not related dont know whats appropriate and whats inappropriate in dealing with each other whats right and whats wrong
And still you approached unrelated householders and specified the kind of robe you wanted without first being invited
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If two male or female householders have set aside separate robe funds for an unrelated monk thinking
With these separate robe funds well buy separate robes and give them to monk soandso
and if that monk without first being invited approaches them and specifies the kind of robe he wants saying
It would be good if you would put these separate robe funds together to buy suchandsuch a robe and then give it to me
and he does so because he wants something nice he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
For a monk
for the benefit of a monk making a monk the object of consideration they desire to give to him
Unrelated
anyone who is not a descendant of ones male ancestors going back seven generations either on the mothers side or on the fathers side
Male householders
any men who live at home
Female householders
any women who live at home
Robe funds
money gold pearls gems corals crystals cloth thread or cotton wool
With these separate robe funds
with that which is at their disposal
Well buy
having swapped
Well give
If that monk
the monk for whom the robe funds have been set aside
Without first being invited
they have not said beforehand Venerable what kind of robe do you need What kind of robe can we buy for you
Approaches them
having gone to their house or having gone wherever
Specifies the kind of robe he wants
please make it long or wide or closely woven or soft
These separate robe funds
that which is at their disposal
Suchandsuch
long or wide or closely woven or soft
having swapped
Put together
two people supplying him with one robe
Because he wants something nice
wanting something nice wanting something expensive
If those householders buy a robe that is long wide closely woven or soft because of his statement then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct
When he gets the robe it becomes subject to relinquishment
The robe should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individual
And monks it should be relinquished like this
Venerables this robe which I received after approaching unrelated householders and specifying the kind of robe I wanted without first being invited is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the Sangha 
the Sangha should give 
you should give 
I give this robe back to you
If the householders are unrelated and he perceives them as such and without first being invited he approaches them and specifies the kind of robe he wants he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If the householders are unrelated but he is unsure of it and without first being invited he approaches them and specifies the kind of robe he wants he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If the householders are unrelated but he perceives them as related and without first being invited he approaches them and specifies the kind of robe he wants he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If the householders are related but he perceives them as unrelated commits an offense of wrong conduct
If the householders are related but he is unsure of it commits an offense of wrong conduct
If the householders are related and he perceives them as such there is no offense
if it is from those who have given an invitation
if it is for the benefit of another
if it is by means of his own property
if the householders wish to buy something expensive but he gets them to buy something inexpensive
if he is insane
if he is the first offender

The chapter on relinquishment
The training rule on almsbowls
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time the monks from the group of six were storing many almsbowls
When people walking about dwellings saw this they complained and criticized them
How can the Sakyan ascetics store many bowls
Will they start up as bowl merchants or set up a bowl shop
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks
How can the monks from the group of six keep extra bowls
After rebuking those monks in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that you do this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you keep extra bowls
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk keeps an extra almsbowl he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Soon afterwards a bowl was given to Venerable nanda
but he wished to give it to Venerable Sāriputta
who was staying at Sāketa
Knowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against keeping an extra bowl
Venerable nanda thought What should I do in this situation
He told the Buddha who said
How long is it nanda before Sāriputta returns
Nine or ten days Venerable Sir
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks you should keep an extra almsbowl for ten days at the most
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
A monk should keep an extra almsbowl for ten days at the most
If he keeps it beyond that he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
For ten days at the most
it should be kept for ten days at a maximum
An extra almsbowl
a bowl that is not determined nor transferred to another
there are two kinds of bowl the iron bowl and the clay bowl
And there are three grades of bowl the large bowl the medium bowl and the small bowl
The large bowl it takes half an āḷhaka measure of rice a fourth part of nonstaple food and a suitable amount of curry
The medium bowl it takes a nāḷika measure of rice a fourth part of nonstaple food and a suitable amount of curry
The small bowl it takes a pattha measure of rice a fourth part of nonstaple food and a suitable amount of curry
Anything larger than this is not a bowl nor anything smaller
If he keeps it beyond that it becomes subject to relinquishment
it becomes subject to relinquishment at dawn on the eleventh day
The bowl should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individual
And monks it should be relinquished like this
After approaching the Sangha that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks He should then squat on his heels raise his joined palms and say
Venerables this almsbowl that I have kept over ten days is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the Sangha
After relinquishing it he should confess the offense
The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk
The relinquished bowl is then to be given back
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
This almsbowl that was to be relinquished by monk soandso has been relinquished to the Sangha
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should give this bowl back to monk soandso
After approaching several monks that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks He should then squat on his heels raise his joined palms and say
Venerables this almsbowl that I have kept over ten days is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the venerables
After relinquishing it he should confess the offense
The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk
The relinquished bowl is then to be given back
Please I ask the venerables to listen to me
This almsbowl that was to be relinquished by monk soandso has been relinquished to you
If it seems appropriate to you you should give this bowl back to monk soandso
After approaching a single monk that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder squat on his heels raise his joined palms and say
This almsbowl that I have kept over ten days is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to you
After relinquishing it he should confess the offense
The confession should be received by that monk
The relinquished bowl is then to be given back
I give this almsbowl back to you
If it is more than ten days and he perceives it as more he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it is more than ten days but he is unsure of it he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it is more than ten days but he perceives it as less he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it has not been determined but he perceives that it has he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it has not been transferred but he perceives that it has he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it has not been given away but he perceives that it has he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it has not been lost but he perceives that it has he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it has not been destroyed but he perceives that it has he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it is not broken but he perceives that it has he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it has not been stolen but he perceives that it has he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If he uses a almsbowl that should be relinquished without first relinquishing it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is less than ten days but he perceives it as more he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is less than ten days but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is less than ten days and he perceives it as less there is no offense
if within ten days it is determined transferred to another given away lost destroyed broken stolen or taken on trust
if he is insane
if he is the first offender
At one time monks from the group six did not give back a relinquished bowl
They told the Buddha
Monks a relinquished alsmbowl should be given back
If you dont give it back you commit an offense of wrong conduct
The first rule the training rule on almsbowls is finished
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on relinquishment
The subchapter on robes
The training rule on more than that
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time the monks from the group of six said this to the monks whose robes had been stolen
The Buddha has allowed
a monk whose robes have been stolen or destroyed to ask an unrelated householder for a robe
You should ask for a robe
Its not necessary weve already obtained a robe
Well ask for you
Do as you please
Then the monks from the group of six went to householders and said
Monks have arrived whose robes have been stolen
Give robes for them
And they asked for many robes
Soon afterwards in the public meeting hall a man said to another
Sir monks have arrived whose robes have been stolen
Ive given them robes
The other replied I too have given robes
And another said the same
They complained and criticized those monks
How can the Sakyan ascetics have no sense of moderation and ask for many robes
Will they start up as cloth merchants or set up shop
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks
How can the monks from the group of six not have any sense of moderation and ask for many robes
After rebuking those monks in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that you acted like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you not have any sense of moderation and ask for many robes
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If an unrelated male or female householder invites that monk to take many robes he should accept at most one sarong and one upper robe
If he accepts more than that he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
the monk whose robes have been stolen
Unrelated
anyone who is not a descendant of ones male ancestors going back seven generations either on the mothers side or on the fathers side
A male householder
any man who lives at home
A female householder
any woman who lives at home
Many robes
a lot of robes
Invites to take
saying Take as many as you like
He should accept at most one sarong and one upper robe
if three robes are destroyed he should accept two if two robes are destroyed he should accept one if one robe is destroyed he should not accept any
If he accepts more than that
if he asks for more than that then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct
When he gets the robe it becomes subject to relinquishment
The robe should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individual
And monks it should be relinquished like this
Venerables this robe which I received after asking an unrelated householder for too many is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the Sangha 
the Sangha should give 
you should give 
I give this robe back to you
If the person is unrelated and the monk perceives them as such and he asks them for too many robes he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If the person is unrelated but the monk is unsure of it and he asks them for too many robes he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If the person is unrelated but the monk perceives them as related and he asks them for too many robes he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If the person is related but the monk perceives them as unrelated commits an offense of wrong conduct
If the person is related but the monk is unsure of it commits an offense of wrong conduct
If the person is related and the monk perceives them as such there is no offense
if he takes too much but with the intention of returning the remainder
if they give saying The remainder is for you
if they give but not because his robes were stolen
if they give but not because his robes were destroyed
if it is from those who have given an invitation
if it is by means of his own property
if he is insane
if he is the first offender

At one time the Buddha was staying at ḷavī at the Aggāḷava Shrine
At that time the monks from the group of six approached some silkmakers and said
Boil many silkworms and give us silk
We wish to make blankets containing silk
The silkmakers complained and criticized them
How can the Sakyan ascetics approach us and say
such a thing
Its our misfortune that we must cause the death of many small creatures because of our livelihood and because of our wives and children
The monks heard the complaints of those silkmakers
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks
How can the monks from the group of six approach silkmakers and say

If a monk has a blanket made that contains silk he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
A blanket
it is made by strewing not by weaving
If he makes a blanket that contains even one thread of silk or he has one made then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct
When he gets the blanket it becomes subject to relinquishment
The blanket should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individual
And monks it should be relinquished like this
Venerables this blanket containing silk which I had made is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the Sangha 
the Sangha should give 
you should give 
I give this blanket back to you
If he finishes what he began himself he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession

The training rule on taking back robecloth
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan said to his brothers student
Come lets go wandering in the country
I cant go Venerable
my robes are worn
Ill give you a robe
And he gave him a robe
Soon afterwards that monk heard
that the Buddha was about to go wandering in the country
He thought
Now I wont go wandering with Venerable Upananda but with the Buddha
Then when Upananda said
Lets go
he replied Im not going with you but with the Buddha
Well the robe I gave you is going with me
and he just took it back in anger
That monk told other monks what had happened
And the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda
How can Venerable Upananda give away a robe and then take it back in anger
After rebuking him in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true Upananda that you acted like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you give a robe to a monk and then take it back in anger
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk himself gives a robe to a monk but then in anger takes it back or has it taken back he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
To a monk
to another monk
he himself has given it
one of the six kinds of robecloth but not smaller than what can be transferred to another
discontent having hatred hostile
Takes back
if he takes it back himself he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
Has taken back
if he asks another he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he only asks once then even if the other takes back many it becomes subject to relinquishment
The robecloth should be relinquished to a sangha a group or an individual
And monks it should be relinquished like this
Venerables this robecloth which I took back after giving it to a monk is to be relinquished I relinquish it to the Sangha 
the Sangha should give 
you should give 
I give this robecloth back to you
If the other monk is fully ordained and he perceives him as such and after giving him robecloth he takes it back in anger or has it taken back he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If the other monk is fully ordained but he is unsure of it and after giving him robecloth he takes it back in anger or has it taken back he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time when the monks from the group of six knew that the Buddha had prohibited having blankets made entirely of black wool they added just a little bit of white on the edge In this way they had blankets made entirely of black wool
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six act like this
After rebuking those monks in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that you did this

The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you add just a little bit of white on the edge and in this way have blankets made entirely of black wool
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk is having a new blanket made he should use two parts of entirely black wool a third part of white and a fourth part of brown
If he has a new blanket made without using two parts of entirely black wool a third part of white and a fourth part of brown he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
newly made is what is meant
A blanket
it is made by strewing not by weaving
Is having made

Various ways
what is shaped what is not shaped and what is both shaped and not shaped
what is meant for the head what is meant for the neck what is meant for the hands what is meant for the feet what is meant for the waist
What is not shaped
what is shaped in a lump is what is meant
What is both shaped and not shaped

a golden kahāpaṇa coin a copper māsaka coin a wooden māsaka coin a resin māsaka coin whatever is used in commerce

It should be relinquished in the midst of the Sangha
And monks it should be relinquished like this
After approaching the Sangha that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks He should then squat on his heels put raise his joined palms and say
Venerables I have traded with money in various ways
This is to be relinquished
I relinquish it to the Sangha
After relinquishing it he is to confess the offense
The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk
If a monastery worker or a lay follower is available you should tell him
Look into this
If he says
What can I get you with this
you should not say
Get this or that
you should point out what is allowable
ghee oil honey or syrup
If he makes a purchase and brings back what is allowable everyone may enjoy it except the one who did the exchange into money
If this is what happens all is well
If not you should tell him
Discard this
If he discards it all is well
If he does not a monk who has five qualities should be appointed as the money discarder
one who is not swayed by desire ill will confusion or fear and who knows what has and has not been discarded
And monks this is how he should be appointed
First the monk should be asked
and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha it should appoint monk soandso as the money discarder
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The Sangha appoints monk soandso as the money discarder
Any monk who agrees to appointing monk soandso as the money discarder should remain silent
Any monk who doesnt agree should speak up
The Sangha has appointed monk soandso as the money discarder
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent
I will remember it thus
The appointed monk should drop it without taking note of the location
If he takes note of where he drops it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is money and he perceives it as such and he exchanges it into money he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it is money but he is unsure of it and he exchanges it into money he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession
If it is money but he does not perceive it as such and he exchanges it into money he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession

The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing expulsion
The third training rule on expulsion
At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood
At that time the Buddha spoke to the monks in many ways about unattractivenesshe spoke in praise of unattractiveness in praise of developing the mind in unattractiveness and in praise of the attainment of unattractiveness
The Buddha then addressed the monks
Monks I wish to go into solitary retreat for half a month
Noone is to approach me except the one who brings me almsfood
Yes Venerable Sir they replied and noone approached him except the one who brought him almsfood
The monks thought The Buddha has talked in many ways about unattractiveness
and they devoted themselves to the development of the mind in unattractiveness in its many different facets
As a consequence they became troubled by their own bodies ashamed of them disgusted with them
Just as a young woman or mansomeone fond of adornments who had just washed her hairwould be ashamed humiliated and disgusted if the carcase of a snake a dog or a man were hung around her neck
just so those monks were troubled by their own bodies
They took their own lives took the lives of one another
and they approached Migalaṇḍika the ascetic lookalike and said
Please kill us
This bowl and these robe will be yours
And hired for a bowl and robes Migalaṇḍika killed a number of monks He took his bloodstained knife to the river Vaggumudā
and while he was washing it he became anxious and remorseful
This is truly bad for me
Ive made much demerit by killing virtuous monks
Then walking across the water a god from the realm of the lord of death said to Migalaṇḍika
Well done superior man youre truly fortunate
Youve made much merit because youve brought across those who hadnt yet crossed
And Migalaṇḍika thought
So it seems that Im fortunate that Ive made much merit
He then went from dwelling to dwelling from precincts to precincts and said
Who hasnt crossed yet Whom do I bring across
The monks who still had sensual desire became fearful and terrified with their hair standing on end
Only those who were free from desires were unaffected
Then on a single day Migalaṇḍika killed one monk two monks three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty even sixty monks
At the end of that halfmonth the Buddha came out of seclusion and said to Venerable nanda
nanda why is the Sangha of monks so diminished
nanda told him what had happened
adding Venerable Sir please give another instruction so that the Sangha of monks may become established in perfect insight
Well then nanda bring together in the assembly hall all those monks who live supported by Vesālī
When he had done so he approached the Buddha and said
Sir the Sangha of monks is gathered
Please do as you think is appropriate
The Buddha then went to the assembly hall sat down on the prepared seat and addressed the monks
Monks when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it is peaceful and sublime a satisfying state of bliss And it stops and settles bad unwholesome qualities on the spot whenever they arise
Just as a great unseasonal storm in the last month of the hot season stops and settles the dust and dirt in the air
just so when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it is peaceful and sublime and it stops and settles bad unwholesome qualities on the spot whenever they arise
And how is stillness by mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated like this
A monk sits down in the wilderness at the foot of a tree or in an empty hut He crosses his legs straightens his body and establishes mindfulness in front of him
Simply mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
When he breathes in long he knows it and when he breathes out long he knows that
When he breathes in short he knows it and when he breathes out short he knows that
When breathing in he trains in having the full experience of the breath when breathing out he trains in having the full experience of the breath
When breathing in he trains in calming the activity of the body when breathing out he trains in calming the activity of the body
When breathing in he trains in experiencing joy when breathing out he trains in experiencing joy
When breathing in he trains in experiencing bliss when breathing out he trains in experiencing bliss
When breathing in he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind when breathing out he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind
When breathing in he trains in calming the activity of the mind when breathing out he trains in calming the activity of the mind
When breathing in he trains in experiencing the mind when breathing out he trains in experiencing the mind
When breathing in he trains in gladdening the mind when breathing out he trains in gladdening the mind
When breathing in he trains in stilling the mind when breathing out he trains in stilling the mind
When breathing in he trains in freeing the mind when breathing out he trains in freeing the mind
When breathing in he trains in contemplating impermanence when breathing out he trains in contemplating impermanence
When breathing in he trains in contemplating fading away when breathing out he trains in contemplating fading away
When breathing in he trains in contemplating ending when breathing out he trains in contemplating ending
When breathing in he trains in contemplating relinquishment when breathing out he trains in contemplating relinquishment
Monks when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated like this it is peaceful and sublime a satisfying state of bliss and it stops and settles bad unwholesome qualities on the spot whenever they arise
The Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that some monks have taken their own lives have killed one another and have said to Migalaṇḍika
Please kill us this bowl and these robes will be yours
Its true Sir
The Buddha criticized them
Monks its not suitable for these monks its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable it should not be done
How could those monks take their own lives kill one another and say to Migalaṇḍika
Please kill us this bowl and these robes will be yours
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk intentionally kills a human being or seeks an instrument of death for him
he too is expelled and excluded from the community
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
At one time a lay follower was ill
He had a beautiful and pleasant wife
and the monks from the group of six had fallen in love with her
They said to each other
If this lay follower lives we wont get this woman
Come lets praise death to him
They then went to that lay follower and said
Youve done whats good and wholesome youve made a shelter against fear You havent done anything bad you havent been greedy or immoral
Whats the point of this miserable and difficult life
Death is better for you than life
When you have passed away youll be reborn in a happy place in heaven
There youll be able to enjoy the pleasures of heaven
That lay follower thought
The venerables have spoken the truth
for Ive done whats good and avoided whats bad
and after death Ill be reborn in a happy place
From then on he ate various kinds of detrimental food and drank detrimental drinks
and as a consequence he became seriously ill
But his wife complained and criticized those monks
These Sakyan ascetics are shameless and immoral liars
They claim to live according to the Truth to be celibate and of good conduct to be truthful moral and of good character
But they dont have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmin
theyve lost the plot
They praised death to my husband
and because of them my husband has died
And other people complained and criticized them in the same way
The monks heard the criticism of those people
Those monks who had few desires and a sense of conscience who were contented afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training complained and criticized those monks
How could they praise death to that lay follower
After criticizing those monks in many ways they told the Buddha 
Is it true monks that you praised death to that lay follower
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
Foolish men its not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable it should not be done
How could you praise death to that lay follower
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk intentionally kills a human being or seeks an instrument of death for him or praises death or incites someone to die saying
My friend whats the point of this miserable and difficult life Death is better for you than life
thinking and intending thus if he praises death in many ways or incites someone to die
he too is expelled and excluded from the community
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
knowing perceiving having intended having decided he transgresses
A human being
from the minds first appearance in a mothers womb from the first manifestation of consciousness until the time of death in between thesethis is called a human being
Cuts off the life faculty brings it to an end interrupts its continuation
Or seeks an instrument of death for him
a sword a dagger an arrow a club a rock a knife poison or a rope
Or praises death
he shows the disadvantage in living and speaks in praise of death
Or incites someone to die
he says Kill yourself with a knife Eat poison Die by hanging yourself with a rope
My friend
this is a form of address
Whats the point of this miserable and difficult life
Miserable life
the life of the poor is miserable compared to the life of the rich
the life of the impoverished is miserable compared to the life of the wealthy
the life of humans is miserable compared to the life of the gods
Difficult life
the life of one whose hands are cut off whose feet are cut off whose hands and feet are cut off whose ears are cut off whose nose is cut off whose ears and nose are cut off
Because of this sort of miserableness and because of this sort of difficult life one says Death is better for you than life
mind and thought are equivalent
Intending
perceiving death intending death aiming at death
In many ways
in various manners
He praises death
he shows the disadvantage in living and speaks in praise of death saying
When youve passed away youll be reborn in a happy destination in heaven
There youll be able to enjoy the pleasures of heaven
Or incites someone to die
he says Kill yourself with a knife Eat poison Die by hanging yourself with a rope Jump into a chasm Jump into a pit Jump off a cliff
this is said with reference to the preceding offenses entailing expulsion
Is expelled
just as an ordinary stone that has broken in half cannot be put back together again
so too a monk who has intentionally killed a human being is not an ascetic not a son of the Sakyan
Therefore it is said he is expelled
Community joint legal procedures a joint recitation the same trainingthis is called community
He does not take part in thistherefore it is called excluded from the community
Oneself having determined by messenger by a series of messengers by a messenger who does not follow instructions by a messenger gone and returned again
Not in private but perceiving it as private

Summary verses of case studies
Praising sitting down
And with pestle with mortar
Gone forth when old flowing out
First experimental poison
And three with making sites
Another three with bricks
And also machete and rafter
A elevated platform coming down fell down
Sweating and nose treatment massage
By bathing and by smearing
Making get up making lie down
Death through food death through drink
Child by a lover and cowives
mother child he killed both
he killed neither crushing
Heating barren fertile
Tickling in taking hold of a spirit
And predatory spirits sending
Thinking it was him he gave a blow
In talking about heaven and about hell
Three trees at ḷavī
Three others with forest groves
Do not torture not as you
Buttermilk and salty purgative

Sir the ascetic Gotama the Sakyan who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan is staying at Verañjā at the foot of Nalerus Nimba tree with a large sangha of five hundred monks
That Buddha Gotama has a good reputation
He is indeed a Master perfected and fully awakened complete in insight and conduct happy knower of the world supreme trainer of tamable people teacher of gods and humans the Master the Buddha
With his own insight he has seen this world with its gods its lords of death and its supreme beings this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans and he makes it known to others
He has a Teaching that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end It has a true goal and is well articulated He sets out a perfectly complete and pure spiritual life
Its good to see such perfected ones
Then that brahmin went to the Buddha exchanged pleasantries with him sat down and said
I have heard good Gotama
that you dont bow down to old brahmins stand up for them or offer them a seat
Now Ive seen that this is indeed the case
This isnt proper
Brahmin in the world with its gods its lords of death and its supreme beings in this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans I dont see anyone to whom I should bow down for whom I should rise up or to whom I should offer a seat
If I bowed down to anyone rose up for him or offered him a seat his head would explode
Good Gotama lacks taste
There is a way one could rightly say about me that the ascetic Gotama lacks taste
For the taste for forms sounds smells flavors and material objects has been abandoned by me cut off at the root made like a palmstump so utterly done away with that it is incapable of reappearing
But thats not what you meant
Good Gotama is unlikeable
There is a way one could rightly say about me that Im unlikeable
For the liking of forms sounds smells flavors and material objects has been abandoned by the Buddha cut off at the root made like a palmstump so utterly done away with that it is incapable of reappearing
But thats not what you meant
Good Gotama teaches nonaction
There is a way one could rightly say about me that the ascetic Gotama teaches nonaction
For I teach the nondoing of misconduct by body speech and mind
I teach the nondoing of various sorts of bad unwholesome actions
But thats not what you meant
Good Gotama is an annihilationist
There is a way one could rightly say about me that the ascetic Gotama is an annihilationist
For I speak of the annihilation of sensual desire ill will and confusion
I speak of the annihilation of various sorts of bad unwholesome qualities
But thats not what you meant
Good Gotama is detestable
There is a way one could rightly say about me that I am detestable
For I detest misconduct by body speech and mind
I detest being possessed of various sorts of bad unwholesome qualities
But thats not what you meant
Good Gotama is an exterminator
There is a way one could rightly say about me that Im an exterminator
For I teach for the sake of the extermination of sensual desire ill will and confusion
for the extermination of various sorts bad unwholesome qualities
But thats not what you meant
Good Gotama is austere
There is a way one could rightly say about me that Im austere
For I say that bad unwholesome qualitiesmisconduct by body speech and mindare to be disciplined
One who has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be disciplined who has cut them off at the root made them like a palmstump done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of reappearingsuch a one I call one who is austere
Now I have abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be disciplined have cut them off at the root made them like a palm tree done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of reappearing
But thats not what you meant
Good Gotama is withdrawn
There is a way one could rightly say about me that Im withdrawn
For one whose future conception in a womb whose rebirth in a future life is abandoned and cut off at the root made like a palmstump so utterly done away with that one is incapable of reappearingsuch a one I call one who is withdrawn
Now my future conception in a womb my rebirth in a future life has been abandoned and cut off at the root made like a palmstump so utterly done away with that Im incapable of reappearing
But thats not what you meant
Brahmin suppose there were a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs
which she had properly covered properly warmed and properly incubated
Is the first chick that hatches safelyafter piercing through the eggshell with its claw or its beakto be called the eldest or the youngest
Hes to be called the eldest
for hes the eldest of those
Just so in this deluded population enveloped like an egg I alone in the world have split the eggshell of delusion and reached the supreme full awakening
I brahmin am the worlds eldest and best
I was firmly energetic and had clarity of mindfulness my body was tranquil and my mind unified
Fully secluded from the five senses secluded from unwholesome mental qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which consists of joy and bliss born of seclusion and is accompanied by movement of the mind
Through the stilling of the movement of the mind I entered and remained in the second absorption which has internal confidence and unification of mind and consists of joy and bliss born of stillness
Through the fading away of joy I remained evenminded mindful and fully aware experiencing bliss directly and I entered and remained in the third absorption of which the noble ones declare
One is evenminded mindful and abides in bliss
Through the abandoning of bliss and suffering and the earlier ending of joy and aversion I entered and remained in the fourth absorption which has neither suffering nor happiness and consists of purity of mindfulness and evenmindedness
Then with my mind collected purified cleansed flawless free from defilements supple wieldy steady and imperturbable I directed it to the knowledge which is the recollection of former lives
I recollected many past lives that is
one birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births and many eons of world dissolution many eons of world evolution and many eons of both dissolution and evolution and I knew
There I had such a name such a family such appearance such food such experience of happiness and suffering and such a lifespan
Passing away from there I was reborn elsewhere
and there I had such a name such a family such appearance such food such experience of happiness and suffering and such a lifespan
Passing away from there I was reborn here
In this way I recollected many past lives with their characteristics and particulars
This was the first true insight attained by me in the first part of the night
Delusion was dispelled and true insight arose darkness was dispelled and light arose
as happens to one who remains heedful energetic and diligent
This brahmin was my first breaking out like a chick from an eggshell
Then with my mind collected purified cleansed flawless free from defilements supple wieldy steady and imperturbable I directed it to the knowledge of the arising and passing away of beings
With superhuman and purified clairvoyance I saw beings passing away and getting reborn inferior and superior beautiful and ugly gone to good destinations and to bad destinations and I understood how beings pass on according to their actions
These beings who engaged in misconduct by body speech and mind who abused the noble ones who had wrong views and acted accordingly
at the breaking up of the body after death have been reborn in a lower realm a bad destination a world of misery hell
But these beings who engaged in good conduct of body speech and mind who did not abuse the noble ones who held right view and acted accordingly
at the breaking up of the body after death have been reborn in a good destination a heaven world
In this way with superhuman and purified clairvoyance I saw beings passing away and getting reborn inferior and superior beautiful and ugly gone to good destinations and to bad destinations and I understood how beings pass on according to their actions
This was the second true insight attained by me in the middle part of the night
Delusion was dispelled and true insight arose darkness was dispelled and light arose
as happens to one who remains heedful energetic and diligent
This brahmin was my second breaking out like a chick from an eggshell
Then with my mind collected purified cleansed flawless free from defilements supple wieldy steady and imperturbable I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the corruptions
I knew according to reality This is suffering This is the origin of suffering This is the end of suffering This is the path leading to the end of suffering
I knew according to reality These are the corruptions This is the origin of the corruptions This is the end of the corruptions This is the path leading to the end of the corruptions
When I knew and saw this my mind was freed from the corruption of sensual desire from the corruption of existence from the corruption of views and from the corruption of delusion
When it was freed I knew it was freed
and I understood that birth had come to an end the spiritual life had been lived the job had been done there was no further state of existence
This was the third true insight attained by me in the last part of the night
Delusion was dispelled and true insight arose darkness was dispelled and light arose
as happens to one who remains heedful energetic and diligent
This brahmin was my third breaking out like a chick from an eggshell
That brahmin then said to the Buddha
Good Gotama is the eldest good Gotama is the best
Wonderful good Gotama wonderful
Just as one might set upright what had been overturned or reveal what had been hidden or show the way to one who was lost or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see whats there
just so have you made the Teaching clear in many ways
Good Gotama I go for refuge to you and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks
Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
And please consent to spend the rainyseason residence at Verañjā together with the Order of monks
The Buddha consented by keeping silent and the brahmin understood
He then got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and left
At that time Verañjā was short of food and afflicted with hunger with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw It was not easy to get by on almsfood
Just then some horsedealers from Uttarāpatha had entered the rainyseason residence at Verañjā with five hundred horses
In the horsepen they prepared many portions of steamed grain for the monks
Then after robing up in the morning the monks took their bowls and robes and entered Verañjā for alms Being unable to obtain anything they went to the horsepen They then brought the portions of steamed grain back to the monastery pounded them and ate them
Venerable nanda crushed a portion of steamed grain on a stone took it to the Buddha and the Buddha ate it
The Buddha heard the sound of the mortar
When Buddhas know what is going on sometimes they ask and sometimes not
they know the right time to ask and the right time not to ask
Buddhas ask when it is beneficial not when it is unbeneficial
for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial
Buddhas question the monks for two reasons to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule
And so the Buddha said to nanda nanda whats this sound of a mortar
nanda told him what was happening
Well done nanda
You who are superior people have conquered the problems of famine later generations will despise even rice and meat
Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached the Buddha bowed sat down and said
At present Venerable Sir Verañjā is short of food and afflicted with hunger with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw
Its not easy to get by almsfood
Sir the undersurface of this great earth is abounding with food which tastes just like pure honey
It would be good if I inverted the earth so that the monks may enjoy the nutrition in the sprouts
But what will you do Moggallāna with those creatures who are living there
I will transform one of my hands to be just like the great earth and Ill make those creatures go there
Then with the other hand Ill invert the earth
Let it be Moggallāna please dont invert the earth
Those creatures might lose their minds
In that case Sir it would be good if the whole Sangha of monks could go to Uttarakuru for alms
Let it be Moggallāna please dont pursue this
At this time while Venerable Sāriputta was in seclusion he thought
For which Buddhas did the spiritual life not last long
For which Buddhas did the spiritual life last long
In the evening after coming out of seclusion Sāriputta approached the Buddha bowed sat down and said
Just now Sir while I was in seclusion I thought
For which Buddhas did the spiritual life not last long and for which ones did it last long
Sāriputta the spiritual life established by Buddha Vipassī Buddha Sikhī and Buddha Vessabhū didnt last long
But the spiritual life established by Buddha Kakusandha Buddha Konāgamana and Buddha Kassapa did last long
And whats the reason why the spiritual life established by Buddha Vipassī Buddha Sikhī and Buddha Vessabhū didnt last long
Buddha Vipassī Buddha Sikhī and Buddha Vessabhū were disinclined to give detailed teachings to their disciples
They gave few discourses in prose and in prose and verse few expositions verses inspired exclamations quotations birth stories amazing accounts and analyses
and they didnt lay down training rules or recite a monastic code
After the disappearance of those Buddhas after the disappearance of the disciples awakened under them those who were the last disciplesof various names clans and social standing who had gone forth from various familiesallowed that spiritual life to disappear rapidly
Its just like flowers not tied with a string to a wooden plank theyre scattered about whirled about and destroyed by the wind
Whys that
Because theyre not held together by a string
Just so after the disappearance of those Buddhas after the disappearance of the disciples awakened under them those who were the last disciples allowed that spiritual life to disappear rapidly
But those Buddhas were untiring in instructing their disciples after reading their minds
At one time Sāriputta while staying in a certain frightening forest grove Buddha Vessabhū the Perfected and the fully Awakened One instructed an sangha of a thousand monks reading their minds and saying
Think like this not like this
pay attention like this not like this
abandon this having attained this abide in it
When those thousand monks had been instructed by Buddha Vessabhū their minds were freed from the corruptions without grasping
But when anyone with sensual desire entered that frightening forest grove usually their hair would stand on end
This is the reason why the spiritual life established by Buddha Vipassī Buddha Sikhī and Buddha Vessabhū didnt last long
What then is the reason why the spiritual life established by Buddha Kakusandha Buddha Konāgamana and Buddha Kassapa lasted long
Buddha Kakusandha Buddha Konāgamana and Buddha Kassapa were diligent in giving detailed teachings to their disciples
They gave many discourses in prose and in prose and verse many expositions verses inspired exclamations quotations birth stories amazing accounts and analyses
and they laid down training rules and recited a monastic code
After the disappearance of those Buddhas after the disappearance of the disciples awakened under them those who were the last disciplesof various names clans and social standing who had gone forth from various familiesmade that spiritual life last for a long time
Its just like flowers tied with a string to a wooden plank they are not scattered about whirled about or destroyed by the wind
Why is that
Because they are held together by a string
Just so after the disappearance of those Buddhas after the disappearance of the disciples awakened under them those who were the last disciples made that spiritual life last for a long time
This is the reason why the spiritual life established by Buddha Kakusandha Buddha Konāgamana and Buddha Kassapa lasted long
Then Sāriputta got up from his seat put his upper robe over one shoulder raise his joined palms and said
This is the right time Venerable Sir
for laying down training rules and reciting a monastic code so that this spiritual life may last for a long time
Hold on Sāriputta
the Buddha will know the right time for that
The Teacher doesnt lay down training rules and recite a monastic code until the causes of corruption appear in the Sangha
And they dont appear until the Sangha has attained long standing
great size
an abundance of the best material support
or great learning
When this happens then the Teacher lays down training rules for his disciples and recites a monastic code in order to hold back those causes of corruption
Sāriputta the Sangha of monks is devoid of immorality devoid of danger stainless pure established in the essence
Even the least developed of these five hundred monks is a streamenterer not subject to rebirth in the lower world fixed in destiny bound for awakening
Then the Buddha said to nanda nanda its the custom for Buddhas not to go wandering in the country without taking leave of those who invited them to spend the rainyseason residence
Lets go to the brahmin of Verañjā and take leave
Yes Sir
The Buddha robed up took his bowl and robe and with nanda as his attendant went to that brahmins house where he sat down on the prepared seat
The brahmin approached the Buddha bowed and sat down
And the Buddha said Brahmin weve completed the rains residence according to your invitation and now we take leave of you
We wish to depart to go wandering in the country
Its true good Gotama that youve completed the rains residence according to my invitation but I havent given a gift
Thats not good
Its not because I didnt want to but because household life is so busy
Would you and the Sangha of monks please accept a meal from me tomorrow
The Buddha consented by keeping silent
Then after instructing inspiring and gladdening that brahmin with a teaching the Buddha got up from his seat and left
The following morning the brahmin prepared various kinds of fine food in his own house and then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready
The Buddha robed up took his bowl and robe and together with the Sangha of monks he went to that brahmins house and sat down on the prepared seat
And that brahmin personally served and satisfied the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha with various kinds of fine food When the Buddha had finished his meal the brahmin gave a set of three robes to the Buddha and two pieces of cloth to each monk
The Buddha instructed inspired and gladdened him with a teaching and then got up from his seat and left
After remaining in Verañjā for as long as he liked the Buddha traveled to Payāgapatiṭṭhāna via Soreyya Saṅkassa and Kaṇṇakujja There he crossed the river Ganges and continued on to Benares
After remaining at Benares for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward Vesālī
When he eventually arrived at Vesālī
he stayed in the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
The section for recitation on Verañjā is finished
The first raining rule on expulsion
Origin story
At one time Sudinna the son of a prominent merchant lived in a village called Kalandaka not far from Vesālī
On one occasion Sudinna went to Vesālī on some business together with a number of friends
Just then the Buddha was seated surrounded by a great gathering of people giving a teaching
When Sudinna saw this he thought Why dont I listen to the Teaching
He then approached that gathering and sat down
As he was sitting there he thought
The way I understand the Buddhas Teaching its not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell
Why dont I cut off my hair and beard put on the ocher robes and go forth from home into homelessness
When those people had been instructed inspired and gladdened by the Buddha they got up from their seats bowed down circumambulated him with their right side toward him and left
Sudinna then approached the Buddha bowed sat down and said
Venerable Sir the way I understand the Buddhas Teaching its not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell
I want to cut off my hair and beard put on the ocher robes and go forth from home into homelessness
Sir please give me the going forth
But Sudinna do you have your parents permission
No Sir
Sudinna Buddhas dont give the going forth to anyone who hasnt gotten their parents permission
Ill do whatever is necessary Sir to get my parents permission
Then after finishing his business in Vesālī Sudinna returned to Kalandaka There he approached his parents and said
Mum and dad the way I understand the Buddhas Teaching its not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure
I want to cut off my hair and beard put on the ocher robes and go forth from home into homelessness
Please give me permission to go forth
But Sudinna youre our only child
Youre dear to us and we love you You live in comfort and are well cared for you have no experience of suffering
Even if you died we would lose you against our wishes
So how can we allow you to go forth from home into homelessness while youre still living
Sudinna asked his parents a second
and a third time
but got the same reply
He then lay down on the bare ground and said
Ill either die right here or go forth
And he did not eat at the next seven meals
His parents said Dear Sudinna youre our only child Youre dear to us and we love you You live in comfort and are well cared for
you have no experience of suffering
Even if you died we would lose you against our wishes
So how can we allow you to go forth from home into homelessness while youre still living
Get up Sudinna eat drink and enjoy yourself
Enjoy worldly pleasures and do acts of merit
We wont allow you to go forth
But Sudinna did not respond
His parents said the same thing a second
and a third time
but Sudinna remained silent
Then Sudinnas friends approached him and repeated three times what his parents had said
But Sudinna made no response
Sudinnas friends approached his parents and said
Sudinna says hell either die right there on the bare ground or go forth
If you dont allow him to go forth hell die there
But if you allow him to go forth youll see him again afterwards
And if he doesnt enjoy the going forth what alternative will he have but to come back here
So allow him to go forth
We allow him they said
And Sudinnas friends said to him
Get up Sudinna your parents have given you permission to go forth from home into homelessness
Sudinna thought They say that my parents have given me permission to go forth and he got up excited and joyful stroking his limbs with his hands
After spending a few days to regain his strength he went to the Buddha bowed sat down and said
Venerable Sir Ive gotten my parents permission to go forth from home into homelessness
Please give me the going forth
He then received the going forth in the presence of the Buddha and he received the full ordination
Not long afterwards he practiced these kinds of ascetic practices he stayed in the wilderness ate only almsfood was a ragrobe wearer and went on continuous almsround
And he lived supported by a certain Vajjian village
At that time the Vajjians were short of food and afflicted with hunger with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw and it was not easy to get by on almsfood
Venerable Sudinna considered this and thought
I have many relatives in Vesālī who are rich
Why dont I live supported by them
Because of me my relatives will be able to make offerings and make merit the monks will get material support and Ill have no trouble getting almsfood
He then put his dwelling in order took his bowl and robe and set out for Vesālī
When he eventually arrived he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood
His relatives heard that he had arrived in Vesālī and they presented him with an offering of sixty servings of food
Sudinna gave the sixty servings of food to the monks He then took his bowl and robe and entered the village of Kalandaka for almsfood
As he was going on continuous almsround he came to his own fathers house
Just then a female slave of Sudinnas relatives wanted to throw away the previous evenings porridge
Sudinna said to her
If thats to be thrown away sister put it here in my almsbowl
As she was putting the porridge into his bowl she recognized his hands feet and voice
She then went to his mother and said
Please know madam
that master Sudinna is back
If you speak the truth Ill make you a free woman
As Sudinna was eating the previous evenings porridge at the base of a certain wall
his father saw him as he was coming home from work
He approached him and said
But Sudinna isnt there  and youre eating old porridge
Isnt there your own home to go to
We went to your house householder
Thats where we received this porridge
Sudinnas father took him by the arm and said Come lets go to the house
Sudinna went to his fathers house and sat down on a prepared seat
His father said to him Eat Sudinna
Theres no need Ive finished eating for today
Then please come back for the meal tomorrow
Sudinna consented by keeping silent and he got up from his seat and left
The next morning Sudinnas mother had the ground smeared with fresh cowdung and she piled up two heaps one with money and one with gold
The heaps were so large that a man standing on one side could not see a man standing on the other
Hiding the heaps behind screens and preparing a seat between them surrounded by a curtain she said to Sudinnas former wife
Now please adorn yourself in the way our son Sudinna found you especially attractive
Yes madam
Then after robing up Venerable Sudinna took his bowl and robe and went to his fathers house where he sat down on the prepared seat
His father approached him uncovered the heaps and said
This dowry dear Sudinna is the fortune from your mother and its yours Another is the fortune from your father and another the fortune from your ancestors
Its possible Sudinna to return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make merit
Please do so
I cant father Im enjoying the spiritual life
Sudinnas father repeated his request and Sudinna replied as before
Sudinnas father then repeated his request a third time and Sudinna replied
If you wouldnt get offended I could tell you what to do
Speak Sudinna
Well then make some large sacks of sunnhemp cloth put all the money and gold inside take it all away in carts and dump it in the middle of the Ganges
Because that way you would avoid the danger fear and terror that it will cause you as well as the trouble with protection
His father became displeased and thought How can our son Sudinna say such things
He then said to Sudinnas former wife
Now then since you were dear to him perhaps our son Sudinna will listen to you
Sudinnas former wife took hold of his feet and said
What are these nymphs like sir for which you lead the spiritual life
Sister I dont lead the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs
His former wife thought From today Sudinna calls me sister and she fainted on the spot
Sudinna said to his father
If theres food to be given householder give it
but dont annoy me
Eat Sudinna he said
And Sudinnas mother and father personally served and satisfied him with various kinds of fine food
When Sudinna had finished his meal his mother said to him
Dear Sudinna this family is rich
Its possible to return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make merit
Please do so
Mother I cant Im enjoying the spiritual life
His mother repeated her request a second time but got the same reply
She then said
This family Sudinna is rich
Please give us an offspring
so that the Licchavīs dont take over our heirless property
Yes mother I can do that
Where are you staying at present
In the Great Wood
And he got up from his seat and left
Sudinnas mother said to his former wife
Now then as soon as you reach your fertile period please tell me
Yes madam she replied
Not long afterwards Sudinnas former wife reached her fertile period
and she reported it to Sudinnas mother
Now please adorn yourself in the way that our son Sudinna found you especially attractive
Yes madam
Then Sudinnas mother together with his former wife approached Sudinna in the Great Wood and she said to him
This family dear Sudinna is rich
Its possible to return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make merit
Please do so
Mother I cant
Im enjoying the spiritual life
His mother repeated her request a second time but got the same reply
She then said this
This family Sudinna is rich
Please give us an offspring
so that the Licchavīs dont take over our heirless property
Yes mother I can do that he said
He then took his former wife by the arm plunged into the Great Wood andthere being no training rule and he seeing no dangerhad sexual intercourse with her three times
As a result she conceived
The earthgods cried out
Sirs the Sangha of monks has been stainless and free from danger
But Sudinna of Kalanda has produced a stain has produced danger
Hearing the cry of the earthgods the gods belonging to the heaven of the four great kings also cried out 
the Tāvatisa gods 
the Yāma gods 
the Tusita gods 
the gods who delight in creation 
the gods who control the creation of others 
the gods belonging to the retinue of the supreme beings also cried out
Sirs the Sangha of monks has been stainless and free from danger
But Sudinna of Kalanda has produced a stain has produced danger
Thus in that moment in that instance the news spread as far as the world of the supreme beings
The pregnancy of Sudinnas wife developed and she eventually gave birth to a son
Sudinnas friends called this boy Offspring
they called Sudinnas former wife Offsprings mother
and they called Venerable Sudinna Offsprings father
After some time they both went forth from home into homelessness and they realized perfection
But Sudinna was anxious and remorseful and he thought
This is truly bad for me
that after going forth on such a wellproclaimed spiritual path I wasnt able to practice for life the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life
And because of his anxiety and remorse he became thin haggard and pale his veins protruding all over his limbs he became sad sluggish miserable depressed remorseful weighed down by grief
The monks who were Sudinnas friends said to him
Formerly Sudinna you were satisfied with a good color a bright face and clear skin
But now youre thin haggard and pale your veins protruding all over your limbs and youre sad sluggish miserable depressed remorseful weighed down by grief
Could it be that you are dissatisfied with the spiritual life
I am not dissatisfied with the spiritual life
but Ive done a bad deed
Ive had sexual intercourse with my former wife
Thats why Im so miserable
I wasnt able to practice for life the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life
Sudinna no wonder youre anxious no wonder you feel remorse in that having gone forth on such a wellproclaimed spiritual path you werent able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life
Hasnt the Buddha taught in many ways for the sake of dispassion not for the sake of passion
for the sake of freedom from bondage not for the sake of bondage
for the sake of nongrasping not for the sake of grasping
When the Buddha has taught in this way how can you be intent upon passion bondage and grasping
Hasnt the Buddha given many teachings for the fading away of sensual desire
for the clearing away of intoxication for the removal of thirst for the uprooting of attachment for the cutting off of the round of birth and death for the stopping of craving for fading away for ending for extinguishment
Hasnt the Buddha in many ways taught the abandoning of worldly pleasures
the full understanding of the perception of worldly pleasures
the removal of thirst for worldly pleasures
the elimination of thoughts of worldly pleasures
the stilling of the fever of worldly pleasures
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it
but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds
After rebuking Sudinna in many ways they told the Buddha
The Buddha then had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned Sudinna
Is it true Sudinna that you had sexual intercourse with your former wife
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
Foolish man its not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be done
How could you go forth on such a wellproclaimed spiritual path and not be able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life
Havent I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion not for the sake of passion
for the sake of freedom from bondage not for the sake of bondage
for the sake of nongrasping not for the sake of grasping
When I have taught in this way how can you be intent upon passion bondage and grasping
Havent I given many teachings for the fading away of sensual desire
for the clearing away of intoxication for the removal of thirst for the uprooting of attachment for the cutting off of the round of birth and death for the stopping of craving for fading away for ending for extinguishment
Havent I in many ways taught the abandoning of worldly pleasures
the full understanding of the perception of worldly pleasures
the removal of thirst for worldly pleasures
the elimination of thoughts of worldly pleasures
the stilling of the fever of worldly pleasures
It would be better foolish man for your penis to enter the mouth of a terrible and poisonous snake than to enter a woman
It would be better for your penis to enter the mouth of a black snake than to enter a woman
It would be better for your penis to enter a blazing charcoal pit than to enter a woman
Why is that
Because for that reason you might die or experience deathlike suffering but you wouldnt because of that be reborn in a bad destination
But for this reason you might
Foolish man you have practiced what is contrary to the true Teaching the common practice the low practice the coarse practice that which ends with a wash that which is done in private that which is done wherever there are couples
You are the forerunner the first performer of many unwholesome things
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it
but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds
Then the Buddha spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain in dispraise of great desires discontent socializing and laziness but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain of fewness of wishes contentment selfelimination ascetic practices serenity reduction in things and of being energetic
After giving a teaching on what is right and proper he addressed the monks
Well then monks I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons
for the wellbeing of the Sangha for the comfort of the Sangha for the restraint of bad people for the ease of good monks for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives to give rise to confidence in those without it to increase the confidence of those who have it for the longevity of the true Teaching and for supporting the training
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk has sexual intercourse he is expelled and excluded from the community
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
The section for recitation on Sudinna is finished
Second substory the account of the female monkey
Some time later in the Great Wood near Vesālī a certain monk befriended a female monkey by giving her food and then had sexual intercourse with her
Soon afterwards after robing up in the morning he took his bowl and robe and entered Vesālī for alms
Just then a number of monks who were walking about the dwellings came to this monks dwelling
The female monkey saw the monks coming
She went up to them shook her buttocks in front of them wagged her tail presented her buttocks and made a gesture
The monks thought This monk must be having sexual intercourse with this monkey and they hid to one side
Then when that monk had finished his almsround in Vesālī and had returned with his almsfood
he ate one part himself and gave the rest to that female monkey
After eating the food the monkey presented her buttocks to the monk and he had sexual intercourse with her
Those monks said to that monk Hasnt a training rule been laid down by the Buddha
Why then do you have sexual intercourse with a monkey
Its true that a training rule has been laid down by the Buddha but it refers to human women not to animals
But thats just the same
Its not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be done
How could you go forth on such a wellproclaimed spiritual path and not be able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life
Hasnt the Buddha taught in many ways for the sake of dispassion 
the stilling of the fever of worldly pleasures
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it
but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds
After rebuking that monk in many ways they told the Buddha
The Buddha then had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned that monk
Is it true monk that you had sexual intercourse with a monkey
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
Foolish man its not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be done
How could you go forth on such a wellproclaimed spiritual path and not be able for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life
Havent I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion 
the stilling of the fever of worldly pleasures
It would be better foolish man for your penis to enter the mouth of a terrible and poisonous snake than to enter a woman
It would be better for your penis to enter the mouth of a black snake than to enter a woman
It would be better for your penis to enter a blazing charcoal pit than to enter a woman
Whys that
Because for that reason you might die or experience deathlike suffering
but you wouldnt because of that be reborn in a bad destination
But for this reason you might
Foolish man youve practiced what is contrary to the true Teaching the common practice the low practice the coarse practice that which ends with a wash that which is done in private that which is done wherever there are couples
Foolish man this wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk has sexual intercourse even with a female animal he is expelled and excluded from the community
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
The account of the female monkey is finished
Third substory the section for recitation on covering
Around the same time a number of Vajjian monks from Vesālī ate slept and bathed as much as they liked
Doing so and not reflecting properly they had sexual intercourse but without first renouncing the training and revealing their weakness
After some time they were affected by loss of relatives loss of property and loss of health They then approached Venerable nanda and said
Venerable nanda we dont blame the Buddha the Teaching or the Sangha
we only blame ourselves
We were unfortunate and had little merit
after going forth on such a wellproclaimed spiritual path we were unable for life to practice the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life
If we were now to obtain the going forth and the full ordination in the presence of the Buddha we would have clarity about wholesome qualities and would be devoted day after day to developing the aids to awakening
Venerable nanda please tell the Buddha about this
Yes he replied And he went to the Buddha and told him
Its impossible nanda that the Buddha should abolish a training rule that entails expulsion because of the Vajjians
The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks if a monk without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness has sexual intercourse he may not receive the full ordination
But monks if someone has sexual intercourse after first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness he may receive the full ordination
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk after taking on the monks training and way of life without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness has sexual intercourse even with a female animal he is expelled and excluded from the community
whoever of such a kind of such activity of such social standing of such name of such family of such conduct of such behavior of such association who is senior who is junior or who is of middle standingthis is called a
he is a monk because he lives on alms
a monk because he has gone over to living on alms
a monk because he wears a patchwork cloth
a monk by convention
a monk on account of his claim
a come monk monk
a monk given the full ordination by going to the three refuges
a good monk
a monk of substance
a trainee monk
a fully trained monk
a monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand
The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements which is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
the three trainings the training in the higher morality the training in the higher mind the training in the higher wisdom
The training in the higher morality is the training meant in this case
Way of life
whatever training rule has been laid down by the Buddhathis is called way of life
One trains in this therefore it is called after taking on the way of life
Without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness
There is monks a revealing of weakness without the training being renounced
and there is a revealing of weakness together with the training being renounced
And how is there a revealing of weakness without the training being renounced

The first offense entailing expulsion is finished
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing expulsion
The second training rule on expulsion
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak
At that time a number of monks who were friends had made grass huts on the slope of Mount Isigili and had entered the rainyseason residence there
Among them was Venerable Dhaniya the potter
After three months when they had completed the rainyseason residence the monks demolished their grass huts put away the grass and wood and left to wander in the country
But Venerable Dhaniya also spent the winter and the summer there
Then on one occasion while Dhaniya was in the village to collect almsfood some women gathering grass and firewood demolished the grass hut and took away the grass and sticks
A second time Dhaniya collected grass and sticks and made a grass hut
and again the hut was demolished in the same way
The same thing happened a third time
Dhaniya thought
Three times this has happened
But Im welltrained and experienced in my own craft of pottery
Why dont I knead mud myself and make a hut consisting of nothing but clay
Then Dhaniya did just that And he collected grass wood and cowdung and he baked his hut
It was a beautiful and charming little hut and it was red just like a scarlet rainmite
And when hit it sounded just like the sound of a bell
Soon afterwards the Buddha was descending from the Vulture Peak with a number of monks and he saw that hut
He said to the monks
Monks whats this beautiful and charming thing which is red like a scarlet rainmite
The monks told the Buddha
and the Buddha criticized Dhaniya
Its not suitable monks for that foolish man its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be done
How can he make a hut out of nothing but clay
Certainly that foolish man can have no consideration compassion and mercy for living beings
Go monks and demolish this hut
so that future generations dont take up the destruction of living beings
And monks you should not make a hut consisting of nothing but clay
If you do you commit an offense of wrong conduct
Yes Venerable Sir the monks replied and they went to that hut and demolished it
Dhaniya said to them
Why are you demolishing my hut
The Buddha has asked us to
Demolish it if the Lord of the Truth has said so
Then Dhaniya thought
Three times while I was in the village to collect almsfood women gathering grass and firewood demolished my hut and took away the grass and sticks
And now my hut made of nothing but clay has been demolished at the Buddhas request
But the caretaker of the woodyard is a friend of mine
Why dont I ask him for timber and make a hut out of that
Dhaniya then went to the caretaker of the woodyard and told him what had happened
adding Please give me some timber
I want to make a wooden hut
Theres no such timber Sir that I could give you
This timber is held by the King and its meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of an emergency
You can only take it if the King gives it away
Its been given by the King
The caretaker of the woodyard thought
These Sakyan ascetics live according to the Truth They are celibate and their conduct is good and they are truthful moral and have a good character
Even the King has faith in them
These venerables wouldnt say something is given if it were not
And he said to Dhaniya
You may take it Sir
Dhaniya then had that timber cut into pieces removed it by means of carts and made a wooden hut
Soon afterwards the brahmin Vassakāra the chief minister of Magadha while inspecting the works in Rājagaha went to the caretaker of the woodyard and said to him
Whats going on
Wheres the timber held by the King thats meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of an emergency
Sir that timber was given by the King to Venerable Dhaniya
The brahmin Vassakāra was upset and thought
How could the King give away this timber to Dhaniya the potter
The brahmin Vassakāra then went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and said
Is it true sir that the timber held by the King meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of an emergency was given by the King to Dhaniya the potter
Who said that
The caretaker of the woodyard sir
Well then brahmin send for the caretaker of the woodyard
And Vassakāra had the caretaker of the woodyard bound and taken by force
Dhaniya saw the caretaker of the woodyard being bound and taken by force
and he said to him
Why is this happening to you
Because of that business with the timber Sir
Go and Ill come too
Please come before Im done for
Dhaniya then went to King Bimbisāras house and sat down on the prepared seat
The King approached Dhaniya bowed sat down
Is it true Venerable that I have given the timber held by the Kingmeant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of an emergencyto you
Yes great king
We kings are very busy
we may give and not remember
Please remind me
Do you remember great king when you were first anointed speaking these words
I give the grass sticks and water for the ascetics and brahmins to enjoy
I remember
There are ascetics and brahmins who have a sense of conscience who are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training
They are afraid of wrongdoing even in regard to small matters
What was uttered by me was meant for these and it concerned whats ownerless in the wilderness
Yet you imagine that you can take timber not given to you by means of this pretext
But how could I presume to beat imprison or banish an ascetic or a brahmin living in my kingdom
Go youre free because of your status
but dont do such a thing again
But people complained and criticized him
These Sakyan ascetics are shameless and immoral liars
They claim to live according to the Truth to be celibate and of good conduct to be truthful moral and of good character
But they dont have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmin
theyve lost the plot
They even deceive the Kingwhat then other people
The monks heard the complaints of those people
The monks of few desires who had a sense of conscience who were contented afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training complained and criticized Venerable Dhaniya
How can he take timber belonging to the King that hasnt been given to him
After criticizing Dhaniya in many ways they told the Buddha
The Buddha then convened the Sangha of monks and questioned Venerable Dhaniya
Is it true Dhaniya that youve taken timber belonging to the King that wasnt given to you
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
Foolish man its not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be done
How can you take timber belonging to the King that hasnt been given to you
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it
but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds
Just then a former judge who had gone forth with the monks was sitting near the Buddha
The Buddha said to him
For what amount of stealing does King Bimbisāra beat imprison or banish a thief
For a pāda coin Sir for the worth of a pāda or for more than a pāda
At that time in Rājagaha a pāda coin was worth five māsaka coins
After rebuking Venerable Dhaniya in many ways for being difficult to support 
 And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk intending to steal takes what has not been given to him
the sort of stealing for which kings having caught a thief would beat imprison or banish him saying Youre a bandit youre a fool youve gone astray youre a thief
he too is expelled and excluded from the community
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
At one time monks from the group of six went to the dyers spread of cloth took the dyers goods to the monastery and shared it out
Other monks said
You have great merit
since youve obtained so much robecloth
How is there merit for us
Just now we went to the dyers spread of cloth and took the dyers goods
Hasnt a training rule been laid down by the Buddha
Why then do you take the dyers goods
Its true that a training rule has been laid down by the Buddha
but it concerns inhabited areas not the wilderness
But thats just the same
Its not suitable its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be done
How can you take the dyerss goods
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it
but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds
After rebuking those monks in many ways they told the Buddha
The Buddha convened the Sangha of monks and questioned those monks
Is it true monks that you went to the dyers spread of cloth and took the dyers goods
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
Its not suitable foolish men its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be done
How can you go to the dyers spread of cloth and take the dyers goods
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it
but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds
Then after rebuking the monks from the group of six in many ways the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support 
but he spoke in praise  of being energetic Having given a teaching on what is right and proper he addressed the monks 
 And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk intending to steal takes from an inhabited area or from the wilderness what has not been given to him
the sort of stealing for which kings having caught a thief would beat imprison or banish him saying Youre a bandit youre a fool youve gone astray youre a thief
he too is expelled and excluded from the community
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
an inhabited area of one hut an inhabited area of two huts an inhabited area of three huts an inhabited area of four huts an inhabited area with people an an inhabited area without people an enclosed inhabited area an unenclosed inhabited area a disorganized inhabited area and even a caravan settled for more than four months is called an inhabited area
The vicinity of an inhabited area
of an enclosed inhabited area the outward stonethrow of a man of average height standing at the threshold of the gateway to the inhabited area
of an unenclosed inhabited area the outward stonethrow of a man of average height standing in the vicinity of a house
The wilderness
apart from inhabited areas and the vicinity of inhabited areas the remainder is called the wilderness
What has not been given
what has not been given what has not been let go of what has not been relinquished what is guarded what is protected what is regarded as mine what belongs to someone else
This is called what has not been given
Intending to steal
the thought of stealing the thought of taking
takes carries off takes away interrupts the movement of removes from its base does not keep an appointment
a pāda coin the worth of a pāda or more than a pāda
kings of the earth kings of a region rulers of islands rulers of border areas judges government officials or whoever metes out physical punishmentthese are called kings
whoever intending to steal takes anything having a value of five māsaka coins or more than five māsaka coins that has not been givenhe is called a thief
Would beat
would beat with the hand the foot a whip a cane a cudgel or by mutilation
Would imprison
would imprison by constricting with a rope by constricting with shackles by constricting with chains by constricting to a house by constricting to a city by constricting to a village by constricting to a town by being guarded
Would banish
would banish from a village from a town from a city from a country or from a district
Youre a bandit youre a fool youve gone astray youre a thief
this is a rebuke
this is said with reference to the preceding offense entailing expulsion
Is expelled
just as a fallen withered leaf is incapable of becoming green again
so too a monk who intending to steal takes a pāda coin the worth of a pāda or more than a pāda that had not been given to him is not an ascetic not a son of the Sakyan
Therefore it is said he is expelled
Community joint legal procedures a joint recitation the same trainingthis is called community
He does not take part in thistherefore it is called excluded from the community

The second offense entailing expulsion is finished
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing expulsion
The fourth training rule on expulsion
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood
At that time a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainyseason residence on the banks of the river Vaggumudā
Just then Vajjī was short of food and afflicted with hunger with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw
and it was not easy to get by on almsfood
The monks considered the difficult circumstances and they thought
How can we remain united and in harmony have a comfortable rainy season
and get almsfood without trouble
Some said
We could work for the householders
and theyll give something in return
In this way well be united and in harmony and well spend the rainy season in comfort
and have no trouble getting almsfood
Some said
Theres no need to work for the householders
Lets instead take messages for them
and theyll give something in return
In this way well be united and in harmony and well spend the rainy season in comfort
and have no trouble getting almsfood
Some said
Theres no need to work for the householders
nor to take messages for them
Lets instead praise one anothers superhuman qualities to the householders
Such a monk has the first absorption
such a monk the second absorption
such a monk the third
such a monk the fourth
such a monk is a streamenterer
such a monk a oncereturner
such a nonreturner
such a perfected one
such a monk has the three true insights
and such the six direct knowledges
Then theyll give to us
In this way well be united and in harmony and well spend the rainy season in comfort
and have no trouble getting almsfood
Indeed this is the better way that we praise one anothers superhuman qualities to the householders
Then those monks praised one anothers superhuman qualities to the householders
Such a monk has the first absorption 
such a monk has the six direct knowledges
And those people thought
Were fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rainyseason residence
Such monks as these who are virtuous and of good character have never before entered the rains residence with us
And they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves or give to their parents to their wives and children to their slaves servants and workers to their friends and companions or to their relatives
In this way those monks were satisfied with a good color a bright face and clear skin
Now it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainyseason residence to go and visit the Buddha
So when they had completed the rains residence and the three months had elapsed those monks put their dwellings in order took their bowls and robes and left for Vesālī
When they eventually arrived at Vesālī they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood There they approached the Buddha bowed and sat down
At that time the monks who had completed the rains residence in that region were thin haggard and pale their veins protruding all over their limbs
But the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā were satisfied with a good color a bright face and clear skin
Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks
the Buddha said to them
I hope youre keeping well monks I hope youre comfortable
I hope you had a comfortable rains residence in concord and harmony without dispute and that you had no trouble getting almsfood
Were keeping well Venerable Sir were comfortable
we had a comfortable rains residence in concord and harmony without dispute and we had no trouble getting almsfood
When Buddhas know what is going on sometimes they ask and sometimes not they know the right time to ask and the right time not to ask Buddhas ask when it is beneficial not when it is unbeneficial for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial
Buddhas question the monks for two reasons to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule
And the Buddha said to those monks
In what way monks did you have a comfortable rains residence without having any trouble getting almsfood
Then those monks told the Buddha
But had you really achieved those superhuman qualities
No Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
Its not suitable foolish men its not proper its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its should not be done
How can you for the sake of your stomachs praise one anothers superhuman qualities to householders
It would be better for your bellies to be cut open with a sharp butchers knife than for you to praise one anothers superhuman qualities to householders
Why is that
Because for that reason you might die or experience deathlike suffering
but you wouldnt because of that be reborn in a bad destination
But for this reason you might
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it  
After rebuking them and giving a teaching he addressed the monks
Monks there are these five great gangsters to be found in the world
What five
A great gangster thinks like this
Oh when will I with a following of a hundred or a thousand men wander among villages towns and royal capitals
killing and making others kill destroying and making others destroy tormenting and making others torment
Then after some time he does just that
Just so monks a bad monk thinks like this
Oh when will I with a following of a hundred or a thousand people go wandering among villages towns and royal capitals
be honored respected and revered by both lay people and those gone forth and obtain robes almsfood dwellings and medicines
Then after some time he does just that
This is the first great gangster to be found in the world
Again a bad monk learns the spiritual path proclaimed by the Buddha and takes it as his own
This is the second great gangster to be found in the world
Again a bad monk groundlessly charges someone who lives the spiritual life in purity with not abstaining from sexuality
This is the third great gangster to be found in the world
Again a bad monk takes valuable goods and requisites belonging to the Sangha
a monastery the site of a monastery a dwelling the site of a dwelling a bed a bench a mattress a pillow a metal pot a metal jar a metal bucket a metal bowl a machete a hatchet an ax a spade a chisel a creeper bamboo reed grass clay wooden goods earthenware goods
and uses them to win over and create a following among householders
This is the fourth great gangster to be found in the world
But in this world with its gods its lords of death and its supreme beings in this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans this is the greatest gangster one who untruthfully and groundlessly boasts about a superhuman quality
Why is that
Monks youve eaten the countrys almsfood by theft
Whoever should declare himself
to be other than he truly is
Has eaten this by theft
like a cheater who has deceived
Many ochernecks of bad qualities
uncontrolled and wicked
By their wicked deeds
they are reborn in hell
Its better to eat an iron ball
heated like a burning flame
Than for the immoral and uncontrolled
to eat the countrys alms
After rebuking the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā in many ways for being difficult to maintain difficult to support 
 And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk falsely claims for himself a superhuman quality knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones saying This I know this I see
but after some timewhether questioned or not but having committed the offense and seeking purificationshould say Not knowing I said that I know not seeing that I see what I said was empty and false
he too is expelled and excluded from the community
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
At one time a number of monks thinking they had seen what they had not attained what they had not achieved what they had not realized what they had not declared final knowledge because of overestimation
After some time their minds inclined to sensual desire ill will and confusion
They became anxious thinking
The Buddha has laid down a training rule
yet we declared final knowledge because of overestimation
Could it be that weve committed an offense entailing expulsion
They told Venerable nanda
who told the Buddha
He said nanda these monks declared final knowledge because of overestimation thinking they had seen what they had not attained what they had not achieved what they had not realized what they had not
but this is negligible
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk falsely claims for himself a superhuman quality knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones saying This I know this I see
but after some timewhether he is questioned or not but having committed the offense and seeking purificationshould say Not knowing I said that I know not seeing that I see what I said was empty and false then
except if it is due to overestimation
he too is expelled and excluded from the community
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
although a certain wholesome quality is nonexistent in himself not real not to be found and he does not see it or know it he says I have this wholesome quality
A superhuman quality
absorption release stillness attainment knowledge and vision development of the path realization of the fruits abandoning the defilements a mind without hindrances delighting in empty dwellings
For himself
either he presents those good qualities as in himself or he presents himself as among those good qualities
the three true insights
knowledge and vision are equivalent
announces to a woman or a man to a lay person or one gone forth
This I know this I see
I know these qualities I see these qualities These qualities are found in me and I conform to them
After some time
the moment the second the instant after he has made the claim
He is questioned
he is questioned in regard to what he has claimed
What did you attain
How did you attain it
When did you attain it
Where did you attain it
Which defilements did you abandon
Which qualities did you gain
he is not spoken to by anyone
having bad desires overcome by desire claiming a nonexistent unreal superhuman quality he has committed an offense entailing expulsion
Seeking purification
he desires to be a householder a lay follower a monastery worker or a novice monk
Not knowing I said that I know not seeing that I see
I dont know these qualities I dont see these qualities These qualities arent found in me and I dont conform to them
What I said was empty and false
what I said was empty what I said was false what I said was unreal I said it without knowing
Except if it is due to overestimation
Unless it is due to overestimation
this is said with reference to the preceding offenses entailing expulsion
Is expelled
just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth
so too a monk with bad desires overcome by desire who has claimed a nonexistent unreal superhuman quality is not an ascetic not a son of the Sakyan
Therefore it is said he is expelled
Community joint legal procedures a joint recitation the same trainingthis is called community
He does not take part in thistherefore it is called excluded from the community
A superhuman quality
absorption release stillness attainment knowledge and vision development of the path realization of the fruits abandoning the defilements a mind without hindrances delighting in empty dwellings
the first absorption the second absorption the third absorption the fourth absorption
emptiness release signless release desireless release
emptiness stillness signless stillness desireless stillness
Attainment
emptiness attainment signless attainment desireless attainment
Knowledge and vision
the three true insights
Development of the path
the four applications of mindfulness the four right efforts the four foundations for supernormal power the five spiritual faculties the five spiritual powers the seven factors of awakening the noble eightfold path
Realization of the fruits
realization of the fruit of streamentry realization of the fruit of oncereturning realization of the fruit of nonreturning realization of perfection
Abandoning the defilements
the abandoning of sensual desire the abandoning of ill will the abandoning of confusion
A mind without hindrances
a mind without sensual desire a mind without ill will a mind without confusion
Delighting in empty dwellings
because of the first absorption there is delight in empty dwellings
because of the second absorption there is delight in empty dwellings
because of the third absorption there is delight in empty dwellings
because of the fourth absorption there is delight in empty dwellings

he misrepresents his acceptance of what is true
he misrepresents his sentiment of what is true

Summary verses of case studies
About overestimation in the wilderness
Almsfood preceptor behavior
Fetters qualities in private
Dwelling supported
Not difficult and then energy fear of death
Remorseful friend rightly
To be reached by energy to be reached by exertion
Then two on the enduring of feeling
Five cases of a brahmin
Three on declaring final knowledge
Home rejected sense pleasures
And delight set out
Both are cattlebutchers bone lump
A morsel is a poultrybutcher a sheepbutcher is flayed
And a pigbutcher and sword a deerhunter and knife
And a torturer and arrow a horse trainer and needle
And a slanderer is sewn
A corrupt magistrate had testicles as burden
An adulterer submerged in a pit
An eater of feces was a wicked brahmin
A flayed woman was an adulteress
An ugly woman was a fortuneteller
A sweating woman scattered coals on a cowife
A beheaded man was an executioner
A monk a nun a trainee nun
A novice monk then a novice nun
These having gone forth in the training of Kassapa
did bad deeds right there
The Tapodā in Rājagaha battle
And with the plunging in of elephants
The perfected monk Sobhita
recalled five hundred eons

This isnt the right time to reply
Please ask me in the presence of the Buddha
Then after their meal and after returning from almsround Lakkhaṇa and Mahāmoggallāna approached the Buddha
and sat down

Just now as you were descending from the Vulture Peak you smiled at a certain place
Why was that
As I was coming down from the Vulture Peak I saw a skeleton flying through the air
Vultures crows and hawks were in close pursuit of it striking it between the ribs
while it uttered cries of distress
And I thought
how amazing and astonishing it is that such a being should exist
such a spirit
such a state of existence
The monks complained and criticized him

The Buddha then said to them
There are disciples who have vision
and knowledge
and they can see know and witness such things

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing confession
The training rule on had prepared
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuary
At that time the nun Thullanandā was associating with a family from which she received a regular meal
On one occasion the head of that family had invited some senior monks
Just then the nun Thullanandā robed up in the morning took her bowl and robe and went to that family And she asked the head of the family
Why have you prepared so much food
Because Venerable Ive invited the senior monks
But who are those senior monks
Venerable Sāriputta Venerable Mahāmoggallāna Venerable Mahākaccāna Venerable Mahākoṭṭhika Venerable Mahākappina Venerable Mahācunda Venerable Anuruddha Venerable Revata Venerable Upāli Venerable nanda and Venerable Rāhula
But why do you invite such inferior monks instead of the great ones
Who are these great monks
Venerable Devadatta Venerable Kokālika Venerable Kaṭamodakatissaka Venerable Khaṇḍadeviyāputta and Venerable Samuddadatta
While this conversation was still taking place the senior monks entered
Thullanandā said Is it true that youve invited these great monks
Just before you called them inferior monks and now you call them great monks
And that lay person threw her out of the house and made an end of her regular meal
The monks of few desires complained and criticized Devadatta
How can Devadatta eat almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared 
Is it true Devadatta that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you eat almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk eats almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared he commits an offense entailing confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Soon afterwards a monk who had earlier left Rājagaha returned to see his family
Because it was long since he had last returned people prepared food for him respectfully
And the nun who was associating with that family said to them
Give food to that monk
The monk thought
The Buddha has prohibited us from eating almsfood when we know that a nun had it prepared and being afraid of wrongdoing he did not accept it
And because he was not able to walk for alms he missed his meal
After returning to the monastery he told the monks what had happened
and they in turn told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks I allow you to eat almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared if the householder had already intended to prepare it
 And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk eats almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared except if the householder had already intended to prepare it he commits an offense entailing confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
he knows by himself or others have told him or the nun has told him
she has been given the full ordination by both Sanghas
Has it prepared
if she says to those who do not already want to give or want to prepare This monk is a reciter This monk is learned This monk is an expert on the discourses This monk is an expert on the Monastic Law This monk is an expounder of the Teaching Give to this monk Prepare for this monkthis is called has it prepared
any of the five staple foods
Except if the householder had already intended to prepare it
unless the householder had intended to prepare it
The householder had intended to prepare it
they are relatives or they have invited or they give regularly
If he receives it with the intention of eating it except if the householder had already intended to prepare it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
For every mouthful he commits an offense entailing confession
If a nun had it prepared and he perceives that this is the case and he eats it except if the householder had already intended to prepare it he commits an offense entailing confession
If a nun had it prepared but he is unsure of it and he eats it except if the householder had already intended to prepare it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If a nun had it prepared but he perceives that this is not the case and he eats it except if the householder had already intended to prepare it there is no offense
If a nun who is fully ordained only on one side had it prepared and he eats it except if the householder had already intended to prepare it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If a nun did not have it prepared but he perceives that a nun did he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If a nun did not have it prepared but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If a nun did not have it prepared and he perceives that a nun did not there is no offense
if the householder had already intended to prepare it
if a trainee nun has it prepared
if a novice nun has it prepared
if it is anything apart from the five kinds of staple food
if he is insane
if he is the first offender
The ninth rule the training rule on had prepared is finished
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing confession
The subchapter on legitimately
The training rule on deception
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
the monks from the group of six were misbehaving They said to each other Lets make the other monks think that we committed these offenses because we didnt know the rules Then during the recitation of the Monastic Code they said
Just now did we find out that this rule too is included in the Monastic Code and comes up for recitation every halfmonth
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six say this during the recitation of the Monastic Code 
Is it true monks that you said this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you say this during the recitation of the Monastic Code
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
During the halfmonthly recitation of the Monastic Code a monk might say
Just now did I find out that this rule too has come down in the Monastic Code is included in the Monastic Code and comes up for recitation every halfmonth
If other monks know that that monk has previously sat through at least two or three recitations of the Monastic Code then that monk is not let off because of ignorance and he is to be dealt with according to the rule Further he should be charged with deception
Its a loss for you that you dont pay proper attention during the recitation of the Monastic Code
And for the act of deception he commits an offense entailing confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
Halfmonthly
on every observance day
During the recitation of the Monastic Code
Might say
after misbehaving he thinks
Let them think that I committed these offenses because I didnt know the rules If during the recitation of the Monastic Code he then says
Just now did I find out that this rule too has come down in the Monastic Code is included in the Monastic Code and comes up for recitation every halfmonth then he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If other monks know that the monk who wants to deceive has previously sat through at least two or three recitations of the Monastic Code then that monk is not let off because of ignorance and he is to be dealt with according to the rule Further he should be charged with deception
And monks he is to be charged like this
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
Monk soandso did not pay proper attention during the recitation of the Monastic Code
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should charge him with deception
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
Monk soandso did not pay proper attention during the recitation of the Monastic Code
The Sangha charges him with deception
Any monk who approves of charging him with deception should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has charged monk soandso with deception
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
If he deceives but he has not been charged with deception he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he deceives and he has been charged with deception he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is a legitimate legal procedure and he perceives it as legitimate and he deceives he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is a legitimate legal procedure but he is unsure of it and he deceives he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is a legitimate legal procedure but he perceives it as illegitimate and he deceives he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure but he perceives it as legitimate he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure and he perceives it as such he commits an offense of wrong conduct
if he has not heard it in full
if he has heard it fewer than two or three times in full
if he does not want to deceive
if he is insane
if he is the first offender

and they said The monks from the group of six intentionally make us anxious
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six do this 
Is it true monks that you do this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you do this
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk intentionally makes a monk anxious thinking In this way he will be ill at ease at least for a moment and he does so only for this reason and no other he commits an offense entailing confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
another monk
knowing perceiving having intended having decided he transgresses
Makes anxious
if he makes him anxious saying It would seem that you were less than twenty years old when you were given the full ordination It would seem that you have eaten at the wrong time It would seem that you have drunk alcohol It would seem that you have been sitting in private with a woman he commits an offense entailing confession
He does so only for this reason and no other
there is no other reason for making him anxious
If it is one who is fully ordained and he perceives him as such and he intentionally makes him anxious he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is one who is fully ordained but he is unsure of it and he intentionally makes him anxious he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is one who is fully ordained but he does not perceive him as such and he intentionally makes him anxious he commits an offense entailing confession
If he intentionally makes one who is not fully ordained anxious he commits an offense of wrong conduct

If it is one who is not fully ordained but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct

if not wanting to make him anxious he says It would seem that you were less than twenty years old when you were given the full ordination It would seem that you have eaten at the wrong time It would seem that you have drunk alcohol It would seem that you have been sitting in private with a woman and then Find out about it so that you dont get anxious later

The training rule on memorizing the Teaching
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time the monks from the group of six were instructing lay followers to memorize the Teaching
Those lay followers became disrespectful undeferential and rude toward the monks
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six instruct lay followers to memorize the Teaching
those lay followers becoming disrespectful undeferential and rude toward the monks
After rebuking those monks in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that you do this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you instruct lay followers to memorize the Teaching
those lay followers becoming disrespectful undeferential and rude toward the monks
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk instructs a person who is not fully ordained to memorize the Teaching he commits an offense entailing confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
A person who is not fully ordained
anyone except a fully ordained monk and a fully ordained nun
To memorize
a line the next line syllable by syllable the next phrase
they start together and finish together
The next line
one of them starts but they finish together
Syllable by syllable
when rūpa anicca is being said he prompts him saying rū
The next phrase
when Rūpa anicca is being said the other says Vedanā aniccā
And whatever line there is whatever next line whatever syllable by syllable whatever next phrase
this is all called to memorize
The Teaching
what has been spoken by the Buddha what has been spoken by disciples what has been spoken by sages what has been spoken by gods what is connected with what is beneficial what is connected with the Teaching
if he instructs by the line then for every line he commits an offense entailing confession
If he instructs by the syllable then for every syllable he commits an offense entailing confession
If the person is not fully ordained and the monk does not perceive them as such and he instructs them to memorize the Teaching he commits an offense entailing confession

The training rule on nuns dwelling places
At one time when the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery
the monks from the group of six went to the nuns dwelling place and instructed the nuns from the group of six
Soon afterwards the nuns said to the nuns from the group of six
Come Venerables lets go to the instruction
Theres no need the monks from the group of six came and instructed us right here
The nuns complained and criticized the monks from the group of six
How can the monks from the group of six go and instruct the nuns at their dwelling place
And those nuns told the monks
The monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks
How can the monks from the group of six go and instruct the nuns at their dwelling place
Is it true monks that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you go and instruct the nuns at their dwelling place
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk goes to a nuns dwelling place and then instructs her he commits an offense entailing confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Soon afterwards Mahāpajāpati Gotamī became sick
The senior monks went to see her
We hope youre bearing up Gotamī we hope youre getting better
Im not bearing up Venerables and Im not getting better
Please give me a teaching
Its not allowable for us to go and teach a nun at her dwelling place And being afraid of wrongdoing they did not teach her
Soon afterwards after robing up in the morning the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Mahāpajāpati Gotamī where he sat down on a prepared seat
And he said to her
I hope youre bearing up Gotamī I hope youre getting better
Previously Venerable Sir the senior monks would come and teach me
and because of that I would be comfortable
But now that this has been prohibited by the Buddha they dont teach because theyre afraid of wrongdoing
And because of that Im not comfortable
After instructing inspiring and gladdening her with a teaching the Buddha got up from his seat and left
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks I allow you to go and instruct a sick nun at her dwelling place
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk goes to the nuns dwelling place and then instructs them except on an appropriate occasion he commits an offense entailing confession
This is the appropriate occasion a nun is sick
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
The nuns dwelling place
where nuns stay for even a single night

they have been given the full ordination by both Sanghas
if he instructs about the eight important principles he commits an offense entailing confession
Except on an appropriate occasion
unless it is an appropriate occasion
A sick nun
she is not able to go to the instruction or to a formal meeting of the community
If she is fully ordained and he perceives her as such and he goes to her dwelling place and then instructs her except on an appropriate occasion he commits an offense entailing confession
If she is fully ordained but he is unsure of it and he goes to her dwelling place and then instructs her except on an appropriate occasion he commits an offense entailing confession
If she is fully ordained but he does not perceive her as such and he goes to her dwelling place and then instructs her except on an appropriate occasion he commits an offense entailing confession
If he instructs her with another teaching he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he instructs a nun who is fully ordained only on one side he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If she is not fully ordained but he perceives her as such he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If she is not fully ordained but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If she is not fully ordained and he does not perceive her as such there is no offense
if he recites

The legal procedure hasnt been done Its been done badly It should be done again Its not been settled Its been badly settled It should be settled again
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six reopen a legal issue that they know has been legitimately settled 
Is it true monks that youre doing this

but he wore a robe that was the same size as the Buddhas
When the senior monks saw him coming
they thought it was the Buddha and got up from their seats
But when he came close they realized who it was and they complained and criticized him
How can Venerable Nanda wear a robe the same size as the Buddhas 
Is it true Nanda that you do this

Venerable Upananda the Sakyan said to his brothers student
Come lets go to the village for alms
Then without getting him any food he sent him away saying
Go away Im not comfortable talking or sitting with you but only if I talk and sit by myself
But since the right time for eating was coming to an end that student was not able to walk for alms And while he was going back there was nobody offering food and so he missed his meal
He then went to the monastery and told the monks
The monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda
How can Venerable Upananda say to a monk Come lets go to the village for alms and then send him away without getting him any food 
Is it true Upananda that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you say to a monk Come lets go to the village for alms and then send him away without getting him any food
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this

At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuary
At that time Venerable Dabba the Mallian assigned the dwellings and designated the meals
and the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka were only newly ordained
They had little merit and they obtained inferior dwellings and meals
They then complained about Dabba to other monks
Dabba the Mallian assigns dwellings and designates meals based on favoritism
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka complain about Venerable Dabba to other monks
Is it true monks that you do this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you complain about Dabba to other monks
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk complains he commits an offense entailing confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited complaining the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka considered other ways of getting the monks to hear about their grievances
They then criticized Dabba the Mallian in the vicinity of other monks
Dabba assigns dwellings and designates meals based on favoritism
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka criticize Venerable Dabba
Is it true monks that you do this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you criticize Dabba
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this

If it is a legitimate legal procedure and he perceives it as such and he complains or criticizes he commits an offense entailing confession

The husband approached Upananda bowed and sat down
He then said to his wife Please give him alms
And she did so
Soon afterwards he said Please leave Sir the alms have been given
But the woman knowing that her husband was lustful said Please sit Sir dont go
A second time and
a third time he repeated his request
and both times his wife repeated hers
He then left the house and complained to the other monks
Venerables Venerable Upananda is seated with my wife in our bedroom
When I ask him to leave he doesnt want to go
Yet were very busy
The monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda
How can Venerable Upananda sit down intruding on a lustful couple 
Is it true Upananda that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you sit down intruding on a lustful couple
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk sits down intruding on a lustful couple he commits an offense entailing confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case

At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
he allowed the rainyseason robe for the monks
Knowing this the monks from the group of six wore rainyseason robes that were inappropriate in size
As they were walking about they were dragging them along both in front and behind
The monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks
How can the monks from the group of six wear such rainyseason robes 
Is it true monks that you do this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you do this
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk is having a rainyseason robe made it should be made the right size
This is the right size six standard handspans long and twoandahalf wide
If it exceeds that it is to be cut down and he commits an offense entailing confession
A rainyseason robe
it is for use during the four months of the rainy season
Is having made
making it himself or having someone else make it it should be made to the right size
This is the right size six standard handspans long and two and a half wide
If he makes one or has one made that exceeds that then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct
When he obtains it it is to be cut down and he is then to confess an offense entailing confession
If he finishes what he began himself he commits an offense entailing confession
If he has others finish what he began himself he commits an offense entailing confession
If he finishes himself what was begun by others he commits an offense entailing confession
If he has others finish what was begun by others he commits an offense entailing confession
If he makes one or has one made for the benefit of someone else he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he obtains one that was made by someone else and then uses it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
if he makes it the right size
if he makes it less than the right size
if he obtains one made by another that exceeds the right size and then cuts it down before using it

At that time the monks from the group of six were misbehaving but when a legal procedure was being done against any one of them they would object
On one occasion the Sangha had gathered on some business
The monks from the group of six were busy making robes and so they gave their consent to one among them
When the monks saw that only one monk from the group of six had come they did a legal procedure against him
When he returned to the monks from the group of six
they asked him
What did the Sangha do
It did a legal procedure against me
We didnt give our consent for that
If we had known that a procedure would be done against you we wouldnt have given our consent
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six give their consent to legitimate legal procedures and then criticize them afterwards 
Is it true monks that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you do this
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk gives his consent to legitimate legal procedures and then criticizes them afterwards he commits an offense entailing confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
A legitimate legal procedure
a legal procedure consisting of getting permission a legal procedure consisting of one motion a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements done according to the Teaching according to the Monastic Law according to the Teachers instruction This is called a legitimate legal procedure

The training rule on almsmeals at public guesthouses
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time a certain association was preparing an almsmeal at a public guesthouse not far from Sāvatthī
Then after robing up one morning the monks from the group of six took their bowl and robe and entered Sāvatthī for alms Not getting anything they went to that public guesthouse
And because it was long since they had been there people served them respectfully
For a second and third day those monks did the same thing
Then they thought
Whats the point of returning to the monastery
Tomorrow well just have to come back here
And so they stayed on and on right there eating alms at the guesthouse
And the ascetics of other religions left
People then complained and criticized them
How can these Sakyan ascetics stay on and on eating alms at the guesthouse
We dont prepare the almsfood just for them
we prepare it for everyone
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks
How can the monks from the group of six stay on and on eating alms at a public guesthouse 
Is it true monks that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you stay on and on eating alms at a public guesthouse
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk eats more than one almsmeal at a public guesthouse he commits an offense entailing confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Soon afterwards Venerable Sāriputta was traveling in the Kosalan country toward Sāvatthī when he came to a public guesthouse
Because it was long since he had been there people served him respectfully
After he had eaten Sāriputta became severely ill and he was not able to leave that guesthouse
On the second day too those people said to him
Eat Venerable
But since he knew that
the Buddha had prohibited eating alms at a public guesthouse after staying on and on and because he was afraid of wrongdoing he did not accept
As a consequence he missed his meal
When he arrived at Sāvatthī he told the monks what had happened
and they in turn told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks I allow a sick monk to stay on at a public guesthouse and eat alms there
 And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk who is not sick eats more than one almsmeal at a public guesthouse he commits an offense entailing confession
Who is not sick
he is able to leave that public guesthouse
Who is sick
he is not able to leave that public guesthouse
Almsmeal at a public guesthouse
as much as one needs of any of the five staple foods prepared for the general public in a building under a roofcover at the foot of a tree or out in the open
A monk who is not sick may eat there once
If he receives food beyond that with the intention of eating it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
For every mouthful he commits an offense entailing confession
If he is not sick and he perceives himself as not sick and he eats more than one almsmeal at a public guesthouse he commits an offense entailing confession
If he is not sick but he is unsure of it and he eats more than one almsmeal at a public guesthouse he commits an offense entailing confession
If he is not sick but he perceives himself as sick and he eats more than one almsmeal at a public guesthouse he commits an offense entailing confession
If he is sick but he perceives himself as not sick he commits an offense of wrong conduct

If he is sick and he perceives himself as sick there is no offense
if he is not sick and he eats once
if he eats while coming or going
if he eats after being invited by the owners
if the food is prepared specifically for him
if there is not as much as he needs

which he got
While he was on probation he saw Upanandas brothers student and said to him
Ive committed an offense of intentional emission of semen I asked the Sangha for probation which I got Im now undergoing probation Please remember me as such
Do others who have committed this offense need to do the same
Venerable Upananda committed this offense and told me not to tell anyone
So did you conceal it
That monk then told other monks
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law

The chapter on offenses entailing confession
The subchapter on containing living beings
The training rule on a group of traveling thieves
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
a certain group of travelers was about to go south from Rājagaha
A monk said to those people
Let me travel with you
But were smuggling goods
Thats your business
The customs officers heard
about that group of travelers
They then blocked the road
caught the group confiscated the goods and asked that monk
Venerable why are you knowingly traveling with a group of thieves
And they detained him
After being released that monk went to Sāvatthī where he told the monks what had happened
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How could a monk knowingly travel by appointment with a group of thieves 
Is it true monk that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how could you do this
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk knowingly travels by appointment with a group of thieves even just to the next village he commits an offense entailing confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
Knowingly
he knows by himself or others have told him or the group of travelers has told him
A group of thieves
thieves who have done their deed or thieves who have not They are stealing from the king or smuggling
By appointment
if he makes an appointment like this the monk says Lets go and they reply Yes lets go Venerable or they say Lets go Venerable and the monk replies Yes lets go or the monk says Lets go today Lets go tomorrow or Lets go the day after tomorrow then he commits an offense of wrong conduct
Even just to the next village
when the villages are a chickens flight apart then for every next village he commits an offense entailing confession
When it is an uninhabited area a wilderness then for every six kilometers he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is a group of traveling thieves and he perceives it as such and he travels by appointment with them even just to the next village he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is a group of traveling thieves but he is unsure of it and he travels by appointment with them even just to the next village he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is a group of traveling thieves but he does not perceive it as such and he travels by appointment with them even just to the next village there is no offense
If the monk makes an appointment but the group does not express its agreement he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is not a group of traveling thieves but he perceives it as such he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is not a group of traveling thieves but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is not a group of traveling thieves and he does not perceive it as such there is no offense
if he goes but not by appointment
if the group has made an appointment but he has not expressed his agreement
if he goes but not according to the appointment
if he is insane
if he is the first offender
The sixth rule the training rule on a group of traveling thieves is finished
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing confession
The subchapter on naked ascetics
The training rule on Mahānāma
At one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery
At that time Mahānāma the Sakyan had an abundance of tonics
He approached the Buddha bowed sat down and said
Venerable Sir I wish to invite the Sangha to ask for tonics from me for four months
Good good Mahānāma
Please do so
But the monks were afraid of wrongdoing and did not accept
They told the Buddha Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks I allow you to accept an invitation to supply tonics for four months
Yet the monks only asked Mahānāma for a small amount of tonics and so he still had an abundance
A second time he went to the Buddha bowed sat down and said
Sir I wish to invite the Sangha to ask for tonics from me for a further four months
Good good Mahānāma
Please do so
Again the monks were afraid of wrongdoing and did not accept
They told the Buddha 
Monks I allow you to accept a further invitation
Once again the monks only asked Mahānāma for a small amount of tonics and so he still had an abundance
A third time he went to the Buddha bowed sat down and said
Sir I wish to invite the Sangha to ask for tonics from me for life
Good good Mahānāma
Please do so
Yet again the monks were afraid of wrongdoing and did not accept
They told the Buddha 
Monks I allow you to accept a permanent invitation
At that time the monks from the group of six were shabbily dressed and improper in appearance
And Mahānāma criticized them Venerables why are you shabbily dressed and improper in appearance
Shouldnt one gone forth be suitably dressed and proper in appearance
The monks from the group of six developed a grudge against Mahānāma
Thinking of ways to humiliate him it occurred to them
Mahānāma has invited the Sangha to ask for tonics
Lets ask him for ghee
They then went to Mahānāma and said We need a doṇa measure of ghee
Please wait until tomorrow
People have gone to the cowpen to get ghee
You may come and get it tomorrow morning
A second time
and a third time the monks from the group of six said the same thing
and Mahānāma replied as before
They then said Why do you give an invitation if you dont wish to give
Mahānāma complained and criticized them How can they not wait for one day when asked
The monks heard the complaints of Mahānāma
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks
How can the monks from the group of six not wait for one day when asked by Mahānāma 
Is it true monks that you acted like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you not wait for one day when asked by Mahānāma
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
A monk who is not sick may accept an invitation to ask for requisites for four months If he accepts one beyond that limit except if it is a further invitation or a permanent invitation he commits an offense entailing confession
A monk who is not sick may accept an invitation to ask for requisites for four months
he may accept an invitation to ask for requisites for the sick
He may accept a further invitation
he should think When Im sick then Ill ask
He may accept a permanent invitation
he should think When Im sick then Ill ask
If he accepts one beyond that limit
there are invitations that have a limit on the tonics but no limit on the time period
there are invitations that have a limit on the time period but no limit on the tonics
there are invitations that have a limit on both the tonics and the time period

both the tonics and the time period are restricted I invite you to ask for these particular tonics during this particular period of time
A limit neither on the tonics nor on the time period
neither the tonics nor the time period is restricted
When there is a limit on the tonics if he asks for tonics other than those he has been invited to ask for he commits an offense entailing confession
When there is a limit on the time period if he asks outside of the period during which he has been invited to ask he commits an offense entailing confession
When there is a limit on both the tonics and on the time period if he asks for tonics other than those he has been invited to ask for and he asks outside of the period during which he has been invited to ask he commits an offense entailing confession
When there is a limit neither on the tonics nor on the time period there is no offense
If he asks for tonics when he has no need for tonics he commits an offense entailing confession
If he asks for a tonic other than the tonic he needs he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is beyond the limit and he perceives it as such and he asks for tonics he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is beyond the limit but he is unsure of it and he asks for tonics he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is beyond the limit but he does not perceive it as such and he asks for tonics he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is not beyond the limit but he perceives it as such he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is not beyond the limit but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is not beyond the limit and he does not perceive it as such there is no offense

if he asks during the time period that he was invited to ask
if he asks by informing You have invited me to ask for these tonics but I need suchandsuch a tonic
if he asks by informing The time period during which you invited me to ask has passed but I need tonics
if it is from those who have given an invitation
if it is for the benefit of someone else
if it is by means of his own property
if he is insane
if he is the first offender

Homage to the Buddha the Perfected One the fully Awakened One
Venerables these ninetytwo rules on confession come up for recitation
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time Hatthaka the Sakyan had been beaten in debate
While talking with the ascetics of other religions he would assert things after denying them and he would deny things after asserting them He evaded the issues lied and made sham appointments
The ascetics of other religions complained and criticized him When Hatthaka talks with us how can he assert things after denying them deny things after asserting them evade the issues lie and make sham appointments
The monks heard the complaints of those ascetics of other religions
and they went to Hatthaka and said
Is it true Hatthaka that youre acting like this
These ascetics of other religions should be beaten whatever it takes
They shouldnt be allowed to win
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him
When Hatthaka talks with the ascetics of other religions how can he assert things after denying them deny things after asserting them evade the issues lie and make sham appointments
After rebuking Hatthaka in many ways they told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Hatthaka
Is it true Hatthaka that youre acting like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man when you talk with the ascetics of other religions how can you assert things after denying them deny things after asserting them evade the issues lie and make sham appointments

had a robe that was worn out
Just then the Sangha had obtained a robe
which it gave it to Dabba
The monks from the group of six complained and criticized it
The monks are diverting the Sanghas material gains according to friendship
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six give out a robe as part of a unanimous Sangha and then criticize it afterwards 
Is it true monks that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you do this
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it

At that time it was winter and the monks put furniture outside in order to warm themselves in the sun But when the time for departure was announced they departed without putting it away having it put away or taking leave
And the furniture was rained on
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can those monks put furniture outside and then depart without putting it away having it put away or taking leave The furniture was rained on
After rebuking those monks in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that you did this
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk takes a bed a bench a mattress or a stool belonging to the Sangha and puts it outside or has it put outside and he then departs without putting it away having it put away or taking leave he commits an offense entailing confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Soon afterwards monks who had stayed outside brought the furniture back even though it was not the rainy season
The Buddha saw this
and after giving a teaching he addressed the monks
Monks during the eight months outside of the rainy season I allow you to store furniture under a roofcover or at the foot of a tree or wherever crows or ravens dont leave droppings
The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case

At that time in Rājagaha there was a hilltop fair
and the monks from the group of seventeen went to see it
When people saw the monks they bathed them anointed them fed them staples and gave them nonstaple food
The monks brought that food back to the monastery And they said to the monks from the group of six
Take food and eat it
But where did you get this food
And they told them
So are you eating at the wrong time
The monks from the group of six complained and criticized them
How can those monks from the group of seventeen eat at the wrong time
They told the monks
The monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks
How can those monks from the group of seventeen eat at the wrong time 
Is it true monks that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you eat at the wrong time
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing confession
The subchapter on plants
The training rule on evasive speech
At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghositas Monastery
At that time Venerable Channa was misbehaving Then when he was examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha he spoke evasively
Who has committed an offense What offense has been committed In regard to what has an offense has been committed How has an offense been committed Who are you talking about What are you talking about
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How can Venerable Channa speak evasively like this when he is examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha
Is it true Channa that you are speaking like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha how can you speak evasively like this
Who has committed an offense What offense has been committed In regard to what has an offense has been committed How has an offense been committed Who are you talking about What are you talking about
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
and after rebuking him 
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Well then monks the Sangha should charge Channa with evasive speech
And he is to be charged like this
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The monk Channa speaks evasively when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should charge him with evasive speech
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The monk Channa speaks evasively when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha
The Sangha is charging him with evasive speech
Any monk who approves of charging him with evasive speech should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has charged the monk Channa with evasive speech
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
After rebuking Channa in many ways for being difficult to support 
the Buddha said And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk speaks evasively he commits an offense entailing confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Later when Channa was again being examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha he thought
By speaking evasively Ill commit an offenses and he instead harassed the Sangha by remaining silent
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him
When hes examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha how can Venerable Channa harass the Sangha by remaining silent
Is it true Channa that you are acting like this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man when youre examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha how can you harass the Sangha by remaining silent
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
and after rebuking him 
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Well then monks the Sangha should charge Channa with harassment
And he is to be charged like this
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The monk Channa when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha harasses the Sangha by remaining silent
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should charge him with harassment
Please Venerables I ask the Sangha to listen
The monk Channa when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha harasses the Sangha by remaining silent
The Sangha is charging him with harassment
Any monk who approves of charging him of harassment should remain silent
Any monk who does not approve should speak up
The Sangha has charged the monk Channa with harassment
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thus
After rebuking Channa in many ways for being difficult to support 
the Buddha said And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk speaks evasively or harasses he commits an offense entailing confession
One who speaks evasively
when being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an action that was the basis for an offense or about the class of an offense he speaks evasively because he does not want to talk about it or reveal it saying Who has committed an offense What offense has been committed In regard to what has an offense has been committed How has an offense been committed Who are you talking about What are you talking aboutthis is called one who speaks evasively
One who harasses
when being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an action that was the basis for an offense or about the class of an offense he harasses the Sangha by remaining silent because he does not want to talk about it or reveal itthis is called one who harasses
If he has not been charged with evasive speech but he is being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an action that was the basis for an offense or about the class of an offense and he then speaks evasively because he does not want to talk about it or reveal it saying
Who has committed an offense What offense has been committed In regard to what has an offense has been committed How has an offense been committed Who are you talking about What are you talking about then he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he has not been charged with harassment but he is being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an action that was the basis for an offense or about the class of an offense and he then harasses the Sangha by remaining silent because he does not want to talk about it or reveal it then he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he has been charged with evasive speech and he is being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an action that was the basis for an offense or about the class of an offense and he then speaks evasively because he does not want to talk about it or reveal it saying
Who has committed an offense What offense has been committed In regard to what has an offense has been committed How has an offense been committed Who are you talking about What are you talking about then he commits an offense entailing confession
If he has been charged with harassment and he is being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an action that was the basis for an offense or about the class of an offense and he then harasses the Sangha by remaining silent because he does not want to talk about it or reveal it then he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is a legitimate legal procedure and he perceives it as such and he speaks evasively and he harasses he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is a legitimate legal procedure but he is unsure of it and he speaks evasively and he harasses he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is a legitimate legal procedure but he perceives it as illegitimate and he speaks evasively and he harasses he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure but he perceives it as legitimate he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure and he perceives it as such he commits an offense of wrong conduct
if he asks because he does not know
if he does not speak because he is sick
if he does not speak because he thinks there will be quarrels or disputes in the Sangha
if he does not speak because he thinks there will be a fracture or schism in the Sangha
if he does not speak because he thinks the legal procedure will be illegitimate done by an incomplete assembly or done to one who does not deserve a legal procedure
if he is insane
if he is the first offender

The husband complained and criticized him
How can Venerable Upananda sit down in private alone with my wife
The monks heard the complaints of that man
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda
How can Venerable Upananda sit down in private alone with a woman 
Is it true Upananda that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you sit down in private alone with a woman
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk sits down in private alone with a woman he commits an offense entailing confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
a human female not a female spirit not a female ghost not a female animal She understands and is capable of discerning bad speech and good speech what is decent and what is indecent
just the monk and the woman
there is private to the eye and there is private to the ear
Private to the eye

The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six live do formal meetings and share a sleeping place with the monk Ariṭṭha even though they know that hes saying such things that he hasnt made amends according to the rule and that he hasnt given up that view 
Is it true monks that you do this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you do this
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk lives does formal meetings or shares a sleeping place with a monk whom he knows is saying such things who has not made amends according to the rule and who has not given up that view he commits an offense entailing confession

he knows by himself or others have told him or the offender has told him
Whom is saying such things
one who says this As I understand the Buddhas Teaching the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them
Who has not made amends according to the rule
who has been ejected and not reinstated
With a monk who has not given up that view
with a monk who has not given up this view
Lives with

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time the senior monks were instructing the nuns in turn and on one occasion it was the turn of Venerable Cūḷapanthaka
The nuns said Today the instruction wont be effective since Venerable Cūḷapanthaka will just be repeating the same utterance over and over
Soon afterwards those nuns went to Cūḷapanthaka bowed and sat down
Cūḷapanthaka then said to them Are you all present Sisters
Were all present Venerable
Are you keeping the eight important principles
After saying This is the instruction he spoke the same utterance again and again
For the heedful one possessed of the higher mind
For the sage training on the path to sagacity
There are no sorrows for such a one
The peaceful one who is always mindful
And the nuns said Didnt we say that the instruction wouldnt be effective that Venerable Cūḷapanthaka would just be repeating the same utterance over and over
But Cūḷapanthaka overheard that conversation between the nuns
He then rose up into the air walked back and forth in space and he stood sat down and lay down there He emitted smoke and fire and he disappeared all the while speaking the same utterance and many other sayings by the Buddha
And the nuns said
Its astonishing and amazing
No previous instruction has been as effective as this one from Venerable Cūḷapanthaka
And Cūḷapanthaka kept on instructing those nuns until the dark of night and then dismissed them saying Go Sisters
But because the gates to the town were closed those nuns stayed the night outside and entered early in the morning
People complained and criticized them These nuns arent celibate
They spend the night in the monastery with the monks and only now do they enter the town
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Cūḷapanthaka
How can Venerable Cūḷapanthaka instruct the nuns after the sun has set
Is it true Cūḷapanthaka that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Cūḷapanthaka how can you instruct the nuns after the sun has set
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
Even if he has been agreed upon if a monk instructs the nuns after sunset he commits an offense entailing confession
Has been agreed upon
Has been agreed upon through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements
After sunset
after the sun has gone down
they have been given the full ordination by both Sanghas
if he instructs in the eight important principles or he gives any other teaching he commits an offense entailing confession
If the sun has set and he perceives that it has and he instructs the nuns he commits an offense entailing confession
If the sun has set but he is unsure of it and he instructs the nuns he commits an offense entailing confession
If the sun has set but he perceives that it has not and he instructs the nuns he commits an offense entailing confession
If he instructs a nun who is fully ordained only on one side he commits an offense of wrong conduct

People complained and criticized them
How can the Sakyan ascetics eat fine foods that they themselves have asked for
Who doesnt like nice food Who doesnt prefer tasty food
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks
How can the monks from the group of six do this 
Is it true monks that you do this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you do this
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk asks for any of these kinds of fine foods for himselfthat is ghee butter oil honey syrup fish meat milk and curdand then eats it he commits an offense entailing confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
At one time a number of monks were sick
The monks who were looking after them asked
We hope youre bearing up we hope youre getting better
Previously we ate fine foods that we ourselves had asked for and then we were comfortable
But now that the Buddha has prohibited this we dont ask because were afraid of wrongdoing And because of that were not comfortable
They told the Buddha
Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks I allow a sick monk to eat fine foods that he himself has asked for
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk who is not sick asks for any of these kinds of fine foods for himselfthat is ghee butter oil honey syrup fish meat milk and curdand then eats it he commits an offense entailing confession
These kinds of fine foods
ghee from cows ghee from goats ghee from buffaloes or ghee from whatever animal whose meat is allowable
butter from those same animals
sesame oil mustardseed oil honeytree oil castor oil oil from fat
honey from bees
from sugarcane
what lives in water is what is meant
the meat of those animals whose meat is allowable
milk from cows milk from goats milk from buffaloes or milk from whatever animal whose meat is allowable
curd from those same animals
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
Any of these kinds of fine foods
such kinds of fine foods
Who is not sick
who is comfortable without fine foods
Who is sick
who is not comfortable without fine foods
If he is not sick and he asks for himself then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct
When he receives it with the intention of eating it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
For every mouthful he commits an offense entailing confession
If he is not sick and he does not perceive himself as sick and he eats fine foods that he himself has asked for he commits an offense entailing confession
If he is not sick but he is unsure of it and he eats fine foods that he himself has asked for he commits an offense entailing confession

Venerable Upananda the Sakyan was quarreling with the monks from the group of six
At that time Upananda committed an offense of intentional emission of semen He then asked the Sangha for probation for that offense
which he received
Just then an association in Sāvatthī was offering a meal to the Sangha
Because Upananda was on probation he was seated on the last seat in the dining hall
The monks from the group of six then told those lay followers
This Venerable Upananda the esteemed associate of your families eats the food given in faith with the same hand he uses to emit semen
After committing an offense of intentional emission of semen he asked the Sangha for probation for that offense
which he received
And because hes on probation hes seated on the last seat in the dining hall
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six tell a person whos not fully ordained about a monks grave offense 
Is it true monks that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you tell a person whos not fully ordained about a monks grave offense
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk tells a person who is not fully ordained about a monks grave offense except if the monks have agreed he commits an offense entailing confession

about kings gangsters and officials about armies dangers and battles about food drink clothes and beds about garlands and perfumes about relatives vehicles villages towns and countries about women and heroes gossip about the departed about various trivialities about the world and the sea about the various kinds of existence
People complained and criticized them
How can the Sakyan ascetics enter the village at the wrong time sit down in the public meeting hall and talk about such pointless things
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks
How can the monks from the group of six do this

Soon afterwards a number of monks were walking through the Kosalan country toward Sāvatthī when one evening they came to a certain village
People saw them and said
Venerables please enter the village
But knowing that entering a village at the wrong time had been prohibited by the Buddha and being afraid of wrongdoing they declined
And so thieves robbed them
They then went to Sāvatthī and told the monks what had happened
who in turn told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks I allow you to enter an inhabited area at the wrong time after taking leave
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this

Another monk went to the village to get fire
He then remembered
that the Buddha has prohibited entering a village at the wrong time without taking leave of an available monk And being afraid of wrongdoing he did not enter
They told the Buddha

At that time the Buddha gave many talks about the Monastic Law spoke in praise of the Monastic Law and of learning the Monastic Law and repeatedly praised Venerable Upāli
When the monks heard this they thought
Well then lets learn the Monastic Law from Venerable Upāli And many monks both senior and junior as well as those of middle standing learned the Monastic Law from Upāli
The monks from the group of six
considered this and thought
If these monks become wellversed in the Monastic Law theyll boss us around as they like
So lets disparage the Monastic Law
They approached the other monks and said
Whats the point of reciting these minor and insignificant training rules when they just lead to anxiety oppression and annoyance
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six disparage the Monastic Law 
Is it true monks that you do this

 Foolish men how can do this
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
When the Monastic Code is being recited if a monk says Whats the point of reciting these minor and insignificant training rules when they just lead to anxiety oppression and annoyance then in disparaging the training rules he commits an offense entailing confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
When the Monastic Code is being recited
when reciting it when having it recited or when practicing it
Whats the point of reciting these minor and insignificant training rules when they just lead to anxiety oppression and annoyance
If he disparages the Monastic Law to one who is fully ordained saying Those who learn this will be anxious They will feel oppressed They will be annoyed Those who dont learn this wont be anxious They wont feel oppressed They wont be annoyed Its better left unrecited Its better left unlearned Its better left unstudied Its better left unmastered May the Monastic Law disappear or may these monks remain ignorant then he commits an offense entailing confession
If he disparages the Monastic Law to one who is fully ordained and he perceives them as fully ordained he commits an offense entailing confession
If he disparages the Monastic Law to one who is fully ordained but he is unsure of it he commits an offense entailing confession
If he disparages the Monastic Law to one who is fully ordained but he does not perceive them as fully ordained he commits an offense entailing confession

the monks from the group of seventeen were playing in the water of the river Aciravatī
Just then King Pasenadi of Kosala was up in his best stilt house with queen Mallikā
and he saw the monks from the group of seventeen playing in the river
He said to queen Mallikā
Mallikā these perfected ones are playing in the water
Great King no doubt the Buddha hasnt laid down a rule
Either that or these monks are ignorant of the rules
King Pasenadi thought
How can the Buddha find out about these monks playing in the water without me telling him
King Pasenadi then summoned those monks and gave them a large lump of sugar saying
Venerables please give this lump of sugar to the Buddha
The monks took the lump of sugar and went to the Buddha
They said
Venerable Sir this lump of sugar is a gift from King Pasenadi
But monks where did you see the king
From the river Aciravatī while we were playing in the water
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you play in water
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it

The training rule on giving robecloth
On one occasion when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
a certain monk was walking for almsfood along a street in Sāvatthī as was a certain nun
And that monk said to that nun Go to suchandsuch a place Sister and youll get alms
and she said the same to him
And because they met frequently they became friends
Just then robecloth belonging to the Sangha was being distributed
Then after going to the instruction that nun approached that monk and bowed
He then said to her Sister will you accept my share of the robecloth
Yes Venerable my robes are worn
And he gave his robecloth to that nun
As a consequence his robes too became worn
Other monks said to him Why dont you make a robe for yourself
And he told them what had happened
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How can a monk give robecloth to a nun 
Is it true monk that you did this
Its true Sir
Is she a relative of yours
Foolish man a man and a woman who are not related dont know whats appropriate and whats inappropriate in dealing with each other whats right and whats wrong
And still you gave robecloth to an unrelated nun
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk gives robecloth to an unrelated nun he commits an offense entailing confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Once this had happened monks did not even give robecloth to nuns in exchange being afraid of wrongdoing
The nuns complained and criticized them
How can they not give us robecloth in exchange
The monks heard the complaints of those nuns
and they told the Buddha
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks if it is part of an exchange I allow you to give things to five kinds of people
monks nuns trainee nuns novice monks and novice nuns
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk gives robecloth to an unrelated nun except if it is an exchange he commits an offense entailing confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
Unrelated
anyone who is not a descendant of ones male ancestors going back seven generations either on the mothers side or on the fathers side
she has been given the full ordination by both Sanghas
Robecloth
one of the six kinds of robecloth but not smaller than what can be transferred to another
Except if it is an exchange
unless it is an exchange
If she is unrelated and he perceives her as such and he gives her robecloth except if it is an exchange he commits an offense entailing confession
If she is unrelated but he is unsure of it and he gives her robecloth except if it is an exchange he commits an offense entailing confession
If she is unrelated but he perceives her as related and he gives her robecloth except if it is an exchange he commits an offense entailing confession
If he gives robecloth to a nun who is fully ordained only on one side except if it is an exchange he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If she is related but he perceives her as unrelated he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If she is related but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If she is related and he perceives her as such there is no offense
if much is exchanged with little or little is exchanged with much
if the nun takes it on trust
if she borrows it
if he gives any requisite apart from robecloth
if it is a trainee nun
if it is a novice nun
if he is insane

The training rule on Kāṇamātu
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time there was a female lay follower Kāṇamātā who had faith and confidence
She had a daughter Kāṇā who had been given in marriage to a man in a certain village
On one occasion Kāṇā went to her mothers house on some business
Kāṇās husband sent her a message Please come Kāṇā I want you back
Kāṇamātā thought Its shameful to go emptyhanded and she baked pastries
Just when the pastries were finished an almscollecting monk entered Kāṇamātās house and she gave him pastries
After leaving he told another monk and he too was given pastries
And the same happened a third time
At that all the pastries were gone
A second time Kāṇās husband sent her the same message and everything unfolded as before
A third time he sent the same message
adding If Kāṇā doesnt come Ill find another wife
But once again all the pastries were given to monks
Kāṇās husband found another wife
and when Kāṇā heard what had happened she cried
Soon afterwards after robing up in the morning the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Kāṇamātās house where he sat down on a prepared seat
Kāṇamātā approached the Buddha bowed and sat down
The Buddha asked her why Kāṇā was crying and she told him what had happened
After instructing inspiring and gladdening her with a teaching the Buddha got up from his seat and left
Soon afterwards a certain caravan was ready to go south from Rājagaha
An almscollecting monk approached that caravan to get almsfood
and a lay follower gave him flour
After leaving that monk told another monk and he too was given flour
And the same happened a third time
At that all the flour was gone
That lay follower said to the other people in the caravan
Sirs please wait one day Ive given my provisions to the monks
and I need to prepare more provisions
We cant wait the caravan is going already And they left
After preparing provisions that lay follower followed after the caravan but he was robbed by thieves
People complained and criticized them
How can the Sakyan ascetics receive without moderation
This man gave to them and then because he was following after the caravan he was robbed by thieves
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha
Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Well then monks I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons
for the wellbeing of the Sangha for the comfort of the Sangha for the restraint of bad people for the ease of wellbehaved monks for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives to give rise to confidence in those without it to increase the confidence of those who have it for the longevity of the true Teaching and for supporting the training
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk approaches a family and is invited to take pastries or baked goods he may accept two or three bowlfuls if he wishes If he accepts more than that he commits an offense entailing confession
If he accepts two or three bowlfuls he should take it away and share it with the monks
This is the proper procedure
A monk approaches a family
a family there are four kinds of family the aristocratic family the brahmin family the merchant family the worker family
he has gone there
whatever has been prepared for the purpose of sending away
Baked goods
whatever has been prepared as provisions for a journey
Is invited to take
saying Take as much as you like
If he wishes
if he desires
He may accept two or three bowlfuls
two or three bowlfuls can be accepted
If he accepts more than that
if he receives more than that commits an offense entailing confession
If he accepts two or three bowlfuls
leaving that place and seeing a monk he should tell him Ive accepted two or three bowlfuls from suchandsuch a place dont receive anything from there
If he sees a monk but does not tell him he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If one who is told accepts from there regardless he commits an offense of wrong conduct
He should take it away and share it with the monks
he should take it away when he is returning from almsround and then share it
This is the proper procedure
this is the right method
If it is more than two or three bowlfuls and he perceives it as more and he receives it he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is more than two or three bowlfuls but he is unsure of it and he receives it he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is more than two or three bowlfuls but he perceives it as less and he receives it he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is less than two or three bowlfuls but he perceives it as more he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is less than two or three bowlfuls but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is less than two or three bowlfuls and he perceives it as less there is no offense
if he accepts two or three bowlfuls
if he accepts less than two or three bowlfuls
if they give anything that has not been prepared for sending away or for provisions for a journey
if they give the leftovers from what was prepared for sending away or for provisions for a journey
if they give after the plans to travel have been canceled
if it is from those who have given an invitation
if it is for the benefit of someone else
if it is by means of his own property
if he is insane
if he is the first offender

The training rule on appointments
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
a monk who was traveling through the Kosalan country toward Sāvatthī walked through the gateway of a certain village
A woman who had had an argument with her husband walked through the same gateway When she saw that monk she asked him
Venerable where are you going
Im going to Sāvatthī
May I go with you
Soon afterwards that womans husband also left that village He asked around
Have you seen suchandsuch a woman
Shes walking along with an ascetic
He then followed after them caught that monk and gave him a beating
The monk sat down fuming at the foot of a tree
And the woman said to her husband
This monk didnt make me go
I was the one who went with him
Hes innocent
Go and ask his forgiveness
And he did so
That monk then went to Sāvatthī where he told the monks what had happened
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How could a monk travel by appointment with a woman 
Is it true monk that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how could do this
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk travels by appointment with a woman even just to the next village he commits an offense entailing confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
a human female not a female spirit not a female ghost not a female animal She understands and is capable of discerning bad speech and good speech what is indecent and what is decent
By appointment
if he makes an appointment like this he says Lets go and she replies Yes lets go Venerable or she says Lets go Venerable and he replies Yes lets go or he says Lets go today Lets go tomorrow or Lets go the day after tomorrow then he commits an offense of wrong conduct
Even just to the next village
when the villages are a chickens flight apart then for every next village he commits an offense entailing confession
When it is an uninhabited area a wilderness then for every six kilometers he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is a woman and he perceives her as such and he travels by appointment with her even just to the next village he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is a woman but he is unsure of it and he travels by appointment with her even just to the next village he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is a woman but he does not perceive her as such and he travels by appointment with her even just to the next village he commits an offense entailing confession
If the monk makes an appointment but the woman does not express her agreement he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he travels by appointment with a female spirit with a female ghost with a paṇḍaka with a female animal in the form of a woman even just to the next village he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is not a woman but he perceives it as such he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is not a woman but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it is not a woman and he does not perceive it as such there is no offense
if he goes but not by appointment
if the woman has made an appointment but he has not expressed his agreement
if he goes but not according to the appointment
if he is insane
if he is the first offender

The training rule on visiting
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuary
At that time a family that was supporting Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had invited him to a meal
and they had invited other monks too
But since Upananda was visiting other families before that meal
the other monks said to that family
Please give the meal
Please wait Sirs until Venerable Upananda arrives
A second time 
A third time those monks said
Please give the meal before the time for eating comes to an end
But we made the meal because of Venerable Upananda
Please wait until he arrives
Then after visiting those families Upananda arrived late
and those monks did not eat as much as they had intended
The monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda
How can Venerable Upananda visit families first when invited to a meal 
Is it true Upananda that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you visit families first when invited to a meal
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand he commits an offense entailing confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Soon afterwards a family that was supporting Upananda sent nonstaple food to the Sangha
They gave instructions that the food should be shown to Upananda and then given to the Sangha
On that occasion Upananda had entered the village for alms
When those people arrived at the monastery
they asked for Upananda
and they were told where he was
They said Venerables after showing it to Venerable Upananda this nonstaple food is to be given to the Sangha
The monks told the Buddha
who then gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Well then monks receive it and put it aside until Upananda returns
Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited visiting families before the meal Upananda visited them after the meal instead As a consequence he returned late to the monastery and the food had to be returned to the donors
The monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda
How can Venerable Upananda visit families after the meal 
Is it true Upananda that you do this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you visit families after the meal
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand or afterwards he commits an offense entailing confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Soon afterwards it was the robegiving season But being afraid of wrongdoing the monks did not visit families
As a result they only obtained a small amount of robecloth
They told the Buddha 
Monks I allow you to visit families during the robegiving season
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand or afterwards except on an appropriate occasion he commits an offense entailing confession
This is the appropriate occasion it is the robegiving season
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Soon afterwards the monks were making robes and they needed a needle thread and scissors
But being afraid of wrongdoing they did not visit families
They told the Buddha 
Monks I allow you to visit families at a time of making robes
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand or afterwards except on an appropriate occasion he commits an offense entailing confession
These are the appropriate occasions it is the robegiving season it is a time of making robes
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Soon afterwards there were sick monks who needed medicines
But being afraid of wrongdoing the monks did not visit families
They told the Buddha 
Monks I allow you to visit families after taking leave of an available monk
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand or afterwards without taking leave of an available monk except on an appropriate occasion he commits an offense entailing confession
These are the appropriate occasions it is the robegiving season it is a time of making robes
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
invited to eat any of the five staple foods
To a meal
the invitation includes a meal
An available monk
he is able to take leave and then enter
No available monk
he is not able to take leave and then enter
Beforehand
he has not yet eaten what he has been invited to eat
Afterwards
even if he has just eaten what fits on the tip of a blade of grass from what he has been invited to eat
there are four kinds of family the aristocratic family the brahmin family the merchant family the worker family
Visits families
if he enters the vicinity of someone elses house he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he crosses the threshold with the first foot he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he crosses the threshold with the second foot he commits an offense entailing confession
Except on an appropriate occasion
unless it is an appropriate occasion
It is the robegiving season
for one who has not participated in the robemaking procedure it is the last month of the rainy season For one who has participated in the robemaking procedure it is the fivemonth period
It is a time of making robes
when he is making robes
If he has been invited and he perceives that he has and he visits families beforehand or afterwards without taking leave of an available monk except on an appropriate occasion he commits an offense entailing confession
If he has been invited but he is unsure of it and he visits families beforehand or afterwards without taking leave of an available monk except on an appropriate occasion he commits an offense entailing confession

The subchapter on precious things
The training rule on sitting mats
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
he allowed the sitting mat for the monks
Knowing this the monks from the group of six used sitting mats that were inappropriate in size
The sitting mats hung down from beds and benches both in front and behind
The monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks
How can the monks from the group of six use such sitting mats 
Is it true monks that you do this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you do this
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk is having a sitting mat made it is to be made the right size
This is the right size two standard handspans long and oneandahalf wide
If it exceeds that it is to be cut down and he commits an offense entailing confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
At that time there was a big monk called Venerable Udāyī
After putting out his sitting mat in front of the Buddha he stretched it on all sides before sitting down
The Buddha asked him
Udāyī why are you stretching the sitting mat on all sides
as if an old hide
Because Venerable Sir the sitting mat youve allowed for the monks is too small
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks I allow a border of one handspan for the sitting mat
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk is having a sitting mat made it should be made the right size
This is the right size two standard handspans long and oneandahalf wide and a border of one handspan
If it exceeds that it is to be cut down and he commits an offense entailing confession
A sitting mat
one with a border is what is meant
Is having made
making it himself or having someone else make it it should be made the right size
This is the right size two standard handspans long and oneandahalf wide and a border of one handspan
If he makes one or has one made that exceeds that then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct
When he obtains it it is to be cut down and he is then to confess an offense entailing confession
If he finishes what he began himself he commits an offense entailing confession
If he has others finish what he began himself he commits an offense entailing confession
If he finishes himself what was begun by others he commits an offense entailing confession
If he has others finish what was begun by others he commits an offense entailing confession
If he makes one or has one made for the benefit of someone else he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If he obtains one that was made by someone else and then uses it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
if he makes it the right size
if he makes it less than the right size
if he obtains one made by another that exceeds the right size and then cuts it down before using it
if he makes a canopy a floor cover a cloth screen a mattress or a pillow
if he is insane
if he is the first offender

At that time the monks from the group of six had taken possession of the best sleeping places but the senior monks made them move
They thought
What can we do so that we may dwell here during the rainy season
They then arranged their sleeping places in a way that encroached on the senior monks thinking
Those who feel crowded will leave
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them
How can the monks from the group of six arrange their sleeping places in a way that encroaches on the senior monks
After rebuking those monks in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks
Is it true monks that you did this

The Buddha rebuked them
 Foolish men how can you arrange your sleeping places in a way that encroaches on the senior monks
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If in a dwelling belonging to the Sangha a monk arranges his sleeping place in a way that encroaches on a monk that he knows arrived there before him with the intention that anyone who feels crowded will leave and he does so only for this reason and no other he commits an offense entailing confession
The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing confession
The subchapter on eating
The training rule on tooth cleaners
At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood
At that time a monk who only used discarded things was staying in a charnel ground
He disliked receiving what was given by people Instead he would take whatever was offered to the dead at charnel grounds at the foot of trees or at thresholds and he would use that
People complained and criticized him
How can this monk take the offerings to our ancestors and use them
This monk is big and strong One might even suspect him of eating human flesh
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How can this monk eat food that hasnt been given 
Is it true monk that you do this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you eat food that hasnt been given
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk eats food that has not been given he commits an offense entailing confession
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks
Soon afterwards the monks did not use water or tooth cleaners because they were afraid of wrongdoing
They told the Buddha Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks
Monks I allow you to use water and tooth cleaners after taking them yourselves
And so monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk eats food that has not been given except for water and tooth cleaners he commits an offense entailing confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
That has not been given
what has not been received is what is meant
standing within arms reach of one giving by body or by what is connected to his body or by releasing he receives it by body or by what is connected to his bodythis is called given
whatever is edible apart from water and tooth cleanersthis is called food
Except for water and tooth cleaners
apart from water and tooth cleaners
If he takes it with the intention of eating it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
For every mouthful he commits an offense entailing confession
If it has not been received and he does not perceive it as received and he eats it except for water and tooth cleaners he commits an offense entailing confession
If it has not been received but he is unsure of it and he eats it except for water and tooth cleaners he commits an offense entailing confession
If it has not been not received but he perceives it as such and he eats it except for water and tooth cleaners he commits an offense entailing confession
If it has been received but he does not perceive it as received he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it has been received but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conduct
If it has been received and he perceives it as such there is no offense
if it is water or tooth cleaners
if when there is a reason but there is no attendant he himself takes the four filthy edibles and eats them
if he is insane
if he is the first offender
The tenth rule the training rule on tooth cleaners is finished
The fourth subchapter on eating is finished

The training rule on sitting in private
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
At that time the former wife of Venerable Udāyī had been given the full ordination as a nun
She often went to see Udāyī and he often went to see her
And on one occasion Udāyī was seated in private alone with that nun
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him
How can Venerable Udāyī sit in private alone with a nun 
Is it true Udāyī that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you sit in private alone with a nun
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk sits in private alone with a nun he commits an offense entailing confession
 The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this case
she has been given the full ordination by both Sanghas

Private to the ear

if the monk sits down or lies down next to a seated nun he commits an offense entailing confession
If a nun sits down or lies down next to the seated monk he commits an offense entailing confession
If both are seated or both are lying down he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is private and he perceives it as private and he sits down alone with a nun he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is private but he is unsure of it and he sits down alone with a nun he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is private but he perceives it as not private and he sits down alone with a nun he commits an offense entailing confession
If it is not private but he perceives it as private he commits an offense of wrong conduct

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing confession
The subchapter on lying
The training rule on telling truthfully
At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood
At that time a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainyseason residence on the banks of the river Vaggumudā
Just then Vajjī was short of food and afflicted with hunger with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw and it was not easy to get by on almsfood
The monks considered the difficult circumstances and they thought How can we remain united and in harmony have a comfortable rainy season and get almsfood without trouble
Some said We could do work for the householders and theyll give something in return
In this way well be united and in harmony and well spend the rainy season in comfort and have no trouble getting almsfood
Some said Theres no need to do work for the householders
Lets instead take messages for them and theyll give something in return
In this way well be united and in harmony and well spend the rainy season in comfort and have no trouble getting almsfood
Some said Theres no need to do work for the householders nor to take messages for them
Lets instead praise one anothers superhuman qualities to the householders
Such a monk has the first absorption such a monk the second absorption such a monk the third such a monk the fourth such a monk is a streamenterer such a monk a oncereturner such a nonreturner such a perfected one such a monk has the three true insights and such the six direct knowledges
Then theyll give to us
In this way well be united and in harmony and well spend the rainy season in comfort and have no trouble getting almsfood
Indeed this is the better way that we praise one anothers superhuman qualities to the householders
Then they praised each others superhuman qualities to the householders
Such a monk has the first absorption  such a monk has the six direct knowledges
And those people thought Were fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rainyseason residence Such monks as these who are virtuous and of good character have never before entered the rains residence with us
And they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves or give to their parents to their wives and children to their slaves servants and workers to their friends and companions or to their relatives
In this way those monks became satisfied with a good color a bright face and clear skin
Now it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainyseason residence to go and visit the Buddha
So when they had competed the rains residence and the three months had elapsed those monks put their dwellings in order took their bowls and robes and left for Vesālī
When they eventually arrived at Vesālī they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood
There they approached the Buddha bowed and sat down
At that time the monks who had completed the rains residence in that region were thin haggard and pale their veins protruding all over their limbs
But the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā were satisfied with a good color a bright face and clear skin
Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks
the Buddha said to them
I hope youre keeping well monks I hope youre comfortable
I hope you had a comfortable rains residence in concord and harmony without dispute and that you had no trouble getting almsfood
Were keeping well Venerable Sir were comfortable
we had a comfortable rains residence in concord and harmony without dispute and we had no trouble getting almsfood
When Buddhas know what is going on sometimes they ask and sometimes not
they know the right time to ask and the right time not to ask
Buddhas ask when it is beneficial not when it is unbeneficial
for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial
Buddhas question the monks for two reasons to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule
And the Buddha said to those monks In what way monks did you had a comfortable rains residence without having any trouble getting almsfood
And they told the Buddha what had happened
But had you really achieved those superhuman qualities
Yes Sir
The Buddha rebuked them
Monks how can you for the sake of your stomachs praise one anothers superhuman qualities to householders
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
If a monk truthfully tells a person who is not fully ordained of a superhuman quality he commits an offense entailing confession

That monk told the monks
Venerable Upananada is using a robe that he has transferred to me even though I havent relinquished it
The monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda
How can Venerable Upananda use a robe that he has transferred to a monk when that monk hasnt relinquished it 
Is it true Upananda that you do this

At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghositas Monastery
At that time a government official who was Venerable Channas supporter was making him a dwelling
When the dwelling was finished Channa had it roofed and plastered again and again
Being overloaded the dwelling collapsed
Then while collecting grass and sticks Channa spoiled the barley field belonging to a certain brahmin
That brahmin complained and criticized him
How can the venerables spoil my barley field
The monks heard the complaints of that brahmin
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Channa
How can Venerable Channa have a finished dwelling roofed and plastered again and again so that it collapsed from overloading
After rebuking him in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Channa
Is it true Channa that you did this
Its true Sir
The Buddha rebuked him
 Foolish man how can you have a finished dwelling roofed and plastered again and again so that it collapses from overloading
This wont give rise to confidence in those without it 
And monks this training rule should be recited like this
When a monk is building a large dwelling then standing where there are no cultivated plants he may apply two or three courses of roofing material taking it as far as the doorcase and using it for fixing the door and for treating the window openings
If he applies more than that even if he stands where there are no cultivated plants he commits an offense entailing confession
