In the beginning you have to put together the causes  in other words you have to make an effort to look and know correctlyAs for the letting go that comes afterwards The Buddha compared the training of the mind to holding a bird in your handThe mind is like a tiny bird and the question is how to hold the bird so that it doesnt fly awayIf you hold it too tightly it will die in your handIf you hold it too loosely the tiny bird will slip out through your fingersSo how are you going to hold it so that it doesnt die and doesnt get awayThe same holds true with our training of the mind in a way thats not too tense and not too lax but always just rightThere are many things you have to know in training the mind and you have to look after them correctlyOn the physical side you have to change postures in a way thats balanced and just right so that the mind can stay at normalcy so that it can stay at a natural level of stillness or emptiness continuouslyPhysical exercise is also necessaryEven yogis who practice high levels of concentration have to exercise the body by stretching and bending it in various posturesWe dont have to go to extremes like them but we can exercise enough so that the mind can maintain its stillness naturally in a way that allows it to contemplate physical and mental phenomena to see them as inconstant stressful and notselfIf you force the mind too much it dies just like the bird held too tightlyIn other words it grows deadened insensitive and will simply stay frozen in stillness without contemplating to see what inconstancy stress and notselfness are likeOur practice is to make the mind still enough so that it can contemplate inconstancy stress and notselfnessThis is the point for which we train and contemplate and that makes it easy to trainAs for changing postures or working and getting exercise we do these things with an empty mindWhen youre practicing in total seclusion you should get some physical exerciseIf you simply sit and lie down the flow of blood and breath energy in the body will get abnormal The fourth tetrad in the instructions for keeping the breath in mind begins with keeping track of inconstancy with every inandout breathThe main obstacle that makes us unable to maintain this kind of awareness for long or for continuous periods of time is the fact that we dont maintain our awareness with every inandout breathWhen things grow empty we just let the mind grow quiet without focusing without contemplating so everything drifts or grows blurryOr some sort of fabrication arises easily so that we cant focus on the empty mindSo when any crude fabrication arises you have to block it by focusing on the breathUse the breath to snuff it outWhether the fabrication is a tiny or a strong sensation catch hold of the breath as your first step in protecting yourselfThe more often you do this the more it turns into a normal habit  and the more useful it will beSimply staying with the breath can help prevent unskillful thinking  in other words it can keep the mind from fabricating unskillful thoughtsThat way craving for sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations cant take shapeWhatever youre aware of quickly focus on the breath and whatever it is it will simply stop and disband When the mind is very refined and very still if you dont maintain your focus your still awareness can blur or grow distractedSo you have to keep your mindfulness in focusBreathe deeply and heavily as a way of waking the mind upDont let it grow quiet in an unfocused wayYou have to focus on seeing the condition of emptiness within the mind thats a primal part of its natureIf you can do this theres not much else to the practiceSimply keep the mind under the control of mindfulness and the breathIn other words focus on watching it knowing itEven if theres some thinking that helps in your knowing keep it shortDont let it grow longWhatever the reflection or the contemplation keep it shortDont let it grow longIf its long it will turn into distractionUse the breath as a means of cutting it offWhen your thinking starts getting long make it stopKeep it as short as possibleMake it stop as short as possibleKeep your still selfawareness as clear and bright as possible seeing that it doesnt have any self The mind that maintains itself in a state of normalcy is like a white cloth or a white sheet of paperYou have to keep focused on keeping watch over it to see when theres any sensory contact how the mind wavers in reaction how it labels things as good or bad or self This is something you have to learn how to observe on a refined level Once the mind is quiet and empty your awareness really gets sharperSharp here means that it clearly sees the actual facts because it focuses its gaze until it sees clearlyIf youre looking at something and dont yet see clearly dont go looking anywhere elseKeep looking right there until you knowWhat does this knowing knowIt knows arisingRemainingPassing awayAnd it doesnt clingTo know in this way you have to keep abreast of fabrication of every sort whether it fabricates good or bad or neither good nor badIf youre not yet capable of contemplating the mind then contemplate the body to see how its composed of the four elements earth water wind and fireYou have to keep eating and excreting adding elements and excreting them all the timeEven just the affairs of the body  this walking corpse  are already a burdenWhen its hot you have to give it a shower when its cold you have to wrap it up in blankets when its sick you have to give it medicine when its hungry you have to give it foodYou have to look after it in just the right way otherwise it causes all sorts of problemsThey say that the mind is the master and the body the servantBut if craving becomes the minds master then the body will have two mastersJust think of how many conflicts that can causeThe mind is in bad straits and so is the body The physical body on its own is already painful and stressfulIf we fasten onto it that makes it even more painful and stressfulSo contemplate the body carefully to see that theres only the stress of conditions the stress of the aggregates but that theres no one to whom the stress belongs  and theres no defilement burning the heart Give up your fascination with worthless things with the good and bad things of the pastSweep them up and toss them outMake the mind free of clutterAnd once its free of clutter dont go gathering up things to clutter it up againFor example your mind is empty at the momentLook at it to see how things take shape and arise look at how they disappearLook at genuine nature right hereLook at the nature of how the mind receives its objects or how it receives contactIf you see correctly in line with the truth youll see that these things are all emptyTheres nothing true or lasting about them at allSimply look in a way that doesnt apply labelsWhen the eye sees sights or the ear hears sounds look at these things simply as natural eventsAs for the mind let it stay still free from any tendency to get involved by labeling things as good or badThat way desire wont arise to disturb the mindAsk yourself If you fall for these things and suffering follows as a result what do you get out of itYoull see that you dont get anything at allIts all emptyWhat you do get is the suffering that keeps the heart flusteredSo whatever you look at look to see its inconstancy thoroughly inside and outJust that will be enough to keep you from having to cling to anything When youre aware of sensory contact you dont want your awareness to stop just at the point where the eye sees a sight or the ear hears a soundYou have to know deeply into the eyeconsciousness that takes note of the sightThen focus on the sight to see its changes its decay and disbandingWhen theres the sensation of a sight you have to look to see whether the sight changes If you understand how to look you can see the changes in physical and mental phenomena of all kindsPhysical phenomena you can see with your eyesFor example a flower thats still fresh contains change and decay there in its freshnessIf you see its decay only when its withered and brown your contemplation is still crude still far from the truthNothing thats fabricated is stable or steady but we make up our own suppositions about these thingsThings change in the direction of development and in the direction of decayWe see these as two separate processes but actually both of them are decay Whenever theres sensory contact keep your focus turned inward on the mind continuouslyKeep it still and at normalcyAs for the contact simply know it as contact but keep your awareness of the mind as continuous as possible until your awareness all gathers togetherLet it gather into an awareness pure and simpleIf this awareness pure and simple can maintain its stance continuously it will become a means of reading and deciphering everything withinYou dont have to pay attention to the sensations of arising and passing awayFocus instead on the awareness pure and simple  in other words the awareness right at the mind or at the property of consciousness pure and simpleEven if youre aware of physical matters keep your awareness pure and simpleYou have to be observant when the mind has firmly established mindfulness and your awareness gathers so that youre aware of the property of consciousness pure and simple without any fabrication at all  an awareness pure and simple right at itselfTake that as your foundationIn the beginning we focus on the breath to keep the mind from wandering offWhen you focus on the breath as it grows more and more refined you get to the point where you dont have to focus on the breath any moreYou focus continually right at the mindYou focus right on the mind pure and simple without any fabrications without any labelsWhatever arises know it no further than that and keep your mindfulness continuous When the mind lies under the control of mindfulness without fabricating thoughts or getting distracted it will be quiet and awake withinWhen you focus directly on the mind it will stop and grow still naturallyYoull see that the mind is just an aspect of nature not your self or anything of the sortWhen you see clearly that its just an aspect of nature that will destroy any attachment to it as you or yoursWhether youre aware of form or feeling simply let them be aspects of nature  all of themThe mind wont be put to difficulties wont get stirred up with thoughts and fabricationsLet it stop and grow still simply by keeping abreast of itself with every moment To restrain the mind makes the sensations of sensory contact stop in their tracksIn other words simply being acquainted with the mind when mindfulness is focused on being aware of the mind allows sensory contacts to pass away naturally right in the presentThis is why people who are careless who dont develop restraint through mindfulness fall easily under the power of the defilementsRestraint through mindfulness is the first step  in other words the step where you maintain restraint by being mindfulWhen your mindfulness becomes continuous to the point where it becomes clear knowing thats called restraint through knowledgeTry to maintain this state of clear knowing within Restraint of the senses is for the purpose of seeing the movements of the mind  to see how the sensation of contact at the eye ear nose tongue body or mind turns into other sensations Your study of the Dhamma has to be a study inside not a study of written words or spoken wordsIt has to be a study of the mind pure and simple so that it will know its own features and characteristics while it maintains its normalcy or maintains itself in emptiness an emptiness that doesnt latch onto anythingIf you look at it again and again with every moment it will develop into a clear awareness of the characteristics of an aspect of nature fabricated from causes and conditions simply as its own nature pure and simpleOr there may be an awareness of another side of nature  even though the awareness may not be clear  of an aspect of nature free from fabricationHere Im referring to the mind thats empty or quiet on its own which can serve as a standard for comparisonThe aspect of the mind fabricated by conditions is simply natureDont enter into it to latch onto itAs for the aspect thats not fabricated thats simply empty in and of itself This too shouldnt be latched ontoSo when the mind is embroiled if you latch onto the idea that My mind is embroiled or if when the mind is empty you latch onto the idea that My mind is empty Both of these are equal in that no matter what you latch onto you have to sufferSo no matter how things change if you correctly know the truth of the Buddhas sabbe dhamma anatta  All phenomena are notself  youll simply be able to let go Stopping to look stopping to know your own mind is better than straying out to know things outside for when you stop to look stop to know youll see inconstancy stress and notselfness in a way that doesnt require wordsThis will be a knowing thats totally silent and still withinThe kind of insight that uses the words inconstant stressful and notself is imitation knowing not the real thingGenuine knowing sees the change happening with every moment right before your eyes right here and nowYou actually see whatever arises and how it passes awayAnd its always there for you to see right nowTheres nothing difficult about it at allSo if you know how to stop to look stop to know your own mind youll become acquainted with the Dhamma in a correct wayIf you look correctly seeing all the way through youll see how change involves arising remaining and passing away with every momentYoull see how change inherently involves stressBut you have to see all the way in in a profound wayIts not just a matter of repeating to yourself that these things are inconstant stressful and notselfYou really have to look in order to see how change is inherently stressfulYou dont have to call it stressful in your mind but you have to look until you see this truth clearly right in the stress itselfOnce youve seen that inconstancy is stressful youll see the nonselfness inherently there in the same place If you stay focused on disbanding this that and the other thing youve fallen for the deceits of inconstancy When you look at inconstancy or arising and passing away with true mindfulness and discernment there will have to be a sense of dismay disenchantment and dispassion If you know but are simply indifferent thats called not knowingYouve simply fooled yourself into thinking you know when you really haventGenuine knowing bright and clear to the heart is something else entirely  not at all the indifferent knowing that counts as delusion When you really know there has to be a sense of dismay a sense of urgency in getting everything out giving everything back a sense of urgency in seeing how things are not at all worthy of attachmentThats the kind of knowing you have to developIf you havent yet developed it you need to contemplate things over and over again whether youre sitting standing walking lying down eating excreting whateverYou need to be absorbed in contemplating these things as much as you canWhen you can do that youll enter into the DhammaIf the mind is still far away and distracted if its still concerned with this that and the other thing itll keep retreating further and further away until it falls slave to craving and defilement as before The chant for contemplating the four requisites is something very useful and beneficialYou have to keep training yourself not to get carried away in your consumption of the requisitesThe mindfulness that arises from this contemplation will then be full of discernmentWherever theres mindfulness there has to be alertness and selfawareness  which are the same thing as discernment Every aspect of the training that aims at making you contented with what you have helps keep the mind more empty than notOnce you see the value of these practices you should practice letting go of your desiresIf you simply follow your desires then if you get what you desire youre happyIf you dont you get all hot and botheredSo contemplate desire to see if its stressful  to see how its both stress and the cause of stress all in one Training the mind is refined workEven when knowledge arises if you decide on your own that it has to be right for sure youve failed the testNo matter what the knowledge If it can waver its fake knowledge deceptive knowledge not absolute knowledge When you latch onto your knowledge as correct that gives rise to wrong view in that very momentSo you have to keep stopping to look and to know all along the way until you see how your knowing turns into notknowingThis is because right knowing and wrong knowing are inherently intertwinedIts not the case that true knowing will stay as nothing but true knowingYou have to find the angle from which you can see how and where wrong knowing and wrong views will spring up When pride and conceit arise you have to make them turn around and contemplate themselves to see that theres no self to them  and so when thats the case what do they get out of braggingExactly where is their selfWhen you look into this you find that youre at a loss as to what to sayAnd that in and of itself helps to put an end to your braggingWhen you find the source that gives rise to I know Im right Im good thats the voice you have to make life difficult forIf you make life difficult for other voices in the mind then youve missed the mark for theyre all just its followersThe voice that says its good or right Use that voice to take itself apartYou dont have to use any other voiceMake it turn around and dig up its own source If you dont know how to look for your own faults youre not practicing the DhammaTo focus on your own faults goes against the flowThe basic principle in contemplation is that you cant put yourself firstYou have to put the Dhamma firstThe more you know the more modest you become Thats the nature of the DhammaWhoever says youre stupid let them go ahead and say it but make sure you stay full of the Dhamma insideMaintain the Dhamma at all costs in the same way that people carefully protect a cabinet in which the Canon is placedFocus on gathering the Dhamma into one point keeping the mind in a proper stance without fastening onto anythingAnd as to how you protect it and how it requires care and circumspection Thats something you have to discover for yourself Right views and right awareness see everything as DhammaIn other words they see all the events of fabrication in line with the three characteristics We have to contemplate the genuine essence of the Dhamma so that when we look outward we can see it all as Dhamma without labeling it as good or badTry using your eyes to look in a way that doesnt involve labelingSee everything as nature following in line with causes and conditionsOr see everything as Dhamma pure and simpleThen see if the mind feels open empty and lightThe Dhamma that you can study in books is not the genuine essence of the DhammaTo see the genuine essence of the Dhamma you have to strip away all conventional formulations leaving nature pure and simple free of any being or havingContemplation that uses thoughts is still external not internalInternal contemplation has to be a focused watching thats motionless and stillIts a contemplation thats composed of focused watching not something thats thought out Your contemplation has to go through many layers not oneThe first layer is to watch on the level of perceptions and labelsNext you watch thoughtsAnd then next you watch awarenessIf youre watching labels see them simply as labels the act of recognition the awareness that youve recognized something and then the label disbandsIf youre watching thoughts see how a thought arises what its about and then how it disbandsThen a new thought arises and it too disbandsThis is the second levelThen you watch awareness the awareness of the mind pure and simple a sensation that arises right at the mindWatch that sensation right at the mind and see how it disbands in just the same way We have to use mindfulness and discernment which are like extremely sharp shovels and hoes to dig down to our sense of selfThen we can turn it over and look at it from all sides to see exactly where its our selfTry contemplating the form feeling perception fabrication or consciousness that you hold onto so tightly to see exactly where its constant pleasurable or self We havent contemplated the pile of five aggregates  which is changing before our very eyes  in order to see correctly its natural conditions as they appearThats why weve fallen for the allure of attachment and clinging that give rise to the sense of self that functions as the taker the consumer the receiver of results And then we have to suffer by entering into the consuming and receiving  all without realizing itIn fact we want moreFor instance when we receive the results of a mind thats quiet and at ease we want them to stay that wayWhen they change we get all stirred upBut if we understand the principles of inconstancy stress and notself we can let goWe dont have to hold on tightRight here is the path to release Youve come here to practice specifically for the sake of putting an end to your sufferings and defilements so you have to forget everything elseYou dont have to concern yourself with lots of thingsSimply focus your attention on your own body and mind and everything will grow empty on its ownYou dont have to go desiring the emptinessDont get yourself embroiled because of desire Instead of letting go of the things you should let go you feed them more fuel so that they flare up even strongerInstead of dealing with the things you should abstain from or give up or weaken or destroy you dont deal with them at allAnd then you keep looking for new meditation techniquesYour defilements are arising right in your face right in the mind with every moment and yet you dont deal with themAll you do is look for things outside to delude yourself The practice of the Dhamma is a way of curing the illnesses inside the heart and mind so we have to devote ourselves to the practice to the utmost of our abilitiesWe have to practice heedfully so that defilement craving and clinging will grow lighterWe have to focus and contemplate continuously at all times so as to destroy our attachment to selfThis is the most important work in our lives contemplating physical and mental phenomena to see their inconstancy stress and notselfnessAnd we have to keep at this work all throughout life as long as the defilements havent yet endedWe keep looking contemplating letting go continually The hot defilements are easy to see but the cool damp defilements  such as love desire affection  that burn the mind with a cool damp fire as poisonous as acid Those are hard to seeYou have to examine yourself so that you know them for what they areOtherwise youll keep accumulating the fungus that causes damp rot within you The more your attention goes leaking outside the more stupid you becomeThe more you focus inside the sharper you become  and the more youll be able to disband your sufferings and defilementsThe more you focus outside the more you pick up the fungus that causes damp rot and the more you become a garbage pit When we see defilements showing themselves in other people we can see how ugly they are by seeing how ugly those people actBut when they show up in ourselves we see them as good and rightThis is where were inconsistent seeing our own defilements as our close friends  in line with the old saying Seeing a bladed discus as a petaled lotus Is that the way we areThis is something really worth looking into If you know how to focus on the arising of defilement  whether its greed or anger  even it arises only a little bit you should focus on staring it down to the point where you can snuff it outIf you dont make use of this approach you wont have the strength to fight it offIf you feed it fuel until it starts fabricating all out of bounds it will flare up as a huge fire and you wont be able to put it outIf you want to put it out you have to snuff it out in the very first stage where it appears as a slight sense of liking or dislikingYou have to keep contemplating to see  when the mind is empty as it is right now  how these feelings ariseYou have to contemplate to see how they disappear and how you can make sure that nothing else will arise to fabricate them any furtherYour awareness of the stempoint of fabrication is a means of snuffing out suffering right from the start  a means thats correct and uses the least strength Snuffing out blatant greed and anger isnt easy for their roots are still in place theyre still nourished by fertilizerThats why they have to keep flowering and bearing fruitSo if we really want to take the approach thats quickest and most correct we have to focus down on destroying delusion  our lack of familiarity with the truth Focus right on the issue of how defilements when they arise make the mind murky bothered and hotThen contemplate how to disband themWhen they disband does the mind feel coolKeep looking right thereThe coolness here doesnt come from our making it coolIts cool in and of itself without our having to shower it with waterIts the feelingtone of the mind when it can let go of somethingIts cool in and of itself Contemplating yourself repeatedly gives you a sense of the minds higher nature that can pull you up to releaseIts a means of dispersing the side of the mind that used to fasten onto things so that it grows weaker and weaker with regard to everything of every sortYou do this through the power of mindfulness and discernment not through the power of defilement craving or clinging When the mind is struggling to get something just watch it at firstOnly when it stops struggling should you deal with the issue in line with whats appropriateIn this way desire will grow weaker and your actions will lie under the power of mindfulness and discernment If we dont experiment with using the power of mindfulness and discernment to win out over defilement well stay ignorant as alwaysWell just keep on eating and living at our own convenience but when anything strikes well start spinning away grasping after all kinds of thingsThis is because we havent worked at developing endurance and toleranceWe havent trained ourselves to endure looking at pain and suffering to endure focusing on pain and suffering to see how heavy they are to see whose pains and suffering they areOnly if we endure looking at the pain and suffering endure focusing on the pain and suffering until the pain and suffering dissipate Thats when well gain great benefits from our practice We have to train ourselves a great deal in contemplating pain focusing on pain to the point where we can let go of pain and the mind doesnt fall in line with painThe pain then doesnt go any further than the bodyAs for pleasure you dont have to latch onto itYou dont have to be pleased by pleasureYou have to see pleasure and pain as equalTheyre equally inconstant and stressful as theyve been from the very beginning No matter how pain arises while sitting in meditation you have to endure looking at it until you can let it goSee it as the stress of physical and mental phenomena or the stress of the aggregatesAs for the mind keep it in a state of normalcy without strugglingIn this way craving wont ariseIf you let craving arise first youll have a hard time letting it goItll thrash all aroundSimply be involved in watching the painWhen it arises let it ariseIf its strong simply know that its strongDont let craving ariseLet there just be the feeling in and of itselfNotice how it takes shape how it changes and simply watch it that wayKeep any craving at bayOr if you want you can turn and look at the mind pure and simpleIf its in a turmoil you can know that craving has already arisenIf its at normalcy watch over it carefully for it can pick up moods very quicklyIf your attention lapses itll go flowing along with a mood When you go chasing after good and bad and latch onto your sense of self you create a huge fussBut when you really know clearly you sort out these problems so that they fade awayWhen you really examine all the evidence youll see that theres no good or bad arisingIt all disbandsBut then new thought fabrications arise and pass away arise and pass awayThey keep on flowing and they seem to involve many many issuesBut actually there arent many issuesTheres only arising remaining and passing awayIts because were not focused on knowing this that the issues come to seem manyBut no matter how many there are theres just this arising remaining and passing away one after another like the rippling of a current of water where the rippling isnt a thing at allIf you look into the pattern of the current of your thoughts fabricating good and bad youll find that theres nothing you can latch onto as having any essence for all these thoughts disband and disappearIf you learn how to look skillfully in this way your mind will be empty more than embroiled for you see the truth that these things all arise remain and pass awayThe past has passed awayThe future hasnt yet comeLook simply at the present arising and passing away right before your eyes  and dont latch onWhen you see arising remaining and passing away pure and simple right in the present moment and then can let go Right there is where you gain release Theres an old sayingIn a swiftflowing stream refers to the present where theres fabrication change arising and passing awayRight theres the Buddha whose Dhammas supreme means that clear knowing is found right thereLetting go of attachment occurs right thereExamine your mind to see what kind of currents its flowing afterThen stop to look at themStop to be aware of themUltimately youll see that theres actually nothing there just arising and passing away in emptiness like a projected image that flashes into being and disappears empty of any essence If your lookinginward sees all the way through youll see that none of the things of the world have any value at all for the highest value lies with the mind imbued with clear knowing bright and cleanEven if this knowing is only momentary it means that your practice isnt in vainYou can take it as your guide to continue following until you disband suffering and defilement without trace The internal sense of the mind will show itself of its own accordLike a diamond embedded in rock When the rock is cut away the sparkle and shine of the diamond show themselves of their own accordIn the same way when the mind is embedded in defilement craving and clinging its totally dark totally in the darkTheres no light or brightness to it at allBut when our cutting tools  mindfulness and discernment  bring out its facets the mind will be bright on its own The Dhamma covers many topics but theyre all gathered at the mindDefilements are a kind of dhamma as are discernment and the five aggregatesEverythings dhammaNow what we want is the highest dhamma the dhamma thats unfabricatedWe want to know what its like so where does it lieIt lies right here in the mindThe mind that isnt fabricated thats empty of itself Thats the genuine dhamma In contemplating the phenomena of the present  the way things arise remain and disband  you have to keep looking until you see through to that which doesnt arise or disbandWhen you fully comprehend arising remaining and disbanding youll come face to face with emptiness Emptiness isnt empty in the way youd sit and say to yourself Theres nothing there at all There are things there The eye sees sights the ear hears sounds and so onTheyre empty simply in that the mind doesnt enter in to label them to concoct anything out of them to cling to them liking or disliking them thats allTheyre empty in that the mind is free from attachment If you dont know how to extinguish things how to let go youll get stuck on every level of the pathIf you get stuck on the delicious flavor of emptiness or stillness thats delusions version of nibbana The practice requires that you pass through a lot of thingsIf you gain new knowledge and latch onto it that will create an obstacle along your wayIts like taking a journey If you run across something strange and new and youre not willing to continue along your way because you get contented with where you already are you end up setting up house right thereYour ability to continue on the journey depends on an awareness that sees clearly all the way throughBut here your awareness isnt clear all the way through and yet you set up house right here thinking that nibbana lies right here at the emptinessThat opinion is what blocks your wayIf you take that sense of stillness and emptiness simply as a resting spot it holds little danger for you still have the opportunity to continue along your wayThe path that snuffs out defilement has to focus on snuffing out the view that latches onto knowledge and viewsYou have to recognize the stages of the path that you need as resting spots and to realize that youre holding onto them simply as temporary dwellingsIf you grip them tightly youll get stuck there and will go no further If your awareness focuses down like this again and again and again the mind will ultimately have to surrenderIts old habit of wandering around to know this and that will gradually calm down and grow still without your having to force it for it wont be able to withstand your constant gazeEvery time you look at it youll see its deceptivenessYoull see that its not worthy of credence not worthy of attachment and so that deceptiveness will have to shrink awayIts like a person who comes to flatter youAs soon as you focus your gaze on him and realize what hes up to he has to shrink away in embarrassmentTo focus on the point where your sense of self arises your mindfulness and discernment have to develop many approaches from many angles using tricks that you figure out on your ownThe basic trick is a small thing Look for the point where the sense of self disbands on its ownIf your awareness doesnt penetrate clearly into the disbanding of the property of consciousness theres no way you can know how mental states arise and pass awayTheres no way you can know how they wander around to take on objects how they fall into the swirling currents of good and bad thoughtfabrication or how they get all wound up in a turmoilSo when you choose your focus focus directly on the disbanding of mental statesWhen they take on an object do they then disbandKeep looking until you can see how they disband on their ownIf you cant manage this focus first on the disbanding of physical and mental phenomenaWhen you clearly see the disbanding of physical and mental phenomena youll know for yourself how the consciousness which knows that disbanding also disbands on its own each and every moment it knows those thingsKnowing the disbanding of consciousness is very usefulNo matter how it arises consciousness always disbands on its ownThat way you wont latch onto the idea that it has a self of any kindTo know the disbanding of consciousness pure and simple is to know the disbanding of everythingIts like opening up the entire world or stripping off the entire world and throwing it awayWhen you can strip it away throw it off and let it go theres nothing but emptiness an emptiness thats bright and clear with no sense of the world at allThe words world and five aggregates are simply conventions to help us see how theres change To become acquainted with the property of awareness pure and simple you have to observe the minds movements in response to contactYou have to know arising and passing away and you have to observe the awareness that accompanies the mind which lies deep within the mind or in the property of consciousnessIf its not fabricated or labeled it will stay quietIt will maintain its stanceIf you want to see how long it can maintain its stance you have to observe its movements in response to contact or in response to the internal sensation of labelingWhen these things arise can that awareness maintain its stanceIf it cant it will get fabricated into distractionAnd by the time the matter calms down youll be worn outIf you can see into the condition of awareness pure and simple youll know your foundation  your inner foundationIn the beginning you have to depend on mindfulness as your foundation for focusing on inThen you focus on looking to know the condition of change of arising and passing awayThis is focused looking not simple lookingSimple looking doesnt lead to any knowledgeIts delusionFocused looking to the point of giving rise to clear knowing is in and of itself a means of destroying delusionOn whatever level youre free from fabrication from mental labels or free from attachment its a means of clear knowing within the mind or the property of consciousness For your awareness to reach into the gathering point of the mind or of the property of consciousness pure and simple you have to focus on the condition of change within the mind itselfYou do this to destroy the deep seeds of the property of consciousnessThese seeds which lie continually in the property of consciousness are very refinedThese are the seeds of sensual craving craving for becoming and craving for nonbecomingSensual craving is something fairly easy to observeThe way it moves in to create desire for sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations is something fairly easy to seeAs for the more latent seeds of craving for becoming  the craving to be or have a self or things belonging to a self  these lie deepSo we have to look deeply in if we want to destroy themIf you can see all the way through to these seeds and can destroy them that will be your path to release from sufferingThis gathering point of the property of consciousness pure and simple or of the property of awareness pure and simple is thus something really worth looking intoIf you dont gather your awareness to look into this point youll find it hard to destroy the seedsWhatever seeds you do destroy will be external seeds such as those in sensory pleasuresBut the seeds that are latent tendencies lying within the mind or the property of consciousness have no intentions of their ownThats why we rarely see all the way into them why we rarely know them rarely see themThis is because we play around with their children their followers sensory pleasuresWe dont focus on in to look inside to get any perspective at all The unintentional tendencies that lie deep your character You cant intentionally get rid of them at the drop of a hatThe only way to get rid of them is to contemplate inwardly step by step so that you know them clearlyYou have to reach the basic level of knowing thats unintentional if you want to get rid of the other unintentional things in the mind The property of consciousness contains within it the sense of being or having a selfIt contains the seeds that give rise to being and having in the same way that a seed contains bark branches and leavesIf you focus in to know the condition of the property of name and form pure and simple that in and of itself will destroy the seeds for rebirth We have to contemplate to see natural conditions of both sorts starting with the changing condition of such things as the aggregates penetrating through to the unchanging condition which is the total disbanding of sufferingThe sort that changes keeps changing its disguises without respite deceiving us into latching onto it as genuine and trueIn particular our fascination with pleasurable feelings Even when we train the mind to be still were hoping for the delicious flavor of the pleasurable feelingThis is because we havent contemplated the deceptiveness of feelings of every sortSome arahants gain awakening through becoming acquainted with feeling and destroying the obsessions that lie latent in all three kinds of feelingObsession with irritation lies latent in painful feelingAs soon as pain arises whether its mental or physical pain irritation arises in the mindObsession with passion lies latent in pleasant feelingWe like pleasure of every kind wanting it to stay with us for a long timeWhen a feeling of equanimity  neither pleasure nor pain  arises we get absorbed in the equanimity because we dont know that its just a feeling that has to arise and pass away in line with its conditionsThis is why obsession with ignorance lies latent in equanimous feelingHow do we let go of these obsessionsThis is something to which we should give a lot of attention because feeling has a lot of allure that can engender cravingFor example when the mind is still and empty and then changes so that its no longer still and empty we want it to be still and empty againThe more we want the more its not emptyIf we can disband the desire for emptiness that in and of itself will let the mind will grow empty againDesire is what gets the mind embroiled in a turmoil so desire is what we have to disbandWe practice restraint of the senses so as to disband desire because the mind is always desiring to see the sights hear the sounds smell the aromas taste the flavors and touch the tactile sensations surrounding it on all sidesIts because we dont know how desire is the cause of suffering that we struggle to satisfy our desires  and then all kinds of suffering follow The word sankhatadhamma  fabricated phenomena  covers conditions of nature that are marked by the three characteristicsThe things we have to study are summarized in two words sankhata dhamma and asankhata dhammaBoth of these terms have a deep and wide range of meaning especially sankhata dhammas which are always inconstant stressful and notselfThe conditions of sankhata dhamma follow their own swirling currents without endAs for asankhata dhamma  the phenomenon that doesnt change isnt stressful but is still notself  thats something hard to knowBut even this refined subtle condition is something that we shouldnt latch onto When the mind stops grows still and is aware of itself let it focus even more deeply on itself for its stoppingstate is the mental state thats concentrated or in equanimity still neutral neither pleased nor displeasedThis is a type of fabrication called aneñjabhisankhara  imperturbable fabrication  or if you want you can call it neutral fabricationWhen you focus on it see it simply as an aspect of natureDont get sucked into the stillness the neutrality or the equanimityAt the same time though you do have to depend on the equanimity to focus in on seeing things as aspects of nature pure and simpleThis is a way of disbanding any fabrication of liking or disliking good or badFor this reason we dont stop just at the equanimityWe have to see all the way through it that its an aspect of nature free of self When the fabricated aspects of nature disband the mind stays with its awareness of equanimityThen you focus on the equanimity to be aware of it as an aspect of nature without using any labels or wordsSimply focus on in to watch it to become acquainted with the aspect of nature that lies further in without labeling anything at allAs you see into every level of nature pure and simple things get deeper and more profoundYou know and let go know and let go know and let go  emptyWhatever appears you let goThe important principle in your gazing inward is simply to let goYou look you see and you let goIncline the mind to letting goLook in absolute stillness with no inner conversationKnow and let goMindfulness keeps knowing through letting go of everythingThe breath doesnt disappearNo matter how still or empty the mind youre aware with every breathIf you dont know in this way youll soon lose focus and get distracted or a fabrication of some sort will interfere so that you lose your foundation When the mind fabricates unskillful thoughts  thoughts of sensual passion thoughts of ill will thoughts of harmfulness  these are all called demeritorious fabricationsWhen the mind gains a sense of the drawbacks of sensual passion and develops a sense of distrust disgust and distaste for sensual passion thats how you cleanse the mind of sensual passion so that its not stuck on sensual passion so that its stuck instead on disenchantmentWhen the mind sees the drawbacks of ill will and thinks instead in terms of good will and forgiveness thats how you destroy ill willWhen you see the drawbacks of harmfulness you then think or act in ways that arent harmfulAll of these things are called meritorious fabricationsWhen the mind fabricates these things whether meritorious or demeritorious it puts itself into a turmoilSkillful thoughts have to keep thinking so as to do away with unskillful thoughtsIf you think too much it can make you tired both in body and mindWhen this happens you have to focus on a single preoccupation to bring the mind to concentrationWhen you focus in concentration throwing away both meritorious and demeritorious fabrications and instead stay continuously stopped in a single preoccupation this falls into the characteristics of imperturbable fabricationThe sense of being snugly still or equanimous for long periods of time may not fit into the definition of imperturbable fabrications as jhana or the higher absorptionsIts simply a type of immovability endowed with mindfulness and discernmentThe mind is aware of itself focuses its gaze right on itself and knows itself continuously without fabricating thoughts of good or evilBut this too can be included under imperturbable fabricationFor that reason we have to find the aspect of the mind that can maintain its stance so as to see further in so that its not stuck on imperturbable fabricationWe have to penetrate to the point where we can see clearly in terms of the arising remaining and passing away the inconstancy stress and notselfness that are gathered in here as well You have to sharpen this basic principle of knowing so that its razor sharp  so that you can see the truth that nothing has any true essence that its all illusoryKnowing and not knowing trade places so that they seem to be different but if you get stuck on this duality youre stuck on yourselfIf youre really going to know you have to know both sides the side that knows and the side that doesnt know to see that theyre both inconstant in the same way both deceitful in the same way Your sense of physical and mental phenomena is all fabricationMindfulness is a fabricationDiscernment is a fabricationEven the still mind is a fabricationWhen its not still its a fabricationSo look at fabrication deeply precisely from all angles inside and outKnowledge  even the observer the knower  is also fabricationTheyre all fabrication whether theyre right or wrong good or badSo you have to acquaint yourself thoroughly with fabricationWhen you know fabrication thoroughly in a way that penetrates inwardly it gives rise to a sense of disenchantmentIf you dont do this youll take your pick of the good fabrications to hold onto and push the bad fabrications away We can recognize fabrications in that they change and can disbandAnd then we realize that weve been playing around with these fake imitation things all alongEven clear knowing is a fabricationIt changes in line with physical and mental conditionsMindfulness discernment and intuitive knowingandseeing are all fabrications  just that theyre good fabrications that we have to depend on for the time beingWe have to understand fabrications understand how to use fabrications in a correct way and then simply let them goWe dont have to keep holding onto them Knowing is a fabricationNotknowing is a fabricationWhen we examine them internally we see that they both arise and pass awayEven the truths that we know in this way dont stay longThey have to turn into notknowingFrom this we can see that fabrications play all sorts of tricks on many many levels and we get deluded into playing along with themWhen we can get to know the tricks of fabrication of every sort on every level that will be really beneficialWell really know in line with what the Buddha said Sabbe sankhara aniccati  All fabrications are inconstantThis is an important principle that will enable us to see through to the stressfulness in every sort of fabricationEven good fabrications like mindfulness and discernment are stressful in and of themselves because that have to keep changingTheyre like tools we use for the time being but we shouldnt stay fastened onto them Even though we have to look after the foundation of our knowing using mindfulness and discernment to supervise the mind we should understand that the mind is a form of fabricationMindfulness and discernment are fabricationsIf we know only on a superficial level and go around talking about what weve been able to let go on our level of practice we havent seen deeply into fabricationWhen this is the case we still lie in the swirling currents of fabricationCorrect knowledge which is fabrication of a good sort has to be trained to read and decipher things within and without including itself on many convoluted levelsOnce youve seen inconstancy and stress you have to see through to the lack of self in fabrications of every sort You have to know that fabrication is inconstant stressful and has no self to itselfKeep looking at this point over and over again until it becomes clear to the heartOnly then will you develop a sense of disenchantment and dispassionYou wont fasten onto good fabrications or push bad ones away for youve seen that they have the same price theyre both equally changeableEven though we maintain the stance of our knowing in looking over the mind to make sure that it isnt fabricated even more from outside conditions still we dont stay fastened onto the knowing for it too has to changeThere come times when we think we know the truth in this matter but then at later times or later moments even clearer knowing arisesThat enables us to know that what we thought was true knowing actually wasntThis knowing can changeNo matter how much higher it goes as it changes you have to remember that its still fabrication it can still change no matter what level it isWhether its crude or refined you have to know it thoroughlyOtherwise youll stay fastened to itIf you can look in a way that sees all fabrications thoroughly  good bad right wrong the knower the notknower  simply as the same sort of thing your knowledge will gradually rise above these thingsBut even though its above its still fabricationIt hasnt yet gained release from fabricationEven the path is a form of fabricationSo when we develop the path when we develop the factor of right view we have to see rightly into this matter seeing clearly into fabrication of every sort no matter what the characteristics of our knowingWhether we look at physical phenomena or mental phenomena arising and passing away theyre all fabricationsEven the mind firmly established in concentration is a form of fabrication as are the stages of jhana If we dont look inward we make the mind dark and murkyThen when sensory contact comes the mind can easily get all stirred upSo I ask that you make an effort to peer carefully inward to see whats there in the mind to see how things arise to see how mental labels and fabrications ariseThat way youll be able to disband them destroy them leaving just the mind pure and simple with no labels or attachments at allIt will then be empty of defilementYou might call it your inner beauty Miss Emptiness who doesnt have to age doesnt have to grow ill doesnt have to die  a primal nature that doesnt changeThis is something you have to touch right at the mindIts not the mind itself but the mind itself is what makes contact with it When we practice were like diamond cuttersOur diamond  the mind  is embedded in dense dark defilementsWe have to use mindfulness and discernment  or virtue concentration and discernment  as our cutting tools to make the mind pure in all its thoughts words and deedsThen we train the mind to grow still and to contemplate so as to give rise to clear knowledge all the way to the point where you meet with whats totally pure and free from defilements and mental fermentations our Miss Emptiness who is so extremely beautiful free from change whom the King of Death cant seeAnd as to whether this is something worth aspiring to I leave it up to you to decideMy thanks go to all the nuns anagarikas laymen and women who have listened time and again to my expositions of the Buddhas teachingsWithout them these talks would not have happened and this little booklet would not be possibleA very special thank you to my friends who have encouraged and supported my work and the publication of this book by their continued understanding and generosityThose who have typed the manuscript from tapes made during the talks have given freely of their time energy and love to the propagation of the DhammaMay everyone connected with this joint undertaking reap the excellent kamma caused by their giftThis little volume is offered to all people everywhere who know dukkha which is not only suffering pain and grief but all the unsatisfactoriness all of us experience during our lifetimeIt is that unfulfilled striving in heart and mind which keeps pushing us in so many directions to find the ultimate satisfactionWhen we have realized that all the avenues we have tried have brought us to a dead end then the time has come to turn to Lord Buddhas teachings and see for ourselves whether his promisecan be experienced within ourselves and whether fulfillment is possibleAs practice progresses we will find that by letting go of our preconceived ideas on how and where dukkha can be avoided we come upon uncharted landscapes within ourselves which provide a totally new concept of life its purpose its value and its ultimate realityMay there be many with little dust in their eyes who can turn the tide on dukkha and be liberatedThe following Pali words encompass concepts and levels of ideas for which there are no adequate synonyms in

to reality is one of eighteen chief kinds of insightThe first line of this chant proclaims real faith in the DhammaNot believing everything without inquiring but an inner relationship of trustWhen one is faithful to someone then one also trusts that person one gives oneself into his or her hands has a deep connection and an inner openingHow much more is this true of the faith in the teaching of the BuddhaThose aspects of the Dhamma which we dont understand yet can be left in abeyanceYet that doesnt shake our faith and trustIf we feel that it is perfectly expounded then we are very fortunate for we know one thing in this universe which is perfectTheres nothing else to be found thats without blemish nor is there anything that is becoming perfectIf we have that trust faithfulness and love towards the Dhamma and believe it to be perfectly expounded then we have found something beyond compareWe are blessed with an inner wealthTo be seen here and now is up to each of usthe Dhamma has been made clear by the Enlightened One who taught it out of compassion but we have to see it ourselves with an inner visionHere and now needs to be stressed because it means not forgetting but being aware of the Dhamma in each momentThis awareness helps us to watch our reactions before they result in unskillful words or actionsSeeing the positive within us and cultivating it seeing the negative and substituting itWhen we believe all our thoughts and claim justification for them were not seeing the DhammaThere are no justifications there are only arising phenomena which cease againNot a matter of time means that we are not dependent upon a Buddha being alive in order to practice the Dhamma though this is a widespread belief it is quite possible to practice nowSome people think there has to be a perfect situation or a perfect teacher or perfect meditationNone of that is trueMental and physical phenomena are constantly coming and going changing without pauseWhen we hang onto them and consider them ours then we will believe any story our mind will tell us without discriminationWe consist of body feelings perceptions mental formations and consciousness which we grip tightly and believe them to be me and mine We need to take a step back and be a neutral observer of the whole processThe understanding of the Dhamma leads us into our inner depthWe are not invited to come and see a meditation hall or a Buddha statue a dagoba or a shrineWe are invited to come and see the phenomena arising within usThe defilements as well as the purifications are to be found inside ones own heart and mindOur minds are very busy always remembering planning hoping or judgingThis body could also be very busy picking up little stones and throwing them into the water all day longBut we would consider that a foolish expenditure of energy and we direct the body towards something usefulWe need to do the same with the mindInstead of thinking about this and that allowing the defilements to arise we could also direct the mind towards something beneficial such as investigating our likes and dislikes our desires and rejections our ideas and viewsWhen the mind inquires it doesnt get involved in its own creationsIt cant do both at the same timeAs it becomes more and more observant it remains objective for longer periods of timeThats why the Buddha taught that mindfulness is the one way for the purification of beingsThe clear and lucid observation of all arising phenomena eventually shows that there are only phenomena manifesting as mind and body which are constantly expanding and contracting in the same way as the universe doesUnless we become very diligent observers we will not see that aspect of mind and body and will not know the Dhamma here and now even though we have been invited to come and seeNo one can know the Dhamma for anotherWe can chant read discuss and listen but unless we watch all that arises we will not know the Dhamma by ourselvesTheres only one place where Dhamma can be known in ones own heart and mindIt has to be a personal experience which comes about through constant observation of oneselfMeditation helpsUnless one inquires into ones own reactions and knows why one wants one thing and rejects another one hasnt seen DhammaThen the mind will also get a clear perception of impermanence because our desires and dislikes are constantly changingWell see that the mind which is thinking and the body which is breathing are both painfulWhen the mind doesnt operate with an uplifted transcending awareness it creates sufferingOnly a measureless illumined mind is free from thatThe body certainly produces dukkha in many ways through its inability to remain steadySeeing this clearly will give us a strong determination to know Dhamma by ourselvesWisdom arises within and comes from an understood experienceNeither knowledge nor listening can bring it aboutWisdom also means maturity which has nothing to do with ageSometimes aging may help but it doesnt always do that eitherWisdom is an inner knowing which creates selfconfidenceWe need not look for somebody elses confirmation and goodwill we know with certaintyWhen we chant anything at all it is vital that we know the meaning of the words and inquire whether they have any connection to ourselvesThe Buddha saidIf we can practice one line of Dhamma its so much more valuable than knowing the whole chanting book by heartThe arising and ceasing phenomena which are our teachers never take a restDhamma is being taught to us constantlyAll our waking moments are Dhamma teachers if we make them soThe Dhamma is the truth expounded by the Enlightened One which is the law of nature surrounding us and imbedded within usOnce the Buddha said Ananda it is owing to my being a good friend to them that living beings subject to birth are freed from birthEveryone needs a good friend who has enough selflessness not only to be helpful but also to point out when one is slippingTreading the Dhamma path is like walking a tightropeIt leads along one straight line and every time one slips one hurtsIf we have a painful feeling inside were no longer on the tightrope of the DhammaOur good friend might say to us then You stepped too far to the right or to the leftYou werent careful thats why you fell into depression and painIll point out to you when youre slipping next time We can only accept this from someone whom we trust and have confidence inOne can be fooled by a persons beautiful words or splendid appearanceThe character of a person is shown not only in words but in the small daytoday activitiesOne of the very important guidelines to a persons character is how they react when things go wrongIts easy to be loving helpful and friendly when everything goes well but when difficulties arise our endurance and patience are being tested as well as our equanimity and determinationThe less egoconsciousness one has the easier one can handle all situationsAt first when one starts to walk on the tightrope of the Dhamma path it may feel uncomfortableOne isnt used to balancing oneself but rather to swaying all over the place going in all directions wherever its most comfortableOne may feel restricted and coerced not being allowed to live according to ones natural instinctsYet in order to walk on a tightrope one has to restrict oneself in many ways with mindfulnessThese restrictions may at first feel irksome like fetters or bonds later they turn out to be the liberating factorsTo have this perfect jewel of the Dhamma in our hearts we need to be awake and awareThen we can prove by our own watchfulness that the Dhamma of the Blessed One is perfectly expounded There is no worldly jewel that can match the value of the DhammaEach one of us can become the owner of this priceless gemWe can call ourselves most fortunate to have such an opportunityWhen we wake up in the morning let that be our first thought What good fortune it is for me to practice the DhammaIts a strange phenomenon how difficult people find it to love themselvesOne would think it is the easiest thing in the world because were constantly concerned with ourselvesWere always interested in how much we can get how well we can perform how comfortable we can beThe Buddha mentioned in a discourse that oneself is dearest to oneself So with all that why is it so difficult to actually love oneselfLoving oneself certainly doesnt mean indulging oneselfReally loving is an attitude towards oneself that most people dont have because they know quite a few things about themselves which are not desirableEverybody has innumerable attitudes reactions likes and dislikes which theyd be better off withoutJudgment is made and while one likes ones positive attitudes one dislikes the othersWith that comes suppression of those aspects of oneself that one is not pleased withOne doesnt want to know about them and doesnt acknowledge themThats one way of dealing with oneself which is detrimental to growthAnother unskillful way is to dislike that part of oneself which appears negative and every time it arises one blames oneself which makes matters twice as bad as they were beforeWith that comes fear and very often aggressionIf one wants to deal with oneself in a balanced way its not useful to pretend that the unpleasant part doesnt exist those aggressive irritable sensual conceited tendenciesIf we pretend we are far from reality and put a split into ourselvesEven though such a person may be totally sane the appearance given is that of not being quite realWeve all come across people like that who are too sweet to be true as a result of pretense and suppressionBlaming oneself doesnt work eitherIn both instances one transfers ones own reactions to other peopleOne blames others for their deficiencies real or imagined or one doesnt see them as ordinary human beingsEveryone lives in an unreal world because its egodeluded but this one is particularly unreal because everything is considered either as perfectly wonderful or absolutely terribleThe only thing that is real is that we have six roots within usThree roots of good and three roots of evilThe latter are greed hate and delusion but we also have their opposites generosity lovingkindness and wisdomTake an interest in this matterIf one investigates this and doesnt get anxious about it then one can easily accept these six roots in everybodyNo difficulty at all when one has seen them in oneselfThey are the underlying roots of everyones behaviorThen we can look at ourselves a little more realistically namely not blaming ourselves for the unwholesome roots not patting ourselves on the back for the wholesome ones but rather accepting their existence within usWe can also accept others more clearsightedly and have a much easier time relating to themWe will not suffer from disappointments and we wont blame because we wont live in a world where only black or white exists either the three roots of unwholesomeness or their oppositesSuch a world doesnt exist anywhere and the only person to be like that is an arahantIts largely a matter of degree in everyone elseThese degrees of good and evil are so finely tuned theres so little difference within the degrees in each one of us that it really doesnt matterEverybody has the same job to do to cultivate the wholesome tendencies and uproot the unwholesome onesApparently were all very differentThat too is an illusionWere all having the same problems and also the same faculties to deal with themThe only difference is the length of training that one has hadTraining which may have been going on for a number of lifetimes has brought about a little more clarity thats allClarity of thinking comes from purification of ones emotions which is a difficult job that needs to be doneBut it can only be done successfully when it isnt an emotional upheaval but clearcut straightforward work that one does on oneselfWhen it is considered to be just that it takes the sting out of itThe charge of Im so wonderful or Im so terrible is defusedWe are neither wonderful nor terribleEveryone is a human being with all the potential and all the obstructionsIf one can love that human being the one that is me with all its faculties and tendencies then one can love others realistically usefully and helpfullyBut if one makes a break in the middle and loves the part which is nice and dislikes the part which isnt nice enough ones never going to come to grips with realityOne day well have to see it for what it isIts a working ground a kammatthanaIts a straightforward and interesting affair of ones own heartIf we look at ourselves in that manner we will learn to love ourselves in a wholesome wayJust as a mother at the risk of life loves and protects her child Become your own motherIf we want to have a relationship with ourselves that is realistic and conducive to growth then we need to become our own motherA sensible mother can distinguish between that which is useful for her child and that which is detrimentalBut she doesnt stop loving the child when it misbehavesThis may be the most important aspect to look at in ourselvesEveryone at one time or another misbehaves in thought or speech or actionMost frequently in thought fairly frequently in speech and not so often in actionSo what do we do with thatWhat does a mother doShe tells the child not to do it again loves the child as much as shes always loved it and just gets on with the job of bringing up her childMaybe we can start to bring up ourselvesThe whole of this training is a matter of maturingMaturity is wisdom which is unfortunately not connected to ageIf it were it would be very easyOne would have a guaranteeSince it isnt its hard work a job to be doneFirst comes recognition then learning not to condemn but to understand This is the way it is the third step is changeRecognition may be the hardest part for most people its not easy to see what goes on inside of oneselfThis is the most important and the most interesting aspect of contemplationWe lead a contemplative life but that does not mean we sit in meditation all day longA contemplative life means that one considers every aspect of what happens as part of a learning experienceOne remains introspective under all circumstancesWhen one becomes outgoing with what the Buddha termed exuberance of youth one goes to the world with ones thoughts speech and actionOne needs to recollect oneself and return withinA contemplative life in some orders is a life of prayerIn our way its a combination of meditation and lifestyleThe contemplative life goes on inside of oneselfOne can do the same thing with or without recollectionContemplation is the most important aspect of introspectionIt isnt necessary to sit still all day and watch ones breathEvery move every thought every word can give rise to understanding oneselfThis kind of work on oneself will bring about deep inner security which is rooted in realityMost people are wishing and hoping for this kind of security but are not even able to voice their longingLiving in a myth constantly hoping or being afraid is opposed to having inner strengthThe feeling of security arises when one sees reality inside of oneself and thereby the reality in everyone else and comes to terms with itLet us accept the fact that the Buddha knew the truth when he said everybody had seven underlying tendencies sensual desire illwill speculative views sceptical doubt conceit craving for continued existence ignoranceFind them in yourselfSmile at them do not burst into tears because of themSmile and say Well there you areIll do something about youThe contemplative life is often lived heavyhandedlyA certain lack of joy is compensated for by being outgoingThis doesnt workOne should cultivate a certain lightheartedness but stay within oneselfTheres nothing to be worried or fearful about nothing that is too difficultDhamma means the law of nature and we are manifesting this law of nature all the timeWhat can there be to get away fromWe cannot escape the law of natureWherever we are we are the Dhamma we are impermanent unfulfilled of no coresubstanceIt doesnt matter whether we sit here or on the moonIts always the sameSo we need a lighthearted approach to our own difficulties and those of everyone else but not exuberance and outpouringRather a constant inwardness which contains a bit of amusementThis works bestIf one has a sense of humor about oneself it is much easier to love oneself properlyIts also much easier to love everybody elseThere used to be a television show in America called People are Funny We do have the oddest reactionsWhen they are analyzed and taken apart they are often found to be absurdWe have very strange desires and wishes and unrealistic images of ourselvesIts quite true people are funny so why not see that side of oneselfIt makes it easier to accept that which we find so unacceptable in ourselves and othersThere is one aspect of human life which we cannot change namely that it keeps on happening moment after momentWeve all been meditating here for some timeWhat does the world careIt just keeps on goingThe only one who cares who gets perturbed is our own heart and mindWhen there is perturbance upheaval unreality and absurdity then there is also unhappinessThis is quite unnecessaryEverything just isIf we learn to approach all happenings with more equanimity by being accepting then the work of purification is much easierThis is our work our own purification and it can only be done by each one for himselfOne of the best aspects about it is that if one remembers what one is doing keeps at it day after day without forgetting and continues to meditate not expecting great results little by little it does happenThat too just isAs one keeps working at it there is a constant chipping away at the defilements and at the unreal thinking because there is no happiness in that and few want to hang on to unhappinessEventually one runs out of things to do outside of oneselfThe books are all saying the same things the letters have all been written the flowers have all been watered theres nothing left except to look insideAs this happens again and again a change takes placeIt may be slow but when we have been here so many lifetimes whats a day a month a year ten yearsTheyre all just happeningTheres nothing else to do and theres nowhere else to goThe earth is moving in a circle life is moving from birth to death without us having to move at allIts all happening without our helpThe only thing we need to do is to get to realityThen when we do we will find that loving ourselves and loving others is a natural outcome of thatBecause we are concerned with reality and that is the hearts real work  to loveBut only if weve also seen the other side of the coin in ourselves and have done the work of purificationThen it is no longer an effort or a deliberate attempt but it becomes a natural function of our inner feelings inward directed but shining outwardThe inward direction is an important aspect of our contemplative lifeWhatever happens inwardly has direct repercussions on what takes place outwardlyThe inner light and purity cannot be hidden nor can the defilementsWe sometimes think we can portray something we are notThat is not possibleThe Buddha said that one only knows a person after having heard him speak many times and having lived with him for a long timePeople generally try to show themselves off as something better than they really areThen of course they become disappointed in themselves when they fail and equally disappointed in othersTo realistically know oneself makes it possible to truly loveThat kind of feeling gives the lightheartedness to this job in which were engaged which is neededBy accepting ourselves and others as we truly are our job of purification chipping away at the defilements is made much easierOur old friend dukkha arises in the mind as dissatisfaction caused by all sorts of triggersIt can be triggered by bodily discomfort but more often it is caused by the minds own aberrations and convolutionsThe mind creates dukkha and thats why we must really watch and guard our mindsOur own mind can make us happy our own mind can make us unhappyThere is no person or thing in the whole world that will do this for usAll happenings act as triggers for us which constantly catch us unawaresTherefore we need to develop strong awareness of our own mindmomentsWe have a good chance to do that in meditationThere are two directions in meditation calm and insightIf we can achieve some calm that indicates that concentration is improvingBut unless that valuable skill is used for insight its a waste of timeIf the mind becomes calm joy often arises but we must observe how fleeting and impermanent that joy is and how even bliss is essentially still only a condition which can be easily lostOnly insight is irreversibleThe stronger the calm is established the better it will withstand disturbancesIn the beginning any noise discomfort or thought will break it up especially if the mind has not been calm during the dayImpermanence needs to be seen quite clearly in everything that happens whether it is in or out of meditationThe fact of constant change should and must be used for gaining insight into realityMindfulness is the heart of Buddhist meditation and insight is its goalWere spending our time in many different ways and some portion of it in meditation but all our time can be used to gain some insight into our own mindThats where the whole world is happening for usNothing except what we are thinking exists for usThe more we watch our mind and see what it does to us and for us the more we will be inclined to take good care of it and treat it with respectOne of the biggest mistakes we can make is taking the mind for grantedThe mind has the capacity to create good and also evil for us and only when we are able to remain happy and evenminded no matter what conditions are arising only then can we say that we have gained a little controlUntil then we are out of control and our thoughts are our masterThe greatest support we can have is mindfulness which means being totally present in each momentIf the mind remains centered then it cant make up stories about the injustice of the world or ones friends or about ones desires or ones lamentationsAll these mindmade stories would fill many volumes but we are mindful such verbalizations stopMindful is being fully absorbed in the moment leaving no room for anything elseWe are filled with the momentary happening whether that may be standing or sitting or lying down being comfortable or uncomfortable feeling pleasant or unpleasantWhichever it may be it is a nonjudgmental awareness knowing only without evaluationClear comprehension brings evaluationWe comprehend the purpose of our thought speech or action whether we are using skillful means or not and whether we have actually achieved the required resultsOne needs some distance to oneself in order to be able to evaluate dispassionatelyIf one is right in the middle its very difficult to get an objective viewMindfulness coupled with clear comprehension provides one with the necessary distance the objectivity the dispassionAny dukkha that one has small medium or large continuous or intermittent is all created by ones mindWe are the creators of all that happens to us forming our own destiny nobody else is involvedEverybody else is playing his own role we just happen to be near some people and farther away at other timesBut whatever we are doing all is done to our own mindmomentsThe more we watch our thoughts in meditation the more insight can arise if there is an objective viewing of what is happeningWhen we watch mindmoments arising staying and ceasing detachment from our thinking process will result which brings dispassionThoughts are coming and going all the time just like the breathIf we hang on to them try to keep them thats when all the trouble startsWe want to own them and really do something with them especially of they are negative which is bound to create dukkhaThe Buddhas formula for the highest effort is worth remembering Not to let an unwholesome thought arise which has not yet arisenNot to sustain an unwholesome thought which has already arisenTo arouse a wholesome thought which has not yet arisenTo sustain a wholesome thought which has already arisenThe quicker we can become a master of this effort the betterThis is part of the training we undergo in meditationWhen we have learned to quickly drop whatever is arising in meditation then we can do the same with unwholesome thoughts in daily livingWhen we are alert to an unwholesome thought in meditation we can use the same skill to protect our mind at all timesThe more we learn to shut our minddoor to all negativities which disturb our inner peace the easier our life becomesPeace of mind is not indifferenceA peaceful mind is a compassionate mindRecognizing and letting go is not suppressionDukkha is selfmade and selfperpetuatedIf we are sincere in wanting to get rid of it we have to watch the mind carefully to get an insight into whats really happening withinWhat is triggering usThere are innumerable triggers but there are only two reactionsOne is equanimity and one is cravingWe can learn from everythingToday some anagarikas had to wait quite a long time in the bank which was an exercise in patienceWhether the exercise was successful or not doesnt matter as much as that it was a learning experienceEverything we do is an exercise this is our purpose as human beingsIts the only reason for being here namely to use the time on our little planet for learning and growingIt can be called an adult education classEverything else we can think of as the purpose of life is a mistaken viewWere guests here giving a limited guest performanceIf we use our time to gain insight into ourselves utilizing our likes and dislikes our resistances our rejections our worries our fears then were spending this lifetime to the best advantageIts a great skill to live in such a wayThe Buddha called it urgency a sense of having to work on ourselves now and not leave it for some future unspecified date when one may have more timeEverything can be a learning experience and the only time is nowWhen we meet our old friend dukkha we would ask Where did you come from When we get an answer we should inquire again getting deeper into the subjectTheres only one true answer but we wont get it immediatelyWe have to go through several answers until we get to the bottom line which is ego When weve come to that one we know we have come to the end of the questioning and to the beginning of insightWe can then try to see how the ego has produced dukkha againWhat did it do how did it reactWhen we see the cause it may be possible to let go of that particular wrong viewHaving seen cause and effect by ourselves well never forget it againSingle drops fill a bucket little by little we purifyEvery moment is worthwhileThe more we experience every moment as worthwhile the more energy there isThere are no useless moments every single one is important if we use it skillfullyEnormous energy arises from that because all of it adds up to a life which is lived in the best possible wayBeing happy also means being peaceful but quite often people dont really want to direct their attention to thatThere is the connotation of not interesting about it or not enough happening Obviously there would be no proliferations or excitementPeace is thought of as an absolute in this world from a political social and personal angleYet peace is very hard to find anywhereOne of the reasons must be not only that its difficult to attain but also that very few people work for such an achievementIt seems as if it were a negation of life of ones own supremacyOnly those who practice a spiritual discipline would care to direct their minds towards peaceA natural tendency is to cultivate ones own superiority which also often falls into the other extreme ones own inferiorityWhen one has ones own superiority in mind its impossible to find peaceThe only thing that one can find is a power game Anything you can do I can do better Or at times when its quite obvious that this isnt so then anything you can do I cant do as well There are moments of truth in everyones life when one sees quite clearly that one cant do everything as well as the next person whether its sweeping a path or writing a bookThis kind of stance which is very common is the opposite of peacefulnessA display of either ones own abilities or the lack of them will produce restlessness rather than peaceTheres always the reaching out the craving for a result in the form of other peoples admittance of ones own superiority or their denial of itWhen they deny it there is warfareWhen they admit it there is victoryVictory over other people has as its underlying cause a battleIn war there is never a winner there are only losersNo matter who signs the peacetreaty first both sides loseThe same applies to this kind of attitudeThere are only losers even though one may have a momentary victory having been accepted as the one who knows better or is stronger or clevererBattle and peace do not go well togetherOne wonders in the end does anybody really want peaceNobody seems to have itIs anybody really trying to get itOne does get in life what one strongly determinesIt is important to inquire into our innermost heart whether peace is really what we wantThe inquiry into ones heart is a difficult thing to doMost people have a steel door of thick dimensions which is covering the opening of their heartThey cant get in to find out whats going on insideBut everyone needs to try to get in as far as possible and check ones prioritiesIn moments of turmoil when one is either not getting the supremacy one wants or one feels really inferior then all one desires is peaceLet it all subside again and neither the superiority nor the inferiority is very distinct then what happensIs it really peace one wantsOr does one want to be somebody special somebody important or lovableA somebody never has peaceThere is an interesting simile about a mango tree a king went riding in the forest and encountered a mango tree laden with fruitHe said to his servants Go back in the evening and collect the mangoes because he wanted them for the royal dinner tableThe servants went back to the forest and returned to the palace emptyhanded and told the king Sorry sir the mangoes were all gone there wasnt a single mango left on the tree the king thought the servants had been too lazy to go back to the forest so he rode out himselfWhat he saw instead of the beautiful mango tree laden with fruit was a pitiful bedraggled tree that had been beaten and robbed of its fruit and leavesSomeone unable to reach all the branches had broken them and had taken all the fruitAs the king rode a little farther he came upon another mango tree beautiful in all its green splendor but not a single fruit on itNobody had wanted to go near it since there were no fruits and so it was left in peaceThe king went back to his palace gave his royal crown and scepter to his ministers and said You may now have the kingdom I am going to live in a hut in the forestWhen one is nobody and has nothing then there is no danger of warfare or attack then theres peaceThe mango tree laden with fruit didnt have a moments peace everybody wanted its fruitIf we really want peace we have to be nobodyNeither important nor clever nor beautiful nor famous nor right nor in charge of anythingWe need to be unobtrusive and with as few attributes as possibleThe mango tree which didnt have any fruit was standing peacefully in all its splendor giving shadeTo be nobody doesnt mean never to do anything againIt just means to act without selfdisplay and without craving for resultsThe mango tree had shade to give but it didnt display its wares or fret whether anyone wanted its shadeThis kind of ability allows for inner peaceIt is a rare ability because most people vacillate from one extreme to another either doing nothing and thinking let them see how they get along without me or being in charge and projecting their views and ideasIt seems to be so much more ingrained in us and so much more important to be somebody than to have peaceSo we need to inquire with great care what we are truly looking forWhat is it that we want out of lifeIf we want to be important appreciated loved then we have to take their opposites in stride alsoEvery positive brings with it a negative just as the sun throws shadowsIf we want one we must accept the other without moaning about itBut if we really want a peaceful heart and mind inner security and solidity then we have to give up wanting to be somebody anybody at allBody and mind will not disappear because of that what disappears is the urge and the reaching out and the affirmation of the importance and supremacy of this particular person called meEvery human being considers himself or herself importantThere are billions of people on this globe how many will mourn usCount them for a momentSix or eight or twelve or fifteen out of all these billionsThis consideration may show us that we have a vastly exaggerated idea of our own importanceThe more we can get that into the proper perspective the easier life isWanting to be somebody is dangerousIts like playing with a burning fire into which one puts ones hands all the time and it hurts constantlyNobody will play that game according to our own rulesPeople who really manage to be somebody like heads of state invariably need a solid bodyguard around them because they are in danger of their livesNobody likes to admit that someone else is more importantOne of the major deterrents to peace of mind is the somebody of our own creationIn the world we live in we can find people animals nature and manmade thingsWithin all that if we want to be in charge of anything the only thing we have any jurisdiction over is our own heart and mindIf we really want to be somebody we could try to be that rare person the one who is in charge of his own heart and mindTo be somebody like that is not only very rare but also brings with it the most beneficial resultsSuch a person does not fall into the trap of the defilementsAlthough the defilements may not be uprooted yet he wont commit the error of displaying them and getting involved with themThere is a story about Tan Achaan Cha a famous meditation master in NorthEast ThailandHe was accused by someone of having a lot of hatredTan Achaan Cha replied That may be so but I dont make any use of it An answer like this comes from a deep understanding of ones own nature thats why we are impressed with such a replyIts a rare person who will not allow himself to be defiled by thought speech or actionThat one is really somebody and doesnt have to prove it to anyone else mainly because it is quite obviousIn any case such a person has no desire to prove anythingTheres only one abiding interest and thats ones own peace of mindWhen we have peace of mind as our priority everything that is in the mind and comes out in speech or action is directed towards itAnything that does not create peace of mind is discarded yet we must not confuse this with being right or having the last wordOthers need not agreePeace of mind is ones own everyone has to find his through his own effortsWar and peace are the epic saga of humanityThey are all that our history books contain because they are what our hearts containIf you have ever read Don Quixote youll remember that he was fighting windmillsEverybody is doing just that fighting windmillsDon Quixote was the figment of a writers imagination a man who believed himself to be a great warriorHe thought that every windmill he met was an enemy and started battling with itThats exactly what we are doing within our own hearts and thats why this story has such an everlasting appealIt tells us about ourselvesWriters and poets who have survived their own lifetimes have always told human beings about themselvesMostly people dont listen because it doesnt help when somebody else tells us whats wrong with us and few care to hear itOne has to find out for oneself and most people dont want to do that eitherWhat does it really mean to fight windmillsIt means fighting nothing important or real just imaginary enemies and battlesAll quite trifling matters which we build into something solid and formidable in our mindsWe say I cant stand that so we start fighting and I dont like him and a battle ensues and I feel so unhappy and the inner war is ragingWe hardly ever know what were so unhappy aboutThe weather the food the people the work the leisure the country anything at all will usually doWhy does this happen to usBecause of the resistance to actually letting go and becoming what we really are namely nothingNobody cares to be thatEverybody wants to be something or somebody even if its only Don Quixote fighting windmillsSomebody who knows and acts and will become something else someone who has certain attributes views opinions and ideasEven patently wrong views are held onto tightly because it makes the me more solidIt seems negative and depressing to be nobody and have nothingWe have to find out for ourselves that it is the most exhilarating and liberating feeling we can ever haveBut because we fear that windmills might attach we dont want to let goWhy cant we have peace in the worldBecause nobody wants to disarmNot a single country is ready to sign a disarmament pact which all of us bemoanBut have we ever looked to see whether we ourselves have actually disarmedWhen we havent done so why wonder that nobody else is ready for it eitherNobody wants to be the first one without weapons others might winDoes it really matterIf there is nobody there who can be conqueredHow can there be a victory over nobodyLet those who fight win every war all that matters is to have peace in ones own heartAs long as we are resisting and rejecting and continue to find all sorts of rational excuses to keep on doing that there has to be warfareWar manifests externally in violence aggression and killingBut how does it reveal itself internallyWe have an arsenal within us not of guns and atomic bombs but having the same effectAnd the one who gets hurt is always the one who is shooting namely oneselfSometimes another person comes within firing range and if he or she isnt careful enough he or she is woundedThats a regrettable accidentThe main blasts are the bombs which go off in ones own heartWhere they are detonated thats the disaster areaThe arsenal which we carry around within ourselves consists of our ill will and anger our desires and cravingsThe only criterion is that we dont feel peaceful insideWe need not believe in anything we can just find out whether there is peace and joy in our heartIf they are lacking most people try to find them outside of themselvesThats how all wars startIt is always the other countrys fault and if one cant find anyone to blame then one needs more Lebensraum more room for expansion more territorial sovereigntyIn personal terms one needs more entertainment more pleasure more comfort more distractions for the mindIf one cant find anyone else to blame for ones lack of peace then one believes it to be an unfulfilled needWho is that person who needs moreA figment of our own imagination fighting windmillsThat more is never endingOne can go from country to country from person to personThere are billions of people on this globe its hardly likely that we will want to see every one of them or even onehundredth a lifetime wouldnt be enough to do soWe may choose twenty or thirty people and then go from one to the next and back again moving from one activity to another from one idea to anotherWe are fighting against our own dukkha and dont want to admit that the windmills in our heart are selfgeneratedWe believe somebody put them up against us and by moving we can escape from themFew people come to the final conclusion that these windmills are imaginary that one can remove them by not endowing them with strength and importanceThat we can open our hearts without fear and gently gradually let go of our preconceived notions and opinions views and ideas suppressions and conditioned responsesWhen all that is removed what does one have leftA large open space which one can fill with whatever one likesIf one has good sense one will fill it with love compassion and equanimityThen there is nothing left to fightOnly joy and peacefulness remain which cannot be found outside of oneselfIt is quite impossible to take anything from outside and put it into oneselfThere is no opening in us through which peace can enterWe have to start within and work outwardUnless that becomes clear to us we will always find another crusadeImagine what it was like in the days of the crusadesThere were those noble knights who spent all their wealth on equipping themselves with the most modern and advanced weapons outfitting horses and followers and then setting off to bring religion to the infidelsThey died on the way because of hardships and battles and those who reached the end of the journey the Holy Land still did not get any results only more warfareWhen we look at this today it seems utterly foolish to the extent of being ridiculousYet we do the same in our own livesIf for instance we wrote something in our diary that upset us three or four years ago and were to read it now it would seem quite absurdWe wouldnt be able to remember for what reason it could possibly have been importantWe are constantly engaged in such foolishness with minor and unimportant trifles and spend our energies trying to work them out to our egosatisfactionWouldnt it be much better to forget such mental formations and attend to whats really importantThere is only one thing thats important to every being and that is a peaceful and happy heartIt cannot be bought nor is it given awayNobody can hand it to someone else and it cannot be foundRamana Maharshi a sage in southern India said Peace and happiness are not our birthrightWhoever has attained them has done so by continual effortSome people have an idea that peace and happiness are synonymous with doing nothing having no duties or responsibilities being looked after by othersThats rather a result of lazinessTo gain peace and happiness one has to make unrelenting effort in ones own heartOne cant achieve it through proliferation by trying to get more only by wanting lessBecoming emptier and emptier until there is just open space to be filled with peace and happinessAs long as our hearts are full of likes and dislikes how can peace and happiness find any roomOne can find peace within oneself in any situation any place any circumstance but only through effort not through distractionThe world offers distractions and sense contacts and they are often quite temptingThe more action there is the more distracted the mind can be and the less one has to look at ones own dukkhaWhen one has the time and opportunity to introspect one finds ones inner reality different from what one imaginedMany people quickly look away again they dont want to know about thatIts nobodys fault that there is dukkhaThe only cure is letting goIts really quite simple but few people believe this to the point of trying it outThere is a wellknown simile about a monkey trapThe kind used in Asia is a wooden funnel with a small openingAt the bigger end lies a sweetThe monkey attracted by the sweet puts his paw into the narrow opening and gets hold of the sweetWhen he wants to draw his paw out again he cant get his fist with the sweet through the narrow openingHe is trapped and the hunter will come and capture himHe doesnt realize that all he has to do to be free is to let go of the sweetThats what our life is all aboutA trap because we want it nice and sweetNot being able to let go were caught in the ever recurring happinessunhappiness updown hopingdespairing cycleInstead of trying it out for ourselves whether we could let go and be free we resist and reject such a notionYet we all agree that all that matters are peace and happiness which can only exist in a free mind and heartThere is a lovely story from Nazrudin a Sufi Master who was gifted in telling absurd talesOne day the story goes he sent one of his disciples to the market and asked him to buy him a bag of chiliesThe disciple did as requested and brought the bag to Nazrudin who began to eat the chilies one after anotherSoon his face turned red his nose started running his eyes began to water and he was chokingThe disciple observed this for a while with awe and then said Sir your face is turning red your eyes are watering and you are chokingWhy dont you stop eating these chilies Nazrudin replied I am waiting for a sweet oneThe teaching aid of chiliesWe too are waiting for something somewhere that will create peace and happiness for usMeanwhile there is nothing but dukkha the eyes are watering the nose is running but we wont stop our own creationsThere must be a sweet one at the bottom of the bagIts no use thinking hearing or reading about it the only effective way is to look inside ones own heart and see with understandingThe more the heart is full of wanting and desiring the harder and more difficult life becomesWhy fight all these windmillsThey are selfbuilt and can also be selfremovedIts a very rewarding experience to check whats cluttering up ones own heart and mindAs one finds emotion after emotion not to create allowances and justifications for them but to realize that they constitute the worlds battlegrounds and start dismantling the weapons so that disarmament becomes a realityTruth occupies a very important position in the Buddhas teachingThe Four Noble Truths are the hub of the wheel of the DhammaTruth is one of the ten perfections to be cultivated in order to purify oneselfTruth can have different aspectsIf we want to find an end to suffering we have to find truth at its deepest levelThe moral precepts which include not lying are a basic training without which one cant lead a spiritual lifeTo get to the bottom of truth one has to get to the bottom of oneself and that is not an easy thing to do aggravated by the problem of not loving oneselfIt naturally follows that if one wants to learn to love oneself there must be hate present and we are caught in the world of dualityWhile we are floating around in the world of duality we cant get to the bottom of truth because we are suspended in a wave motion going back and forthThere is an interesting admonition in the Sutta Nipata mentioning that one should not have associates which prevents attachmentsThis would result in neither love nor hate so that only equanimity remains evenmindedness towards all that existsWith equanimity one is no longer suspended between good and bad love and hate friend and enemy but has been able to let go to get to the bottom where truth can be foundIf we want to find the basic underlying truth of all existence we must practice letting go This includes our weakest and our strongest attachments many of which arent even recognized as clingingTo return to the simile of the truth to be found at the bottom we can see that if we are clinging to anything we cant get down to itWere attached to the things people ideas and views which we consider ours and believe to be right and usefulThese attachments will keep us from getting in touch with absolute truthOur reactions the likes and dislikes hold us in suspenseWhile it is more pleasant to like something or someone yet both are due to attachmentsThis difficulty is closely associated with distraction in meditationJust as we are attached to the food that we get for the body we are equally attached to food for the mind so the thoughts go here and there picking up tidbitsAs we do that we are again held in suspense moving from thought to breath and back again being in the world of dualityWhen our mind acts in this way it cannot get to rock bottomDepth of understanding enables release from sufferingWhen one goes deeper and deeper into oneself one finds no core and learns to let go of attachmentsWhether we find anything within us which is pure desirable commendable or whether its impure and unpleasant makes no differenceAll mental states owned and cherished keep us in duality where we are hanging in midair feeling very insecureThey cannot bring an end to sufferingOne moment all might be well in our world and we love everyone but five minutes later we might react with hate and rejectionWe might be able to agree with the Buddhas words or regard them as a plausible explanation but without the certainty of personal experience this is of limited assistance to usIn order to have direct knowledge its as if we were a weight and must not be tied to anything so that we can sink down to the bottom of all the obstructions to see the truth shining throughThe tool for that is a powerful mind a weighty mindAs long as the mind is interested in petty concerns it doesnt have the weightiness that can bring it to the depth of understandingFor most of us our mind is not in the heavyweight class but more akin to bantam weightThe punch of a heavyweight really accomplishes something that of a bantam weight is not too meaningfulThe lightweight mind is attached here and there to people and their opinions to ones own opinions to the whole duality of pure and impure right and wrongWhy do we take it so personal when its truly universalThat seems to be the biggest difference between living at ease and being able to let the mind delve into the deepest layer of truth or living at loggerheads with oneself and othersNeither hate nor greed are a personal manifestation nobody has a singular claim on them they belong to humanityWe can learn to let go of that personalized idea about our mind states which would rid us of a serious impedimentGreed hate and impurities exist by the same token nongreed and nonhate also existCan we own the whole lotOr do we own them in succession or five minutes at a time for eachWhy own any of them they just exist and seeing that it becomes possible to let oneself sink into the depth of the Buddhas visionThe deepest truth that the Buddha taught was that there is no individual personThis has to be accepted and experienced at a feeling levelAs long as one hasnt let go of owning body and mind one cannot accept that one isnt really this personThis is a gradual processIn meditation one learns to let go of ideas and stories and attend to the meditation subjectIf we dont let go we cannot sink into the meditationThe mind has to be a heavyweight for that tooWe can compare the ordinary mind to bobbing around on the waves of thoughts and feelingsThe same happens in meditation therefore we need to prepare ourselves for becoming concentratedWe can look at all mind states arising during the day and learn to let go of themThe ease and buoyancy which arises from this process is due to being unattachedIf we dont practice throughout the day our meditation suffers because we have not come to the meditation cushion in a suitable frame of mindIf one has been letting go all day the mind is ready and can now let go in meditation tooThen it can experience its own happiness and puritySometimes people think of the teaching as a sort of therapy which it undoubtedly is but thats not its ultimate aim only one of its secondary aspectsThe Buddhas teaching takes us to the end of suffering once and for all not just momentarily when things go wrongHaving had an experience of letting go even just once proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that it means getting rid of a great burdenCarrying ones hate and greed around is a heavy load which when abandoned gets us out of the duality of judgmentIts pleasant to be without thinking mental formations are troublesomeIf we succeed even once or twice during a day to let go of our reactions we have taken a great step and can more easily do it againWe have realized that a feeling which has arisen can be stopped it need not be carried around all dayThe relief from this will be the proof that a great inner discovery has been made and that the simplicity of nonduality shows us the way towards truthIn order to embrace the spiritual path fully be able to grow on it and walk along it with a feeling of security one has to renounceRenunciation doesnt necessarily mean cutting off ones hair or wearing robesRenunciation means letting go of all ideas and hopes that the mind would like to grasp and retain be interested in and wants to investigateThe mind wants to have more of whatever is availableIf it cant get more then it makes up fantasies and imaginings and projects them upon the worldThat will never bring true satisfaction inner peace which can only be won by renunciationLetting go is the key word of the Buddhist path the fading away of desireOne must realize once and for all that more is not better It is impossible to come to an end of more there is always something beyond itBut it is certainly possible to come to the end of less which is a much more sensible approachWhy sit in seclusion in meditation and spoil ones chances at all the opportunities the world offers for enjoymentOne could go on trips work at a challenging job meet interesting people write letters or read books have a pleasant time somewhere else and really feel at ease  one could even find a different spiritual pathWhen the meditation does not succeed the thought may arise What am I really doing why am I doing it what for whats the good of it Then the idea comes I cant really do this very well maybe I should try something elseThe world glitters and promises so much but never never keeps its promisesEveryone has tried a number of its temptations and not one of them has really been fulfillingThe real fulfillment the completeness of peace lacking nothing the totality of being at ease and not wanting anything cannot be fulfilled in the worldTheres nothing that can fill ones wants utterly and completelyMoney material possessions another person some of these can do soAnd yet theres that niggling doubt Maybe Ill find something else more comfortable easier not so demanding and above all something new Always that which is new promises fulfillmentThe mind has to be understood for what it is just another sense that has as its base the brain just as seeing has as its base the eyeAs the mindmoments arise and contact is made with them we start believing what we are thinking and even owning it Its mine Because of that were really interested in our thoughts and want to look after themIts a foregone conclusion that people look after their own belongings much better than they look after other peoples things so that one follows ones own mindmoments and believes them allYet they will never bring happinessWhat they bring is hope and worry and doubtSometimes they supply entertainment and at other times depressionWhen doubts arise and one follows through on them goes along with them they can lead us to the point at which there is no practice left at allYet the only way to prove that the spiritual life brings fulfillment is to practiceThe proof of the pudding lies in the eatingNobody else can prove it to us wanting outside proof so that all one has to do is grab a hold of it and nourish oneself is a wrong approachThe fulfillment we are looking for is not what we can get and stuff into this mind and bodyThe gaping hole is much too large to fillThe only way we can find fulfillment is to let go of expectations and wanting of everything that goes on in the mind so that there is nothing lackingThen theres nothing left to fillThe misunderstanding which recurs over and over again is this typical attitude of I want to be givenI want to get knowledge understanding lovingkindness considerationI want to receive a spiritual awakening There is nothing that one can be given except instructions and methodsOne needs to do the daily work of practice so that purification will resultThe lack of fulfillment cannot be remedied by wanting to be given something newWere not even clear about where this is to come fromMaybe from the Buddha or from the Dhamma or we might want it from our teacherPossibly we would like to get it from our meditation or from a bookThe answer is not in getting something from outside of ourselves but rather lies in discarding everythingWhat do we need to get rid of firstPreferably the convolutions of the mind that constantly tell us stories which are fantastic and unbelievableYet when we hear them we ourselves believe themOne way to look at them and disbelieve them is to write them downThey sound absurd when theyre written down on paperThe mind can always think up new stories theres no end to themRenunciation is the keyGiving up letting goGiving up also means giving in to that underlying subconscious knowing that the worldly way doesnt work that there is a different wayWe cannot try to remain in the world and add something to our life but rather give our ambitions up completelyTo stay the way one is and then add something to that  how can it possibly workIf one has a nonfunctioning machine and adds another part to it its not going to make it functionOne has to overhaul the whole machineThat means accepting our underlying understanding that the old ways of thinking arent usefulTheres always dukkha again and againIt keeps coming doesnt itSometimes we think It must be due to a particular person or maybe its due to the weather Then the weather changes or that person leaves but dukkha is still presentSo it wasnt that and we have to try to find something elseInstead we need to become pliable and soft and attend to that which is truly arising without all the convolutions conglomerations proliferations of the mindThat which arises may be either pure or impure and we need to know how to handle each oneOnce we start explaining and rationalizing the whole process breaks down againWe mustnt think that we can add anything to ourselves in order to make us wholeAll has to be taken away the whole identifiable lot then we become a whole personRenunciation is letting go of ideation of the mindstuff that claims to be the person who knowsWho knows that person who knowsThese are only ideas churning around arising and ceasingRenunciation is not an outward manifestation thats only its resultThe cause is an inward one which is the one we need to practiceIf we think of a nunnery as a place for meditation we will find that meditation cannot happen without renunciationIn the Sutta Nipata we find a discourse by the Buddha entitled The Rhinoceros Horn in which he compares the one horn of the rhinoceros with the sages solitudeThe Buddha praises being alone and the refrain to every stanza of the sutta is One should wander solitary as a rhinoceros horn There are two kinds of solitude that of the mind and that of the bodyEveryone is familiar with solitude of the bodyWe go away and sit by ourselves in a room or cave or tell the people we are living with that we want to be left alonePeople usually like that sort of solitude for short periodsIf this aloneness is maintained it is often due to people not being able to get along with others or being afraid of them because there isnt enough love in their own heartsOften there may be a feeling of loneliness which is detrimental to solitudeLoneliness is a negative state of mind in which one feels bereft of companionshipWhen one lives in a family or community it is sometimes difficult to find physical solitude its not even very practicalBut physical solitude is not the only kind of aloneness there isMental solitude is an important factor for practiceUnless one is able to arouse mental solitude in oneself one will not be able to be introspective to find out what changes in oneself are necessaryMental solitude means first and foremost not to be dependent on others for approval for companionable talk for a relationshipIt doesnt mean that one becomes unfriendly towards others just that one is mentally independentIf another person is kind to us well and goodIf that isnt the case thats fine too and makes no differenceThe horn of a rhinoceros is straight and solid and so strong that we cant bend itCan our minds be like thatMental solitude cuts out idle chatter which is detrimental to spiritual growthTalking about nothing at all just letting off steamWhen we let the steam go from a pot we cant cook the foodOur practice can be likened to putting the heat on oneselfIf we let off steam again and again that inner process is stoppedIts much better to let the steam accumulate and find out what is cookingThat is the most important work we can doEverybody should have occasion each day to be on her own physically for some time so that we can really feel alone totally by ourselvesSometimes we may think People are talking about me That doesnt matter we are the owners of our own kammaIf somebody talks about us its their kammaIf we get upset thats our kammaGetting interested in what is being said is enough to show that we are dependent on peoples approvalWhos approving of whomMaybe the five khandha are approvingOr possibly the hair of the head the hair of the body nails teeth and skinWhich self is approving the good one the bad one the mediocre one or maybe the nonselfUnless one can find a feeling of solidity in oneself from the center where there is no movement one is always going to feel insecureNobody can be liked by everyone not even the BuddhaBecause we have defilements we are always on the lookout for everybody elses pollutionsNone of that matters its all totally unimportantThe only thing that is significant is to be mindful totally attentive to each step on the way to what one is doing feeling thinkingIts so easy to forget thisTheres always somebody with whom to talk or another cup of tea to be hadThats how the world lives and the inhabitants are mostly unhappyBut the Buddhas path leads out of the world to independent happinessLetting off steam idle chatter and looking for companionship are the wrong things to doTrying to find out what people are thinking about one is immaterial and irrelevant and has nothing to do with the spiritual pathSolitude in the mind means that one can be alone in the midst of the crowdEven in a large and agitated crowd of people one would still be able to operate from ones own center giving out love and compassion and not being influenced by what is happening around oneThat can be called ideal solitude and means one has removed oneself from the future and past which is necessary in order to stand straight and aloneIf one is attached to the future then there is worry and if one is hankering for the past there is either desire or rejectionThat is the constant chatter of the mind not conducive to mental solitudeSolitude can only be fully experienced when there is inner peaceOtherwise loneliness pushes one to try and remedy a feeling of emptiness and lossWhere is everybodyWhat can I do without some companionshipI must discuss my problems Mindfulness is able to take care of all that because it has to arise in the present moment and has nothing to do with future and pastIt keeps one totally occupied and saves one from making mistakes which are natural to human beingsBut the greater the mindfulness the fewer mistakesErrors on the mundane level also have repercussions on the supermundane path because they are due to a lack of mindfulness which will not allow us to get past our selfinflicted dukkhaWe will try again and again to find someone who is to blame or someone who can distract usIdeal solitude arises when a person can be alone or with others and remain of one piece not getting caught in someone elses difficultiesWe may respond in an appropriate manner but we are not affectedWe all have our own inner life and we only get to know it well when the mind stops chattering and we can attend to our inner feelingsOnce we have seen what is happening inside of us we will want to change itOnly the fully Enlightened One has an inner life which needs no changingOur inner stress and lack of peace push us outward to find someone who will remove a moment of dukkha but only we ourselves can do itSolitude may be physical but thats not its main functionThe solitary mind is one which can have profound and original thoughtsA dependent mind thinks in cliches the way everybody else does because it wants approvalSuch a mind understands on a surface level just like the world does and cannot grasp the profundity and depth of the Buddhas teachingThe solitary mind is at ease because it is unaffectedIts interesting that a mind at ease which can stand on its own also can memorizeBecause such a mind is not filled with the desire to remove dukkha it can remember without much troubleThis is one of its side benefitsThe main value of a solitary mind is its imperturbabilityIt cant be shaken and will stand without support just as a strong tree doesnt need a propBecause its powerful in its own rightIf the mind doesnt have enough vigour to stand on its own it wont have the strength and determination to fulfill the DhammaOur practice includes being on our own some time each day to introspect and contemplateReading talking and listening are all communication with others which are necessary at timesBut it is essential to have time for selfinquiry What is happening within meWhat am I feelingIs it wholesome or notAm I perfectly contented on my ownHow much selfconcern is thereIs the Dhamma my guide or am I bewildered If theres a fog in ones mind all we need is a searchlight to penetrate itThe searchlight is concentrationHealth wealth and youth do not mean no dukkhaThey are a coverupIllhealth poverty and old age make it easier to realize the unsatisfactoriness of our existenceWhen we are alone that is the time to get to know ourselvesWe can investigate the meaning of the Dhamma weve heard and whether we can actualize it in our own livesWe can use those aspects of the Dhamma which are most meaningful for usThe solitary mind is a strong mind because it knows how to stand stillThat doesnt mean not associating with people at all that would lack lovingkindnessA solitary mind is able to be alone and introspect and also be loving towards othersLiving in a Dhamma community is an ideal place to practice thisMeditation is the means for concentration which is the tool to break through the fog enveloping everyone who is not an arahantAt times in communal living there is togetherness and lovingness and serviceThese should be the results of metta not of trying to get away from dukkhaNext time we start a conversation lets first investigate Why am I having this discussionIs it necessary or am I bored and want to get away from my problemsClear comprehension is the mental factor which joins with mindfulness to give purpose and directionWe examine whether our speech and actions are having the right purpose whether we are using skillful means and whether the initial purpose has been accomplishedIf we have no clearcut direction idle chatter resultsEven in meditation the mind does it which is due to lack of trainingWhen we practice clear comprehension we need to stop a moment and examine the whole situation before plunging inThis may become one of our skillful habits not often found in the worldAn important aspect of the Buddhas teaching is the combination of clear comprehension with mindfulnessThe Buddha often recommends them as the way out of all sorrow and we need to practice them in our small everyday effortsThese may consist of learning something new a Dhamma sentence remembered one line of chanting memorized one new insight about oneself one aspect of reality realizedSuch a mind gains strength and selfconfidenceRenunciation is the greatest help in gaining selfconfidenceOne knows one can get along without practically everything for instance food for quite some timeOnce the Buddha went to a village where nobody had any faith in himHe received no almsfood at all nobody in the village paid any attention to himHe went to the outskirts and sat down on a bit of straw and meditatedAnother ascetic came by who had seen that the Buddha had not received any food and commiserated with him You must be feeling very badly not having anything to eatIm very sorryYou dont even have a nice place to sleep just straw The Buddha replied Feeders on joy we areInner joy can feed us for many daysOne can get along without many things when they are voluntarily given upIf someone takes our belongings we resist which is dukkhaBut when we practice selfdenial we gain strength and enable the mind to stand on its ownSelfconfidence arises and creates a really strong backboneRenunciation of companionship shows us whether we are selfsufficientThe Buddha did not advocate exaggerated and harmful ascetic practicesbut we could give up  for instance  afternoon conversations and contemplate insteadAfterwards the mind feels contented with its own effortsThe more effort one can make the more satisfaction arisesWe need a solitary mind in meditation so we need to practice it some time during each dayThe secluded mind has two attributes one is mindfulness full attention and clear comprehension and the other is introspection and contemplationBoth of them bring the mind to unificationOnly in togetherness lies strength unification brings powerThe twelvepointdependentorigination starts with ignorance and goes through kamma formations rebirth consciousness mind and matter sense contacts feeling craving clinging becoming birth and ends with deathGetting born means dyingDuring that sequence there is one point of escape  from feeling to cravingWhile this is called the mundane dependentorigination the Buddha also taught a supermundane transcendental series of cause and effectThat one starts with unsatisfactorinessDukkha needs to be seen for what it really is namely the best starting point for our spiritual journeyUnless we know and see dukkha we would have little reason to practiceIf we havent acknowledged the overall existence of dukkha we wouldnt be interested in getting out of its clutchesThe transcendentaldependentorigination starts out with the awareness and inner knowledge of the inescapable suffering in the human realmWhen we reflect upon this we will no longer try to find a way out through human endeavor nor through becoming more informed or knowledgeable or richer or owning more or having more friendsSeeing dukkha as an inescapable condition bound up with existence we no longer feel oppressed by itIts inescapable that there is thunder and lightning so we dont try to reject the weatherThere have to be thunder lightning and rain so we can grow foodDukkha is equally inescapableWithout it the human condition would not existThere wouldnt be rebirth decay and deathHaving seen it like that one loses ones resistance to itThe moment one is no longer repelled by dukkha suffering is greatly diminishedIts our resistance which creates the craving to get rid of it which makes it so much worseHaving understood dukkha in this way one may be fortunate enough to make contact with the true Dhamma the Buddhas teachingThis is due to ones own good kammaThere are innumerable people who never get in touch with DhammaThey might even be born in a place where the Dhamma is being preached but they will have no opportunity to hear itThere are many more people who will not be searching for the Dhamma because theyre still searching for the escape route in the human endeavor looking in the wrong directionHaving come to the conclusion that the world will not provide real happiness then one also has to have the good kamma to be able to listen to true DhammaIf these conditions arise then faith resultsFaith has to be based on trust and confidenceIf these are lacking the path will not openOne becomes trusting like a child holding the hand of a grownup when crossing the streetThe child believes that the grownup will be watching out for traffic so that no accident will happenThe small child doesnt have the capacity to gauge when its safe to cross but it trusts someone with greater experienceWe are like children compared to the BuddhaIf we can have a childlike innocence then it will be possible for us to give ourselves unstintingly to the teaching and the practice holding onto the hand of the true Dhamma that will guide usLife and practice will be simplified when the judging and weighing of choice is removedNo longer I should do it another way or go somewhere else or find out how it is done by others These are possibilities but they are not conducive to good practice or to getting out of dukkhaTrust in the Dhamma helps to keep the mind steadyOne has to find out for oneself if this is the correct escape route but if we dont try we wont knowIf dukkha is still regarded as a calamity we will not have enough space in the mind to have trustThe mind will be full of grief pain lamentation forgetting that all of us are experiencing our kamma resultants and nothing elseThis is part of being a human being subject to ones own kammaResistance to dukkha saps our energy and the mind cannot stretch to its full capacityIf dukkha is seen as the necessary ingredient to spur one on to leave samsara behind then ones positive attitude will point in the right directionDukkha is not a tragedy but rather a basic ingredient for insightThis must not only be a thinking process but felt with ones heartIts too easy to think like that and not to do anything about itBut when our heart is truly touched trust and confidence in the Dhamma arise as the way out of all sufferingThe Dhamma is totally opposed to worldly thinking where suffering is considered to be a great misfortuneIn the Dhamma suffering is seen as the first step to transcend the human conditionThe understanding of dukkha has to be firm in order to arouse trust in that part of the teaching which one hasnt experienced oneself yetIf one has already tried many other escape routes and none of them actually worked then one will find it easier to become that trusting childlike person walking along this difficult path without turning right or left knowing that the teaching is true and letting it be ones guideSuch faith brings joy without which the path is a heavy burden and will not flourishJoy is a necessary and essential ingredient of the spiritual lifeJoy is not to be mistaken for pleasure exhilaration or exuberanceJoy is a feeling of ease and gladness knowing one has found that which transcends all sufferingPeople sometimes have the mistaken idea that to be holy or pious means having a sad face and walking around in a mournful wayYet the Buddha is said never to have cried and is usually depicted with a halfsmile on his faceHoliness does not stand for sadness it means wholenessWithout joy there is no wholenessThis inner joy carries with it the certainty that the path is blameless the practice is fruitful and the conduct is appropriateWe need to sit down for meditation with a joyous feeling and the whole experience of meditation will culminate in happinessThis brings us tranquillity as we no longer look around for outside satisfactionWe know only to look into ourselvesTheres nowhere to go and nothing to do its all happening withinSuch tranquillity is helpful to concentrated meditation and creates the feeling of being in the right spot at the right timeIt creates ease of mind which facilitates meditation and is conducive to eliminating sceptical doubtSceptical doubt is the harbinger of restlessness joy begets calmWe need not worry about our own or the worlds future its just a matter of time until we fathom absolute realityWhen the path the practice and effort mesh together results are bound to comeIt is essential to have complete confidence in everything the Buddha saidWe cant pick out the ideas we want to believe because they happen to be in accordance with what we like anyway and discard othersThere are no choices to be made its all or nothingTranquillity helps concentration to ariseDukkha itself can lead us to proper concentration if we handle it properlyBut we mustnt reject it thinking that it is a quirk of fate that has brought all this grief to us or think that other people are causing itIf we use dukkha to push us onto the path then proper concentration can resultRight concentration makes it possible for the mind to stretchThe mind that is limited obstructed and defiled cannot grasp the profundity of the teachingIt may get an inkling that there is something extraordinary available but it cannot go into the depth of itOnly the concentrated mind can extend its limitationsWhen it does that it may experience the knowledgeandvisionofthingsastheyreallyareThe Buddha often used this phrase theknowledgeandvisionofthingsastheyreallyareThis is distinct from the way we think they are or might be or as wed like them to be hopefully comfortable and pleasantBut rather birth decay disease and death not getting what one wants or getting what one doesnt want a constant perception of what we dislike because it fails to support our egobeliefIn knowing and seeing things as they really are we will lose that distasteWe will come to see that within this realm of impermanence unsatisfactoriness and corelessness there is nothing that can be grasped and found to be solid and satisfyingNo person no possession no thought no feelingNothing can be clung to and found to be steady and supportiveThis is right view beyond our ordinary everyday perceptionIt results from right concentration and comes from dealing with dukkha in a positive welcoming wayWhen we try to escape from dukkha by either forgetting about it running away from it blaming someone else becoming depressed by it or feeling sorry for ourselves we are creating more dukkhaAll these methods are based on selfdelusionThe knowledgeandvisionofthingsastheyreallyare is the first step on the noble path everything else has been the preliminary workSometimes our understanding may feel like one of those mystery pictures that children play withNow you see it now you dontWhen any aspect of Dhamma is clearly visible to us we must keep on resurrecting that visionIf it is correct dukkha has no sting it just isDecay disease and death do not appear fearfulThere is nothing to fear because everything falls apart continuallyThis body disintegrates and the mind changes every momentWithout knowledge and vision of reality the practice is difficultAfter having this clear perception the practice is the only possible thing to doEverything else is only a sideissue and a distractionFrom the knowledgeandvision arises disenchantment with what the world has to offerAll the glitter that seems to be gold turns out to be fools gold which cannot satisfyIt gives us pleasure for one moment and displeasure the next and has to be searched for again and againThe world of the senses has fooled us so often that were still enmeshed in it and still experiencing dukkha unless the true vision arisesTheres a poster available in Australia which reads Life be in it Wouldnt it be better if it said Life be out of it Life and existence is bound up with the constant renewal of our sense contacts seeing hearing tasting touching smelling and thinkingOnly when we have clear perception will disenchantment set in and then the most wonderful sense contact will no longer entice us to reactIt just exists but doesnt touch our heartMara the tempter has lost his grip and has been shown the doorHes waiting at the doorstep to slip in again at the first possible opportunity but he isnt so comfortably ensconced inside any moreThis brings a great deal of security and satisfaction to the heartOne wont be swayed to leave this path of practiceWhen Mara is still calling theres no peace in the heartOne cant be at ease and satisfied because theres always something new to tempt usWith knowledgeandvisionofthingsastheyreallyare and subsequent disenchantment we realize that the Buddhas path leads us to tranquillity peace and the end of dukkhaDukkha is really our staunchest friend our most faithful supporterWell never find another friend or helpmate like it if it is seen in the right way without resistance or rejectionWhen we use dukkha as our incentive for practice gratitude and appreciation for it will ariseThis takes the sting out of our pain and transforms it into our most valuable experienceMost people are inclined to blame either themselves or others for whatever they consider wrongSome people like to blame mostly others some prefer to blame themselvesNeither way is profitable or will bring peace of mindIt may help to really get a grip on the facts that prevail within each human being by knowing the underlying tendencies within usIf we understand that every human being has these tendencies then we may be less inclined to blame or be upset or take offence and more inclined to accept with equanimityWe may be more prone to work on these negatives when we become aware of them in ourselvesThe underlying tendencies are more subtle than the five hindrances the hindrances are gross and exhibit themselves in that waySensual desire wanting that which is pleasing to the sensesIllwill getting angry upsetSloth and torpor having no energy whatsoeverSloth refers to the body torpor to the mindRestlessness and worry being illatease no peacefulnessSceptical doubt not knowing which way to turnThese five are easily discernible in oneself and othersBut the underlying tendencies are more difficult to pinpointThey are the hidden sources for the hindrances to arise and in order to get rid of them one needs keen mindfulness and a great deal of discernmentHaving worked with the five hindrances in oneself and to a certain degree having let go of their grossest aspects one can begin work on the underlying tendenciesThe word itself suggests their characteristic namely that their roots are deeply imbedded and therefore hard to see and eliminateThe first two tendencies are similar to the hindrances sensuality and irritation being the underlying bases for sensual desire and angerEven when sensual desire has been largely abandoned and anger no longer arises the disposition to sensuality and irritation remainSensuality is part and parcel of a human being and shows itself in becoming attached and reacting to what one sees hears smells tastes touches and thinksOne is concerned with what one feels and has not yet come to the understanding that the sense objects are only impermanent phenomena arising and passing awayWhen this lack of profound insight is still prevalent one ascribes importance to the impressions which come in through the sensesOne is drawn to them and seeks pleasure in themWhen the senses are still playing an important part in a person there is sensualityMan is a sensuous beingThere is a verse which describes the noble Sangha as having pacified senses The LovingKindness Sutta describes the ideal monk as with senses calmed In many a sutta the Buddha said that getting rid of sense desire is the way to NibbanaSensuality as an ingrained part of being human has to be transcended with great effort and cannot be done without insightIts impossible to succeed just by avowing sensuality isnt useful Ill let go of it One has to gain the insight that these sense contacts have no intrinsic value in themselvesThere is a coming together of the sense base with the sense object and the sense consciousness to form an impingementThats all thats happeningAs long as one reacts to these contacts as if they had importance there is sensualityWhere there is sensuality there is also irritation the two go hand in handSensuality is satisfied when the sense contact impingement was pleasantIrritation arises when the sense contact was unpleasantIt doesnt have to issue as anger shouting fury hate or even resistanceIts just irritation which results in being displeased feeling illatease and restlessIt goes together with being a sensuous human beingSensuality and irritation only disappear for the nonreturnerThe last stage before full Enlightenment one who does not return to this realm but attains Nibbana in the Pure Abodes Even the streamenterer and the oncereturner the first and second stage of noble attainment are still beset by the dukkha of sensuality and irritationIf one imagines that the impulse creating sensuality or irritation is outside of oneself one hasnt seen the beginning of the path yetIt is necessary to realize that the reaction is our own so that we may start work on ourselvesIf we dont even notice it happening how can we do anything about itIts occurring constantly without letup so that we have innumerable occasions to become aware of our inner worldBecoming aware doesnt mean yet that we can get rid of our reactionsThere also has to be an understanding of the futility of an unwholesome response and an effort to investigate the causesIts easy to see that sensuality and irritation are the underlying tendencies which creates sensual desire and illwillThis insight should arouse a little acceptance and tolerance towards ones own difficulties and those of other peopleIf this is happening to everyone constantly then what is there to get upset aboutThe only thing to do is to work with it to use it as ones subject for contemplation and introspectionIts well worthwhile to use ones difficulties as ones method for the task of purificationOur tendencies and hindrances are all interconnectedIf one is able to diminish one the others also become a little less obstructive lose their heaviness and cease to be so frighteningPeople generally fear their own reactionsThat is why they often feel threatened by others theyre not so much afraid of the other persons reaction but far more so of their ownTheyre unsure of themselves fearing to become aggressive angry and then losing some of their own selfimageHaving a selfimage is very detrimental because it is based on the illusion of permanenceEverything constantly changes including ourselves while a selfimage presupposes stabilityOne moment we may be a sensual being the next moment an irritable oneSometimes we are at ease at other times we are restlessWhich one are weTo have an image of oneself creates a concept of permanence which can never have any basis in factIt blocks ones insight into the underlying tendencies because one will be blind to those which do not fit ones imageThe third underlying tendency is doubt or hesitationIf one has doubts one hesitates What am I going to do next One doubts ones own path and abilities and how to proceedDue to hesitation one doesnt use ones time wiselyAt times one may waste it or overindulge in activities which are not beneficialDoubt means that one doesnt have an inner vision to guide one but is obsessed by uncertaintyDoubts and hesitation lie in our hearts because of a feeling of insecurityWe are afraid of not being safeBut theres no safety anywhere the only one that can be found is NibbanaThis fear and insecurity in the heart cause doubt and hesitation to ariseIf we were to leave them behind and not pay any attention to them we could step ahead so much more easily and could accomplish many times moreDoubt and hesitation are abandoned with streamentryThe one who has attained the first Path and Fruit no longer doubts because that person has had a personal experience of an unconditioned reality totally different from the relative reality in which we liveHe can now forge ahead without worry or fearThere can be no doubt about a direct experienceIf we tell a small child Please dont touch the stove you might get burned its quite likely that the child will nevertheless touch the stoveHaving once touched it and experienced the painful feeling of being burned he will surely never touch it againThe experience removes doubt and hesitationThe next underlying tendency is the wrong view of relating all that happens to a self This goes on constantly and we can verify that easily as it happens to everybodyVery few people realize This is just mental phenomena They believe I think When there is pain in the body few will say Its just an unpleasant feeling Theyll say Im feeling very badly or I have a terrible pain This reaction to whatever happens as self is due to an underlying tendency so deeply imbedded that it takes great effort to loosen its holdTo lose the wrong view of self does not simply mean to intellectually understand that there is no real self What is required is an inner view of this whole conglomeration of mind and body as nothing but mere phenomena without ownershipThe first step is taken at streamentry when right view of self arises though all clinging to selfconcepts is abandoned only at arahant levelNext comes pride and conceit which here means having a certain concept of ourselves such as being a man or a woman young or old beautiful or uglyWe conceive of what we want feel think know own and what we can doAll this conceptualizing creates ownership and we become proud of possessions knowledge skills feelings being someone specialThis pride may be deeply hidden in ourselves and hard to find and may need some introspective diggingThis is due to the fact that so much of our whole being is involvedWhen we say Now find that concept about being a woman the answer often is Of course I am a woman what else am I But as long as I am anything woman man child stupid or intelligent I am far from NibbanaWhatever I conceptualize myself to be stops me in my tracksThe underlying tendency of pride and conceit is only uprooted for the arahantTheres no directly discernible relationship to any of the hindrances there but the conceiving of self and the wrong view of self are the chief manifestations of delusion the root cause for all our defilementsNext we come to clinging to existenceThats our survival syndrome clinging to being here not willing to give up not ready to die todayWe must learn to be ready to die now not wishing to die but to be ready for itWishing to die is the other side of the same coin of clinging to existenceIts trying to get rid of existence because life is too difficultBut being ready to die now means that the clinging to being someone and being here to prove it has been abandoned for it has been seen to be a fallacyAt that time wrong view of self has been eliminatedClinging to existence brings us into a dependency syndromeWe want everything to work out well for us and resent it if that doesnt happenThis creates irritation and sensualityWe often forget that we are only guests here on this planet and our visit is limited and can be over at any timeThis clinging to being alive brings much difficulty to all of us because it projects us into the future so that we cant attend to the presentIf we dont live in the present were missing out on being alive at allTheres no life in the future its all ideation conjecture a hope and a prayerIf we really want to be alive and experience things as they are weve got to be here now attending to each momentThis entails letting go of clinging to what will happen to us in the future particularly whether we are going to continue to existExisting in this moment is enoughTo be able to let go of that clinging means to let go of the future only then will there be strong mindfulness real attention and clear knowingClinging to existence will always give us the idea that something better will come along if we just wait long enough and that denies effortEffort can only be made now who knows what tomorrow will bringThe last of the seven tendencies is ignoranceIgnoring the Four Noble TruthsIgnorance is the socalled starting point in the chain of cause and effect which brings us back to birth and death again and againIgnorance opposes wisdom and here it concerns the fact that we disregard reality by not realizing that all our dukkha comes from wanting even if our desire may be a wholesome oneIf we continue to ignore the first two noble truths not to speak of the third truth which is Nibbana we are enmeshed in dukkhaOur underlying tendency of ignorance eventuates in the wrong view of self  the conceiving of a self  showing us the interconnection of all the underlying tendenciesWithout ignorance there wouldnt be any sensuality and irritation nor any hesitation or doubt no wrong view nor pride and conceit or clinging to existenceIts very useful to pick the characteristic that creates difficulties for us over and over again and make it ones focus of attentionSince they are all interconnected minimizing one will help to reduce the others to more manageable proportionsTo see these underlying tendencies in oneself takes a great deal of proper attention towards oneself which needs time and solitudeOne cant do it while talking with othersIf the mind is clear one can do it during meditation sessions or through contemplationContemplation is a valid adjunct to meditation an important helpmate and is always directed towards insight while meditation may at times be geared towards serenityContemplation means looking inward and trying to see what arises What makes me tick With utter truthfulness remembering the underlying tendencies knowing that everybody has them one can ask How are they manifesting in me Once that has been seen there is further validity in contemplating What can I do about getting rid of this particular tendency or at least minimizing it One should allot some time during each day for contemplationIf one has spent a whole day without introspection one cant hope to go inward at meditation timeMeditation and contemplation complement and need each otherSorrowless stainless and secure are three attributes of an Enlightened OneSorrowless no dukkha Stainless no defilements and Secure no fearObviously these three are extremely desirable as they make for happinessWhen we think that they are characteristics of an arahant we might wonder This is so far removed from me how can I even aspire to that The conviction might arise that its too immense to consider for ones own achievementWe all know what it means to have sorrowWe are familiar with our defilements when we get upset worried anxious envious or jealousWe have all experienced fearIt can be fear of death of oneself or of loved ones or fear of not being liked praised accepted or fear of not reaching ones goals or of making a fool of oneselfWe can also experience the opposites of those three statesThe seeds are within us otherwise Enlightenment would be a mythIt is possible to have moments of being sorrowless stainless and secureIf one has a really concentrated meditation momentarily dukkha doesnt ariseOnly onepointednessNo defilements can enter because the mind is otherwise occupiedIt can either have defilements or be concentrated which is wonderful though may last only one single momentThere can be no fear because all is well at such a timeThe more often one regenerates these moments of being sorrowless stainless and secure the more they become part of oneself and we can revert to them againEven just remembering that it is possible and trying to bring up a little of these feelings enters into a person as part of his or her makeupJust as a person with fear of not being accepted or worried about achievements experiencing a lack of selfconfidence will always act accordinglyHe or she doesnt even have to make an effort but remembers his or her fears and reenacts themThe same goes for the liberated mindstatesEvery moment of concentration during meditation is a moment of no defilements no sorrow and no fearThat sort of experience must be duplicated over and over againThereby we reinforce our liberated mindstates and as we remember them we can retain them and act in accordance with them even under ordinary or trying circumstancesDefilements need not arise constantly there are pauses when there is no illwill only lovingkindness no sensual desire only generosity and renunciationSensual desire means wanting renunciation means giving upWhen one gives one isnt desiring unless one is wishing for applause or gratitudeIf one gives for givings sake then there is a moment of no defilementThe same holds true for lovingkindness compassion and helpfulness which are all opposed to greedWhen we have no doubt being absolutely sure of what were doing  and these moments do arise  that too is an instant of being stainlessNo worries no restlessness also add to our freedomNot wanting to go anywhere or do anything not worrying about what was done or left undone in the past which is absurd anyway when one realizes that nobody cares a year or even a month from now least of all oneselfWe all know moments without all this dukkhaWhen those moments arise we are stainless without any blemishes sorrowless and fearlessWe feel at ease and secure at such a time which is difficult to find in the worldThere are so many dangers threatening our desire for survival and they are constantly with usBut when heart and mind are fully occupied with purified states fear does not have a chance to ariseOn our way to the deathless we need to regenerate these liberated moments and bring them up over and over againWe can relish these mind states enjoying the knowledge that they are possibleIt is a natural tendency to resurrect our moments of freedom again and again so that we stay on the path to liberationConcentration in meditation brings a quiet and joy with it which prove with absolute certainty that they have nothing to do with outer conditionsThey are strictly factors of the mind which are our doorway to freedomWe cannot cultivate them successfully if we neglect them during those hours when were not meditatingWe need to guard and protect the mind from evil thoughts at all timesWhen we do experience liberated mindmoments we must not think they have come to us from outsideJust as we cannot blame the external trigger for what goes wrong in the mind so we cannot praise it for the oppositeOutside occurrences are quite unreliable and beyond our controlTo depend on anything so unreliable is foolishnessOur practice is to generate the undefiled states in our mind which opens the way to successful meditation and is the pathway to liberationWhen the mind is without defilements clear and at ease without the convolutions of discursive thinking simply aware happiness and peace ariseThese moments though shortlived are like a light at the end of a tunnel which appears dark and suffocatingIt seems never ending because for the lack of light one cannot see its lengthIf we cultivate and make much of these single moments then there is an illumination and we can see that the tunnel does have an endBecause of that joy is generated in ones heart which is an important adjunct to practiceThe Buddha taught a balanced path namely to see reality for what it is to know that dukkha is inescapable but to have the counterbalance of joy from knowing that there is a way outIf we are too imbued with sorrow and are feeling weighed down under that believing only that to be the path then our actions and reactions will have to be based on our sufferingBeing oppressed with dukkha doesnt make for successful meditation nor for harmonious livingIf we try to negate dukkha and suppress it then we are not facing realityBut if we see dukkha as an universal characteristic knowing we can do something about its abandonment then we are keeping in balanceWe need equipoise in order to practice successfullyTo have an ambition seems to be a natural phenomenon in the human makeupSome people want to be rich powerful or famousSome want to be very knowledgeable to get degreesSome just want to find a little niche for themselves where they can look out of the window and see the same scenery every daySome want to find a perfect partner or as near perfect as possibleEven when we are not living in the world but in a nunnery we have ambitions to become excellent meditators to be perfectly peaceful that this lifestyle should yield resultsTheres always something to hope forWhy is thatBecause its in the future never in the presentInstead of being attentive to what is now we are hoping for something better to come maybe tomorrowThen when tomorrow arrives it has to be the next day again because it still wasnt perfect enoughIf we were to change this pattern in our thinking habits and rather become attentive to what is then we would find something to satisfy usBut when we are looking at that which doesnt exist yet more perfect more wonderful more satisfying then we cant find anything at all because we are looking for that which isnt thereThe Buddha spoke about two kinds of people the ordinary worldling and the noble personObviously it is a worthwhile ambition to become a noble person but if we keep looking for it at some future time then it will escape usThe difference between a noble one and a worldling is the experience of path and fruitThe first moment of this supermundane consciousness is termed streamentry and the person who experiences it is a streamwinnerIf we put that into our mind as a goal in the future it will not come about because we are not using all our energy and strength to recognize each momentOnly in the recognition of each moment can a path moment occurThe distinguishing factor between a worldling and a noble one is the elimination of the first three fetters binding us to continuous existenceThese three obstructing the worldling are wrong view of self sceptical doubt and belief in rites and ritualsAnyone who is not a streamwinner is chained to these three wrong beliefs and reactions that lead away from freedom into bondageLets take a look at sceptical doubt firstIts that niggling thought in the back of the mind There must be an easier way or Im sure I can find happiness somewhere in this wide world As long as theres doubt that the path of liberation leads out of the world and the belief is there that satisfaction can be found within the world there is no chance of noble attainment because one is looking in the wrong directionWithin this world with its people and things animals and possessions scenery and sense contacts there is nothing to be found other than that which we already knowIf there were more why isnt it easily discernible why havent we found itIt should be quite plain to seeWhat are we looking for thenObviously we are looking for happiness and peace just like everyone else is doingSceptical doubt that alarmist says Im sure if I just handled it a little cleverer than I did last time Ill be happyThere are a few things I havent tried yet Maybe we havent flown our own plane yet or lived in a cave in the Himalayas or sailed around the world or written that bestselling novelAll of these are splendid things to do in the world except they are a waste of time and energySceptical doubt makes itself felt when one isnt quite sure what ones next move should beWhere am I going what am I to do One hasnt found a direction yetSceptical doubt is the fetter in the mind when the clarity which comes from a path moment is absentThe consciousness arising at that time removes all doubt because one has experienced the proof oneselfWhen we bite into the mango we know its tasteThe wrong view of self is the most damaging fetter that besets the ordinary personIt contains the deeply imbedded this is me notionMaybe its not even my body but there is someone who is meditatingThis someone wants to get enlightened wants to become a streamwinner wants to be happyThis wrong view of self is the cause of all problems that could possibly ariseAs long as theres somebody there that person can have problemsWhen theres nobody there who could have difficultiesWrong view of self is the root which generates all subsequent pain grief and lamentationWith it also come the fears and worries Am I going to be alright happy peaceful find what I am looking for get what I want be healthy wealthy and wise These worries and fears are well substantiated from ones own pastOne hasnt always been healthy wealthy and wise nor gotten what one wanted nor felt wonderfulSo theres very good reason to be worried and fearful as long as wrong view of self prevailsRites and rituals in themselves are not harmful only believing them to be part of the path to Nibbana is detrimentalThey need not even be religious although we usually think of them like thatSuch as offering flowers and incense on a shrine prostrating or celebrating certain festivals and believing that this will accumulate enough merit to go to the Deva realmsIts devotion respect and gratitude to the Triple Gem which countBut this belief is not only confined to religious activitiesEverybody lives with rites and rituals even though we may not be aware of themIn human relationships there are certain prescribed ways of acting in respect to ones parents ones children ones partnersHow one relates in ones job to friends and strangers how one wants to be confirmed by others all is connected to preconceived ideas of what is right and proper in a certain culture and traditionNone of it has any basic truth in it all is mindmadeThe more ideas one has the less one can see realityThe more one believes in them the harder it is to abandon themAs one imagines oneself to be a certain kind of person one relates in that way in all situationsIt doesnt have to be how we put flowers on a shrine it can also be how we greet people if we do it according to a certain stereotyped ritual and not the way an open heart and mind may dictateThese three obstructions fall away when a path and fruit moment has been experiencedTheres a marked change in such a person which is  of course  not externally visibleIt would be nice to wear a halo and look blissfulBut the inner change is firstly that the experience leaves absolutely no doubt what has to be done in this lifeThe event is totally different from anything previously known so much so that it makes ones former life up to that point immaterialNothing can be found in the past which has fundamental importanceThe only significance lies in going ahead with the practice so that this minimal experience of the first path moment can be fortified resurrected and firmly established in oneselfThe path and fruit moments recur for the oncereturner the nonreturner and the Enlightened OneEach time they are not only deepened but can be lengthenedOne could compare this to having examinations at the universityIf one is going through four years of university study to get a certain degree one has to pass examinations at the end of each yearOne has to answer questions each time based on ones previously absorbed knowledgeBut the questions become deeper more profound and more difficult with each subsequent examinationWhile they are always concerned with the same subject they require more depth and profundity of understanding each timeUntil one finally graduates and doesnt have to return to universityIts the same with our spiritual developmentEach path moment is based on the previous one and is concerned with the same subject yet it goes deeper and furtherUntil one passes ones final test and need not return againThe path moment doesnt have any thinking or feeling in itIt is not comparable to the meditative absorptionsAlthough it is based upon them because only the concentrated mind can enter into a path moment it does not have the same qualitiesthe meditative absorptions have  in their initial stages  the ingredients of rapture happiness and peacefulnessLater on the mind experiences expansion nothingness and a change of perceptionThe path moment does not contain any of these states of mindIt has a quality of nonbeingThis is such a relief and changes ones world view so totally that it is quite understandable that the Buddha made such a distinction between a worldling and a Noble OneWhile the meditative absorptions bring with them a feeling of oneness of unity the path moment does not even contain thatThe moment of fruition subsequent to the path moment is the understood experience and results in a turnedaround vision of existenceThe new understanding recognizes every thought every feeling as stressThe most elevated thought the most sublime feeling still has this qualityOnly when there is nothing is there no stressThere is nothing internal or external that contains the quality of total satisfactorinessBecause of such an inner vision the passion for wanting anything is discardedAll has been seen for what it really is and nothing can give the happiness that arises through the practice of the path and its resultsThe Nibbanic element cannot be truly described as bliss because bliss has a connotation of exhilarationWe use the word bliss for the meditative absorption where it includes a sense of excitementThe Nibbanic element does not recognize bliss because all that arises is seen as stressThe bliss of Nibbana may give one the impression that one may find perfect happiness but the opposite is trueOne finds that there is nothing and therefore no more unhappiness only peaceTo look for path and fruit will not bring them about because only moment to moment awareness can do soThis awareness will eventually culminate in real concentration where one can let go of thinking and be totally absorbedWe can drop the meditation subject at that timeWe need not push it aside it falls away of its own accord and absorption in awareness occursIf there has to be an ambition in ones life this is the only worthwhile oneAll others will not bring fulfillmentOne doesnt have to force oneself to give up sceptical doubtWhat is there to doubt when one has experienced the truthIf one hits oneself with a hammer one feels pain and cannot doubt itOne knows from ones own experienceRites and rituals are brought to an interesting end because the person who has experienced a path moment will under no circumstance indulge in any roleplayingAll roles are the ingredients of unrealityOne may continue religious rites because they contain aspects of respect gratitude and devotionBut there will not be any rituals in how to relate to people or to situations or how to invent stories about oneself because the response is with a spontaneous open heartLetting go of the wrong view of self is  of course  the most profound change causing all other changesFor the streamwinner the wrong view of self can never intellectually arise again but feelingwise it can because the path moment has been so fleetingIt hasnt made the complete impact yetIf it had done so it would have resulted in EnlightenmentThis is possible and is mentioned in the Buddhas discourses as having happened during his lifetimeAll four stages of holiness were realized while listening to the DhammaThe initial fruit moment needs to be relived one has to resurrect it over and over again until the second path moment can ariseIts like repeating what one knows and not forgetting so that one can build upon itIt is very useful to remind oneself in all waking moments that body feeling perception mental formations and consciousness are all impermanent and have no core substance changing from moment to momentWhether one has had a direct vision of nonself or just an understanding of it either way one has to bring it back into ones mind and relive it as often as possibleAs we continue to do this ordinary problems arise less and lessIf we remain aware of the impermanence of all that exists our difficulties seem far less important and the view of self subtly changesThe view we have of ourselves is our worst enemyEveryone has made up a persona a mask that one wears and we dont want to see whats behind itWe dont allow anyone else to look eitherAfter having had a path moment that is no longer possibleBut the mask fear and rejection come to the foreThe best antidote is to remember again and again that theres really nobody there only phenomena nothing moreEven though the inner vision may not be concrete enough to substantiate such a claim the affirmation helps to loosen the grasping and clinging and to hang on a little less tightlyThe direction of the practice is certainly towards streamentryHowever there is nothing to get theres everything to give upUnless that is done the moment cannot happen and we will continue to live in the same way we always haveBeset by dukkha obstructed by dukkha subject to praise and blame loss and gain fame and illfame happiness and unhappinessThe usual problems  all caused by self  will arise again and againThe real change comes when there is a decisive alteration in the way we view ourselves otherwise the difficulties remain the same because the same identical person is generating themBeing mindfully aware in and out of meditation is the practice which will bring resultsIt means doing one thing at a time attentive to mind and bodyWhen listening to Dhamma only listenWhen sitting in meditation only attending to the meditation subjectWhen planting a tree only plantingNo frills no judgmentsThat habituates the mind to be in each momentOnly in such a way can a path moment occurIts not in the distant future its possible here and nowTheres no reason why an intelligent healthy committed person should not be able to attain it with patience and perseveranceWe have heard about disenchantment and dispassion as steps on the path to liberation and freedomThey cannot have meaning and impact unless there is a vision of a totally different reality one which does not contain the worlds manifoldnessWhen one sits in meditation and starts thinking thats the temptation of diversification and expansionThe Nibbana element is one not manifoldOne could say that its empty of all that we knowUntil that is seen the world will keep calling but we need not believe it allIt is a difficult taskSo one has to remind oneself often otherwise one gets caught by temptationOne should not be surprised when one doesnt find happiness manifoldness diversification cannot create happiness only distractionCertainly one can experience pleasure from the sensesIf one has good karma there will be many occasionsGood food beautiful scenery pleasant people good music interesting books a comfortable home not too much physical discomfortBut do these bring fulfillmentSince it didnt happen in the past why should it occur in the futurePath and fruit bring fulfillment because they are empty of phenomenaEmptiness does not change nor does it become unpleasant and it cannot lack peace since there is nothing to disturb itWhen people hear or read about Nibbana they are apt to say How can I want nothing When one has seen that everything one can possibly want is meant to fill an inner void and dissatisfaction then the time has come to want nothingThis goes beyond not wanting because one now accepts the reality that there is nothing worthwhile to be hadNot wanting anything will make it possible to experience that there is actually nothing  only peace and quietDiscussing the practice is more useful than discussing anything else because it gives rise to insightIf we follow the practice step by step we can read ourselves continually deciphering things within usAs you read yourself through probing and investigating the harm and suffering caused by defilement craving and attachment there will be times when you come to true knowledge enabling you to grow dispassionate and let goThe mind will then immediately grow still with none of the mental concoctions that used to have the run of the place through your lack of selfinvestigationThe principles of selfinvestigation are our most important toolsWe have to make a concerted effort to master them at all times with special emphasis on using mindfulness to focus on the mind and bring it to centered concentrationIf we dont focus on keeping the mind centered or neutral as its basic stance it will wander off in various ways in pursuit of preoccupations or sensory contacts giving rise to turmoil and restlessnessBut when we practice restraint over the sensory doors by maintaining continuous mindfulness in the heart its like driving in the pilings for a damIf youve ever seen the pilings for a dam youll know that theyre driven deep deep into the ground so that theyre absolutely firm and immovableBut if you drive them into mud theyre easily swayed by the slightest contactThis should give us an idea of how firm our mindfulness should be in supervising the mind to make it stable able to withstand sensory contact without liking or disliking its objectsThe firmness of your mindfulness is something you have to maintain continuously in your every activity with every inandout breathThe mind will stop being scattered in search for preoccupationsIf you dont manage this then the mind will get stirred up whenever theres sensory contact like a rudderless ship going wherever the wind and waves will take itThis is why you need mindfulness to guard the mind at every momentIf you can make mindfulness constant in every activity the mind will be continuously neutral ready to probe and investigate for insightAs a first step in driving in the pilings for our dam  in other words in making mindfulness firm  we have to focus on neutrality as our basic stanceTheres nothing you have to think aboutSimply make the mind solid in its neutralityIf you can do this continuously thats when youll have a true standard for your investigation because the mind will have gathered into concentrationBut this concentration is something you have to watch over carefully to make sure its not just oblivious indifferenceMake the mind firmly established and centered so that it doesnt get absentminded or distracted as you sit in meditationSit straight maintain steady mindfulness and theres nothing else you have to doKeep the mind firm and neutral not thinking of anything at allMake sure this stability stays continuousWhen anything pops up no matter how keep the mind neutralFor example if theres a feeling of pleasure or pain dont focus on the feelingSimply focus on the stability of the mind  and there will be a sense of neutrality in that stabilityIf youre careful not to let the mind get absentminded or distracted its concentration will become continuousFor example if youre going to sit for an hour of meditation focus on centering the mind like this for the first half hour and then make sure it doesnt wander off anywhere until the hour is upIf you change positions its simply an outer change in the body while the mind is still firmly centered and neutral each moment youre standing sitting lying down or whateverMindfulness is the key factor in all of this keeping the mind from concocting thoughts or labeling thingsEverything has to stopKeep this foundation snug and stable with every inandout breathThen you can relax your focus on the breath while keeping the mind in the same state of neutralityRelax your heavy focus so that it feels just right with the breathThe mind will be able to stay in this state for the entire hour free from any thoughts that might wander off the pathThen keep an eye out to see that no matter what you do or say the mind stays solidly in its normal state of inward knowingIf the mind is stable within itself youre protected on all sidesWhen sensory contacts come you stay focused on being aware of your mental stabilityEven if there are any momentary slips in your mindfulness you get right back to the stability of the mindOther than that theres nothing you have to doThe mind will let go without your having to do anything elseThe way you used to like this hate that turn left here turn right there wont be able to happenThe mind will stay neutral equanimous just rightIf mindfulness lapses you get right back to your focus recognizing when the mind is centered and neutral toward its objects and then keeping it that wayThe pilings for the dam of mindfulness have to be driven in so that theyre solid and secure with your every activityKeep working at this no matter what youre doingIf you can train the mind so that stability is its basic stance it wont get into mischiefIt wont cause you any troubleIt wont concoct thoughtsIt will be quietOnce its quiet and centered itll grow more refined and probe in to penetrate within itself to know its own state of concentration from withinAs for sensory contacts those are things outside  appearing only to disappear  so its not interestedThis can make cravings disbandEven when we change positions as pains arise in the body the mind in that moment is stable focused not on the pains but on its own stabilityWhen you change positions there will be physical and mental reactions as the circulation improves and pleasant feelings arise in place of the pains but the mind wont get snagged on either the pleasure or the painIt will simply stay stable centered and firm in its neutralityThis stability can easily help you abandon the cravings that lie latent in connection with all feelingsBut if you dont keep the mind centered in advance like this craving will create issues provoking the mind into a turmoil wanting to change things so as to get this or that kind of happinessIf we practice in this way repeatedly hammering at this point over and over again its like driving pilings into the groundThe deeper we can drive them the more immovable theyll beThats when youll be able to withstand sensory contactsOtherwise the mind will start boiling over with its thought concoctions in pursuit of sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensationsSometimes it keeps concocting the same old senseless issues over and over againThis is because the pilings of mindfulness arent yet firmly in placeThe way weve been stumbling through life is due to the fact that we havent really practiced to the point where mindfulness is continuous enough to make the mind firmly centered and neutralSo we have to make our dam of mindfulness solid and secureThis centeredness of mind is something we should develop with every activity with every inandout breathThis way well be able to see through our illusions all the way into the truths of inconstancy and notselfOtherwise the mind will go straying off here and there like a mischievous monkey  yet even monkeys can be caught and trained to perform tricksIn the same way the mind is something that can be trained but if you dont tie it to the post of mindfulness and give it a taste of the stick itll be very hard to tameWhen training the mind you shouldnt force it too much nor can you simply let it go its habitual waysYou have to test yourself to see what gets resultsIf you dont get your mindfulness focused itll quickly go running out after preoccupations or easily waver under the impact of its objectsWhen people let their minds simply drift along with the flow of things its because they havent established mindfulness as a solid stanceWhen this is the case they cant stopThey cant grow stillThey cant be freeThis is why we have to start out by driving in the pilings for our dam so that theyre good and solid keeping the mind stable and centered whether were sitting standing walking or lying downThis stability will then be able to withstand everythingYour mindfulness will stay with its foundation just like a monkey tied to a post It cant run off or get into mischiefIt can only circle the post to which its leash is tiedKeep training the mind until its tame enough to settle down and investigate things for if its still scattered about its of no use at allYou have to train it until its familiar with what inner stability is like for your own instability and lack of commitment in training it is what allows it to get all entangled with thoughtconcoctions with things that arise and then pass awayYou have to get it to stopWhy is it so mischievousWhy is it so scatteredWhy does it keep wandering offGet in under controlGet it to stop to settle down and grow centeredAt this stage you all have practiced enough to gain at least a taste of centered concentrationThe next step is to use mindfulness to maintain it in your every activity so that even if there are any distractions they last only for a moment and dont turn into long issuesKeep driving in the pilings until theyre solid every time theres an impact from external objects or so that the mental concoctions that go straying out from within are all brought to stillness in every wayThis training isnt really all that hardThe important point is that whichever of the many meditation subjects you choose you stay mindful and aware of the mind state thats centered and neutralIf when the mind goes straying out after objects you keep bringing it back to its centeredness over and over again the mind will eventually be able to stay firmly in its stanceIn other words its mindfulness will become constant ready to probe and investigate because when the mind really settles down it gains the power to read the facts within itself clearlyIf its not centered it can jumble everything up to fool you switching from this issue to that from this role to that but if its centered it can disband everything  all defilements cravings and attachments  on every sideSo what this practice comes down to is how much effort and persistence you put into getting the mind firmly centeredOnce its firm then when there arise all the sufferings and defilements that would otherwise get it soiled and worked up it can withstand them just as the pilings of a dam can withstand windstorms without budgingYou have to be clearly aware of this state of mind so that you wont go out liking this or hating thatThis state will then become your point of departure for probing and investigating so as to gain the insight that sees clearly all the way through  but you have to make sure that this centeredness is continuousThen you wont have to think about anythingSimply look right in deeply and subtlyThe important point is that you get rid of absentmindedness and distractionsThis in itself gets rid of a lot of delusion and ignorance and leaves no opening for craving to create any issues that will stir up the mind and set it wanderingThis is because weve established our stance in advanceEven if we lose our normal balance a little bit we get right back to focusing on the stability of our concentrationIf we keep at this over and over again the stability of the mind with its continuous mindfulness will enable us to probe into the truths of inconstancy stress and notselfIn the beginning though you dont have to do any probingIts better simply to focus on the stability of your stance for if you start probing when the mind isnt really centered and stable youll end up scatteredSo focus on making centeredness the basic level of the mind and then start probing in deeper and deeperThis will lead to insights that grow more and more telling and profound bringing the mind to a state of freedom within itself or to a state where it is no longer hassled by defilementThis in itself will bring about true mastery over the sense doorsAt first when we started out we werent able to exercise any real restraint over the eyes and ears but once the mind becomes firmly centered then the eyes ears nose tongue and body are automatically brought under controlIf theres no mindfulness and concentration you cant keep your eyes under control because the mind will want to use them to look and to see it will want to use the ears to listen to all kinds of thingsSo instead of exercising restraint outside at the senses we exercise it inside right at the mind making the mind firmly centered and neutral at all timesRegardless of whether youre talking or whatever the minds focus stays in placeOnce you can do this youll regard the objects of the senses as meaninglessYou wont have to take issue with things thinking This is good I like itThis is bad I dont like itThis is pretty thats ugly The same holds true with the sounds you hearYou wont take issue with themYou focus instead on the neutral uninvolved centeredness of the mindThis is the basic foundation for neutralityWhen you can do this everything becomes neutralWhen the eye sees a form its neutralWhen the ear hears a sound its neutral  the mind is neutral the sound is neutral everything is all neutral  because weve closed five of the six sense doors and then settled ourselves in neutrality right at the mindThis takes care of everythingWhatever the eye may see the ear may hear the nose may smell the tongue may taste or the body may touch the mind doesnt take issue with anything at allIt stays centered neutral and impartialTake just this much and give it a tryFor the next seven days I want you to make a special point of focusing mindfulness right at the mind for this is the end of the rainy season the period when the lotus and water lily bloom after the end of the Rains RetreatIn the Buddhas time he would have the senior monks train the new monks throughout the Rains Retreat and then meet with him when the lotuses bloomIve mentioned this before and I want to mention it again as a way of encouraging you to develop a stable foundation for the mindIf its stability is continuous then it too will have to bloom  to bloom because its not burned disturbed or provoked by the defilementsSo make a special effort during the next seven days to see how you can manage to observe and investigate the centered neutral state of mind continuously at all timesOf course if you fall asleep you fall asleep but even then when you lie down to sleep try to observe how you can keep the mind centered and neutral at all times until you doze offWhen you wake up the movements of the mind will still remain in that centered neutral stateGive it a try so that your mind will be able to grow calm and peaceful disbanding its defilements cravings sufferings  everythingThen notice to see whether or not its beginning to bloomThe sense of refreshment bathing the mind that comes as part of the peace of mind undisturbed by defilement will arise of its own accord without your having to do anything aside from keeping the mind stable and centeredThis is your guarantee If the mind is really stable in its concentration the defilements wont be able to burn it or mess with itIn other words desire wont be able to provoke itWhen concentration is stable the fires of passion aversion and delusion wont be able to burn itTry to see within yourself how the stability of the mind can withstand these things disbanding the stress putting out the flamesBut youll have to be earnest in practicing in making an effort to keep mindfulness truly continuousThis isnt something to play atYou cant let yourself be weak for if youre weak you wont be able to withstand anythingYoull simply follow the provocations of defilement and cravingThe practice is a matter of stopping so that the mind can settle down and stand fastIts not a matter of getting into mischief wandering around to look and listen and get involved in issuesTry to keep the mind stable in all your activities  eating defecating whatever  keep the mind centered withinIf you know the state of the mind when its centered immovable no longer wavering no longer weak then the basic level of the mind will be free and empty  empty of the things that would burn it empty because theres no attachmentThis is what enables you to ferret out the stability of the mind at every momentIt protects you from all sorts of thingsAll attachment to self me and them is totally wiped out cut awayThe mind is entirely centeredIf you can keep this state stable for the entire seven days it will enable you to reach insight all on your ownSo I ask each of you to see whether or not youll be able to make it all the wayCheck to see how youre doing each dayAnd make sure you check things carefullyDont let yourself be lax sometimes stable sometimes notGet so that the mind is absolutely solidDont let yourself be weakYou have to be genuine in what you do if you want to reach the genuine extinguishing of suffering and stressIf youre not genuine youll end up letting yourself weaken in the face of the provocation of wanting this or wanting that doing this or doing that whatever in the same way that youve been enslaved to desire agitated by desire for who knows how longYour everyday life is where you can test yourself  so get back to the battlefieldTake a firm stance in neutralityThen the objects that come into contact with the mind will be neutral the mind itself will feel centered in neutralityThere will be nothing to take issue with in terms of good or bad or whateverEverything will come to a halt in neutrality  because things in themselves arent good or bad or self or whatever simply that the mind has gone and made issues out of themSo keep looking inward until you see the minds neutrality and freedom from self continuously and then youll see how the lotus comes to bloomIf it hasnt bloomed yet thats because its withering and dry in the heat of the defilements cravings and attachments smoldering in the mind  things well have to learn to ferret out until we can disband themIf we dont the lotus will wither away its petals falling to the ground and simply rotting thereSo make an effort to keep the lotus of the mind stable until it bloomsDont wonder about what will happen as it bloomsJust keep it stable and make sure it isnt burned by the defilementsToday we are meeting as usualFrom what Ive seen of your reports on your special development of mindfulness to read the facts within yourselves some of you have really benefited in terms of penetrating in to read whats going on inside and youve come out with correct understandingSo now Id like to give you a further piece of advice In developing mindfulness as a foundation for probing in to know the truth within yourself you have to apply a level of effort and persistence appropriate to the taskThis is because as we all know the mind is cloaked in defilements and mental effluentsIf we dont train it and force it itll turn weak and laxIt wont have any strengthYou have to make your persistence more and more constant so that your probing and investigating will be able to see all the way through to clear insightClear insight doesnt come from thinking and speculatingIt comes from investigating the mind while its gathered into an adequate level of calm and stabilityYou look deeply into every aspect of the mind when its neutral and calm free from thoughtformations or likes and dislikes for its preoccupationsYou have to work at maintaining this state and at the same time probe deeply into it because superficial knowledge isnt true knowledgeAs long as you havent probed deeply into the mind you dont really know anythingThe mind is simply calm on an external level and your reading of the aspects of the wanderings of the mind under the influence of defilement craving and attachment isnt yet clearSo you have to try to peer into yourself until you reach a level of awareness that can maintain its balance and let you contemplate your way to sharper understandingIf you dont contemplate so as to give rise to true knowledge your mindfulness will stay just on the surfaceThe same principle holds with contemplating the bodyYou have to probe deeply into the ways in which the body is repulsive and composed of physical elementsThis is what it means to read the body so as to understand it so that you can explore yourself in all your activitiesThis way you prevent your mind from straying off the path and keep it focused on seeing how it can burn away the defilements as they arise  which is very delicate workBeing uncomplacent not letting yourself get distracted by outside things is what will make the practice go smoothlyIt will enable you to examine the germs in the mind in a skillful way so that you can eliminate the subtlest ones ignorance and delusionNormally we arent fully aware of even the blatant germs but now that the blatant ones are inactivated because of the minds solid focus we can look into the more profound areas to catch sight of the deceits of craving and defilements in whatever way they move into actionWe watch them know them and are in a position to abandon them as soon as they wander off in search of sights sounds smells and delicious flavorsWhether theyre looking for good physical flavors  bodily pleasure  or good mental flavors we have to know them from all sides even though theyre not easy to know because of all the many desires we feel for physical pleasureAnd on top of that there are the desires for happiness imbued with pleasurable feelings perceptions that carry pleasurable feelings thoughtformations that carry pleasurable feelings and consciousness that carries pleasurable feelingsAll of these are nothing but desires for illusions for things that deceive us into getting engrossed and distractedAs a result it isnt easy for us to understand much of anything at allThese are subtle matters and they all come under the term sensual craving  the desire lust and love that provoke the mind into wandering out in search of the enjoyment it remembers from past sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensationsEven though these things may have happened long ago our perceptions bring them back to deceive us with ideas of their being good or badOnce we latch onto them they make the mind unsettled and defiledSo it isnt easy to examine and understand all the various germs within the mindThe external things were able to know and let go of are only the minor playersThe important ones have gathered together to take charge in the mind and wont budge no matter how you try to chase them outTheyre stubborn and determined to stay in chargeIf you take them on when your mindfulness and discernment arent equal to the fight youll end up losing your inner calmSo you have to make sure that you dont push the practice too much without at the same time letting it grow too slackFind the Middle Way thats just rightWhile youre practicing in this way youll be able to observe what the mind is like when it has mindfulness and discernment in charge and then you make the effort to maintain that state and keep it constantThats when the mind will have the opportunity to stop and be still stable and centered for long periods of time until its used to being that wayNow there are some areas where we have to force the mind and be strict with itIf were weak and lax theres no way we can succeed for weve given in to our own wants for so long alreadyIf we keep giving in to them it will become even more of a habitSo you have to use force  the force of your will and the force of your mindfulness and discernmentEven if you get to the point where you have to put your life on the line youve got to be willingWhen the time comes for you really to be serious youve got to hold out until you come out winningIf you dont win you dont give upSometimes you have to make a vow as a way of forcing yourself to overcome your stubborn desires for physical pleasure that tempt you and lead you astrayIf youre weak and settle for whatever pleasure comes in the immediate present then when desire comes in the immediate present you fall right for itIf you give in to your wants often in this way itll become habitual for defilement is always looking for the chance to tempt you to incite youAs when we try to give up an addiction to betel cigarettes or meat Its hard to do because craving is always tempting usTake just a little it saysJust a tasteIt doesnt matter Craving knows how to fool us the way a fish is fooled into getting caught on a hook by the bait surrounding the hook screwing up its courage enough to take just a little and then a little more and then a little more until its sure to get snaggedThe demons of defilement have us surrounded on all sidesOnce we fall for their delicious flavors were sure to get snagged on the hookNo matter how much we struggle and squirm we cant get freeYou have to realize that gaining victory over your enemies  the cravings and defilements in the heart  is no small matter no casual affairYou cant let yourself be weak or lax but you also have to gauge your strength for you have to figure out how to apply your efforts at abandoning and destroying to weaken the defilements and cravings that have had the power of demons overwhelming the mind for so longIts not the case that you have to battle to the brink of death in every areaWith some things  such as giving up addictions  you can mount a fullscale campaign and come out winning without killing yourself in the processBut with other things more subtle and deep you have to be more perceptive so as to figure out how to overcome them over the long haul digging up their roots so that they gradually weaken to the point where your mindfulness and discernment can rise above themIf there are any areas where youre still losing out you have to take stock of your sensitivities to figure out whyOtherwise youll keep losing out for when the defilements really want something they trample all over your mindfulness and discernment in their determination to get what theyre after Thats what I wantI dont care what anyone says They really are that stubbornSo its no small matter figuring out how to bring them under controlIts like running into an enemy or a wild beast rushing in to devour youWhat are you going to doWhen the defilements arise right before your eyes you have to be warySuppose youre perfectly aware and all of a sudden they spring up and confront you What kind of mindfulness and discernment are you going to use to disband them to realize that These are the hordes of Mara come to burn and eat meHow am I going to get rid of them In other words how are you going to find a skillful way of contemplating them so as to destroy them right then and thereWe have to do this regardless of whether were being confronted with physical and mental pain or physical and mental pleasureActually pleasure is more treacherous than pain because its hard to fathom and easy to fall forAs for pain no one falls for it because its so uncomfortableSo how are we going to contemplate so as to let go of both the pleasure and the painThis is the problem were faced with at every momentIts not the case that when we practice we accept only the pleasure and stop when we run into painThats not the case at allWe have to learn how to read both sides to see that the pain is inconstant and stressful and that the pleasure is inconstant and stressful tooWe have to penetrate clear through these thingsOtherwise well be deluded by the deceits of the cravings that want pleasure whether its physical pleasure or whateverOur every activity  sitting standing walking lying down  is really for the sake of pleasure isnt itThis is why there are so many many ways in which were deluded with pleasureWhatever we do we do for the sake of pleasure without realizing how deeply weve mired ourselves in suffering and stressWhen we contemplate inconstancy stress and notselfness we dont get anywhere in our contemplation because we havent seen through pleasureWe still think that its a good thingWe have to probe into the fact that theres no real ease to physical or mental pleasureIts all stressWhen you can see it from this angle thats when youll come to understand inconstancyThen once the mind isnt focused on wanting pleasure all the time its stresses and pains will lightenIt will be able to see them as something common and normal to see that if you try to change the pains to find ease theres no ease to be foundIn this way you wont be overly concerned with trying to change the pains for youll see that theres no pleasure or ease to the aggregates that they give nothing but stress and painAs in the Buddhas teachings we chant every day Form is stressful feeling perception thoughtformations and consciousness are all stressful The problem is that we havent investigated into the truth of our own form feelings perceptions thoughtformations and consciousnessOur insight isnt yet penetrating because we havent looked from the angle of true knowingAnd so we get deluded here and lost there in our search for pleasure finding nothing but pain and yet mistaking it for pleasureThis shows that we still havent opened our ears and eyes we still dont know the truthOnce we do know the truth though the mind will be more inclined to grow still and calm than to go wandering offThe reason it goes wandering off is because its looking for pleasure but once it realizes theres no real pleasure to be found in that way it settles down and grows stillAll the cravings that provoke and unsettle the mind come down to nothing but the desire for pleasureSo we have to contemplate so as to see that the aggregates have no pleasure to offer that theyre stressful by their very natureTheyre not us or oursTake them apart and have a good look at them starting with the bodyAnalyze the body down to its elements so that the mind wont keep latching onto it as me or mine You have to do this over and over again until you really understandIts the same as when we chant the passage for Recollection while Using the Requisites  food clothing shelter and medicine  every dayWe do this so as to gain real understandingIf we dont do this every day we forget and get deluded into loving and worrying about the body as my body my self No matter how much we keep latching onto it over and over again its not easy for us to realize what were doing even though we have the Buddhas teachings available explaining these things in every wayOr we may have contemplated to some extent but we havent seen things clearlyWeve seen only in a vague and blurry way and then flitted off oblivious without having probed in to see all the way throughThis is because the mind isnt firmly centeredIt isnt stillIt keeps wandering off to find things to think about and get itself all agitatedThis way it cant really get to know anything at allAll it knows are a few little perceptionsThis is the way it has been for who knows how many years nowIts as if our vision has been clouded by spots that we havent yet removed from our eyesThose who arent interested in exploring who dont make an effort to get to the facts dont wonder about anything at allTheyre free from doubt all right but its because their doubts have been smothered by delusionIf we start exploring and contemplating well have to wonder about the things we dont yet know Whats thisWhat does it meanHow should I deal with it These are questions that lead us to exploreIf we dont explore its because we dont have any intelligenceOr we may gain a few little insights but we let them pass so that we never explore deeply into the basic principles of the practiceWhat little we do know doesnt go anywhere doesnt penetrate into the Noble Truths because our mindfulness and discernment run out of strengthOur persistence isnt resilient enough isnt brave enoughWe dont dare look deeply inside ourselvesTo go by our own estimates of how far is enough in the practice is to lie to ourselvesIt keeps us from gaining release from suffering and stressIf you happen to come up with a few insights dont go bragging about them or else youll end up deceiving yourself in countless waysThose who really know even when they have attained the various stages of insight are heedful to keep on exploringThey dont get stuck on this stage or thatEven when their insights are correct they dont stop right there and start bragging for thats the way of a foolIntelligent people even though they see things clearly always keep an eye out for the enemies lying in wait for them on the deeper more subtle levels aheadThey have to keep penetrating further and further inThey have no sense that this or that level is plenty enough  for how can it be enoughThe defilements are still burning away so how can you bragEven though your knowledge may be true how can you be complacent when your mind has yet to establish a foundation for itselfAs you investigate with mindfulness and discernment complacency is the major problemYou have to be uncomplacent in the practice if you want to keep up with the fact that life is ebbing away ebbing with every momentAnd how should you live so that you can be said to be uncomplacentThis is an extremely important question for if youre not alive to it then no matter how many days or months you practice meditation or restraint of the senses its simply a temporary exerciseWhen youre done you get back to your same old turmoil as beforeAnd watch out for your mouthYoull have trouble not bragging for the defilements will provoke you into speakingThey want to speak they want to brag they wont let you stay silentIf you force yourself in the practice without understanding its true aims you end up deceiving yourself and go around telling people I practiced in silence for so many days so many months This is deceiving yourself and others as wellThe truth of the matter is that youre still a slave to stupidity obeying the many levels of defilement and craving within yourself without realizing the factIf someone praises you you really prick up your ears wag your tail and instead of explaining the harm of the defilements and craving you were able to find within yourself you simply want to bragSo the practice of the Dhamma isnt something that you can just muddle your way throughIts something you have to do with your intelligence fully alert  for when you contemplate in a circumspect way youll see that theres nothing worth getting engrossed in that everything  both inside and out  is nothing but an illusionIts like being adrift alone in the middle of the ocean with no island or shore in sightCan you afford just to sit back and relax to make a temporary effort and then brag about itOf course notAs your investigation penetrates inwardly to ever more subtle levels of the mind youll have to become more and more calm and reserved in the same way that people become more and more circumspect as they grow from children to teenagers and into adultsYour mindfulness and discernment have to keep growing more and more mature in order to understand the right and wrong the true and false in whatever arises Thats what will enable you to let go and gain releaseAnd thats what will make your life in the true practice of the Dhamma go smoothlyOtherwise youll fool yourself into boasting of how many years you practiced meditation and will eventually find yourself worse off than before with defilement flaring up in a big wayIf this is the way you go youll end up tumbling head over heels into fire  for when you raise your head in pride you run into the flames already burning within yourselfTo practice means to use the fire of mindfulness and discernment as a counterfire to put out the blaze of the defilements because the heart and mind are burning with defilement and when we use the fire of mindfulness and discernment to put out the fire of defilement the mind can cool downDo this by being increasingly honest with yourself without leaving an opening for defilement and craving to insinuate their way into controlYou have to be alertCircumspectWise to themDont fall for themIf you fall for whatever rationale they come up with it means that your mindfulness and discernment are still weakThey lead you away by the nose burning you with their fire right before your very eyes and yet youre still able to open your mouth to bragSo turn around and take stock of everything within yourselfTake stock of every aspect because right and wrong true and false are all within youYou cant go finding them outsideThe damaging things people say about you are nothing compared to the damage caused inside you when defilement burns you when your feeling of me and mine raises its headIf you dont honestly come to your senses theres no way your practice of the Dhamma can gain you release from the great mass of suffering and stressYou may be able to gain a little knowledge and let go of a few things but the roots of the problem will still lie buried deep downSo you have to dig them outYou cant relax after little bouts of emptiness and equanimityThat wont accomplish anythingThe defilements and mental effluents lie deep in the personality so you have to use mindfulness and discernment to penetrate deep down to make a precise and thorough examinationOnly then will you get resultsOtherwise if you stay only on the surface level you can practice until your body lies rotting in its coffin but you wont have changed any of your basic habitsThose who are scrupulous by nature who know how to contemplate their own flaws will keep on the alert for any signs of pride within themselvesTheyll try to control and destroy conceit on every side and wont allow it to swellThe methods we need to use in the practice for examining and destroying the germs within the mind arent easy to masterFor those who dont contemplate themselves thoroughly the practice may actually only increase their pride their bragging their desire to go teaching othersBut if we turn within and discern the deceits and conceits of self a profound feeling of disenchantment and dismay arises causing us to pity ourselves for our own stupidity for the amount to which weve deluded ourselves all along and for how much effort well still need to put into the practiceSo however great the pain and anguish however many tears bathe your cheeks persevereThe practice isnt simply a matter of looking for mental and physical pleasureLet tears bathe my cheeks but Ill keep on with my striving at the holy life as long as I live Thats the way it has to beDont quit at the first small difficulty with the thought Its a waste of timeId do better to follow my cravings and defilements You cant think like thatYou have to take the exact opposite stance When they tempt me to grab this take a lot of that  I wontHowever fantastic the object may be I wont take the bait Make a firm declarationThis is the only way to get resultsOtherwise youll never work yourself free for the defilements have all sorts of tricks up their sleevesIf you get wise to one trick they simply change to another and then anotherIf were not observant to see how much weve been deceived by the defilements in all sorts of ways we wont come to know the truth within ourselvesOther people may fool us now and then but the defilements fool us all of the timeWe fall for them and follow them hook line and sinkerOur trust in the Lord Buddha is nothing compared to our trust in themWere disciples of the demons of craving letting them lead us ever deeper into their jungleIf we dont contemplate to see this for ourselves were lost in that jungle charnel ground where the demons keep roasting us to make us squirm with desires and every form of distressEven though you have come to stay in a place with few disturbances these demons still manage to tempt and draw you awayJust notice how the saliva flows when you come across anything deliciousSo you have to decide to be either a warrior or a loserThe practice requires that you do battle with defilements and cravingsAlways be on your guard whatever the approach they take to seduce and deceive youOther people cant come in to lead you away but these demons of your own defilements can because youre willing to trust them to be their slaveYou have to contemplate yourself carefully so that youre no longer enslaved to them and can reach total freedom within yourselfMake an effort to develop your mindfulness and discernment so as to gain clear insight and then let go until suffering and stress disband in every wayTodays our day to discuss the practiceIts very beneficial that we have practiced the Dhamma by contemplating ourselves step by step and have  to some extent  come to know the truthThis is because each person has to find the truth within the truths of stress its cause and the path leading to its disbandingIf we dont know these things we fall into the same sufferings as the rest of the worldWe may have come to live in a Dhamma center yet if we dont know these truths we dont benefit from staying hereThe only way we differ from living at home is that were observing the preceptsIf we dont want to be deluded in our practice these truths are things we have to knowOtherwise we get deluded into looking for our fun in the stresses and sufferings offered by the worldOur practice is to contemplate until we understand stress and its cause in other words the defilements that have power and authority in the heart and mindIts only because we have this practice that we can disband these defilements that we can disband stress every day and at all timesThis is something really marvelousThose who dont practice dont have a clue even though they live enveloped by defilements and stressThey simply get led around by the nose into more and more suffering and yet none of them realize whats going onIf we dont make contact with the Dhamma if we dont practice we go through birth and death simply to create kamma with one another and to keep whirling around in suffering and stressWe have to contemplate until we really see stress Thats when well become uncomplacent and try to disband it or to gain release from itThe practice is thus a matter of struggling to gain victory over stress and suffering with better and better results each timeWhatever mistakes we make in whatever way we have to try not to make them againAnd we have to contemplate the harm and suffering caused by the more subtle defilements cravings and attachments within usThis is why we have to probe into the deeper more profound parts of the heart  for if we stay only on the superficial levels of emptiness in the mind we wont gain any profound knowledge at allSo we train the mind to be mindful and firmly centered and to fix its focus on looking within knowing withinDont let it get distracted outsideWhen it focuses within it will come to know the truth the truth of stress and of the causes of stress  defilement craving and attachment  as they ariseIt will see what theyre like and how to probe inward to disband themWhen all is said and done the practice comes down to one issue because it focuses exclusively on one thing stress together with its causeThis is the central issue in human life  even animals are in the same predicament  but our ignorance deludes us into latching onto all kinds of thingsThis is because of our misunderstandings or wrong viewsIf we gain Right View we see things correctlyWhenever we see stress we see its truthWhen we see the cause of stress we see its truthWe both know and see because weve focused on itIf you dont focus on stress you wont know it but as soon as you focus on it you willIts because the mind hasnt focused here that it wanders out oblivious chasing after its preoccupationsWhen we try to focus it down it struggles and resists because its used to wanderingBut if we keep focusing it again and again more and more frequently until we get a sense of how to bring it under control then the task ultimately becomes easier because the mind no longer struggles to chase after its preoccupations as it did beforeNo matter how much it resists when we start training it eventually were sure to bring it under our control getting it to settle down and be stillIf it doesnt settle down you have to contemplate itYou have to show it that you mean businessThis is because defilement and craving are very strongYou cant be weak when dealing with themYou have to be brave to have a fighttothedeath attitude and to keep sustaining your effortsIf youre concerned only with finding comfort and pleasure the day will never come when youll gain releaseYoull have to continue staying under their powerTheir power envelops everything in our character making it very difficult for us to find out the truth about ourselvesWhat we do know is just a smattering and so we play truant abandoning the task and end up seeing that the practice of the Dhamma isnt really importantThus we dont bother to be strict with ourselves and instead involve ourselves in all kinds of things for thats the path the defilements keep pointing out to usWe grope along weakly making it harder and harder to see stress clearly because we keep giving in to the defilements and taking their baitWhen they complain about the slightest discomfort we quickly pander to them and take the bait againIts because were so addicted to the bait that we dont appreciate either the power of craving  as it wanders out after sights sounds smells tastes etc or the harm it causes in making us scattered and restless unable to stay still and contemplate ourselvesIts always finding things for us to do to think about making ourselves suffer and yet we remain blind to the factNow that weve come to practice the Dhamma we begin to have a sense of whats going onFor this reason whoever practices without being complacent will find that defilement and stress will have to grow lighter and lighter step by stepThe areas where we used to be defeated we now come out victoriousWhere we used to be burned by the defilements we now have the mindfulness and discernment to burn them insteadOnly when we stop groping around and really come to our senses will we realize the benefits of the Dhamma the importance of the practiceThen there is no way that we can abandon the practice for something inside us keeps forcing us to stay with itWeve seen that if we dont practice to disband defilement and stress the stress of the defilements will keep piling upThis is why we have to stay with the practice to our last breathYou have to be firm in not letting yourself be weak and easily led astrayThose who are mindful and discerning will naturally act it this way those who arent will keep on following their defilements ending up back where they were when they hadnt yet started practicing to gain release from stressThey may keep on practicing but its hard to tell what theyre practicing for  mostly for more stressThis shows that theyre still groping around  and when they grope around in this way they start criticizing the practice as useless and badWhen a person submits readily to defilement and craving theres no way she can practice for if youre going to practice there are a lot of things you have to struggle with and endureIts like paddling a boat against the stream  you have to use strength if you want to make any headwayIts not easy to go against the stream of the defilements because they are always ready to pull you down to a lower levelIf you arent mindful and discerning if you dont use the Lord Buddhas Dhamma to examine yourself your strength will fail you for if you have only a little mindfulness and discernment in the face of a lot of defilements theyll make you vacillateAnd if youre living with sweettalking sycophants youll go even further off the path involved with all sorts of things and oblivious to the practiceTo practice the Dhamma then is to go against the flow to go upstream against suffering and stress because suffering and stress are the main problemsIf you dont really contemplate stress your practice will go nowhereStress is where you start and then you try to trace out its root causeYou have to use your discernment to track down exactly where stress originates for stress is a resultOnce you see the result you have to track down the causeThose who are mindful and discerning are never complacentWhenever stress arises theyre sure to search out its causes so that they can eliminate themThis sort of investigation can proceed on many levels from the coarse to the refined and requires that you seek advice so that you dont stumbleOtherwise you may think you can figure it all out in your head  which wont work at allThe basic Dhamma principles that the Lord Buddha proclaimed for us to use in our contemplation are many but theres no need to learn them allJust focusing on some of the more important ones such as the five aggregates or name and form will be very usefulBut you need to keep making a thorough allround examination not just an occasional probe so that a feeling of dispassion and disengagement arises and loosens the grip of desireUse mindfulness to keep constant and close supervision over the senses and that mindfulness will come to be more present than your tendency to drift off elsewhereRegardless of what youre doing saying or thinking be on the lookout for whatever will make you slip for if youre tenacious in sustaining mindfulness thats how all your stresses and sufferings can be disbandedSo keep at thisIf you fall down times get back up times and resume your stanceThe reason mindfulness and discernment are slow to develop is because youre not really sensitive to yourselfThe greater your sensitivity the stronger your mindfulness and discernment will becomeAs the Lord Buddha said Bhavita bahulikata  which means Develop and maximize  ie make the most of your mindfulnessThe way your practice has developed through contemplating and supervising the mind throughout your daily life has already shown its rewards to some extent so keep stepping up your effortsDont let yourself grow weak or laxYouve finally got this opportunity Can you afford to be complacentYour life is steadily ebbing away so you have to compensate by building up more and more mindfulness and discernment until you become mature in the DhammaOtherwise your defilements will remain many and your discernment crudeThe older you grow the more you have to watch out  for we know what happens to old people everywhereSo seize the moment to develop the faculties of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment in a balanced wayKeep contemplating and probing and youll protect yourself from wandering out after the worldNo matter who tempts you to go with them you can be sure within yourself that you wont go following them because you no longer have to go believing anyone else or hoping for the baits of the world  because the baits of the world are poisonThe Dhamma has to be the refuge and light of your lifeOnce you have this degree of conviction in yourself you cant help but stride forward without slipping back but if you waver and wander unsure of whether or not to keep practicing the Dhamma watch out Youre sure to get pulled over the cliff and into the pit of fireIf you arent free within yourself you get pulled at from all sides because the world is full of things that keep pulling at youBut those who have the intelligence not to be gullible will see the stress and harm of those things distinctly for themselvesFor this reason theyre not headed for anything low they wont have to keep suffering in the worldThey feel dispassionThey lose their taste for all the various baits and lures the world has to offerThe practice of the Dhamma is what allows us to shake off whatever attractive things used to delude us into holding onRealize that it wont be long before we die  we wont be here much longer so even if anyone offers us incredible wealth why should we want itWho could really own itWho could really control itIf you can read yourself in this matter you come to a feeling of dispassionDisenchantmentYou lose your taste for all the lures of the worldYou no longer hold them in esteemIf you make use of them its for the sake of the benefits they give in terms of the Dhamma but your disenchantment stays continuousEven the name and form youve been regarding as me and mine have been wearing down and falling apart continuallyAs for the defilements theyre still lying in wait to burn youSo how can you afford to be obliviousFirst theres the suffering and stress of the five aggregates and on top of that theres the suffering and stress caused by defilement craving and attachment stabbing you slapping you beating youThe more you practice and contemplate the more you become sensitive to this on deeper and deeper levelsYour interest in blatant things outside  good and bad people good and bad things  gets swept awayYou dont have to concern yourself with them for youre concerned solely with penetrating yourself within destroying your pride and conceitOutside affairs arent importantWhats important is how clearly you can see the truth inside until the brightness appearsThe brightness that comes from seeing the truth isnt at all like the light we see outsideOnce you really know it you see that its indescribable for its something entirely personalIt cleans everything out of the heart and mind in line with the strength of our mindfulness and discernmentIts what sweeps and cleans and clears and lets go and disbands things insideBut if we dont have mindfulness and discernment as our means of knowing contemplating and letting go then everything inside is dark on all sidesAnd not only dark but also full of fire whose poisonous fuel keeps burning awayWhat could be more terrifying than the fuel burning inside usEven though its invisible it flares up every time theres sensory contactThe bombs they drop on people to wipe them out arent really all that dangerous for you can die only once per lifetimeBut the three bombs of passion aversion and delusion keep ripping the heart apart countless timesNormally we dont realize how serious the damage is but when we come to practice the Dhamma we can take stock of the situation seeing what its like when sensory contact comes at what moments the burning heat of defilement and craving arises and why theyre all so very quickWhen you contemplate how to disband suffering and defilement you need the proper tools and have to make the effort without being complacentThe fact that weve come to practice out here without any involvements or worldly responsibilities helps speed up the practiceIts extremely beneficial in helping us to examine our inner diseases in detail and to disband suffering and stress continually in line with our mindfulness and discernmentOur burdens grow lighter and we come to realize how much our practice of the Dhamma is progressing in the direction of the cessation of sufferingThose who dont have the time to come and rest here or to really stop get carried away with all kinds of distractionsThey may say I can practice anywhere but its just wordsThe fact of the matter is that their practice is to follow the defilements until their heads are spinning and yet they can still boast that they can practice anywhereTheir mouths arent in line with their minds and their minds  burned and beaten by defilement craving and attachment  dont realize their situationTheyre like worms that live in filth and are happy to stay and die right there in the filthPeople with any mindfulness and discernment feel disgust at the filth of the defilements in the mindThe more they practice the more sensitive they become the more their revulsion growsBefore when our mindfulness and discernment were still crude we didnt feel this at allWe were happy to play around in the filth within ourselvesBut now that weve come to practice to contemplate from the blatant to the more subtle levels we sense more and more how disgusting the filth really isTheres nothing to it thats worth falling for at all because its all inconstancy stress and notselfSo whats there to want out of lifeThose who are ignorant say that were born to gain wealth and be millionaires but that kind of life is like falling into hellIf you understand the practice of the Dhamma in the Buddhas footsteps you realize that nothing is worth having nothing is worth getting involved with everything has to be let goThose who still latch onto the body feeling perceptions thoughtformations and consciousness as self need to contemplate until they see that the body is stressful feelings are stressful perceptions are stressful thoughtformations are stressful consciousness is stressful  in short name is stressful and so is form or in even plainer terms the body is stressful and so is the mindYou have to focus on stressOnce you see it thoroughly from the blatant to the subtle levels youll be able to rise above pleasure and pain because youve let them goBut if you have yet to fully understand stress youll still yearn for pleasure  and the more you yearn the more you sufferThis holds too for the pleasure that comes when the mind is tranquilIf you let yourself get stuck on it youre like a person addicted to a drug Once theres the desire you take the drug and think yourself happyBut as for how much suffering the repeated desire causes you dont have the intelligence to see itAll you see is that if you take the drug whenever you want youre okayWhen people cant shake off their addictions this is whyThey get stuck on the sense of pleasure that comes when they take the drugTheyre ingesting sensuality and they keep on wanting more for only when they ingest more will their hunger subsideBut soon it comes back again so theyll want still moreThey keep on ingesting sensuality stirring up the mind but dont see that theres any harm or suffering involvedInstead they say theyre happy When the longing gets really intense it feels really good to satisfy itThats what they sayPeople who have heavy defilements and crude discernment dont see that desire and longing are suffering and so they dont know how to do away with themAs soon as they take what they want the desire goes awayThen it comes back again so they take some moreIt comes back again and they take still more  over and over like this so blind that they dont realize anything at allPeople of intelligence though contemplate Why is there desire and why do I have to satisfy itAnd when it comes back why do I have to keep satisfying it over and over again Once they realize that the desire in and of itself is what they have to attack that by disbanding this one thing they wont feel any disturbance and will never have to suffer from desire again thats when they really can gain release from suffering and stressBut for the most part we dont see things from this angle because we still take our pleasure in consuming thingsThis is why its hard for us to practice to abandon desireAll we know is how to feed on the bait so we dont dare try giving it up  as when people who are addicted to meateating are afraid to become vegetariansWhyBecause theyre still attached to flavor still slaves to desireIf you cant let go of even these blatant things how can you ever hope to abandon the damp and fermenting desires within you that are so much harder to detectYou still take the most blatant baitsWhen desire whispers and pleads with you there you go  pandering to it as quickly as possibleYou dont notice how much this tires you out dont realize that this is the source of the most vicious sufferings that deceive all living beings into falling under its powerEven though the Buddhas teachings reveal the easiest way to use our discernment to contemplate cause and effect in this area we dont make the effort to contemplate and instead keep swallowing the baitWe get our pleasure and thats all we want going with the flow of defilement and cravingOur practice here is to go against the flow of every sort of desire and wandering of the mindIt means selfrestraint and training in many many areas as for instance when sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations arise and deceive us into liking something and then a moment later tiring of it and wanting something elseWe get so thoroughly deceived that we end up running frantically all over the placeThe virulent diseases in the mind are more than manyIf you dont know how to deal with them youll remain under Maras powerThose who have truly seen stress and suffering will be willing to put their lives on the line in their effort to work free in the same way the Buddha was willing to put his life on the line in order to gain freedom from suffering and release from the worldHe wasnt out after personal comfort at allEach Buddhatobe has had to undergo suffering in the world for his own sake and that of othersEach has had to relinquish all of his vast wealth instead of using it for his comfortSo the practice is one of struggle and enduranceWhoever struggles and endures will gain victory  and no other victory can match itGaining control over the defilements is the ultimate victoryWhatever you contemplate you can let go Thats the ultimate victorySo please keep at the effortYou cant let yourself relax after each little victoryThe more you keep being victorious the stronger more daring and more resilient your mindfulness and discernment will become in every area examining everything regardless of whether it comes in by way of the eyes ears nose tongue body or mindThe more you examine yourself the sharper your mindfulness and discernment will become understanding how to disband things and let them goAs soon as theres attachment youll see the suffering and stress  just as when you touch fire feel the heat and immediately let goThis is why the practice of the Dhamma is of supreme worthIts not just a game you play around with  for the defilements have a great deal of power thats hard to overcomeBut if you make the effort to overcome them theyll weaken as mindfulness and discernment grow strongerThis is when you can say that youre making progress in the Dhamma when you can disband your own suffering and stressSo try to go all the way while you still have the breath to breatheThe Buddha said Make an effort to attain the asyetunattained reach the asyetunreached realize the asyetunrealized He didnt want us to be weak and vacillating always making excuses for ourselves because now that weve ordained weve already made an important sacrificeIn the Buddhas time no matter where the monks and nuns came from  from royal wealthy or ordinary backgrounds  once they had left their homes they cut their family ties and entered the Lord Buddhas lineage without ever returningTo return to the home life he said was to become a person of no worthHis only concern was to keep pulling people out pulling them out of suffering and stressIf we want to escape we have to follow his example cutting away worry and concern for our family and relatives by entering his lineageTo live and practice under his discipline is truly the supreme refuge the supreme wayThose who follow the principles of the DhammaVinaya  even though they may have managed only an occasional taste of its peace without yet reaching the paths and their fruitions  pledge their lives to the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaThey realize that nothing else they can reach will lead to freedom from suffering but if they reach this one refuge theyll gain total releaseThose whose mindfulness and discernment are deep farseeing and meticulous will cross over to the further shoreTheyve lived long enough on this shore and have had all the suffering they can bearTheyve circled around in birth and death countless timesSo now they realize that they have to go to the further shore and so they make a relentless effort to let go of their sense of selfTheres nothing distant about the further shore but to get there you first have to give up your sense of self in the five aggregates by investigating to see them all as stress to see that none of them are me or mine Focus on this one theme not clingingThe Lord Buddha once spoke of the past as below the future as above and the present as in the middleHe also said that unskillful qualities are below skillful qualities above and neutral ones in the middleTo each of them he said Dont cling to it Even nibbana the further shore shouldnt be clung toSee how far were going to be released through notclingingAny of you who cant comprehend that even nibbana isnt to be clung to should consider the standard teaching that tells us not to cling that we have to let go All things are unworthy of attachment This is the ultimate summary of all that the Buddha taughtAll phenomena whether compounded or uncompounded fall under the phrase Sabbe dhamma anatta  All things are notself Theyre all unworthy of attachmentThis summarizes everything including our investigation to see the truth of the world and of the Dhamma to see things clearly with our mindfulness and discernment penetrating through the compounded to the uncompounded or through the worldly to the transcendent all of which has to be done by looking within not withoutAnd if we want to see the real essence of the Dhamma we have to look deeply profoundlyThen its simply a matter of letting go all along the wayWe see all the way in and let go of everythingThe theme of not clinging covers everything from beginning to endIf our practice is to go correctly its because we look with mindfulness and discernment to penetrate everything not getting stuck on any form feeling perception thoughtformation or consciousness at allThe Buddha taught about how ignorance  not knowing form delusion with form  leads to craving the mental act that arises at the mind and agitates it leading to the kamma by which we try to get what we craveWhen you understand this you can practice correctly for you know that you have to disband the cravingThe reason we contemplate the body and mind over and over again is so that we wont feel desire for anything outside wont get engrossed in anything outsideThe more you contemplate the more things outside seem pitiful and not worth getting engrossed in at allThe reason you were engrossed and excited was because you didnt knowAnd so you raved about people and things and made a lot of fuss talking about worldly matters This is good thats bad shes good hes bad The mind got all scattered in worldly affairs  and so how could you examine the diseases within your own mindThe Buddha answered Mogharajas question  In what way does one view the world so that the king of death does not see one  by telling him to see the world as empty as devoid of selfWe have to strip away conventions such as person and being and all designations such as elements aggregates and sense mediaOnce we know how to strip away conventions and designations theres nothing we need to hold ontoWhats left is the DeathlessThe transcendentNibbanaThere are many names for it but theyre all one and the same thingWhen you strip away all worldly things whats left is the transcendentWhen you strip away all compounded things whats left is the uncompounded the true DhammaSo consider for yourself whether or not this is worth attainingIf we stay in the world we have to go through repeated births and deaths in the three levels of existence sensuality form and formlessnessBut on that further shore theres no birth no deathIts beyond the reach of the King of MortalityBut because we dont know the further shore we want to keep on being reborn on this shore with its innumerable repeated sufferingsOnce you comprehend suffering and stress though theres nowhere else you want to turn You head straight for the further shore the shore with no birth or death the shore where defilement and craving disband once and for allYour practice thus goes straight to the cessation of suffering and defilement to clear penetration of the Common Characteristics of inconstancy stress and notselfness in the aggregatesPeople with mindfulness and discernment focus their contemplation in the direction of absolute disbanding for if their disbanding isnt absolute theyll have to be reborn again in suffering and stressSo keep disbanding attachments keep letting go contemplating inconstancy stress and notselfness and relinquishing themThis is the right path for sureIsnt this something worth knowing and training forIts not all that mysterious or far away you knowIts something that anyone  man or woman  can realize something we can all train inWe can develop virtue can make the mind quiet and can use our mindfulness and discernment to contemplateSo isnt this really worth practicingStupid people like to say noThey say they cant do it They cant observe the precepts cant make the mind quietThe best thing in life  the practice for release from suffering and stress  and yet they reject itInstead they rush around in a turmoil competing with one another bragging to one another and then end up rotting in their coffinsExactly what is appealing about all thatWeve gone astray for far too long already our lives almost gone after how many decadesNow weve come here to turn ourselves aroundNo matter how old you are the air you breathe isnt just for your convenience and comfort but for you to learn about suffering and stressThat way youll be able to disband itDont imagine that your family and relatives are essential to youYou are aloneYou came alone and youll go aloneThis holds true for each of usOnly when theres no self to go Thats when you penetrate to the DhammaIf there is still a self to be born then youre stuck in the cycle of suffering and stressSo isnt it worthwhile to strive for releaseAfter all its something each of us has to find for him or herselfThose who trust in the Lord Buddha will all have to follow this wayTo trust the defilements is to throw yourself down in the mire  and there who will you be able to brag to aside from your own sufferingsThe knowledge that leads to dispassion and disenchantment is what counts as true knowledgeBut if your knowledge leads you to hold on then youre a disciple of MaraYou still find things very deliciousYou may say that youre disenchanted but the mind isnt disenchanted at allIt still wants to take this to get that to stay right hereWhoever can keep reading the truth within her own mind deeper and deeper will be able to go all the way through wiping out stupidity and delusion each step along the wayWhere you used to be deluded youve now begun to come to your sensesWhere you used to brag you now realize how very stupid you were  and that youll have to keep on correcting your stupidityReading yourself contemplating yourself you see new angles you gain more precise selfknowledge each step along the wayIts not a question of being expert about things outsideYou see how whats inside is really inconstant really stressful really notselfThe way you used to fall for things and latch onto them was because of your blindness because you didnt understandSo who can you blameYour own stupidity thats who  because it wanted to brag about how much it knewNow you know that youve still got a lot of stupidity left and that youll have to get rid of it before you dieEvery day that you still have breath left to breathe youll use it to wipe out your stupidity rather than to get this or be that or to dance aroundThe ones who dance around are possessed by spirits the demons of defilement making them crazy and deluded wanting to get this and be that and dance all over the placeBut if you focus your attention in on yourself then your pride your conceit your desires to stand out will shrink out of sight never daring to show their faces for the rest of your life for you realize that the more you brag the more you sufferSo the essence of the practice is to turn around and focus insideThe more you can wash away these things the more empty and free the mind will be This is its own rewardIf you connive with your conceits youll destroy whatever virtue you have but if you can drive these demons away virtuous influences will come and stay with youIf the demons are still there the virtuous ones wont be able to stayThey cant get along at allIf you let yourself get entangled in turmoil its an affair of the demonsIf youre empty and free its an affair of cleanliness and peace  an affair of the virtuous influencesSo go and check to see how many of these demons youve been able to sweep awayAre they thinning outWhen they make an appearance point them right in the face and call them what they are demons and devils come to eat your heart and drink your bloodYouve let them eat you before but now youve finally come to your senses and can drive them awayThat will put an end to your troubles or at least help your sufferings grow lighterYour sense of self will start to shrivel awayBefore it was big fat and powerful but now its power is goneYour pride and conceit have grown thin and weakIts as when a person has been bitten by a rabid dog They give him a serum made from rabid dogs to drive out the diseaseThe same holds here If we can recognize these things they disbandThe mind is then empty and at peace for this one thing  the theme of not clinging  can disband suffering and stress with every momentToday we have gathered for our regular meetingThe way weve been contemplating to the point of giving rise to knowledge through genuine mindfulness and discernment makes us realize how this is a process of disbanding suffering and defilementWhenever mindfulness lapses and we latch on to anything our practice of reading ourselves step by step will enable us to realize the situation easilyThis helps us keep the mind under control and does a world of goodStill its not enough for the affairs of suffering and defilement are paramount issues buried deep in the characterWe thus we have to contemplate and examine things within ourselvesLooking outside is something were already used to Whenever we know things outside the mind is in a turmoil instead of being empty and at peaceThis is something we can all be aware ofAnd this is why we have to maintain the mind in its state of neutrality or mindful centerednessWe then notice from our experience in the practice What state have we been able to maintain the mind inIs our mindfulness continuous throughout all our activitiesThese are things we all have to notice using our own powers of observationWhen the mind deviates from its foundation because of mental fabrications thinking up all sorts of turmoil for itself as its used to doing what can we do to make it settle down and grow stillIf it doesnt grow still it gets involved in nothing but stress wandering around thinking imagining taking on all sorts of thingsThats stressYou have to keep reading these things at all times seeing clearly the ways in which theyre inconstant changing and stressfulNow if you understand the nature of arising and passing away by turning inward to watch the arising and passing away within yourself you realize that its neither good nor bad nor anything of the sortIts simply a natural process of arising persisting and passing awayTry to see deeply into this and youll be sweeping the mind clean just as when you constantly sweep out your house If anything then comes to make it dirty youll be able to detect itSo with every moment we have to sweep out whatever arises persists and then passes awayLet it all pass away without latching on or clinging to anythingTry to make the mind aware of this state of unattachment within itself If it doesnt latch on to anything doesnt cling to anything theres no commotion in itIts empty and at peaceThis state of awareness is so worth knowing for it doesnt require that you know a lot of things at allYou simply have to contemplate so as to see the inconstancy of form feelings perceptions thoughtformations and consciousnessOr you can contemplate whatever preoccupies the mind as it continually changes  arising and passing away  with every momentThis is something you have to contemplate until you really know itOtherwise youll fall for your preoccupations in line with the way you label sensory contactsIf you dont fall for sensory contacts arising in the present you fall for your memories or thoughtformationsThis is why you have to train the mind to stay firmly centered in neutrality without latching onto anything at allIf you can maintain this one stance continuously youll be sweeping everything out of the mind disbanding its suffering and stress in the immediate present with each and every momentEverything arises and then passes away arises and then passes away  everythingDont grasp hold of anything thinking that its good or bad or taking it as your selfStop all your discursive thinking and mental fabricationsWhen you can maintain this state of awareness the mind will calm down on its own will naturally become empty and freeIf any thoughts arise see that they just come and go so dont latch onto themWhen you can read the aspects of the mind that arise and pass away theres not much else to do Just keep watching and letting go within yourself and there will be no remaining long drawnout trains of thought about past or futureThey all stop right at the arising and passing awayWhen you really see the present with its arisings and passings away there are no great issuesWhatever you think about will all pass away but if you cant notice its passing away youll grasp at whatever comes up and then everything will become a turmoil of ceaseless imaginingsSo you have to cut off these connected thoughtformations that keep flowing like a stream of waterEstablish your mindfulness and once its established simply fix your whole attention on the mindThen youll be able to still the flow of thoughtformations that had you distractedYou can do this at any time and the mind will always grow still to become empty unentangled unattachedThen keep watch over the normalcy of the mind again and again whenever it gets engrossed and starts spinning out long drawn out thoughtformationsAs soon as youre aware let them stopAs soon as youre aware let them stop and things will disband right thereWhatever the issue disband it immediatelyPractice like this until you become skilled at it and the mind wont get involved in distractionsIts like driving a car When you want to stop just slam on the brakes and you stop immediatelyThe same principle works with the mindYoull notice that no matter when as soon as theres mindfulness it stops and grows stillIn other words when mindfulness is firmly centered then no matter what happens as soon as youre mindfully aware of it the mind stops disengages and is freeThis is a really simple method stopping as soon as youre mindfulAny other approach is just too slow to copeThis method of examining yourself knowing yourself is very worth knowing because anyone can apply it at any timeEven right here while Im speaking and youre listening just focus your attention right at the mind as its normal in the presentThis is an excellent way of knowing your own mindBefore we knew anything about all this we let the mind go chasing after any thoughts that occurred to it taking up a new thought as soon as it was finished with an old one spinning its webs to trap us in all kinds of complicationsWhatever meditation techniques we tried werent really able to stop our distractionSo dont underestimate this method as being too simpleTrain yourself to be on top of any objects that make contact or any opinions that intrude on your awarenessWhen pride and opinions come pouring out cry StopLet me finish first This method of calling a halt can really still the defilements immediately even when theyre like two people interrupting each other to speak the conceit or sense of self on one side immediately raising objections before the other side has even finishedOr you might say its like suddenly running into a dangerous beast  a tiger or poisonous snake  with no means of escapeAll you can do is simply stop totally still and spread thoughts of lovingkindnessThe same holds true here You simply stop and that cuts the strength of the defilement or any sense of self thats made a sudden appearanceWe have to stop the defilements in their tracks for if we dont theyll grow strong and keep intensifyingSo we have to stop them right from the firstResist them right from the firstThis way your mindfulness will get used to dealing with themAs soon as you say Stop things stop immediatelyThe defilements will grow obedient and wont dare push you around in any wayIf youre going to sit for an hour make sure that youre mindful right at the mind the whole timeDont just aim at the pleasure of tranquillitySit and watch the sensations within the mind to see how its centeredDont concern yourself with any cravings or feelings that ariseEven if pain arises in whatever way dont pay it any attentionKeep being mindful of the centered normalcy of the mind at all timesThe mind wont stray off to any pleasures or pains but will let go of them all seeing the pains as an affair of the aggregates because the aggregates are inconstantFeelings are inconstantThe bodys inconstantThats the way they have to beWhen a pleasant feeling arises the craving that wants pleasure is contented with it and wants to stay with that pleasure as long as possibleBut when theres pain it acts in an entirely opposite way because pain hurtsWhen pains arise as we sit for long periods of time the mind gets agitated because craving pushes for a changeIt wants us to adjust things in this way or thatWe have to train ourselves to disband the craving insteadIf pains grow strong in the body we have to practice staying at equanimity by realizing that theyre the pains of the aggregates  and not our pain  until the mind is no longer agitated and can return to a normal state of equanimityEven if the equanimity isnt complete dont worry about itSimply make sure that the mind doesnt struggle to change the situationKeep disbanding the struggling the cravingIf the pain is so unbearable that you have to change positions dont make the change while the mind is really worked upKeep sitting still watch how far the pain goes and change positions only when the right moment comesThen as you stretch out your leg make sure that the mind is still centered still at equanimityStay that way for about five minutes and the fierce pain will go awayBut watch out When a pleasant feeling replaces the pain the mind will like itSo you have to use mindfulness to keep the mind neutral and at equanimityPractice this in all your activities because the mind tends to get engrossed with pleasant feelingsIt can even get engrossed with neutral feelingsSo you have to keep your mindfulness firmly established knowing feelings for what they really are inconstant and stressful with no real pleasure to them at allContemplate pleasant feelings to see them as nothing but stressYou have to keep doing this at all timesDont get infatuated with pleasant feelings for if you do you fall into more suffering and stress because craving wants nothing but pleasure even though the aggregates have no pleasure to offerThe physical and mental aggregates are all stressfulIf the mind can rise above pleasure above pain above feeling right there is where it gains releasePlease understand this Its release from feelingIf the mind hasnt yet gained release from feeling  if it still wants pleasure is still attached to pleasure and pain  then try to notice the state of mind at the moments when its neutral toward feelingThat will enable it to gain release from suffering and stressSo we have to practice a lot with feelings of physical pain and at the same time to make an effort to comprehend pleasant feelings as well for the pleasant feelings connected with the subtle defilements of passion and craving are things we dont really understandWe think that theyre true pleasure which makes us want themThis wanting is craving  and the Buddha tells us to abandon craving and passion for name and formPassion here means wanting to get nothing but pleasure and then becoming entangled in liking or disliking what resultsIt means that were entangled in the delicious flavors of feelings regardless of whether theyre physical feelings or mental onesWe should come to realize that when a feeling of physical pain gets very strong we can handle it by using mindfulness to keep the mind from strugglingThen even if theres a great deal of physical pain we can let goEven though the body may be agitated the mind isnt agitated along with itBut to do this you first have to practice separating feelings from the mind while youre still strong and healthyAs for the feelings that come with desire if we accumulate them they lead to even greater sufferingSo dont think of them as being easeful or comfortable because thats delusionYou have to keep track of how feelings  no matter what the sort  are all inconstant stressful and notselfIf you can let go of feeling youll become disenchanted with form feelings perceptions thoughtformations and consciousness that carry feelings of pleasureBut if you dont contemplate these things youll stay infatuated with themSo try noticing when the mind is in this infatuated stateIs it empty and at peaceIf its attached youll see that its dirty and defiled because its deluded into clingingAs soon as theres pain it grows all agitatedIf the mind is addicted to the three kinds of feeling  pleasant painful and neither pleasant nor painful  it has to endure suffering and stressWe have to see the inconstancy stressfulness and notselfness of the body and mind so that we wont clingWe wont cling whether we look outside or inWell be empty  empty because of our lack of attachmentWell know that the mind isnt suffering from stressThe more deeply we look inside the more well see that the mind is truly empty of attachmentThis is how we gain release from suffering and stressIts the simplest way to gain release but if we dont really understand its the hardestThus you absolutely have to keep working at letting goThe moment the mind latches onto anything make it let goAnd then notice to see that when you tell the mind to let go it does let goWhen you tell it to stop it stopsWhen you tell it to be empty its really and truly emptyThis method of watching the mind is extremely useful but were rarely interested in contemplating to the point of becoming adept and resourceful at disbanding our own sufferingsWe practice in a leisurely casual way and dont know which points we should correct where we should disband things what we should let go ofAnd so we keep circling around with suffering and attachmentWe have to figure out how to find our opportunity to disband suffering with every momentWe cant just live sleep and eat at our easeWe need to find ways to examine and contemplate all things using our mindfulness and discernment to see their emptiness of self Only then will we be able to loosen our attachmentsIf we dont know with real mindfulness and discernment our practice wont be able to lead us out of suffering and stress at allEvery defilement  each one in the list of sixteen  is hard to abandonStill they dont arise all sixteen at once but only one at a timeIf you know the features of their arising you can let them goThe first step is to recognize their faces clearly because you have to realize that theyre burning hot every time they ariseIf they have you sad or upset its easy to know themIf they have you happy theyre harder to detectSo you first have to learn to recognize the mind at normalcy keeping your words and deeds at normalcy tooNormalcy here means being free of liking and dislikingIts a question of purity in virtue  just as when we practice restraint of the sensesNormalcy is the basic foundationIf the mind isnt at normalcy  if it likes this or dislikes that  that means your restraint of the senses isnt pureFor instance when you see a sight with the eye or hear a sound with the ear you dont get upset as long as no real pains arise but if you get distracted and absentminded as the pains get more and more earnest your precepts will suffer and youll end up all agitatedSo dont underestimate even the smallest thingsUse your mindfulness and discernment to disband things to destroy them and to keep working at your investigationThen even if serious events happen youll be able to let go of themIf your attachments are heavy youll be able to let go of themIf theyre many youll be able to thin them outThe same holds true with intermediate defilements the five HindrancesAny liking for sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations is the Hindrance of sensual desireIf you dont like what you see hear etc thats the Hindrance of ill willThese Hindrances of liking and disliking defile the mind making it agitated and scattered unable to grow calmTry observing the mind when its dominated by the five Hindrances to see whether or not its in a state of sufferingDo you recognize these intermediate defilements when they enshroud your mindThe Hindrance of sensual desire is like a dye that clouds clear water making it murky  and when the mind is murky its sufferingIll will as a Hindrance is irritability and dissatisfaction and the Hindrance of sloth and torpor is a state of drowsiness and lethargy  a condition of refusing to deal with anything at all burying yourself in sleep and lazy forgetfulnessAll the Hindrances including the final pair  restlessness  anxiety and uncertainty  cloak the mind in darknessThis is why you need to be resilient in fighting them off at every moment and in investigating them so that you can weaken and eliminate every form of defilement  from the gross to the middling and on to the subtle  from the mindThe practice of the Dhamma is very delicate work requiring that you use all your mindfulness and discernment in probing and comprehending the body and mindWhen you look into the body try to see the truth of how its inconstant stressful and nothing more than physical elementsIf you dont contemplate in this way your practice will simply grope around and wont be able to release you from suffering and stress  for the sufferings caused by the defilements concocting things in the mind are more than manyThe mind is full of all kinds of tricksSometimes you may gain some insight through mindfulness and discernment  becoming bright empty and at peace  only to find the defilements slipping in to spoil things cloaking the mind in total darkness once more so that you get distracted and cant know anything clearlyWe each have to find special strategies in reading ourselves so that we dont get lost in distractionsDesire is a big troublemaker here and so is distractionTorpor and lethargy  all the Hindrances  are enemies blocking your wayThe fact that you havent seen anything all the way through is because these characters are blocking your way and have you surroundedYou have to find a way to destroy them using apt attention ie a skillful way of making use of the mindYou have to dig down and explore contemplating to see how these things arise how they pass away and what exactly is inconstant stressful and notselfThese are questions you have to keep asking yourself so that the mind will really come to knowWhen you really know inconstancy youre sure to let go of defilement craving and attachment or at least be able to weaken and thin them outIts like having a broom in your handWhenever attachment arises you sweep it away until the mind can no longer grow attached to anything for theres nothing left for it to be attached toYouve seen that everything is inconstant so whats there to latch ontoWhen youre persistent in contemplating to see your inconstancy stress and notselfness the mind feels ease because youve loosened your attachmentsThis is the marvel of the Dhamma an ease of body and mind completely free from entanglement in the defilementsIts truly specialBefore the ignorance obscuring the mind caused you wander about spellbound by sights sounds and so forth so that defilement craving and attachment had you under their powerBut now mindfulness and discernment break the spell by seeing that theres no self to these things nothing real to them at allThey simply arise and pass away with every momentTheres not the least little bit of me or mine to them at allOnce we really know with mindfulness and discernment we sweep everything clean leaving nothing but pure Dhamma with no sense of self at allWe see nothing but inconstancy stress and notselfness with no pleasure or painThe Lord Buddha taught Sabbe dhamma anatta  All things are notself Both the compounded and the uncompounded  which is nibbana the transcendent  are notselfTheres just DhammaThis is very importantTheres no sense of self there but what is there is DhammaThis isnt the extinction taught by the wrong view of annihilationism its the extinction of all attachment to me and mine All that remains is Deathlessness  the undying Dhamma the undying property  free from birth aging illness and deathEverything still remains as it was it hasnt been annihilated anywhere the only things annihilated are the defilements together with all suffering and stressIts called suñño  empty  because its empty of the label of selfThis Deathlessness is the true marvel the Buddha discovered and taught to awaken usThis is why its so worth looking in to penetrate clear through the inconstancy stress and notselfness of the five aggregates for what then remains is the natural Dhamma free from birth aging illness and deathIts called Unbinding Emptiness the Unconditioned These names all mean the same thingTheyre simply conventional designations that also have to be let go so that you can dwell in the aspect of mind devoid of any sense of selfSo the paths fruitions and nibbana are not something to hope for in a future life by developing a vast heap of perfectionsSome people like to point out that the Lord Buddha had to accumulate so many many virtues  but what about youYou dont consider how many lives have passed while you still have yet to attain the goal all because of your stupidity in continually finding excuses for yourselfThe basic principles that the Lord Buddha taught  such as the four foundations of mindfulness the four Noble Truths the three characteristics of inconstancy stress and notselfness  are right here inside you so probe on in to contemplate them until you know themDefilement craving and attachment are right here inside you too so contemplate them until you gain true insightThen youll be able to let them go no longer latching onto them as really being me or mine This way youll gain release from suffering and stress within yourselfDont keep excusing yourself by relying for instance on the miraculous powers of some object or waiting to build up the perfectionsDont think in those termsThink instead of what the defilements are like right here and now Is it better to disband them or to fall in with themIf you fall in with them is there suffering and stressYou have to find out the truth within yourself so as to get rid of your stupidity and delusion in thinking that this bodily frame of suffering is really happinessWere all stuck in this delusion because we dont open our eyesThis is why we have to keep discussing these issues giving advice and digging out the truth so that youll give rise to the mindfulness and discernment that will enable you to know yourselfThe fact that youve begun to see things to acknowledge the defilements and stress within yourself to at least some extent is very beneficialIts better that we talk about these things than about anything else so that well gain knowledge about suffering and its cause about how to contemplate body feelings mind and mental qualities so as to disband our suffering and stressThis way we can reduce our sufferings because well be letting go of the defilements that scorch the mind and get it agitatedOur mindfulness and discernment will gradually be able to eliminate the defilements and cravings from the heartThis practice of ours if we really do it and really come to know will really reduce our sufferingsThis will attract others to follow our exampleWe wont have to advertise for theyll have to noticeWe dont have to brag about what level weve attained or what degrees weve earnedWe dont have any of that here for all we talk about is suffering stress the defilements notselfIf we know with real mindfulness and discernment we can scrape away our defilements cravings and attachments and the good results will be right there inside usSo now that we have this opportunity we should make a concerted effort for the sake of our own progressDont let your life pass under the influence of defilement craving and attachmentMake an effort to correct yourself in this area every day every moment and youre sure to progress in your practice of destroying your defilements and disbanding your suffering and stress at all timesThis business of sacrificing defilements or sacrificing your sense of self is very important because it gives rewards  peace normalcy freedom with every moment  right here in the heartThe practice is thus something really worthy of interestIf youre not interested in the practice of searching out and destroying the diseases of defilement of your own suffering and stress youll have to stay stuck there in repeated suffering along with every other ignorant person in the worldWhen Mara  temptation  tried to stop the Buddhas efforts by telling him that within seven days he would become a Universal Emperor the Buddha answered I know alreadyDont try to deceive me or tempt me Because the Buddha had the ability to know such things instantly for himself Mara was continually defeatedBut what about youAre you a disciple of the Lord Buddha or of MaraWhenever temptation appears  there you go following him hook line and sinker with no sense of weariness or dispassion at allIf were really disciples of the Buddha we have to go against the flow of defilement craving and attachment establishing ourselves in good qualities  beginning with morality which forms the ideal principle for protecting ourselvesThen we can gain release from suffering by working from the level of the precepts on to mental calm and then using discernment to see inconstancy stress and notselfThis is a high level of discernment you know the discernment that penetrates notselfAt any rate the important point is that you not believe your defilementsEven though you may still have the effluents of ignorance or craving in your mind always keep making use of mindfulness and discernment as your means of knowing letting go scrubbing things cleanWhen these effluents come to tempt you simply stopLet goRefuse to go along with themIf you believe them when they tell you to latch onto things youll simply continue being burned and agitated by desireBut if you dont go along with them the desires in the mind will gradually loosen subside and eventually ceaseSo in training the mind you have to take desire as your battlefield in the same way you would in treating an addiction If you arent intent on defeating it theres no way you can escape being a slave to it repeatedlyWe have to use mindfulness as a protective shield and discernment as our weapon to cut through and destroy our desiresThat way our practice will result in steady progress enabling us to keep abreast of defilement craving and attachment with more and more precisionIf in your practice you can read and decipher the mind youll find your escape route following the footsteps of the Noble OnesBut as long as you dont see it youll think that there are no paths no fruitions no nibbanaOnly when you can disband the defilements will you knowYou really have to be able to disband them in order to know for yourself that the paths fruitions and nibbana really exist and really can disband suffering and stressThis is something you have to know for yourselfIts timeless No matter what the time or season whenever you have the mindfulness to stop and let go theres no sufferingAs you learn to do this over and over more and more frequently the defilements grow weaker and weakerThis is why its ehipassiko  something you can invite other people to come and see for all people who do this can disband defilement and sufferingIf they contemplate until they see inconstancy stress and notself theyll no longer have any attachments and their minds will become Dhamma will become freeTheres no need to get all excited about anyone outside  spirit entities or whatever  because success in the practice lies right here in the heartLook into it until you penetrate clearly all the way through yourself sweep away all your attachments and then youll have this ehipassiko within youCome and seeCome and see But if theres still any defilement then its Come and seeCome and see the defilements burning me It can work both ways you knowIf you disband the defilements let go and come to a stop then its Come and see how the defilements are gone how the mind is empty right here and now This is something anyone can know something you can know thoroughly for yourself with no great difficultyTurning to look into the mind isnt all that difficult you knowYou dont have to travel far to do itYou can watch it at any time in any postureTrue things and false are all there within you but if you dont study yourself within you wont know them  for you spend all your time studying outside the things of the world that worldly people studyIf you want to study the Dhamma you have to turn around and come inside watching right at the body at feelings at the mind at mental qualities until you know the truth that the body isnt you or yours its inconstant stressful and notselfFeelings are inconstant stressful and notselfThe mind is inconstant stressful and notself as wellThen look at the Dhamma of mental qualities Theyre inconstant and stressfulThey arise persist and pass awayIf you dont latch on and can become free from any sense of self right here at mental qualities the mind becomes freeIf you understand correctly the mind is really easy to deal withIf you dont its the exact oppositeLike pushing a light switch If you hit the on button the light is immediately brightWith the off button its immediately darkThe same holds true with the mindIf your knowledge is wrong its darkIf your knowledge is right its brightThen look to see if theres anything worth clinging toIf you really look youll see that there isnt for all the things you can cling to are suffering and stress  affairs of ignorance speculation daydreaming taking issue with things self people useless chatter endless news reportsBut if you focus on probing into the mind theres nothing  nothing but letting go to be empty and freeThis is where the Dhamma arises easily  as easily as defilements arise on the other side simply that youre now looking from a different angle and have the choice Do you want the dark angle or the brightShould you stop or keep runningShould you be empty or entangledIts yours to decide within youThe Dhamma is something marvelous and amazingIf you start out with right understanding you can understand all the way throughIf you get snagged at any point you can examine and contemplate things to see where youre still attachedKeep crossexamining back and forth and then all will become clearWere already good at following the knowledge of defilement and craving so now we have to follow the knowledge of mindfulness and discernment insteadKeep crossexamining the defilementsDont submit to them easilyYou have to resist their power and refuse to fall in with themThats when youll really come to knowWhen you really know everything stopsCraving stops your wanderings stop likes hatreds  this knowledge sweeps everything awayBut if you dont know you keep gathering things up until youre thoroughly embroiled arranging this adjusting that wanting this and that letting your sense of self rear its ugly headThink of it like this Youre a huge playhouse showing a truetolife drama whose hero heroine and villains  which are conventional suppositions  are entirely within youIf you strip away all conventional suppositions and designations what you have left is nothing but Dhamma freedom emptinessAnd simply being free and empty of any sense of self is enough to bring the whole show to an endThis is translated from a talk given in July to a group of monks and nuns most of whom were relatively new to meditationBecause his listeners were already familiar with the basic techniques of concentration practice as explained in Method  in Ajaan Lees book Keeping the Breath in Mind Ajaan Fuang here focuses less on technique than on the proper attitude and understanding to bring to the practiceThe style of the talk is fairly repetitive and so works best when it is read aloudOur teachers have laid the basis for our practice setting out everything with nothing lackingThe fact that the developments we experience in the practice arent complete comes from a lack within ourselves in our own practiceWe havent practiced enough to cut things awayWe havent given the practice our full effortSo lets take the opportunity today to make an effort ie to fix our mindfulness  each and every one of us  securely on the inandout breathTheres nothing much to itEach of us has a breathIts a meditation theme we already have within ourselvesWe dont have to go looking for it anywhere elseAnd theres no need to doubt as to whether or not its trueSo lets come and look within ourselves observe investigate ponder whats within ourselvesThe Buddha knew for himself what was true within himself and we follow him by practicing in line with his teachings so as to see whether whats within ourselves is true or falseSo try to be as observant as possible within yourselfThis practice is said to be akaliko  timelessThe Buddhas teachings are timelessThe fact that there are no developments in our practice is because we have timesThe Buddha says timeless We say there are timesOur times are more than manyTime for this time for that times for walking times for sitting times for sleeping times for eating times for talking  there are lots of themOur life turns into nothing but timesSo now lets try practicing in a way that it becomes timelessThe truth will then appear in our minds  each and every one of usEverything thats ready to develop is already thereWe dont have to get it from anywhere elseAwareness itself  the knowing in the mind  is already there within usSo use your mindfulness to keep the breath in mind so that whats already there will appear clearly continually  and developments in the mind will appear as wellWeve got to be observant as much as possibleUse your mindfulness to keep the breath in mind  the breath thats already there within you thats been there from the day you were born up to the presentThe effort lies in taking whats already there and keeping it continuous without break so that it grows so that its steady and constantItll then gain momentumThere will be strength in the breathDevelopments will appearOur inandout breath will become timelessIt will appear continuously to our awarenessThis is something we have to pursue as much as possible do as much as possibleThe more we do it the more all sorts of good things will appear within usIf we dont work at it our goodness wont developItll turn into timesThe opportunity to know the truth wont appear clearly within usThe truth will stay incompleteSo we have to use the power of our mindfulness to keep the breath in mind in a way that becomes more and more completeThen developments will appear within usThe Dhamma  our meditation theme  is something we all have within us  each and every one of usIts something were doing as we sit hereWere practicing it training in itThe question is how we take whats already here and make it more completeWe have to make an effort to use our powers of observation to acquaint ourselves with whats already thereOur teachers simply tell us point out the wayAs for us we have to train ourselves to use our powers of observation within ourselves to know in line with the truth within usOnce we see that its true we look after it so that it develops  we keep looking after it as much as possible and theres no two ways about it itll simply have to progressThere arent a lot of complicated steps to all thisWe simply look after whats already there so that it can become more full and completeItll grow day by day month by month year by yearThe developments in our minds will get better and betterIts not the case that things appear only for a moment and thats plenty enoughThats not the case at allWhatever appears here and now while were sitting here we have to keep looking after it continually all day all night all month all year longWe have to keep after it continuously without stopIf we keep looking after it the developments in our minds will keep developing further alongIf things happen just once thats not enoughIts the same as when we eatOne mouthful of food isnt enoughWe have to keep eating and eating until were fullThe same holds true in the effort to develop good qualities noble qualities within ourselvesWhether we build them through our thoughts our words or our deeds it all comes down to the one heartWe have to train our heart to gain a sense of respite and peaceWe have to train it to grow better and better for all good things arise from the heartThis is why we train it to be mindful to stay with the inbreath the outbreathWe train it in its meditation theme so that it will have roots a foundation  so that it will be steady and solid and wont go straying off after its thoughts and conceptsWe get it to gather together solely at the inandout breath so as to give it respite from its Hindrances so that the Hindrances wont be able to come in and interfere with its goodnessThat way well be able to develop more goodness to get the mind firmly established in concentrationThis is something each person has to do for him or herself  each and every one of usIts our very own personal dutyWhatever techniques actually solve the problems of our hearts so that they can experience peace whatever methods work in getting the mind to stay with the body in the present  whatever the methods  the important thing is that the mind stays firmly in its goodness all day all night whether were standing walking sitting or lying downAfter all we dont get much of a chance to do good you knowIts not the case that well get to do this foreverThere are always obstacles ready to get in the waySo while youve got the chance  right now and on into the future as long as youve got the opportunity  you should try to accelerate your effortsKeep at itKeep at it as much as you can until the mind gains full strength so that it can prevent all its lower qualities its unskillful qualities from getting in the way from interfering with it so that youll have the opportunity to develop your goodness in fullThe goodness that arises from our thoughts words and deeds is something we all haveIts not the case that anyone without any goodness is sitting hereThe question is how we take this goodness and make it even better  making it better here means meditation the goodness accomplished in the area of the mindFor this we have to make an effort to train the mind to be more solid and steadyWe have to make an effort persevere be resilient put the mind through its paces  for who else can train the mind for usWe ourselves are the only ones who can train our own mindsWe have to draw the line to teach ourselvesOnly then will things be able to developOther people can teach you only the outer skin the rind but as for what lies deeper inside only you can lay down the law for yourselfYou have to draw the line being mindful keeping track of what you do at all timesIts like having a teacher following you around in public and in private keeping watch over you alerting you telling what to do and what not to do making sure that you stay in lineIf you dont have this sort of teacher inside you the mind is bound to stray off the path and get into mischief shoplifting all over townThats the way it is with the mindSo we have to draw the line to keep it in placeWe can make it stay in place from morning to noon or from noon to late afternoon  whatever the boundaries we set for it we have to make it stay in line to make it stay in schoolLike a child in a schoolroom we give it directions and set a goal for its work so that the results will be substantial and solidWe have to keep training the mind in line with the path of our practice and as a result itll get gradually more familiar with the work bit by bitItll keep getting more tractable more tame so that it wanders off only occasionally only once in a long long whileItll rarely get lostIf we strap it down too tightly it may struggle to get awaySo we may have to put it on a long leashBut whether you keep it on a slack leash or a tight leash all depends on which technique you find works for youThe strategies needed for training the mind arent the same for everyoneSome people really have to force the mind come down hard on it go without water and foodBut it all comes down to whatever works in keeping the mind within its proper boundsTo summarize our practice is to keep the breath in mindThis is the path our teacher Ajaan Lee set out for us while he was still aliveWe practice staying with the inandout breathWe focus on keeping track of the inandout breathWe watch follow know the inandout breathStay with the breathDont wander offObserve the inandout breath so that its clear so that its completeIf we can maintain this continue keeping this in mind theres no problem  for the breath is always thereIts already coming in going out all day all nightWhether or not we watch it whether or not we focus on it its always there by its very natureAll we have to do is maintain whats already there look after whats already thereActually it sounds pretty easy its not the sort of thing you have to go borrow from anyone else anywhere else at allIts already there already happeningAll you have to do is look after it or keep it in mindAnd you dont have to invest a lot of capitalJust keep the breath in mind gently support and protect whats already developing there so that it becomes more completeIf you do just this youll experience a sense of easeBodily pleasureMental pleasureThe mind will experience peaceSo straighten out your viewsMake them rightIf your views are right the mind will immediately experience a sense of easeIf your views are wrong everything else will immediately be wrong  for the things were talking about are already there already happeningSo keep your views straight in line with the breathYou wont have to exert a lot of energyYoull experience a sense of easeYour mind will immediately feel peaceNow how do you use your powers of observation to get acquainted with the breathAsk yourself Do you know the breath yet or notIs the breath truly there or notIf you cant see whether the breath is true look further in until its clearly thereTheres no trick no mystery to itIts always true right thereThe important thing is whether or not youre trueThen thats all there is to it  this little tiny pointThere arent a lot of complicationsOnce that awareness is true you simply maintain it maintain that truth your truth continuallyKeep it constantly in mind and the developments in the mind will be able to continue developingTheyll gradually grow stronger and the mind will grow calmJust be clear about what youre doingDont have any doubtsIf you can doubt even your own breath then there are no two ways about it Youll doubt everythingNo matter what happens youll be uncertain about itSo being true in this way is what will solve the problem of vicikiccha the Hindrance of uncertaintySo reflect ponder investigate whats going on inside yourself as youre sitting here practicing to see why the mind isnt experiencing any peace why theres no sense of physical or mental pleasureWhy is itWhy is the mind still restless and distractedSet your mind on what youre doingDont let yourself have any doubtsBe straightforward and true in whatever you do for everything comes down to whether or not youre trueSo you have to keep using your powers of observation as much as possibleYou have to get acquainted with your own breath  coming in going out  and make it clearOnce youre clearly acquainted with it then maintain it keep looking after the way it develops keep it in mind at all timesTheres just this one little point in our practiceAll I ask is that you recognize it that youre aware of it for this awareness is already the basis of cognitive skillThe trick is to make it more and more aware more and more developedTo be aware just once isnt enoughYou have to keep becoming more and more aware more and more aware until its totally full  your awareness is totally full with no lapses no gapsIt stays steady and continuous at all timesThats when its called knowing in full measureAjaan Fuang rarely allowed his talks to be taped and he was even more adamant about not allowing anyone to tape his conversationsSomehow though the following conversation was taped with his permissionIn it hes giving advice to some of his students  young women in their late twenties and early thirties  who were being pressured by their parents to settle down get married and start having childrenThere were other occasions on which when asked he gave advice on how to lead a happily married life to any of his students who were planning on marriage but its easy to see from this discussion where his heart really layAjaan Fuang Thats rightGive it a lot of thoughtOnce theres birth there has to be sufferingWeve all suffered in this wayFirst theres your own suffering then you take on the sufferings of othersLook at a babyWhat is itWhere does it come fromThe Buddha says that its suffering it comes from the power of craving and defilementFirst you have to carry it around in your womb then when its born you have to carry it around on your hip and then when it starts to walk you have to lead it by the handWhen you see this sort of thing your heart justStudent WithersAjaan Fuang YesIt withersThis is what gives you a sense of samvegaThis is the sort of thing you want in your practiceIts your teacherThey call it your teacherAsk yourself Is this what you want out of lifeIs this what you want this sort of thing Not reallyThen if you dont want this sort of thing dont get involved How many times have you been through this alreadyThis isnt the first time you knowYouve been doing this holdingcarryingweighingyourselfdown routine for a long long time  hundreds of thousands of eonsIf you keep getting involved theres no way youll get freeBirth aging illness and death these things are normalBirth is the normal way of things agings the normal way of things illness and death are the normal way of thingsGet so that you can see clearly that this is the way things normally areThats when a sense of disenchantment can ariseYoull be able to loosen the grip that these things have on youYoull be able to pull them out root and allWeve suffered as the slaves of defilement and craving for how long nowCan you rememberAsk yourselfCan you remember all youve been throughAnd how much longer are you going to let it keep on happening  this holding and carrying and weighing yourself downHow many eons have you been doing thisTens of thousands hundreds of thousands of eonsCan you count them allOf course you cantAnd how much longer will you have to keep on suffering in this wayIf youre still stubborn still unwilling to listen to the Buddhas teachings this is the kind of reward youll have to expect out of lifeDo you want itDo you like itIf you dont want it then youll have to develop the goodness of your mind so that you can see your way out of this so that you can see your defilements so that you can see the suffering and harm they causeLook at sufferingLook at the rewards of sufferingWhen people feel that we dont have much suffering they find more suffering for usEven just the five aggregates provide us with more than enough suffering  the suffering we have just on our ownSo when they talk about the happiness of taking on another person exactly what happiness is thereNothing but more sufferingTreasures that bring you sufferingOur parents want us to get married to have a spouse and a familyTheyve had plenty of suffering raising us and yet its not enoughHow many children has your mother carried around in her wombAnd now shes looking for more suffering for her childrenStudent Than Phaw is it true what they say that a woman gains of lot of merit in having a child in that she gives someone else the chance to be bornAjaan Fuang If that were true then dogs would get gobs of merit giving birth to whole litters at a timeNo thats just propaganda from those who want to see more and more beings getting born in this worldStudent When people want to get married its because they have a lot of bad karma with each otherIsnt that rightAjaan Fuang Of course thats rightJust look at what theyre doingTheres no need to explainIts nothing but imposing on each other causing each other affliction and painTheres no real happiness there nothing but sufferingGetting married is no way to escape sufferingActually all you do is pile more suffering on yourselfThe Buddha taught that the five aggregates are a heavy burden but if you get married all of a sudden you have ten to worry about and then fifteen and then twentyAnd thats not the end of the matterAs soon as a child is born it comes down with this then comes down with thatIts not the case that from the moment it pops out it doesnt need to take medicine that we can just leave it alone and itll grow day and nightOh all the things you have to do for it until its grownIt starts out so small and can only lie thereThen think of what it needs until it can sit up and then what it needs until it can stand and then what it needs until it can walkWhen was it ever an easy thing raising a childAnd thats not allAs soon as you want to lie down for a little rest it criesYou lie down for a little bit and it criesTheres nothing wonderful about it at allWhen people pressure you to get married and have children its like someone who walks along and steps in a pile of excrement and then tries to figure out how to get other people to step in it too to make up for his own mistakeYes its karma that makes people want to get marriedKarma is what obscures their visionThey cant see that what they want is a form of sufferingTo them its something wonderful  because thats the best they knowThe best they haveThey dont know anything better than thatWhen your parents want you to get married its because thats all they knowGet them to meditate and then theyll realize OhWhat weve been through is suffering To see this sort of thing though you have to meditateIf you dont meditate you wont seeIf you dont meditate youll have to see things the way they doEven when you do meditate you still see things the way they doIts not easy to pull yourself out of that way of thinkingIts not easy at allIf the power of this defilement wont surrender Only when your views are straight and you really let go only then will you be done with the matterEven the devas in heaven theyre still satisfied with their sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensationsTheyre still satisfied with what theyve gotTheyre infatuated with the way they look and sound and smell infatuated with their companionsTheyre tied down to sensuality hand and foot which is why it disturbs them when we meditateTheyre afraid well get awayTheyre determined not to let it happenWhen we meditate and our minds grow still they come and attack stirring us up so that we start turning back in our tracks so that we dont see the right path to release from sufferingThis is called karma that keeps us in the round of samsara the karma we do that makes us fall in line with everyone else so that we dont see the path to release from sufferingAll we can see is the path to staying stuck staying stuck in sufferingStudent In that case then when you think youve found your mate youve really found someone who holds some of your old karma debtsAjaan Fuang What else did you thinkIts like horseshoe crabsHave you ever seen themThey live in the seaEven they have their matesEverywhere they go they go in pairsThe male doesnt know how to feed itself so it rides on the back of the femaleStudent So how can we escape thisWe can avoid this cant we Than Phaw if we really want toAjaan Fuang If you dont want this sort of thing then dont let any horseshoe crabs catch hold of youAfter all its just an animal instinctAnimals have to mate in order to spread their species their influenceBut if we dont want to have a part in that we just dont get involvedYour mate can demand repayment on your old karma debts only if you get involvedStudent Can you really escapeAjaan Fuang Why shouldnt you be able to escapeJust dont get involved dont get attachedTry to keep your mind strong and dont waverDevelop your perfections so that theyre greater and greater and these other desires will just wither awayTheyre really shallow you know and nothing but sufferingThey come about because were attracted to our own bodies but when you get an image of yourself in meditation just take it apartTake it apart and then whats leftAnythingNothing at allIts all in the formWhen you take the form apart theres nothing leftAnd what substance is there in the formLook at itTake it apartTheres nothing but earth water wind and fireIs there anything to be attracted to thenStudent No nothingAjaan Fuang And when youre sound asleepDoes the body know anything of desireStudent No not at allAjaan Fuang The mind is the instigatorThe body on its own doesnt have anything to doIt simply acts under the orders of its boss the mindThe body doesnt know a thingIt depends on the boss ordersSo when the boss says EnoughNo more then thats the end of the matterThe mind doesnt struggle or thirstWhat struggles and thirsts is the aggregate of fabricationIf you latch on to fabrication thats the essence of suffering  bigtime sufferingIf you look at the body youll see that there really are no issues thereThe issues all come from fabricationIf the mind can break through and understand this attachment to the body then where else will desire come fromThe body isnt really oursWherever you see anything thats yours uproot it take it apart and let it goTake it apart the earth the water the wind the fireThats all theres been to it all along since who knows whenThats all there is to it nowThe problem is that weve been deluded about it and so weve latched onto itWeve been deluded just like everyone elseDeep down doesnt the mind already know thisOf course it knows for thats the nature of the mind to knowWe have to knowSo bring this knowledge in and take it to heartYou have to be your own refuge you knowIf youre the sort that has to take refuge in other people then youll have to see things the same way they do which means you have to be stupid the same way they areSo pull yourself out of all that and take a good look at yourself until things are clear within youKeep contemplating things until theres just the knower insideThis knower isnt paired with anything elseIt doesnt have a mateIts singleIts oneIt doesnt have anythingSo focus in on the knower and make it oneGet so that it lets go of everythingIt lets go of pleasure lets go of pain lets go of equanimityIts bright all on its ownKeep focused there until theres nothing left but a state of onenessThen ask yourself is it male or femaleTheres no male or female in there at allIt doesnt place labels on anythingAnd when youve gotten there thats the end of those issuesThose who get stuck on mental phenomena are called BrahmasOnce they reach this point in their practice The devas in their heavens still have their mates but the Brahmas have no interest in sights smells sounds tastes tactile sensationsTheyre content in their onenessWere told that if we listen well we gain discernmentIf we dont listen well we wont gain any discernmentIn terms of the Buddhas teachings listening well means that the mind has to be centered and firmly intentSuccess depends on our minds being firmly intentIf were not intent there wont be any success  we wont succeed in attaining the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana in the way they did in the pastIn the past they listened for just an instant and succeeded in attaining nibbanaWhy was thatBecause they listened wellThey gained discernmentThey understoodIn other words they took it to heartNowadays we study all kinds of things  going abroad to study studying many many fields of knowledge  but it doesnt lead to release from sufferingIt just leads back into the world of conventional truths and wandering onWe already know a lot but if we want to listen well in the way that leads to discernment the mind has to be stillHow do we make it stillOfferings weve already givenThe precepts weve already taken against killing against stealing against illicit sex against lying against intoxicantsAnd now its up to us as to whether well keep them or notThe rewards of keeping the precepts you know go all the way to nibbanaThe attainment of the human state the attainment of the heavenly state the attainment of nibbana are all results of keeping the preceptsThats what were toldNext comes meditation making the mind centered firmly intentThis is the duty of each and every one of usYou have to make a mental effort to look after the mindIts a subtle thing not blatant at allIts subtle  but it lies within usLots of teachers have come through here teaching you to think buddho or buddho dhammo sanghoYou have to keep recollecting these things until the mind gets firmly centeredThe reason the mind isnt yet firmly centered in concentration is because you go centering it outsideIts centered inside just a bit and then goes stretching outsideIt wont stay centered insideAnd when this is the case you find it hard to listen wellSo you have to try to listen wellMake the mind firmly centeredYou listen with your mind not just with your earsYou listen with your mindWhen the mind is firmly centered you gain discernmentUnderstandingTotal comprehensionIn the past they listened for just a little bit and they understoodThey became streamwinners oncereturners nonreturners and arahantsSo focus your minds on meditatingMake the mind stillLet it calm down from its outside preoccupationsOutside preoccupations are all around usLet your eyes and ears be stillOur ears keep on hearing so how can they be quietWere the ones who arent quietWe keep giving rise to things that go flowing out the ears and eyesWe keep making contactSo were told to make the mind quietMake it centeredWe have to be mindful keeping the breath in mindSoSit and meditate right nowFocus on your breathClose your eyes and focus on your breathClose your eyes and think bud with the inbreath dho with the outBud in dho outTrain the mindAnd listenIf you simply listen without doing the training nothing will developWhen youve listened thats not the end of itYou have to listen and do it as wellWhat this means is that when youve listened you have to do it right then and there so that you can gain some benefits from listeningOnly then will you gain the skillfulness that you hope for that you wantWhen the mind is centered and you understand it leads to merit and skillWhen the mind is still you see what they mean by merit you reach what they mean by merit Its not the least bit hardIf the mind isnt centered its pretty hardSo fix the mind firmly on nothing but the inandout breathObserve the breathIs there an inbreathAn outbreathIts something we all have within each and every one of usThis treasure is already thereThe inbreath is thereThe outbreath is thereSo we have to bring our powers of observation inside the bodyKeep this breath in mindDont go wandering off far okayLook at whats already there inside youYou have a valuable treasure within you  the treasure of being a human beingSo you have to look after this treasure until it grows more complete until it becomes the treasure of the heavenly realms the treasure of nibbanaLook after this treasureIts hard to look after if you dont know how to use it if you dont know how to take care of itIf youre not discerning this treasure can turn into a liability  theres no need to doubt itSo what can we do when were not yet discerningThere are all kinds of dangers that can make us fall away from this treasureThis is why we have to develop the skills needed to take care of it  in other words observing the five precepts and keeping the mind firmly centered on the inandout breathKeep the mind firmly centeredKeep watch over the breath continuallyKeep after it continually making sure that the inbreath is comfortable the outbreath is comfortableWhen we do this were looking after our treasureWhen we look after it mindfully nothing will threaten itIf anything comes our way well know in advanceWell be able to look after our treasure for the rest of our livesOr well be able to increase it add to it so that it becomes the treasure of the heavenly realms the treasure of nibbanaIt all comes from this one spot right hereIt comes from the breathIf we can take care of it and keep it firm itll take us to the treasure of the human state the treasure of the heavenly realms all the way to the treasure of nibbanaNow its only natural that doing this will require persistenceEffortPatience and enduranceOnly then will we arrive at our goalIf were diligent and persistent were sure to succeed just like the great ajaans just like the BuddhaThey reached the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana through endurance diligence and persistenceThats how the Buddha became the Buddha we worship and bow down to every dayWhy do we bow down to himBecause he exerted the kind of effort and persistence that enabled him to gain omniscience to become the mainstay for all beings human and divineThe same principle holds true for usOnce weve set our minds on developing our treasures  our noble wealth our inner wealth as well as our outer wealth  we have take good care of this spot the breathWe have to train the heart so that its firmly centered and established staying with the breath at all times every dayActually the breath is already always thereIf it werent there wed be finishedThe breath has been with us ever since the day of our birth but the mind hasnt looked after it hasnt taken care of itIn other words it hasnt looked after its guardian hasnt even been acquainted with its guardian from birthThis guardian has looked after us all along you know from the time we came out of our mothers womb up until nowIf this guardian hadnt been attentive in caring for us wed be deadFinishedSo we shouldnt forget the good that shes done usLook to see what kind of person she is What does she look likeWhat are her featuresIs she warm or coldShort or longFocus on seeing what kind of person she is to see why shes been so goodheartedShes been looking after us all the way up until now even though we arent acquainted with her havent paid her any attention at all to see how shes getting along what her needs areWeve never looked after her at allSo lets give her some thoughtLook to see what shes like when she comes in what shes like when she goes outKeep track of herPay her some attentionBe observantReflect on what you seeThat way youll see that the inbreath is there the outbreath is thereThen its up to you sit here and keep this awareness goingKeep the breath going comfortablyNotice is the inbreath comfortableIs the outbreath comfortableIf the inbreath and outbreath are comfortable keep them going that wayIf theyre not comfortable we can change themYou might try in long and out short depending on what you notice feels goodIf long breathing isnt comfortable you can change to shortOr if short breathing isnt comfortable you can change to longIn other words gain a sense of how to adjust things so that theyre comfortableIf youre well acquainted with the breath you can adjust itIf youre not acquainted with the breath how will you be able to adjust itSo first we have to get acquainted with it to see the features of the breath already coming in and going out of the bodyWhats it like when it comes inWhats it like when it goes outWhen we can clearly observe it when its comfortable then we keep after it keep it going continuallyWell find that our guardian grows more goodhearted and kindWhen our guardian is goodhearted our heart will grow good as wellWhy is thatIts the same as when we live with goodhearted people our heart feels good tooWhen our guardian is goodhearted our heart will keep on being goodThe Buddha taught asevana ca balanam panditanañca sevana when you associate with fools When our heart sours its as if we associate with fools  fools inside usWhen the heart is good its because we have good friends  panditanañca  withinWhen the mind has a good friend as its guardian within it will grow bright open and refreshedIt will gain in mindfulness and discernmentWhatever we think of doing wont be for the purpose of harming ourselves or othersSo keep your mind firmly established in this way because youve got a good friend a guardian who will keep giving you good adviceThe mind will experience brightness and clarity throughout the day the month the year all the way until theres no more inandout breathingSo keep looking after your guardian until you breathe your lastIf the mind is in really good shape youll go all the way to nibbanaIf thats what you want you have to make an effort to study and train a lot keep after it for its a skill that arises only from within youIts your own direct refugeIn gaining this skill you have to depend on yourselfThe Buddha taught us to train ourselves that we have to be strict with ourselvesOur parents brothers and sisters our teachers these are simply people with whom we associate for a short whileBut if were really earnest really intent we have to depend on ourselvesThats what the Buddha taughtWhen he had taught living beings to take themselves as their own refuge he was able to teach them to reach the paths and fruitions leading to nibbanaWhen he taught them they took his teachings inward  opanayiko  to contemplate and then to put into practice so that they saw in line with the DhammaSo we should train ourselves to be better and better every day every night for this is our very own affairYou can say that the practice of the Dhamma is hard and it isYou can say that its easy and it is for the breath is right here within usIts our very own affairIt all depends on whether you want to do it or notIf you dont train yourself arent strict with yourself then you wont make progressIf you train yourself are strict with yourself then you will  every day every nightYou start out with your parents and teachersThey teach you how to talk how to eat how to sit up how to walk all kinds of thingsEver since you came out crying how long has it beenThey trained you for months and then years kept on training youYou depended on your parents to train youYou couldnt sit up you couldnt walk and so they taught you howYou couldnt talk so they kept teaching you howYou gradually became more and more skilled more and more intelligentYouve depended on your parents as your first teachers to teach you and advise you to the point where youre grownNow its your own dutyYoure adultsIts your own duty to train yourself to be strict with yourselfIts all up to youWhether youre to be good or bad to rise or fall its all up to youIf you dont train yourself and just let things follow their course whos going to sufferYou willThe things we have to practice are all already within usSo we have to be selective in looking at the heart to make it firmly centered withinWe have to realize that weve already got wealthWere human beingsAggathanam manussesu the supreme status is in the human stateBeing supreme in this way isnt something easily gained you knowTo be born as a human being and to meet with the Buddhas teachings is hardThere are a lot of beings out there who dont make it hereSo we already have a treasure we already have wealthIts now up to us to develop that treasure into the treasure of the heavenly realms the treasure of nibbanaIts not all that hardFor those who dont have this treasure  spirits angry demons hungry ghosts  its hardThey want to do good but they cantWhy notBecause they dont have any bodiesThey dont have any wealthThey want to do good along with everyone else but they cantSo they have to wander around begging from people here and there trying to get a message through by possessing this person and that telling them to do goodThey themselves want to do good but they cantBack when they were human beings they didnt want to do goodHaving gained the human state they were lazy eating and sleeping sleeping and eating letting the days pass by pass bySo we have to take time out every day to give some value to our livesIf human beings had a sense of how to give value to their lives  even just for an hour a day every day The important thing is that you not be complacentBe intent on accelerating your effortsWhatever goodness you should develop should realize should master should perfect make an effort to give rise to itGive the heart something to hold toWhen the heart has something firm to hold to its not put to any difficultiesSo be as intent as you can on not being complacentThe Buddha told us to accelerate our effortsWhatever goodness you havent yet developed in your actions go ahead and develop itWhatever goodness you havent yet developed in your words go ahead and develop itWhatever goodness you havent yet developed in the area of the mind you should accelerate your efforts and build it up within yourself as the treasure of the human stateThat way when you die and leave this human realm you wont have to beg for anything from anyone else because youve already provided for yourselfWhat you have is perfectly complete with nothing lacking in any way at allThis is why those who know accelerate their effortsWhen were born into the human realm were born into a realm thats abundant in every waySo when those who know are born here they waste no time and make every effort to build up their perfections even furtherLike the Buddha  think about it for four incalculable periods and one hundred thousand aeons he kept returning to this human realm to build up his perfections taking birth again and again growing old growing sick and dying again and againFourIncalculablesDo you have any idea how long that isTwentyeight beings have completed their perfections to the point of becoming BuddhasEach perfection of each Buddha has to be totally complete in every wayIf you were to take all the treasures of the human realm theyd still be no match for the perfections of the BuddhaHe was born for the sake of perfection to build his perfectionsThat was his aimWhatever he was born as it was always for the sake of his perfections for the sake of the knowledge of AwakeningThat was why he kept swimming around in samsara dying and taking birth dying and taking birth dying and taking birth over and over againHe kept on building up his perfections until he succeeded in gaining Awakening in line with his aimsThe same with his disciples they all were born for the sake of building up their perfectionsSo how about usWhat are the perfections weve been born forWhy havent we accelerated our efforts to give rise to somethingWhy havent we aimed our sights higherAsk yourself what do you aim forWhat are your aspirationsWhen you have an aspiration work to fulfil itBring it into being in line with your aimsEven if you dont succeed in this lifetime youre forming the habits the requisite conditions for the next life so that theyre tempered and strong so that theyll keep on growing higher and higher with every lifetime  because you keep adding to them with every lifetimeIn that way youll be able to succeedWhen we come into this world we have to know within ourselves what weve come forWhat were we born forWhat were we born forWere born to build up our goodness so we should hurry up and develop our goodness and make it a realityJust like the Buddha and his disciples They werent complacentNo matter where they were born they were born for perfectionThey didnt get infatuated with the affairs of worldly treasuresNo matter how much worldly pleasure they experienced they werent satisfiedAs soon as they had the opportunity they left home to practice the holy life in order to continue building up their perfections in line with their aimsAs for us as soon as we experience a little bit of pleasure we get stuck on it addicted to itAnd so we arent willing to go anywhereEven with just little pleasures we get satisfied with the way things areThese pleasures are really tricky you know  these human pleasuresTheyre called sensual pleasureSensual pleasure is like a drug One taste and you get addictedThey say that with heroin its hard to break the habit but this is even worseIt goes deep right into the boneIts what made us get born in the first place and has kept us circling through birth and death for aeons and aeonsTheres no medicine you can take to break the habit to wash it out of your system aside from the medicine of the Buddhas teachingsOnly when you use the Buddhas teachings will your addiction to these pleasures gradually loosen gradually lighten gradually fade awayOnly then will you be done with the poison of this intoxicantThats what it is sensual intoxicationWe live with sensual intoxicationIts really fierceIts what keeps us swimming around in death and rebirthThink about itThink about itHuman beings common animals theyre all in the same boatNo matter where youre born in the sensual realm even those who are born in the heavenly realm are still addictedEven in the heavenly realms theyre not done with itAs soon as you escape from the human realm you get stuck in the heavenly realmsSo as long as we dont use the medicine of the Buddhas teachings to cut through this addiction to drive it out well have to keep on swimming through death and rebirth going and coming back the way we are right now with never a chance to put an end to itThis is why those who know have ears have eyes have discernmentThey listen well and gain discernmentThats why they see through everythingThey contemplate all fabricated things and see right through themThats why theyre able to destroy becoming and birth so that they no longer have to keep swimming through death and rebirthThey let go of all stress and suffering all difficulties and hardships and enter nibbanaThey abandon all fabrications without leaving a trace and go straight to nibbanaThe Buddha and his disciples have all succeeded in this way washing away all states of becoming and birth so that they dont have to come back and suffer in this human world ever againSo we should all set our hearts on making the mind into a firm foundation that we can hold to as much as possibleIf you cant yet hold to it then do what you need to so that you canThere are lots of people who are ashamed to talk about their own defilements but who feel no shame at talking about the defilements of othersThose who are willing to report their own diseases  their own defilements  in a straightforward manner are few and far betweenAs a result the disease of defilement is hushed up and kept secret so that we dont realize how serious and widespread it isWe all suffer from it and yet no one is open about itNo one is really interested in diagnosing his or her own defilementsWe have to find a skillful approach if we hope to wipe out this disease and we have to be open about it admitting our defilements from the grossest to the most subtle levels dissecting them down to their minutest detailsOnly then will we gain from our practiceIf we look at ourselves in a superficial way we may feel that were already fine just as we are already know all we need to knowBut then when the defilements let loose with full force as anger or delusion we pretend that nothing is wrong  and this way the defilements become a hidden disease hard to catch hold of hard to diagnoseWe have to be strong in fighting off defilements cravings and illusions of every sortWe have to test our strength against them and bring them under our powerIf we can bring them under our power we can ride on their backsIf we cant theyll have to ride on our backs making us do their work pulling us around by the nose making us want wearing us out in all sorts of waysSo are we still beasts of burdenAre we beasts of burden because defilement and craving are riding on our backsHave they put a ring through our nosesWhen you get to the point when youve had enough you have to stop  stop and watch the defilements to see how they come into being what they want what they eat what they find deliciousMake it your sport  watching the defilements and making them starve like a person giving up an addiction See if it gets the defilements upsetDo they hunger to the point where theyre salivatingThen dont let them eatNo matter what dont let them eat what theyre addicted toAfter all there are plenty of other things to eatYou have to be hard on them  hard on your self  like this HungryWell go ahead and be hungryYoure going to dieFineGo ahead and die If you can take this attitude youll be able to win out over all sorts of addictions all sorts of defilements  because youre not pandering to desire youre not nourishing the desire that exists for the sake of finding flavor in physical thingsIts time you stopped time you gave up feeding these thingsIf theyre going to waste away and die let them dieAfter all why should you keep them fat and well fedNo matter what you have to keep putting the heat on your cravings and defilements until they wither and waste awayDont let them raise their headsKeep them under your thumbThis is the sort of straightforward practice you have to followIf youre steadfast if you put up a persistent fight until theyre all burned away then theres no other victory that can come anywhere near no other victory thats anywhere near a match for victory over the cravings and defilements in your own heartThis is why the Buddha taught us to put the heat on the defilements in all our activities  sitting standing walking and lying downIf we dont do this theyll burn us in all our activitiesIf you consider things carefully youll see that the Buddhas teachings are all exactly right both in how they tell us to examine the diseases of defilement and in how they tell us to let go destroy and extinguish defilementAll the steps are there so we neednt go study anywhere elseEvery point in his doctrine and discipline shows us the way so we neednt wonder how we can go about examining and doing away with these diseasesThis becomes mysterious and hard to know only if you study his teachings without making reference to doing away with your own defilementsPeople dont like to talk about their own defilements so they end up completely ignorantThey grow old and die without knowing a thing about their own defilements at allWhen we start to practice when we come to comprehend how the defilements burn our own hearts thats when we gradually come to know ourselvesTo understand suffering and defilement and learn how to extinguish defilement gives us space to breatheWhen we learn how to put out the fires of defilement how to destroy them it means we have toolsWe can be confident in ourselves  no doubts no straying off into other paths of practice because were sure to see that practicing in this way contemplating inconstancy stress and notselfness in this way at all times really gets rid of our defilementsThe same holds true with virtue concentration and discernmentTheyre our tools  and we need a full setWe need the discernment that comes with Right View and the virtue that comes with selfdisciplineVirtue is very importantVirtue and discernment are like our right and left handsIf one of our hands is dirty it cant wash itselfYou need to use both hands to keep both hands washed and cleanThus wherever theres virtue you have to have discernmentWherever theres discernment you have to have virtueDiscernment is what enables you to know virtue is what enables you to let go to relinquish to destroy your addictionsVirtue isnt just a matter of the five or eight precepts you knowIt has to deal with the finest detailsWhatever your discernment sees as a cause of suffering you have to stop you have to let goVirtue is something that gets very subtle and preciseLetting go giving up renouncing abstaining cutting away and destroying All of these things are an affair of virtueThis is why virtue and discernment have to go together just as our right and left hands have to help each otherThey help each other wash away defilementThats when your mind can become centered bright and clearThese things show their benefits right at the mindIf we dont have these tools its as if we had no hands or feet We wouldnt be able to get anywhere at allWe have to use our tools  virtue and discernment  to destroy defilementThats when our minds will benefitThis is why the Buddha taught us to keep training in virtue concentration and discernmentWe have to keep fit in training these thingsIf we dont keep up the training as we should our tools for extinguishing suffering and defilement wont be sharp wont be of much useThey wont be a match for the defilementsThe defilements have monstrous powers for burning the mind in the twinkling of an eyeSay that the mind is quiet and neutral The slightest sensory contact can set things burning in an instant by making us pleased or displeasedWhySensory contact is our measuring stick for seeing how firm or weak our mindfulness isMost of the time it stirs things upAs soon as theres contact by way of the ear or eye the defilements are very quickWhen this is the case how can we keep things under controlHow are we going to gain control over our eyesHow are be going to gain control over our ears nose tongue body and mindHow can we get mindfulness and discernment in charge of these thingsThis is a matter of practice pure and simple our own affair something by which we can test ourselves to see why defilements flare up so quickly when sensory contact takes placeSay for instance that we hear a person criticizing someone elseWe can listen and not get upsetBut say that the thought occurs to us Shes actually criticizing me As soon as we conjure up this me were immediately angry and displeasedIf we concoct very much of this me we can get very upsetJust this fact alone should enable us to observe that as soon as our self gets involved we suffer immediatelyThis is how it happensIf no sense of self comes out to get involved we can remain calm and indifferentWhen they criticize other people we can stay indifferent but as soon as we conclude that theyre criticizing us our self appears and immediately gets involved  and we immediately burn with defilementWhyYou have to pay close attention to thisAs soon as your self arises suffering arises in the very same instantThe same holds true even if youre just thinkingThe self you think up spreads out into all sorts of issuesThe mind gets scattered all over the place with defilement craving and attachmentsIt has very little mindfulness and discernment watching over it so it gets dragged every which way by craving and defilementAnd yet we dont realize itWe think were just fineIs there anyone among us who realizes that this is whats happeningWere too weighted down weighted down with our own delusionsNo matter how much the mind is smothered in the defilement of delusion we dont realize it for it keeps us deaf and blindThere are no physical tools you can use to detect or cure this disease of defilement because it arises only at sensory contactTheres no substance to itIts like a match in a matchboxAs long as the match doesnt come into contact with the friction strip on the side of the box it wont give rise to fireBut as soon as we strike it against the side of the box it bursts into flameIf it goes out right then all that gets burned is the matchheadIf it doesnt stop at the matchhead itll burn the matchstickIf it doesnt stop with the matchstick and meets up with anything flammable it can grow into an enormous fireWhen defilement arises in the mind it starts from the slightest contactIf we can be quick to put it out right there its like striking a match that flares up  chae  for an instant and then dies down right in the matchheadThe defilement disbands right thereBut if we dont put it out the instant it arises and let it start concocting issues its like pouring fuel into a fireWe have to observe the diseases of defilement in our own minds to see what their symptoms are why theyre so quick to flare upThey cant stand to be disturbedThe minute you disturb them they flare up into flameWhen this is the case what can we do to prepare ourselves beforehandHow can we stock up on mindfulness before sensory contact strikesThe way to stock up is to practice meditation as when we keep the breath in mindThis is what gets our mindfulness prepared so that we can keep ahead of defilement so that we can keep it from arising as long as we have our theme of meditation as an inner shelter for the mindThe minds outer shelter is the body which is composed of physical elements but its inner shelter is the theme of meditation we use to train its mindfulness to be focused and awareWhatever theme we use thats the inner shelter for the mind that keeps it from wandering around concocting thoughts and imaginingsThis is why we need a theme of meditationDont let the mind chase after its preoccupations the way ordinary people who dont meditate doOnce we have a meditation theme to catch this monkey of a mind so that it becomes less and less willful day by day it will gradually calm down calm down until it can stand firm for long or short periods depending on how much we train and observe ourselvesNow as for how we do breath meditation The texts say to breathe in long and out long  heavy or light  and then to breathe in short and out short again heavy or lightThose are the first steps of the trainingAfter that we dont have to focus on the length of the inbreath or outbreathInstead we simply gather our awareness at any one point of the breath and keep this up until the mind settles down and is stillWhen the mind is still you then focus on the stillness of the mind at the same time youre aware of the breathAt this point you dont focus directly on the breathYou focus on the mind that is still and at normalcyYou focus continuously on the normalcy of the mind at the same time that youre aware of the breath coming in and out without actually focusing on the breathYou simply stay with the mind but you watch it with each inandout breathUsually when you are doing physical work and your mind is at normalcy you can know what youre doing so why cant you be aware of the breathAfter all its part of the bodySome of you are new at this which is why you dont know how you can focus on the mind at normalcy with each inandout breath without focusing directly on the breath itselfWhat were doing here is practicing how to be aware of the body and mind pure and simple in and of themselvesStart out by focusing on the breath for about or minutesBreathe in long and out long or in short and out shortAt the same time notice the stages in how the mind feels how it begins to settle down when you have mindfulness watching over the breathYouve got to make a point of observing this because usually you breathe out of habit with your attention far awayYou dont focus on the breath youre not really aware of itThis leads you to think that its hard to stay focused here but actually its quite simpleAfter all the breath comes in and out on its own by its very natureTheres nothing at all difficult about breathingIts not like other themes of meditationFor instance if youre going to practice recollection of the Buddha or buddho you have to keep on repeating buddho buddho buddhoActually if you want you can repeat buddho in the mind with each inandout breath but only in the very beginning stagesYou repeat buddho to keep the mind from concocting thoughts about other thingsSimply by keeping up this repetition you can weaken the minds tendency to stray for the mind can take on only one object at a timeThis is something you have to observeThe repetition is to prevent the mind from thinking up thoughts and clambering after themAfter youve kept up the repetition  you dont have to count the number of times  the mind will settle down to be aware of the breath with each inandout breathIt will begin to be still neutral at normalcyThis is when you focus on the mind instead of the breathLet go of the breath and focus on the mind  but still be aware of the breath on the sideYou dont have to make note of how long or short the breath isMake note of the mind staying at normalcy with each inandout breathRemember this carefully so that you can put it into practiceThe posture For focusing on the breath sitting is a better posture than standing walking or lying down because the sensations that come with the other postures often overcome the sensations of the breathWalking jolts the body around too much standing for a long time can make you tired and if the mind settles down when youre lying down you tend to fall asleepWith sitting its possible to stay in one position and keep the mind firmly settled for a long period of timeYou can observe the subtleties of the breath and the mind naturally and automaticallyHere Id like to condense the steps of breath meditation to show how all four of the tetrads mentioned in the texts can be practiced at onceIn other words is it possible to focus on the body feelings the mind and the Dhamma all in one sittingThis is an important question for all of usYou could if you wanted to precisely follow all the steps in the texts so as to develop strong powers of mental absorption but it takes a lot of timeIts not appropriate for those of us who are old and have only a little time leftWhat we need is a way of gathering our awareness at the breath long enough to make the mind firm and then go straight to examining how all formations are inconstant stressful and notself so that we can see the truth of all formations with each inandout breathIf you can keep at this continually without break your mindfulness will become firm and snug enough for you to give rise to the discernment that will enable you to gain clear knowledge and visionSo what follows is a guide to the steps in practicing a condensed form of breath meditation Give them a try until you find they give rise to knowledge of your own within youYoure sure to give rise to knowledge of your very ownThe first thing when youre going to meditate on the breath is to sit straight and keep your mindfulness firmBreathe inBreathe outMake the breath feel open and at easeDont tense your hands your feet or any of your joints at allYou have to keep your body in a posture that feels appropriate to your breathingAt the beginning breathe in long and out long fairly heavily and gradually the breath will shorten  sometimes heavy and sometimes lightThen breathe in short and out short for about or minutes and then changeAfter a while when you stay focused mindfully on it the breath will gradually changeWatch it change for as many minutes as you like then be aware of the whole breath all of its subtle sensationsThis is the third step the third step of the first tetrad sabbakayapatisamvedi  focusing on how the breath affects the whole body by watching all the breath sensations in all the various parts of the body and in particular the sensations related to the inandout breathFrom there you focus on the sensation of the breath at any one pointWhen you do this correctly for a fairly long while the body  the breath  will gradually grow stillThe mind will grow calmIn other words the breath grows still together with the awareness of the breathWhen the subtleties of the breath grow still at the same time that your undistracted awareness settles down the breath grows even more stillAll the sensations in the body gradually grow more and more stillThis is the fourth step the stilling of bodily formationsAs soon as this happens you begin to be aware of the feelings that arise with the stilling of the body and mindWhether they are feelings of pleasure or rapture or whatever they appear clearly enough for you to contemplate themThe stages through which you have already passed  watching the breath come in and out long or short  should be enough to make you realize  even though you may not have focused on the idea  that the breath is inconstantIts continually changing from in long and out long to in short and out short from heavy to light and so forthThis should enable you to read the breath to understand that theres nothing constant to it at allIt changes on its own from one moment to the nextOnce you have realized the inconstancy of the body  in other words of the breath  youll be able to see the subtle sensations of pleasure and pain in the realm of feelingSo now you watch feelings right there in the same place where youve been focusing on the breathEven though they are feelings that arise from the stillness of the body or mind theyre nevertheless inconstant even in that stillnessThey can changeSo these changing sensations in the realm of feeling exhibit inconstancy in and of themselves just like the breathWhen you see change in the body change in feelings and change in the mind this is called seeing the Dhamma ie seeing inconstancyYou have to understand this correctlyPracticing the first tetrad of breath meditation contains all four tetrads of breath meditationIn other words you see the inconstancy of the body and then contemplate feelingYou see the inconstancy of feeling and then contemplate the mindThe mind too is inconstantThis inconstancy of the mind is the DhammaTo see the Dhamma is to see this inconstancyWhen you see the true nature of all inconstant things then keep track of that inconstancy at all times with every inandout breathKeep this up in all your activities to see what happens nextWhat happens next is dispassionLetting goThis is something you have to know for yourselfThis is what condensed breath meditation is likeI call it condensed because it contains all the steps at onceYou dont have to do one step at a timeSimply focus at one point the body and youll see the inconstancy of the bodyWhen you see the inconstancy of the body youll have to see feelingFeeling will have to show its inconstancyThe minds sensitivity to feeling or its thoughts and imaginings are also inconstantAll of these things keep on changingThis is how you know inconstancyIf you can become skilled at looking and knowing in this way youll be struck with the inconstancy stressfulness and notselfness of your self and youll meet with the genuine DhammaThe Dhamma thats constantly changing like a burning fire  burning with inconstancy stress and notselfness  is the Dhamma of the impermanence of all formationsBut further in in the mind or in the property of consciousness is something special beyond the reach of any kind of fireThere theres no suffering or stress of any kind at allThis thing that lies inside You could say that it lies within the mind but it isnt really in the mindIts simply that the contact is there at the mindTheres no way you can really describe itOnly the extinguishing of all defilement will lead you to know it for yourselfThis something special within exists by its very nature but defilements have it surrounded on all sidesAll these counterfeit things  the defilements  keep getting in the way and take possession of everything so that this special nature remains imprisoned inside at all timesActually theres nothing in the dimension of time that can be compared with itTheres nothing by which you can label it but its something that you can pierce through to see  ie by piercing through defilement craving and attachment into the state of mind that is pure bright and silentThis is the only thing thats importantBut it doesnt have only one levelThere are many levels from the outer bark to the inner bark and on to the sapwood before you reach the heartwoodThe genuine Dhamma is like the heartwood but theres a lot to the mind that isnt heartwood The roots the branches and leaves of the tree are more than many but theres only a little heartwoodThe parts that arent heartwood will gradually decay and disintegrate but the heartwood doesnt decayThats one kind of comparison we can makeIts like a tree that dies standingThe leaves fall away the branches rot away the bark and sapwood rot away leaving nothing but the true heartwoodThats one comparison we can make with this thing we call deathless this property that has no birth no death no changingWe can also call it nibbana or the UnconditionedIts all the same thingNow thenIsnt this something worth trying to break through to seeThe production manager would like to thank Venerable Ajahn Puriso the translator who kindly not only revised the text for this edition but also helped with the final proof readingThis book has come into existence with the help of many devoted peopleKhun Vanee Lamsam along with her brother Khun Parl Na Pombejra raised the Fund to support all costs of publicationKhun Thanu Malakul Na Ayudhaya supplied us a slide of his beautiful

invaluable photograph of Luang Por ChahKhun Karoon Hansachainand helped with the pasting some parts of the artwork and saw the book through the pressMay the kind meritorious deeds of the abovementioned people help them experience the supreme bliss NibbanaThe talks translated in this book were all taken from old cassette tape recordings of Venerable Ajahn Chah some in Thai and some in the NorthEastern dialect most recorded on poor quality equipment under less than optimum conditionsThis presented some difficulty in the work of translation which was overcome by occasionally omitting very unclear passages and at other times asking for advice from other listeners more familiar with those languagesNevertheless there has inevitably been some editing in the process of making this bookApart from the difficulties presented by the lack of clarity of the tapes there is also the necessity of editing when one is taking words from the spoken to the written mediumFor this the translator takes full responsibilityPali words have occasionally been left as they are in other cases translatedThe criteria here has been readabilityThose Pali words which were considered short enough or familiar enough to the reader already conversant with Buddhist terminology have generally been left untranslatedThis should present no difficulty as they are generally explained by the Venerable Ajahn in the course of the talkLonger words or words considered to be probably unfamiliar to the average reader have been translatedOf these there are two which are particularly noteworthyThey are Kamasukhallikanuyogo and Attakilamathanuyogo which have been translated as Indulgence in Pleasure and Indulgence in Pain respectivelyThese two words occur in no less than five of the talks included in this book and although the translations provided here are not those generally used for these word they are nevertheless in keeping with the Venerable Ajahns use of themVenerable Ajahn Chah always gave his talks in simple everyday languageHis objective was to clarify the Dhamma not to confuse his listeners with an overlog of informationConsequently the talks presented here have been rendered into correspondingly simple EnglishThe aim has been to present Ajahn Chahs teaching in both the spirit and the letterIn this third printing of A Taste of Freedom a number of corrections have been made to clumsily worded passages of which there are now hopefully less than in the first editionsFor such inadequacies the translator must also take responsibility and hopes the reader will bear with any literary shortcomings in order to receive the full benefit of the teachings contained hereinThe translatorAbout this mind In truth there is nothing really wrong with itIt is intrinsically pureWithin itself its already peacefulThat the mind is not peaceful these days is because it follows moodsThe real mind doesnt have anything to it it is simply NatureIt becomes peaceful or agitated because moods deceive itThe untrained mind is stupidSense impressions come and trick it into happiness suffering gladness and sorrow but the minds true nature is none of those thingsThat gladness or sadness is not the mind but only a mood coming to deceive usThe untrained mind gets lost and follows these things it forgets itselfThen we think that it is we who are upset or at ease or whateverBut really this mind of ours is already unmoving and peaceful really peacefulJust like a leaf which is still as long as no wind blowsIf a wind comes up the leaf fluttersThe fluttering is due to the wind  the fluttering is due to those sense impressions the mind follows themIf it doesnt follow them it doesnt flutter If we know fully the true nature of sense impressions we will be unmovedOur practice is simply to see the Original MindSo we must train the mind to know those sense impressions and not get lost in themTo make it peacefulJust this is the aim of all this difficult practice we put ourselves throughTo calm the mind means to find the right balanceIf you try to force your mind too much it goes too far if you dont try enough it doesnt get there it misses the point of balanceNormally the mind isnt still its moving all the time it lacks strengthMaking the mind strong and making the body strong are not the sameTo make the body strong we have to exercise it to push it in order to make it strong but to make the mind strong means to make it peaceful not to go thinking of this and thatFor most of us the mind has never been peaceful it has never had the energy of samadhi so we establish it within a boundaryWe sit in meditation staying with the One who knowsIf we force our breath to be too long or too short were not balanced the mind wont become peacefulIts like when we first start to use a pedal sewing machineAt first we just practice pedaling the machine to get our coordination right before we actually sew anythingFollowing the breath is similarWe dont get concerned over how long or short weak or strong it is we just note itWe simply let it be following the natural breathingWhen its balanced we take the breathing as our meditation objectWhen we breathe in the beginning of the breath is at the nose tip the middle of the breath at the chest and the end of the breath at the abdomenThis is the path of the breathWhen we breathe out the beginning of the breath is at the abdomen the middle at the chest and the end at the nose tipWe simply take note of this path of the breath at the nose tip the chest and the abdomen then at the abdomen the chest and the tip of the noseWe take note of these three points in order to make the mind firm to limit mental activity so that mindfulness and selfawareness can easily ariseWhen we are adept at noting these three points we can let them go and note the in and out breathing concentrating solely at the nosetip or the upper lip where the air passes on its in and out passageWe dont have to follow the breath just establish mindfulness in front of us at the nosetip and note the breath at this one point  entering leaving entering leavingTheres no need to think of anything special just concentrate on this simple task for now having continuous presence of mindTheres nothing more to do just breathing in and outSoon the mind becomes peaceful the breath refinedThe mind and body become lightThis is the right state for the work of meditationWhen sitting in meditation the mind becomes refined but whatever state its in we should try to be aware of it to know itMental activity is there together with tranquillityThere is vitakkaVitakka is the action of bringing the mind to the theme of contemplationIf there is not much mindfulness there will be not much vitakkaThen vicara the contemplation around that theme followsVarious weak mental impressions may arise from time to time but our selfawareness is the important thing  whatever may be happening we know it continuouslyAs we go deeper we are constantly aware of the state of our meditation knowing whether or not the mind is firmly establishedThus both concentration and awareness are presentTo have a peaceful mind does not mean that theres nothing happening mental impressions do ariseFor instance when we talk about the first level of absorption we say it has five factorsAlong with vitakka and vicara piti arises with the theme of contemplation and then sukhaThese four things all lie together in the mind established in tranquillityThey are as one stateThe fifth factor is ekaggata or onepointednessYou may wonder how there can be onepointedness when there are all these other factors as wellThis is because they all become unified on that foundation of tranquillityTogether they are called a state of samadhiThey are not everyday states of mind they are factors of absorptionThere are these five characteristics but they do not disturb the basic tranquillityThere is vitakka but it does not disturb the mind vicara rapture and happiness arise but do not disturb the mindThe mind is therefore as one with these factorsThe first level of absorption is like thisWe dont have to call it First Jhana Second Jhana third Jhana and so on lets just call it a peaceful mind As the mind becomes progressively calmer it will dispense with vitakka and vicara leaving only rapture and happinessWhy does the mind discard vitakka and vicaraThis is because as the mind becomes more refined the activity of vitakka and vicara is too coarse to remainAt this stage as the mind leaves off vitakka and vicara feelings of great rapture can arise tears may gush outBut as the samadhi deepens rapture too is discarded leaving only happiness and onepointedness until finally even happiness goes and the mind reaches its greatest refinementThere are only equanimity and onepointedness all else has been left behindThe mind stands unmovingOnce the mind is peaceful this can happenYou dont have to think a lot about it it just happens by itselfThis is called the energy of a peaceful mindIn this state the mind is not drowsy the five hindrances sense desire aversion restlessness dullness and doubt have all fledBut if mental energy is still not strong and mindfulness weak there will occasionally arise intruding mental impressionsThe mind is peaceful but its as if theres a cloudiness within the calmIts not a normal sort of drowsiness though some impressions will manifest  maybe well hear a sound or see a dog or somethingIts not really clear but its not a dream eitherThis is because these five factors have become unbalanced and weakThe mind tends to play tricks within these levels of tranquillityImagery will sometimes arise when the mind is in this state through any of the senses and the meditator may not be able to tell exactly what is happeningAm I sleepingNoIs it a dreamNo its not a dream These impressions arise from a middling sort of tranquillity but if the mind is truly calm and clear we dont doubt the various mental impressions or imagery which ariseQuestions like Did I drift off thenWas I sleepingdid I get lost dont arise for they are characteristics of a mind which is still doubtingAm I asleep or awake Here its fuzzyThis is the mind getting lost in its moodsIts like the moon going behind a cloudYou can still see the moon but the clouds covering it render it hazyIts not like the moon which has emerged from behind the clouds  clear sharp and brightWhen the mind is peaceful and established firmly in mindfulness and selfawareness there will be no doubt concerning the various phenomena which we encounterThe mind will truly be beyond the hindrancesWe will clearly know as it is everything which arises in the mindWe do not doubt it because the mind is clear and brightThe mind which reaches samadhi is like thisHowever some people find it hard to enter samadhi because it doesnt suit their tendenciesThere is samadhi but its not strong or firmBut one can attain peace through the use of wisdom through contemplating and seeing the truth of things solving problems that wayThis is using wisdom rather than the power of samadhiTo attain calm in practice its not necessary to sit in meditation for instanceJust ask yourself Ehh what is that and solve your problem right thereA person with wisdom is like thisPerhaps he cant really attain high levels of samadhi although he develops some enough to cultivate wisdomIts like the difference between farming rice and farming cornOne can depend on rice more than corn for ones livelihoodOur practice can be like this we depend more on wisdom to solve problemsWhen we see the truth peace arisesThe two ways are not the sameSome people have insight and are strong in wisdom but do not have much samadhiWhen they sit in meditation they arent very peacefulThey tend to think a lot contemplating this and that until eventually they contemplate happiness and suffering and see the truth of themSome incline more towards this than samadhiWhether standing walking sitting or lying enlightenment of the Dhamma can take placeThrough seeing through relinquishing they attain peaceThey attain peace through knowing the truth without doubt because they have seen it for themselvesOther people have only little wisdom but their samadhi is very strongThey can enter very deep samadhi quickly but not having much wisdom they cannot catch their defilements they dont know themThey cant solve their problemsBut regardless of whichever approach we use we must do away with wrong thinking leaving only Right ViewWe must get rid of confusion leaving only peaceEither way we end up at the same placeThere are these two sides to practice but these two things calm and insight go togetherWe cant do away with either of themThey must go togetherThat which looks over the various factors which arise in meditation is sati mindfulnessThis sati is a condition which through practice can help other factors to ariseSati is lifeWhenever we dont have sati when we are heedless its as if we are deadIf we have no sati then our speech and actions have no meaningThis sati is simply recollectionIts a cause for the arising of selfawareness and wisdomWhatever virtues we have cultivated are imperfect if lacking in satiSati is that which watches over us while standing walking sitting and lyingEven when we are no longer in samadhi sati should be present throughoutWhatever we do we take careA sense of shame will ariseWe will feel ashamed about the things we do which arent correctAs shame increases our collectedness will increase as wellWhen collectedness increases heedlessness will disappearEven if we dont sit in meditation these factors will be present in the mindAnd this arises because of cultivating satiDevelop satiThis is the dhamma which looks over the work we are doing or have done in the pastIt has usefulnessWe should know ourselves at all timesIf we know ourselves like this right will distinguish itself from wrong the path will become clear and cause for all shame will dissolveWisdom will ariseWe can bring the practice all together as morality concentration and wisdomTo be collected to be controlled this is moralityThe firm establishing of the mind within that control is concentrationComplete overall knowledge within the activity in which we are engaged is wisdomThe practice in brief is just morality concentration and wisdom or in other words the pathThere is no other wayToday I would like to ask you allAre you sure yet are you certain in your meditation practice I ask because these days there are many people teaching meditation both monks and laypeople and Im afraid you may be subject to wavering and doubtIf we understand clearly we will be able to make the mind peaceful and firmYou should understand the Eightfold Path as morality concentration and wisdomThe path comes together as simply thisOur practice is to make this path arise within usWhen sitting meditation we are told to close the eyes not to look at anything else because now we are going to look directly at the mindWhen we close our eyes our attention comes inwardsWe establish our attention on the breath center our feelings there put our mindfulness thereWhen the factors of the path are in harmony we will be able to see the breath the feelings the mind and its mood for what they areHere we will see the focus point where samadhi and the other factors of the Path converge in harmonyWhen we are sitting in meditation following the breath think to yourself that now you are sitting aloneThere is noone sitting around you there is nothing at allDevelop this feeling that you are sitting alone until the mind lets go of all externals concentrating solely on the breathIf you are thinking This person is sitting over here that person is sitting over there there is no peace the mind doesnt come inwardsJust cast all that aside until you feel there is noone sitting around you until there is nothing at all until you have no wavering or interest in your surroundingsLet the breath go naturally dont force it to be short or long or whatever just sit and watch it going in and outWhen the mind lets go of all external impressions the sounds of cars and such will not disturb youNothing whether sights or sounds will disturb you because the mind doesnt receive themYour attention will come together on the breathIf the mind is confused and wont concentrate on the breath take a full deep breath as deep as you can and then let it all out till there is none leftDo this three times and then reestablish your attentionThe mind will become calmIts natural for it to be calm for a while and then restlessness and confusion may arise againWhen this happens concentrate breathe deeply again and them reestablish your attention on the breathJust keep going like thisWhen this has happened many times you will become adept at it the mind will let go of all external manifestationsExternal impressions will not reach the mindSati will be firmly establishedAs the mind becomes more refined so does the breathFeelings will become finer and finer the body and mind will be lightOur attention is solely on the inner we see the inbreaths and outbreaths clearly we see all impressions clearlyWe will see the coming together of Morality Concentration and WisdomThis is called the Path in harmonyWhen there is this harmony our mind will be free of confusion it will come together as oneThis is called samadhiAfter watching the breath for a long time it may become very refined the awareness of the breath will gradually cease leaving only bare awarenessThe breath may become so refined it disappearsPerhaps we are just sitting as if there is no breathing at allActually there is breathing but it seems as if theres noneThis is because the mind has reached its most refined state there is just bare awarenessIt has gone beyond the breathThe knowledge that the breath has disappeared becomes establishedWhat will we take as our object of meditation nowWe take just this knowledge as our object that is the awareness that theres no breathUnexpected things may happen at this time some people experience them some dontIf they do arise we should be firm and have strong mindfulnessSome people see that the breath has disappeared and get a fright theyre afraid they might dieHere we should know the situation just as it isWe simply notice that theres no breath and take that as our object of awarenessThis we can say is the firmest surest type of samadhiThere is only one firm unmoving state of mindPerhaps the body will become so light its as if there is no body at allWe feel like were sitting in empty space all seems emptyAlthough this may seem very unusual you should understand that theres nothing to worry aboutFirmly establish your mind like thisWhen the mind is firmly unified having no sense impressions to disturb it one can remain in that state for any length of timeThere will be no painful feelings to disturb usWhen samadhi has reached this level we can leave it when we choose but if we come out of this samadhi we do so comfortably not because weve become bored with it or tiredWe come out because weve had enough for now we feel at ease we have no problems at allIf we can develop this type of samadhi then if we sit say thirty minutes or an hour the mind will be cool and calm for many daysWhen the mind is cool and calm like this it is cleanWhatever we experience the mind will take up and investigateThis is a fruit of samadhiMorality has one function concentration has another function and Wisdom anotherThese factors are like a cycleWe can see them all within the peaceful mindWhen the mind is calm it has collectedness and restraint because of wisdom and the energy of concentrationAs it becomes more collected it becomes more refined which in turn gives morality the strength to increase in purityAs our morality becomes purer this will help in the development of concentrationWhen concentration is firmly established it helps in the arising of wisdomMorality concentration and wisdom help each other they are interrelated like thisIn the end the Path becomes one and functions at all timesWe should look after the strength which arises from the path because it is the strength which leads to Insight and WisdomSamadhi is capable of bringing much harm or much benefit to the meditator you cant say it brings only one or the otherFor one who has no wisdom it is harmful but for one who has wisdom it can bring real benefit it can lead him to InsightThat which can be most harmful to the meditator is Absorption Samadhi the samadhi with deep sustained calmThis samadhi brings great peaceWhere there is peace there is happinessWhen there is happiness attachment and clinging to that happiness ariseThe meditator doesnt want to contemplate anything else he just wants to indulge in that pleasant feelingWhen we have been practicing for a long time we may become adept at entering this samadhi very quicklyAs soon as we start to note our meditation object the mind enters calm and we dont want to come out to investigate anythingWe just get stuck on that happinessThis is a danger to one who is practicing meditationWe must use Upacara SamadhiHere we enter calm and then when the mind is sufficiently calm we come out and look at outer activityLooking at the outside with a calm mind gives rise to wisdomThis is hard to understand because its almost like ordinary thinking and imaginingWhen thinking is there we may think the mind isnt peaceful but actually that thinking is taking place within the calmThere is contemplation but it doesnt disturb the calmWe may bring thinking up in order to contemplate itHere we take up the thinking to investigate it its not that we are aimlessly thinking to investigate it its not that we are aimlessly thinking or guessing away its something that arises from a peaceful mindThis is called awareness within calm and calm within awareness If its simply ordinary thinking and imagining the mind wont be peaceful it will be disturbedBut I am not talking about ordinary thinking this is a feeling that arises from the peaceful mindIts called contemplation Wisdom is born right hereSo there can be right samadhi and wrong samadhiWrong samadhi is where the mind enters calm and theres no awareness at allOne could sit for two hours or even all day but the mind doesnt know where its been or whats happenedIt doesnt know anythingThere is calm but thats allIts like a wellsharpened knife which we dont bother to put to any useThis is a deluded type of calm because there is not much selfawarenessThe meditator may think he has reached the ultimate already so he doesnt bother to look for anything elseSamadhi can be an enemy at this levelWisdom cannot arise because there is no awareness of right and wrongWith right samadhi no matter what level of calm is reached there is awarenessThere is full mindfulness and clear comprehensionThis is the samadhi which can give rise to wisdom one cannot get lost in itPractitioners should understand this wellYou cant do without this awareness it must be present from beginning to endThis kind of samadhi has no dangerYou may wonder where does the benefit arise how does the wisdom arise from samadhiWhen right samadhi has been developed wisdom has the chance to arise at all timesWhen the eye sees form the ear hears sound the nose smells odor the tongue experiences taste the body experiences touch or the mind experiences mental impressions  in all postures  the mind stays with full knowledge of the true nature of those sense impressions it doesnt pick and choose In any posture we are fully aware of the birth of happiness and unhappinessWe let go of both of these things we dont clingThis is called Right Practice which is present in all posturesThese words all postures do not refer only to bodily postures they refer to the mind which has mindfulness and clear comprehension of the truth at all timesWhen samadhi has been rightly developed wisdom arises like thisThis is called insight knowledge of the truthThere are two kinds of peace  the coarse and the refinedThe peace which comes from samadhi is the coarse typeWhen the mind is peaceful there is happinessThe mind then takes this happiness to be peaceBut happiness and unhappiness are becoming and birthThere is no escape from samsara here because we still cling to themSo happiness is not peace peace is not happinessThe other type of peace is that which comes from wisdomHere we dont confuse peace with happiness we know the mind which contemplates and knows happiness and unhappiness as peaceThe peace which arises from wisdom is not happiness but is that which sees the truth of both happiness and unhappinessClinging to those states does not arise the mind rises above themThis is the true goal of all Buddhist practiceThe teaching of Buddhism is about giving up evil and practicing goodThen when evil is given up and goodness is established we must let go of both good and evilWe have already heard enough about wholesome and unwholesome conditions to understand something about them so I would like to talk about the Middle Way that is the path to escape from both of those thingsAll the Dhamma talks and teachings of the Buddha have one aim  to show the way out of suffering to those who have not yet escapedThe teachings are for the purpose of giving us the right understandingIf we dont understand rightly then we cant arrive at peaceWhen the various Buddhas became enlightened and gave their first teachings they all declared these two extremes  indulgence in pleasure and indulgence in painThese two ways are the ways of infatuation they are the ways between which those who indulge in sense pleasures must fluctuate never arriving at peaceThey are the paths which spin around in samsaraThe Enlightened One observed that all beings are stuck in these two extremes never seeing the Middle Way of Dhamma so he pointed them out in order to show the penalty involved in bothBecause we are still stuck because we are still wanting we live repeatedly under their wayThe Buddha declared that these two ways are the ways of intoxication they are not the way of a meditator nor the ways to peaceThese ways are indulgence in pleasure and indulgence in pain or to put it simply the way of slackness and the way of tensionIf you investigate within moment by moment you will see that the tense way is anger the way of sorrowGoing this way there is only difficulty and distressIndulgence in Pleasure  if youve escaped from this it means youve escaped from happinessThese ways both happiness and unhappiness are not peaceful statesThe Buddha taught to let go of both of themThis is right practiceThis is the Middle WayThese words the Middle Way do not refer to our body and speech they refer to the mindWhen a mental impression which we dont like arises it affects the mind and there is confusionWhen the mind is confused when its shaken up this is not the right wayWhen a mental impression arises which we like the mind goes to indulgence in pleasure  thats not the way eitherWe people dont want suffering we want happinessBut in fact happiness is just a refined form of sufferingSuffering itself is the coarse formYou can compare them to a snakeThe head of the snake is unhappiness the tail of the snake is happinessThe head of the snake is really dangerous it has the poisonous fangsIf you touch it the snake will bite straight awayBut never mind the head even if you go and hold onto the tail it will turn around and bite you just the same because both the head and the tail belong to the one snakeIn the same way both happiness and unhappiness or pleasure and sadness arise from the same parent  wantingSo when youre happy the mind isnt peacefulIt really isntFor instance when we get the things we like such as wealth prestige praise or happiness we become pleased as a resultBut the mind still harbors some uneasiness because were afraid of losing itThat very fear isnt a peaceful stateLater on we may actually lose that thing and then we really sufferThus if you arent aware even if youre happy suffering is imminentIts just the same as grabbing the snakes tail  if you dont let go it will biteSo whether its the snakes tail or its head that is wholesome or unwholesome conditions theyre all just characteristics of the Wheel of Existence of endless changeThe Buddha established morality concentration and wisdom as the path to peace the way to enlightenmentBut in truth these things are not the essence of BuddhismThey are merely the pathThe Buddha called them Magga which means path The essence of Buddhism is peace and that peace arises from truly knowing the nature of all thingsIf we investigate closely we can see that peace is neither happiness nor unhappinessNeither of these is the truthThe human mind the mind which the Buddha exhorted us to know and investigate is something we can only know by its activityThe true original mind has nothing to measure it by theres nothing you can know it byIn its natural state it is unshaken unmovingWhen happiness arises all that happens is that this mind is getting lost in a mental impression there is movementWhen the mind moves like this clinging and attachment to those things come into beingThe Buddha has already laid down the path of practice fully but we have not yet practiced or if we have weve practiced only in speechOur minds and our speech are not yet in harmony we just indulge in empty talkBut the basis of Buddhism is not something that can be talked about or guessed atThe real basis of Buddhism is full knowledge of the truth of realityIf one knows this truth then no teaching is necessaryIf one doesnt know even if he listens to the teaching he doesnt really hearThis is why the Buddha said The Enlightened One only points the way He cant do the practice for you because the truth is something you cannot put into words or give awayAll the teachings are merely similes and comparisons means to help the mind see the truthIf we havent seen the truth we must sufferFor example we commonly say sankharas when referring to the bodyAnybody can say it but in fact we have problems simply because we dont know the truth of these sankharas and thus cling to themBecause we dont know the truth of the body we sufferHere is an exampleSuppose one morning youre walking to work and a man yells abuse and insults at you from across the streetAs soon as you hear this abuse your mind changes from its usual stateYou dont feel so good you feel angry and hurtThat man walks around abusing you night and dayWhen you hear the abuse you get angry and even when you return home youre still angry because you feel vindictive you want to get evenA few days later another man comes to your house and calls out HeyThat man who abused you the other day hes mad hes crazyHas been for yearsHe abuses everybody like thatNobody takes any notice of anything he says As soon as you hear this you are suddenly relievedThat anger and hurt that youve pent up within you all these days melts away completelyWhyBecause you know the truth of the matter nowBefore you didnt know you thought that man was normal so you were angry at himUnderstanding like that caused you to sufferAs soon as you find out the truth everything changes Oh hes madThat explains everything When you understand this you feel fine because you know for yourselfHaving known then you can let goIf you dont know the truth you cling right thereWhen you thought that man who abused you was normal you could have killed himBut when you find out the truth that hes mad you feel much betterThis is knowledge of the truthSomeone who sees the Dhamma has a similar experienceWhen attachment aversion and delusion disappear they disappear in the same wayAs long as we dont know these things we think What can I doI have so much greed and aversion This is not clear knowledgeIts just the same as when we thought the madman was saneWhen we finally see that he was mad all along were relieved of worryNoone could show you thisOnly when the mind sees for itself can it uproot and relinquish attachmentIts the same with this body which we call sankharasAlthough the Buddha has already explained that its not substantial or a real being as such we still dont agree we stubbornly cling to itIf the body could talk it would be telling us all day long Youre not my owner you know Actually its telling us all the time but its Dhamma language so were unable to understand itFor instance the sense organs of eye ear nose tongue and body are continually changing but Ive never seen them ask permission from us even onceLike when we have a headache or a stomachache  the body never asks permission first it just goes right ahead following its natural courseThis shows that the body doesnt allow anyone to be its owner it doesnt have an ownerThe Buddha described it as an empty thingWe dont understand the Dhamma and so we dont understand these sankharas we take them to be ourselves as belonging to us or belonging to othersThis gives rise to clingingWhen clinging arises becoming follows onOnce becoming arises then there is birthOnce there is birth then old age sickness death the whole mass of suffering arisesThis is the PaticcasamuppadaWe say ignorance gives rise to volitional activities they give rise to consciousness and so onAll these things are simply events in mindWhen we come into contact with something we dont like if we dont have mindfulness ignorance is thereSuffering arises straight awayBut the mind passes through these changes so rapidly that we cant keep up with themIts the same as when you fall from a treeBefore you know it  Thud  youve hit the groundActually youve passed many branches and twigs on the way but you couldnt count them you couldnt remember them as you passed themYou just fall and then ThudThe Paticcasamuppada is the same as thisIf we divide it up as it is in the scriptures we say ignorance gives rise to volitional activities volitional activities give rise to consciousness consciousness gives rise to mind and matter mind and matter give rise to the six sense bases the sense bases give rise to sense contact contact gives rise to feeling feeling gives rise to wanting wanting gives rise to clinging clinging gives rise to becoming becoming gives rise to birth birth gives rise to old age sickness death and all forms of sorrowBut in truth when you come into contact with something you dont like theres immediate sufferingThat feeling of suffering is actually the result of the whole chain of the PaticcasamuppadaThis is why the Buddha exhorted his disciples to investigate and know fully their own mindsWhen people are born into the world they are without names  once born we name themThis is conventionWe give people names for the sake of convenience to call each other byThe scriptures are the sameWe separate everything up with labels to make studying the reality convenientIn the same way all things are simply sankharasTheir original nature is merely that of things born of conditionsThe Buddha said that they are impermanent unsatisfactory and notselfThey are unstableWe dont understand this firmly our understanding is not straight and so we have wrong viewThis wrong view is that the sankharas are ourselves we are the sankharas or that happiness and unhappiness are ourselves we are happiness and unhappinessSeeing like this is not full clear knowledge of the true nature of thingsThe truth is that we cant force all these things to follow our desires they follow the way of natureA simple comparison is this suppose you go and sit in the middle of a freeway with the cars and trucks charging down at youYou cant get angry at the cars shouting Dont drive over hereDont drive over here Its a freeway you cant tell them thatSo what can you doYou get off the roadThe road is the place where cars run if you dont want the cars to be there you sufferIts the same with sankharasWe say they disturb us like when we sit in meditation and hear a soundWe think Oh that sounds bothering me If we understand that the sound bothers us then we suffer accordinglyIf we investigate a little deeper we will see that its we who go out and disturb the soundThe sound is simply soundIf we understand like this then theres nothing more to it we leave it beWe see that the sound is one thing we are anotherOne who understands that the sound comes to disturb him is one who doesnt see himselfHe really doesntOnce you see yourself then youre at easeThe sound is just sound why should you go and grab itYou see that actually it was you who went out and disturbed the soundThis is real knowledge of the truthYou see both sides so you have peaceIf you see only one side there is sufferingOnce you see both sides then you follow the Middle WayThis is the right practice of the mindThis is what we call straightening out our understandingIn the same way the nature of all sankharas is impermanence and death but we want to grab them we carry them about and covet themWe want them to be trueWe want to find truth within the things that arent trueWhenever someone sees like this and clings to the sankharas as being himself he suffersThe Buddha wanted us to consider thisThe practice of Dhamma is not dependent on being a monk a novice or a layman it depends on straightening out your understandingIf our understanding is correct we arrive at peaceWhether you are ordained or not its the same every person has the chance to practice Dhamma to contemplate itWe all contemplate the same thingIf you attain peace its all the same peace its the same Path with the same methodsTherefore the Buddha didnt discriminate between laymen and monks he taught all people to practice to know the truth of the sankharasWhen we know this truth we let them goIf we know the truth there will be no more becoming or birthHow is there no more birthThere is no way for birth to take place because we fully know the truth of sankharasIf we fully know the truth then there is peaceHaving or not having its all the sameGain and loss are oneThe Buddha taught us to know thisThis is peace peace from happiness unhappiness gladness and sorrowWe must see that there is no reason to be bornBorn in what wayBorn into gladness When we get something we like we are glad over itIf there is no clinging to that gladness there is no birth if there is clinging this is called birth So if we get something we arent bornIf we lose then we arent bornThis is the birthless and the deathlessBirth and death are both founded in clinging to and cherishing the sankharasSo the Buddha saidThere is no more becoming for me finished is the holy life this is my last birth ThereHe knew the birthless and the deathlessThis is what the Buddha constantly exhorted his disciples to knowThis is the right practiceIf you dont reach it if you dont reach the Middle Way then you wont transcend sufferingIts of great importance that we practice the DhammaIf we dont practice then all our knowledge is only superficial knowledge just the outer shell of itIts as if we have some sort of fruit but we havent eaten it yetEven though we have that fruit in our hand we get no benefit from itOnly through the actual eating of the fruit we really know its tasteThe Buddha didnt praise those who merely believe others he praised the person who knows within himselfJust as with that fruit if we have tasted it already we dont have to ask anyone else if its sweet or sourOur problems are overWhy are they overBecause we see according to the truthOne who has realized the Dhamma is like one who has realized the sweetness or sourness of the fruitAll doubts are ended right hereWhen we talk about Dhamma although we may say a lot it can usually be brought down to four thingsThey are simply to know suffering to know the cause of suffering to know the end of suffering and to know the path of practice leading to the end of sufferingThis is all there isAll that we have experienced on the path of practice so far comes down to these four thingsWhen we know these things our problems are overWhere are these four things bornThey are born just within the body and the mind nowhere elseSo why is the Dhamma of the Buddha so broad and expansiveThis is so in order to explain these things in a more refined way to help us to see themWhen Siddhattha Gotama was born into the world before he saw the Dhamma he was an ordinary person just like usWhen he knew what he had to know that is the truth of suffering the cause the end and the way leading to the end of suffering he realized the Dhamma and became a perfectly Enlightened BuddhaWhen we realize the Dhamma wherever we sit we know Dhamma wherever we are we hear the Buddhas teachingWhen we understand Dhamma the Buddha is within our mind the Dhamma is within our mind and the practice leading to wisdom is within our own mindHaving the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha within our mind means that whether our actions are good or bad we know clearly for ourselves their true natureIt was thus that the Buddha discarded worldly opinions he discarded praise and criticismWhen people praised or criticized him he just accepted it for what it wasThese two things are simply worldly conditions so he wasnt shaken by themWhy notBecause he knew sufferingHe knew that if he believed in that praise or criticism they would cause him to sufferWhen suffering arises it agitates us we feel ill at easeWhat is the cause of that sufferingIts because we dont know the Truth this is the causeWhen the cause is present then suffering arisesOnce arisen we dont know how to stop itThe more we try to stop it the more it comes onWe say Dont criticize me or Dont blame meTrying to stop it like this suffering really comes on it wont stopSo the Buddha taught that the way leading to the end of suffering is to make the Dhamma arise as a reality within our own mindsWe become one who witnesses the Dhamma for himselfIf someone says we are good we dont get lost in it they say we are no good we dont get lost in it they say we are no good and we dont forget ourselvesThis way we can be freeGood and evil are just worldly dhammas they are just states of mindIf we follow them our mind becomes the world we just grope in the darkness and dont know the way outIf its like this then we have not yet mastered ourselvesWe try to defeat others but in doing so we only defeat ourselves but if we have mastery over ourselves then we have mastery over all  over all mental formations sights sounds smells tastes and bodily feelingsNow Im talking about externals theyre like that but the outside is reflected inside alsoSome people only know the outside they dont know the insideLike when we say to see the body in the body Having seen the outer body is not enough we must know the body within the bodyThen having investigated the mind we should know the mind within the mindWhy should we investigate the bodyWhat is this body in the bodyWhen we say to know the mind what is this mindIf we dont know the mind then we dont know the things within the mindThis is to be someone who doesnt know suffering doesnt know the cause doesnt know the end and doesnt know the wayThe things which should help to extinguish suffering dont help because we get distracted by the things which aggravate itIts just as if we have an itch on our head and we scratch our legIf its our head thats itchy then were obviously not going to get much reliefIn the same way when suffering arises we dont know how to handle it we dont know the practice leading to the end of sufferingFor instance take this body this body that each of us has brought along to this meetingIf we just see the form of the body theres no way we can escape sufferingWhy notBecause we still dont see the inside of the body we only see the outsideWe only see it as something beautiful something substantialThe Buddha said that only this is not enoughWe see the outside with our eyes a child can see it animals can see it its not difficultThe outside of the body is easily seen but having seen it we stick to it we dont know the truth of itHaving seen it we grab onto it and it bites usSo we should investigate the body within the bodyWhatevers in the body go ahead and look at itIf we just see the outside its not clearWe see hair nails and so on and they are just pretty things which entice us so the Buddha taught to see the inside of the body to see the body within the bodyWhat is in the bodyLook closely withinWe will see many things inside to surprise us because even though they are within us weve never seen themWherever we walk we carry them with us sitting in a car we carry them with us but we still dont know them at allIts as if we visit some relatives at their house and they give us a presentWe take it and put it in our bag and then leave without opening it to see what is insideWhen at last we open it  full of poisonous snakesOur body is like thisIf we just see the shell of it we say its fine and beautifulWe forget ourselvesWe forget impermanence unsatisfactoriness and notselfIf we look within this body its really repulsiveIf we look according to reality without trying to sugar things over well see that its really pitiful and wearisomeDispassion will ariseThis feeling of disinterest is not that we feel aversion for the world or anything its simply our mind clearing up our mind letting goWe see things are naturally established just as they areHowever we want them to be they just go their own way regardlessWhether we laugh or cry they simply are the way they areThings which are unstable are unstable things which are not beautiful are not beautifulSo the Buddha said that when we experience sights sounds tastes smells bodily feelings or mental states we should release themWhen the ear hears sounds let them goWhen the nose smells an odor let it go just leave it at the noseWhen the bodily feelings arise let go of the like or dislike that follow let them go back to their birthplaceThe same for mental statesAll these things just let them go their wayThis is knowingWhether its happiness or unhappiness its all the sameThis is called meditationMeditation means to make the mind peaceful in order to let wisdom ariseThis requires that we practice with body and mind in order to see and know the sense impressions of form sound taste smell touch and mental formationsTo put it shortly its just a matter of happiness and unhappinessHappiness is pleasant feeling in the mind unhappiness is just unpleasant feelingThe Buddha taught to separate this happiness and unhappiness from the mindThe mind is that which knowsFeeling is the characteristic of happiness or unhappiness like or dislikeWhen the mind indulges in these things we say that it clings to or takes that happiness and unhappiness to be worthy of holdingThat clinging is an action of mind that happiness or unhappiness is feelingWhen we say the Buddha told us to separate the mind from the feeling he didnt literally mean to throw them to different placesHe meant that the mind must know happiness and know unhappinessWhen sitting in samadhi for example and peace fills the mind then happiness comes but it doesnt reach us unhappiness comes but doesnt reach usThis is to separate the feeling from the mindWe can compare it to oil and water in a bottleThey dont combineEven if you try to mix them the oil remains oil and the water remains waterWhy is this soBecause they are of different densityThe natural state of the mind is neither happiness nor unhappinessWhen feeling enters the mind then happiness or unhappiness is bornIf we have mindfulness then we know pleasant feeling as pleasant feelingThe mind which knows will not pick it upHappiness is there but its outside the mind not buried within the mindThe mind simply knows it clearlyIf we separate unhappiness from the mind does that mean there is no suffering that we dont experience itYes we experience it but we know mind as mind feeling as feelingWe dont cling to that feeling or carry it aroundThe Buddha separated these things through knowledgeDid he have sufferingHe knew the state of suffering but he didnt cling to it so we say that he cut suffering offAnd there was happiness too but he knew that happiness if its not known is like a poisonHe didnt hold it to be himselfHappiness was there through knowledge but it didnt exist in his mindThus we say that he separated happiness and unhappiness from his mindWhen we say that the Buddha and the Enlightened Ones killed defilements its not that they really killed themIf they had killed all defilements then we probably wouldnt have anyThey didnt kill defilements when they knew them for what they are they let them goSomeone whos stupid will grab them but the Enlightened Ones knew the defilements in their own minds as a poison so they swept them outThey swept out the things which caused them to suffer they didnt kill themOne who doesnt know this will see some things such as happiness as good and then grab them but the Buddha just knew them and simply brushed them awayBut when feeling arises for us we indulge in it that is the mind carries that happiness and unhappiness aroundIn fact they are two different thingsThe activities of mind pleasant feeling unpleasant feeling and so on are mental impressions they are the worldIf the mind knows this it can equally do work involving happiness or unhappinessWhyBecause it knows the truth of these thingsSomeone who doesnt know them sees them as equalIf you cling to happiness it will be the birthplace of unhappiness later on because happiness is unstable it changes all the timeWhen happiness disappears unhappiness arisesThe Buddha knew that because both happiness and unhappiness are unsatisfactory they have the same valueWhen happiness arose he let it goHe had right practice seeing that both these things have equal values and drawbacksThey come under the Law of Dhamma that is they are unstable and unsatisfactoryOnce born they dieWhen he saw this right view arose the right way of practice became clearNo matter what sort of feeling or thinking arose in his mind he knew it as simply the continuous play of happiness and unhappinessHe didnt cling to themWhen the Buddha was newly enlightened he gave a sermon about indulgence in Pleasure and Indulgence in PainMonksIndulgence in Pleasure is the loose way Indulgence in Pain is the tense way These were the two things that disturbed his practice until the day he was enlightened because at first he didnt let go of themWhen he knew them he let them go and so was able to give his first sermonSo we say that a meditator should not walk the way of happiness or unhappiness rather he should know themKnowing the truth of suffering he will know the cause of suffering the end of suffering and the way leading to the end of sufferingAnd the way out of suffering is meditation itselfTo put it simply we must be mindfulMindfulness is knowing or presence of mindRight now what are we thinking what are we doingWhat do we have with us right nowWe observe like this we are aware of how we are livingWhen we practice like this wisdom can ariseWe consider and investigate at all times in all posturesWhen a mental impression arises that we like to know it as such we dont hold it to be anything substantialIts just happinessWhen unhappiness arises we know that its Indulgence in Pain its not the path of a meditatorThis is what we call separating the mind from the feelingIf we are clever we dont attach we leave things beWe become the one who knowsThe mind and feeling are just like oil and water they are in the same bottle but they dont mixEven if we are sick or in pain we still know the feeling as feeling the mind as mindWe know the painful or comfortable states but we dont identify with themWe stay only with peace the peace beyond both comfort and painYou should understand it like this because if there is no permanent self then there is no refugeYou must live like this that is without happiness and without unhappinessYou stay only with the knowing you dont carry things aroundAs long as we are still unenlightened all this may sound strange but it doesnt matter we just set our goal in this directionThe mind is the mindIt meets happiness and unhappiness and we see them as merely that theres nothing more to itThey are divided not mixedIf they are all mixed up then we dont know themIts like living in a house the house and its occupant are related but separateIf there is danger in our house we are distressed because we must protect it but if the house catches fire we get out of itIf painful feeling arises we get out of it just like that houseWhen its full of fire and we know it we come running out of itThey are separate things the house is one thing the occupant is the otherWe say that we separate mind and feeling in this way but in fact they are by nature already separateOur realization is simply to know this natural separateness according to realityWhen we say they are not separated its because were clinging to them through ignorance of the truthSo the Buddha told us to meditateThis practice of meditation is very importantMerely to know with the intellect is not enoughThe knowledge which arises from practice with a peaceful mind and the knowledge which comes from study are really far apartThe knowledge which comes from study is not real knowledge of our mindThe mind tries to hold onto and keep this knowledgeWhy do we try to keep itJust lose itAnd then when its lost we cryIf we really know then theres letting go leaving things beWe know how things are and dont forget ourselvesIf it happens that we are sick we dont get lost in thatSome people think This year I was sick the whole time I couldnt meditate at all These are the words of a really foolish personSomeone whos sick and dying should really be diligent in his practiceOne may say he doesnt trust his body and so he feels that he cant meditateIf we think like this then things are difficultThe Buddha didnt teach like thatHe said that right here is the place to meditateWhen were sick or almost dying thats when we can really know and see realityOther people say they dont have the chance to meditate because theyre too busySometimes school teachers come to see meThey say they have many responsibilities so theres no time to meditateI ask them When youre teaching do you have time to breathe They answer Yes So how can you have time to breathe if the work is so hectic and confusingHere you are far from DhammaActually this practice is just about the mind and its feelingsIts not something that you have to run after or struggle forBreathing continues while workingNature takes care of the natural processes  all we have to do is try to be awareJust to keep trying going inwards to see clearlyMeditation is like thisIf we have that presence of mind then whatever work we do will be the very tool which enables us to know right and wrong continuallyTheres plenty of time to meditate we just dont fully understand the practice thats allWhile sleeping we breathe eating we breathe dont weWhy dont we have time to meditateWherever we are we breatheIf we think like this then our life has as much value as our breath wherever we are we have timeAll kinds of thinking are mental conditions not conditions of body so we need simply have presence of mind then we will know right and wrong at all timesStanding walking sitting and lying theres plenty of timeWe just dont know how to use it properlyPlease consider thisWe cannot run away from feeling we must know itFeeling is just feeling happiness is just happiness unhappiness is just unhappinessThey are simply thatSo why should we cling to themIf the mind is clever simply to hear this is enough to enable us to separate feeling from the mindIf we investigate like this continuously the mind will find release but its not escaping through ignoranceThe mind lets go but it knowsIt doesnt let go through stupidity not because it doesnt want things to be the way they areIt lets go because it knows according to the truthThis is seeing nature the reality thats all around usWhen we know this we are someone whos skilled with the mind we are skilled with mental impressionsWhen we are skilled with mental impressions we are skilled with the worldThis is to be a Knower of the World The Buddha was someone who clearly knew the world with all its difficultyHe knew the troublesome and that which was not troublesome was right thereThis world is so confusing how is it that the Buddha was able to know itHere we should understand that the Dhamma taught by the Buddha is not beyond our abilityIn all postures we should have presence of mind and selfawareness  and when its time to sit meditation we do thatWe sit in meditation to establish peacefulness and cultivate mental energyWe dont do it in order to play around at anything specialInsight meditation is sitting in samadhi itselfAt some places they say Now we are going to sit in samadhi after that well do insight meditation Dont divide them like thisTranquillity is the base which gives rise to wisdom wisdom is the fruit of tranquillityTo say that now we are going to do calm meditation later well do insight  you cant do thatYou can only divide them in speechJust like a knife the blade is on one side the back of the blade on the otherYou cant divide themIf you pick up one side you get both sidesTranquillity gives rise to wisdom like thisMorality is the father and mother of DhammaIn the beginning we must have moralityMorality is peaceThis means that there are no wrong doings in body or speechWhen we dont do wrong then we dont get agitated when we dont become agitated then peace and collectedness arise within the mindSo we say that morality concentration and wisdom are the path on which all the Noble Ones have walked to enlightenmentThey are all oneMorality is concentration concentration is moralityConcentration is wisdom wisdom is concentrationIts like a mangoWhen its a flower we call it a flowerWhen it becomes a fruit we call it a mangoWhen it ripens we call it a ripe mangoIts all one mango but it continually changesThe big mango grows from the small mango the small mango becomes a big oneYou can call them different fruits or all oneMorality concentration and wisdom are related like thisIn the end its all the path that leads to enlightenmentThe mango from the moment it first appears as a flower simply grows to ripenessThis is enough we should see it like thisWhatever others call it it doesnt matterOnce its born it grows to old age and then whereWe should contemplate thisSome people dont want to be oldWhen they get old they become regretfulThese people shouldnt eat ripe mangoesWhy do we want the mangoes to be ripeIf theyre not ripe in time we ripen them artificially dont weBut when we become old we are filled with regretSome people cry theyre afraid to get old or dieIf its like this then they shouldnt eat ripe mangoes better eat just the flowersIf we can see this then we can see the DhammaEverything clears up we are at peaceJust determine to practice like thatSo today the Chief Privy Councillor and his party have come together to hear the DhammaYou should take what Ive said and contemplate itIf anything is not right please excuse meBut for you to know whether its right or wrong depends on your practicing and seeing for yourselvesWhatevers wrong throw it outIf its right then take it and use itBut actually we practice in order to let go both right and wrongIn the end we just throw everything outIf its right throw it out wrong throw it outUsually if its right we cling to rightness if its wrong we hold it to be wrong and then arguments followBut he Dhamma is the place where theres nothing  nothing at allSome of us start to practice and even after a year or two still dont know whats whatWe are still unsure of the practiceWhen were still unsure we dont see that everything around us is purely Dhamma and so we turn to teachings from the AjahnsBut actually when we know our own mind when there is sati to look closely at the mind there is wisdomAll times and all places become occasions for us to hear the DhammaWe can learn Dhamma from nature from trees for exampleA tree is born due to causes and it grows following the course of natureRight here the tree is teaching us Dhamma but we dont understand thisIn due course it grows until it buds flowers and fruit appearAll we see is the appearance of the flowers and fruit were unable to bring this within and contemplate itThus we dont know that the tree is teaching us DhammaThe fruit appears and we merely eat it without investigating sweet sour or salty its the nature of the fruitAnd this Dhamma the teaching of the fruitFollowing on the leaves grow oldThey wither die and then fall from the treeAll we see is that the leaves have fallen downWe step on them we sweep them up thats allWe dont investigate thoroughly so we dont know that nature is teaching usLater on the new leaves sprout and we merely see that without taking it furtherWe dont bring these things into our minds to contemplateIf we can bring all this inwards and investigate it we will see that the birth of a tree and our own birth are no differentThis body of ours is born and exists dependent on conditions on the elements of earth water wind and fireIt has its food it grows and growsEvery part of the body changes and flows according to its natureIts no different from the tree hair nails teeth and skin  all changeIf we know the things of nature then we will know ourselvesPeople are bornIn the end they dieHaving died they are born againNails teeth and skin are constantly dying and regrowingIf we understand the practice then we can see that a tree is no different from ourselvesIf we understand the teaching of the Ajahns then we realize that the outside and the inside are comparableThings which have consciousness and those without consciousness do not differThey are the sameAnd if we understand this sameness then when we see the nature of a tree for example we will know that its no different from our own five khandhas  body feeling memory thinking and consciousnessIf we have this understanding then we understand DhammaIf we understand Dhamma we understand the five khandhas how they constantly shift and change never stoppingSo whether standing walking sitting or lying we should have sati to watch over and look after the mindWhen we see external things its like seeing internalsWhen we see internals its the same as seeing externalsIf we understand this then we can hear the teaching of the BuddhaIf we understand this then we can say that Buddhanature the One who knows has been establishedIt knows the externalIt knows the internalIt understands all things which ariseUnderstanding like this then sitting at the foot of a tree we hear the Buddhas teachingStanding walking sitting or lying we hear the Buddhas teachingSeeing hearing smelling tasting touching and thinking we hear the Buddhas teachingThe Buddha is just this One who knows within this very mindIt knows the Dhamma it investigates the DhammaIts not that the Buddhanature the one who knows arisesThe mind becomes illuminedIf we establish the Buddha within our mind then we see everything we contemplate everything as no different from ourselvesWe see various animals trees mountains and vines as no different from ourselvesWe see poor people and rich people  theyre no differentThey all have the same characteristicsOne who understands like this is content wherever he isHe listens to the Buddhas teaching at all timesIf we dont understand this then even if we spend all our time listening to teachings from the various Ajahns we still wont understand their meaningThe Buddha said that enlightenment of the Dhamma is just knowing Nature the reality which is all around us the Nature which is right hereIf we dont understand this Nature we experience disappointment and joy we get lost in moods giving rise to sorrow and regretGetting lost in mental objects is getting lost in NatureWhen we get lost in Nature then we dont know DhammaThe Enlightened One merely pointed out this NatureHaving arisen all things change and dieThings we make such as plates bowls and dishes all have the same characteristicA bowl is molded into being due to a cause mans impulse to create and as we use it it gets old breaks up and disappearsTrees mountains and vines are the same right up to animals and peopleWhen Añña Kondañña the first disciple heard the Buddhas teaching for the first time the realization he had was nothing very complicatedHe simply saw that whatever thing is born that thing must change and grow old as a natural condition and eventually it must dieAñña Kondañña had never thought of this before or if he had it wasnt thoroughly clear so he hadnt yet let go he still clung to the khandhasAs he sat mindfully listening to the Buddhas discourse Buddhanature arose in himHe received a sort of Dhamma transmission which was the knowledge that all conditioned things are impermanentAny thing which is born must have aging and death as a natural resultThis feeling was different from anything hed ever known beforeHe truly realized his mind and so Buddha arose within himAt that time the Buddha declared that Añña Kondañña had received the Eye of DhammaWhat is it that this Eye of Dhamma seesThis Eye sees that whatever is born has aging and death as a natural resultWhatever is born means everythingWhether material or immaterial it all comes under this whatever is born It refers to all of NatureLike this body for instance  its born and then proceeds to extinctionWhen its small it dies from smallness to youthAfter a while it dies from youth and becomes middleagedThen it goes on to die from middleage and reach oldage finally reaching the endTrees mountains and vines all have this characteristicSo the vision or understanding of the One who knows clearly entered the mind of Añña Kondañña as he sat thereThis knowledge of whatever is born became deeply embedded in his mind enabling him to uproot attachment to the bodyThis attachment was sakkayaditthiThis means that he didnt take the body to be a self or a being or in terms of he or me He didnt cling to itHe saw it clearly thus uprooting sakkayaditthiAnd the vicikiccha was destroyedHaving uprooted attachment to the body he didnt doubt his realizationSilabbata paramasa was also uprootedHis practice became firm and straightEven if his body was in pain or fever he didnt grasp it he didnt doubtHe didnt doubt because he had uprooted clingingThis grasping of the body is called silabbata paramasaWhen one uproots the view of the body being the self grasping and doubt are finished withIf just this view of the body as the self arises within the mind then grasping and doubt begin right thereSo as the Buddha expounded the Dhamma Añña Kondañña opened the Eye of DhammaThis Eye is just the One who knows clearly It sees things differentlyIt sees this very natureSeeing Nature clearly clinging is uprooted and the One who knows is bornPreviously he knew but he still had clingingYou could say that he knew the Dhamma but he still hadnt seen it or he had seen the Dhamma but still wasnt one with itAt this time the Buddha said Kondañña knows What did he knowHe just knew NatureUsually we get lost in Nature as with this body of oursEarth water fire and wind come together to make this bodyIts an aspect of Nature a material object we can see with the eyeIt exists depending on food growing and changing until finally it reaches extinctionComing inwards that which watches over the body is consciousness  just this One who knows this single awarenessIf it receives through the ear its called hearing through the nose its called smelling through the tongue tasting through the body touching and through the mind thinkingThis consciousness is just one but when it functions at different places we call it different thingsThrough the eye we call it one thing through the ear we call it anotherBut whether it functions at the eye ear nose tongue body or mind its just one awarenessFollowing the scriptures we call it the six consciousness but in reality there is only one consciousness arising at these six different basesThere are six doors but a single awareness which is this very mindThis mind is capable of knowing the truth of NatureIf the mind still has obstructions then we say it knows through ignoranceIt knows wrongly and it sees wronglyKnowing wrongly and seeing wrongly or knowing and seeing rightly its just a single awarenessWe say wrong view and right view but its just one thingRight and wrong both arise from this one placeWhen there is wrong knowledge we say that Ignorance conceals the truthWhen there is wrong knowledge then there is wrong view wrong intention wrong action wrong livelihood  everything is wrongAnd on the other hand the path of right practice is born in this same placeWhen there is right then the wrong disappearsThe Buddha practiced enduring many hardships and torturing himself with fasting and so on but he investigated deeply into his mind until finally he uprooted ignoranceAll the Buddhas were enlightened in mind because the body knows nothingYou can let it eat or not it doesnt matter it can die at any timeThe Buddhas all practiced with the mindThey were enlightened in mindThe Buddha having contemplated his mind gave up the two extremes of practice  indulgence in pleasure and indulgence in pain  and in his first discourse expounded the Middle Way between these twoBut we hear his teaching and it grates against our desiresWere infatuated with pleasure and comfort infatuated with happiness thinking we are good we are fine  this is indulgence in pleasureIts not the right pathDissatisfaction displeasure dislike and anger  this is indulgence in painThese are the extreme ways which one on the path of practice should avoidThese ways are simply the happiness and unhappiness which ariseThe one on the path is this very mind the One who knowsIf a good mood arises we cling to it as good this is indulgence in pleasureIf an unpleasant mood arises we cling to it through dislike this is indulgence in painThese are the wrong paths they arent the ways of a meditatorTheyre the ways of the worldly those who look for fun and happiness and shun unpleasantness and sufferingThe wise know the wrong paths but they relinquish them they give them upThey are unmoved by pleasure and displeasure happiness and unhappinessThese things arise but those who know dont cling to them they let them go according to their natureThis is right viewWhen one knows this fully there is liberationHappiness and unhappiness have no meaning for an Enlightened OneThe Buddha said that the Enlightened Ones were far from defilementsThis doesnt mean that they ran away from defilements they didnt run away anywhereDefilements were thereHe compared it to a lotus leaf in a pond of waterThe leaf and the water exist together they are in contact but the leaf doesnt become dampThe water is like defilements and the lotus leaf is the Enlightened MindThe mind of one who practices is the same it doesnt run away anywhere it stays right thereGood evil happiness and unhappiness right and wrong arise and he knows them allThe meditator simply knows them they dont enter his mindThat is he has no clingingHe is simply the experiencerTo say he simply experiences is our common languageIn the language of Dhamma we say he lets his mind follow the Middle WayThese activities of happiness unhappiness and so on are constantly arising because they are characteristics of the worldThe Buddha was enlightened in the world he contemplated the worldIf he hadnt contemplated the world if he hadnt seen the world he couldnt have risen above itThe Buddhas Enlightenment was simply enlightenment of this very worldThe world was still there gain and loss praise and criticism fame and disrepute happiness and unhappiness were still thereIf there werent these things there would be nothing to become enlightened toWhat he knew was just the world that which surrounds the hearts of peopleIf people follow these things seeking praise and fame gain and happiness and trying to avoid their opposites they sink under the weight of the worldGain and loss praise and criticism fame and disrepute happiness and unhappiness  this is the worldThe person who is lost in the world has no path of escape the world overwhelms himThis world follows the Law of Dhamma so we call it worldly dhammaHe who lives within the worldly dhamma is called a worldly beingHe lives surrounded by confusionTherefore the Buddha taught us to develop the pathWe can divide it up into morality concentration and wisdom  develop them to completionThis is the path of practice which destroys the worldWhere is this worldIt is just in the minds of beings infatuated with itThe action of clinging to praise gain fame happiness and unhappiness is called world when it is there in the mind then the world arises the worldly being is bornThe world is born because of desireDesire is the birthplace of all worldsTo put an end to desire is to put an end to the worldOur practice of morality concentration and wisdom is otherwise called the Eightfold PathThis Eightfold Path and the eight worldly dhammas are a pairHow is it that they are a pairIf we speak according to the scriptures we say that gain and loss praise and criticism fame and disrepute happiness and unhappiness are the eight worldly dhammasRight view Right Intention Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration this is the Eightfold PathThese two eightfold ways exist in the same placeThe eight worldly dhammas are right here in this very mind with the One who knows but this One who knows has obstructions so it knows wrongly and thus becomes the worldIts just this one One who knows no otherThe Buddhanature has not yet arisen in this mind it has not yet extracted itself from the worldThe mind like this is the worldWhen we practice the path when we train our body and speech its all done in that very same mindIts the same place so they see each other the path sees the worldIf we practice with this mind of ours we encounter this clinging to praise fame pleasure and happiness we see the attachment to the worldThe Buddha said You should know the worldIt dazzles like a kings royal carriageFools are entranced but the wise are not deceived Its not that he wanted us to go all over the world looking at everything studying everything about itHe simply wanted us to watch this mind which is attached to itWhen the Buddha told us to look at the world he didnt want us to get stuck in it he wanted us to investigate it because the world is born just in this mindsitting in the shade of a tree you can look at the worldWhen there is desire the world comes into being right thereWanting is the birth place of the worldTo extinguish wanting is to extinguish the worldWhen we sit in meditation we want the mind to become peaceful but its not peacefulWhy is thisWe dont want to think but we thinkIts like a person who goes to sit on an ants nest the ants just keep on biting himWhen the mind is the world then even sitting still with our eyes closed all we see is the worldPleasure sorrow anxiety confusion  it all arisesWhy is thisIts because we still havent realized DhammaIf the mind is like this the meditator cant endure the worldly dhammas he doesnt investigateIts just the same as if he were sitting on an ants nestThe ants are going to bite because hes right on their homeSo what should he doHe should look for some poison or use fire to drive them outBut most Dhamma practitioners dont see it like thatIf they feel content they just follow contentment feeling discontent they just follow thatFollowing the worldly dhammas the mind becomes the worldSometimes we may think Oh I cant do it its beyond me so we dont even tryThis is because the mind is full of defilements the worldly dhammas prevent the path from arisingWe cant endure in the development of morality concentration and wisdomIts just like that man sitting on the ants nestHe cant do anything the ants are biting and crawling all over him hes immersed in confusion and agitationHe cant rid his sitting place of the danger so he just sits there sufferingSo it is with our practiceThe worldly dhammas exist in the minds of worldly beingsWhen those beings wish to find peace the worldly dhammas arise right thereWhen the mind is ignorant there is only darknessWhen knowledge arises the mind is illumined because ignorance and knowledge are born in the same placeWhen ignorance has arisen knowledge cant enter because the mind has accepted ignoranceWhen knowledge has arisen ignorance cannot staySo the Buddha exhorted his disciples to practice with the mind because the world is born in this mind the eight worldly dhammas are thereThe Eightfold Path that is investigation through calm and insight meditation our diligent effort and the wisdom we develop all these things loosen the grip of the worldAttachment aversion and delusion become lighter and being lighter we know them as suchIf we experience fame material gain praise happiness or suffering were aware of itWe must know these things before we can transcend the world because the world is within usWhen were free of these things its just like leaving a houseWhen we enter a house what sort of feeling do we haveWe feel that weve come through the door and entered the houseWhen we leave the house we feel that weve left it we come into the bright sunlight its not dark like it was insideThe action of the mind entering the worldly dhammas is like entering the houseThe mind which has destroyed the worldly dhammas is like one who has left the houseSo the Dhamma practitioner must become one who witnesses the Dhamma for himselfHe knows for himself whether the worldly dhammas have left or not whether or not the path has been developedWhen the path has been well developed it purges the worldly dhammasIt becomes stronger and strongerRight view grows as wrong view decreases until finally the path destroys defilements  either that or defilements will destroy the pathRight view and wrong view there are only these two waysWrong view has its tricks as well you know it has its wisdom  but its wisdom thats misguidedThe meditator who begins to develop the path experiences a separationEventually its as if he is two people  one in the world and the other on the pathThey divide they pull apartWhenever hes investigating theres this separation and it continues on and on until the mind reaches insight vipassanaOr maybe its vipassanuHaving tried to establish wholesome results in our practice seeing them we attach to themThis type of clinging comes from our wanting to get something from the practiceThis is vipassanu the wisdom of defilementsSome people develop goodness and cling to it they develop purity and cling to that or they develop knowledge and cling to thatThe action of clinging to that goodness or knowledge is vipassanu infiltrating our practiceSo when you develop vipassana be carefulWatch out for vipassanu because theyre so close that sometimes you cant tell them apartBut with right view we can see them both clearlyIf its vipassanu there will be suffering arising at times as a resultIf its really vipassana theres no sufferingThere is peaceBoth happiness and unhappiness are silencedThis you can see for yourselfThis practice requires enduranceSome people when they come to practice dont want to be bothered by anything they dont want frictionBut theres friction the same as beforeWe must try to find an end to friction through friction itselfSo if theres friction in your practice then its rightIf theres no friction its not right you just eat and sleep as much as you wantWhen you want to go anywhere or say anything you just follow your desiresThe teaching of the Buddha gratesThe supermundane goes against the worldlyRight view opposes wrong view purity opposes impurityThe teaching grates against our desiresTheres a story in the scriptures about the Buddha before he was enlightenedAt that time having received a plate of rice he floated that plate on a stream of water determining in his mind If I am to be enlightened may this plate float against the current of the water The plate floated upstreamThat plate was the Buddhas right view or the Buddhanature that he became awakened toIt didnt follow the desires of ordinary beingsIt floated against the flow of his mind it was contrary in every wayThese days in the same way the Buddhas teaching is contrary to our heartsPeople want to indulge in greed and hatred but the Buddha wont let themThey want to be deluded but the Buddha destroys delusionSo the mind of the Buddha is contrary to that of worldly beingsThe world calls the body beautiful he says its not beautifulThey say the body belongs to us he says not soThey say its substantial he says its notRight view is above the worldWorldly beings merely follow the flow of the streamContinuing on when the Buddha got up from there he received eight handfuls of grass from a brahmanThe real meaning of this is that the eight handfuls of grass were the right worldly dhammas  gain and loss praise and criticism fame and disrepute happiness and unhappinessThe Buddha having received this grass determined to sit on it and enter samadhiThe action of sitting on the grass was itself samadhi that is his mind was above the worldly dhammas subduing the world until it realized the transcendentThe worldly dhammas became like refuse for him they lost all meaningHe sat over them but they didnt obstruct his mind in any wayThe various maras came to try to overcome him but he just sat there in samadhi subduing the world until finally he became enlightened to the Dhamma and completely defeated MaraThat is he defeated the worldSo the practice of developing the path is that which kills defilementsPeople these days have little faithHaving practiced a year or two they want to get there and they want to go fastThey dont consider that the Buddha our Teacher had left home a full six years before he became enlightenedThis is why we have freedom from dependence According to the scriptures a monk must have at least five rains before he is considered able to live on his ownBy this time he has studied and practiced sufficiently he has adequate knowledge he has faith his conduct is goodSomeone who practices for five years I say hes competentBut he must really practice not just hang out in the robes for five yearsHe must really look after the practice really do itUntil you reach five rains you may wonder What is this freedom from dependence that the Buddha talked about You must really try to practice for five years and then youll know for yourself the qualities he was referring toAfter that time you should be competent competent in mind one who is certainAt the very least after five rains one should be at the first stage of enlightenmentThis is not just five rains in body but five rains in mind as wellThat monk has fear of blame a sense of shame and modestyHe doesnt dare to do wrong either in front of people or behind their backs in the light or in the darkWhy notBecause he has reached the Buddha The One who knowsHe takes refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaTo depend truly on the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha we must see the BuddhaWhat use would it be to take refuge without knowing the BuddhaIf we dont yet know the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha our taking refuge in them is just an act of body and speech the mind still hasnt reached themOnce the mind reaches them we know what the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha are likeThen we can really take refuge in them because these things arise in our mindsWherever we are we will have the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha with usOne who is like this doesnt dare to commit evil actsThis is why we say that one who has reached the first stage of enlightenment will no longer be born in the woeful statesHis mind is certain he has entered the Stream there is no doubt for himIf he doesnt reach full enlightenment today it will certainly be some time in the futureHe may do wrong but not enough to send him to Hell that is he doesnt regress to evil bodily and verbal actions he is incapable of itSo we say that person has entered the Noble BirthHe cannot returnThis is something you should see and know for yourselves in this very lifeThese days those of us who still have doubts about the practice hear these things and say Oh how can I do that Sometimes we feel happy sometimes troubled pleased or displeasedFor what reasonBecause we dont know DhammaWhat DhammaJust the Dhamma of Nature the reality around us the body and the mindThe Buddha said Dont cling to the five khandhas let them go give them up Why cant we let them goJust because we dont see them or know them fullyWe see them as ourselves we see ourselves in the khandhasHappiness and suffering we see as ourselves we see ourselves in happiness and sufferingWe cant separate ourselves from themWhen we cant separate them it means we cant see Dhamma we cant see NatureHappiness unhappiness pleasure and sadness  none of them is us but we take them to be soThese things come into contact with us and we see a lump of atta or selfWherever there is self there you will find happiness unhappiness and everything elseSo the Buddha said to destroy this lump of self that is to destroy sakkaya ditthiWhen atta is destroyed anatta naturally arisesWe take Nature to be us and ourselves to be Nature so we dont know Nature trulyIf its good we laugh with it if its bad we cry over itBut Nature is simply sankharasAs we say in the chanting Tesam vupasamo sukho  pacifying the sankharas is real happinessHow do we pacify themWe simply remove clinging and see them as they really areSo there is truth in this worldTrees mountains and vines all live according to their own truth they are born and die following their natureIts just we people who arent trueWe see it and make a fuss over it the Nature is impassive it just is as it isWe laugh we cry we kill but Nature remains in truth it is truthNo matter how happy or sad we are this body just follows its own natureIts born it grows up and ages changing and getting older all the timeIt follows Nature in this wayWhoever takes the body to be himself and carries it around with him will sufferSo Añña Kondañña recognized this whatever is born in everything be it material or immaterialHis view of the world changedHe saw the truthHaving got up from his sitting place he took that truth with himThe activity of birth and death continued but he simply looked onHappiness and unhappiness were arising and passing away but he merely noted themHis mind was constantHe no longer fell into the woeful statesHe didnt get overpleased or unduly upset about these thingsHis mind was firmly established in the activity of contemplationThereAñña Kondañña had received the Eye of DhammaHe saw Nature which we call sankharas according to truthWisdom is that which knows the truth of sankharasThis is the mind which knows and sees Dhamma which has surrenderedUntil we have seen the Dhamma we must have patience and restraintWe must endure we must renounceWe must cultivate diligence and enduranceWhy must we cultivate diligenceBecause were lazyWhy must we develop enduranceBecause we dont endureThat the way it isBut when we are already established in our practice have finished with laziness then we dont need to use diligenceIf we already know the truth of all mental states if we dont get happy or unhappy over them we dont need to exercise endurance because the mind is already DhammaThe One who knows has seen the Dhamma he is the DhammaWhen the mind is Dhamma it stopsIt has attained peaceTheres no longer a need to do anything special because the mind is Dhamma alreadyThe outside is Dhamma the inside is DhammaThe One who knows is DhammaThe state is Dhamma and that which knows the state is DhammaIt is oneIt is freeThis Nature is not born it does not age nor sickenThis Nature does not dieThis Nature is neither happy nor sad neither big nor small heavy nor light neither short nor long black nor whiteTheres nothing you can compare it toNo convention can reach itThis is why we say Nirvana has no colorAll colors are merely conventionsThe state which is beyond the world is beyond the reach of worldly conventionsSo the Dhamma is that which is beyond the worldIt is that which each person should see for himselfIt is beyond languageYou cant put it into words you can only talk about ways and means of realizing itThe person who has seen it for himself has finished his workThe things of this world are merely conventions of our own makingHaving established them we get lost in them and refuse to let go giving rise to clinging to our personal views and opinionsThis clinging never ends it is samsara flowing endlessly onIt has no completionNow if we know conventional reality then well know LiberationIf we clearly know Liberation then well know conventionThis is to know the DhammaHere there is completionTake people for instanceIn reality people dont have any names we are simply born naked into the worldIf we have names they arise only through conventionIve contemplated this and seen that is you dont know the truth of this convention it can be really harmfulIts simply something we use for convenienceWithout it we couldnt communicate there would be nothing to say no languageIve seen the Westerners when they sit in meditation together in the WestWhen they get up after sitting men and women together sometimes they go and touch each other on the headWhen I saw this I thought Ehh if we cling to convention it gives rise to defilements right there If we can let go of convention give up our opinions we are at peaceLike the generals and colonels men of rank and position who come to see meWhen they come they say Oh please touch my head If they ask like this theres nothing wrong with it theyre glad to have their heads touchedBut if you tapped their heads in the middle of the street itd be a different storyThis is because of clingingSo I feel that letting go is really the way of peaceTouching a head is against our customs but in reality it is nothingWhen they agree to having it touched theres nothing wrong with it just like touching a cabbage or a potatoAccepting giving up letting go  this is the way of lightnessWherever youre clinging theres becoming and birth right thereTheres danger right thereThe Buddha taught about convention and he taught to undo convention in the right way and so reach LiberationThis is freedom not to cling to conventionsAll things in this world have a conventional realityHaving established them we should not be fooled by them because getting lost in them really leads to sufferingThis point concerning rules and conventions is of utmost importanceOne who can get beyond them is beyond sufferingHowever they are a characteristic of our worldTake MrBoonmah for instance he used to be just one of the crowd but now hes been appointed the District CommissionerIts just a convention but its a convention we should respectIts part of the world of peopleIf you think Oh before we were friends we used to work at the tailors together and then you go and pat him on the head in public hell get angryIts not right hell resent itSo we should follow the conventions in order to avoid giving rise to resentmentIts useful to understand convention living in the world is just about thisKnow the right time and place know the personWhy is it wrong to go against conventionsIts wrong because of peopleYou should be clever knowing both convention and LiberationsKnow the right time for eachIf we know how to use rules and conventions comfortably then we are skilledBut if we try to behave according to the higher level of reality in the wrong situation this is wrongWhere is it wrongIts wrong with peoples defilements nothing elsePeople all have defilementsIn one situation we behave one way in another situation we must behave in another wayWe should know the ins and outs because we live within conventionsProblems occur because people cling to themIf we suppose something to be then it isIts there because we suppose it to be thereBut if you look closely in the absolute sense these things dont really existAs I have often said before we were laymen and now we are monksWe lived within the convention of layman and now we live within the convention of monk We are monks by convention not monks through LiberationIn the beginning we establish conventions like this but if a person merely ordains this doesnt mean he overcomes defilementsIf we take a handful of sand and agree to call it salt does this make it saltIt is salt but only in name not in realityYou couldnt use it to cook withIts only use is within the realm of that agreement because theres really no salt there only sandIt becomes salt only through our supposing it to be soThis word Liberation is itself just a convention but it refers to that beyond conventionsHaving achieved freedom having reached liberation we still have to use convention in order to refer to it as liberationIf we didnt have convention we couldnt communicate so it does have its useFor example people have different names but they are all people just the sameIf we didnt have names to differentiate between them and we wanted to call out to somebody standing in a crowd saying Hey PersonPerson that would be uselessYou couldnt say who would answer you because theyre all person But if you called Hey John then John would come the others wouldnt answerNames fulfill just this needThrough them we can communicate they provide the basis for social behaviorSo you should know both convention and liberationConventions have a use but in reality there really isnt anything thereEven people are nonexistentThey are merely groups of elements born of causal conditions growing dependent on conditions existing for a while or control itBut without conventions we would have nothing to say wed have no names no practice no workRules and conventions are established to give us a language to make things convenient and thats allTake money for exampleIn olden times there werent any coins or notes they had no valuePeople used to barter goods but those things were difficult to keep so they created money using coins and notesPerhaps in the future well have a new king decree that we dont have to use paper money we should use wax melting it down and pressing it into lumpsWe say this is money and use it throughout the countryLet alone wax it may even happen that they decide to make chicken dung the local currency  all the other things cant be money just chicken dungThen people would fight and kill each other over chicken dungThis is the way it isYou could use many examples to illustrate conventionWhat we use for money is simply a convention that we have set up it has its use within that conventionHaving decreed it to be money it becomes moneyBut in reality what is moneyNobody can sayWhen there is a popular agreement about something then a convention comes about to fulfill the needThe world is just thisThis is convention but to get ordinary people to understand liberation is really difficultOur money our house our family our children and relatives are simply conventions that we have invented but really seen in the light of Dhamma they dont belong to usMaybe if we hear this we dont feel so good but in reality is like thatThese things have value only through the established conventionsIf we establish that it doesnt have value then it doesnt have valueThis is the way it is we bring convention into the world to fulfill a needEven this body is not really ours we just suppose it to be soIts truly just a suppositionIf you try to find a real substantial self within it you cantThere are merely elements which are born continue for a while and then dieEverything is like thisTheres no real true substance to it but its proper that we use itIts a tool for your useIf it breaks there is trouble so even though it must break you should try your utmost to preserve itAnd so we have the four supports which the Buddha taught again and again to contemplateThey are the supports on which a monk depends to continue his practiceAs long as you live you must depend on them but you should understand themDont cling to them giving rise to craving in your mindConvention and liberation are related like this continuallyEven though we use convention dont place your trust in it as being the truthIf you cling to it suffering will ariseThe case of right and wrong is a good exampleSome people see wrong as being right and right as being wrong but in the end who really knows what is right and what is wrongWe dont knowDifferent people establish different conventions about whats right and whats wrong but the Buddha took suffering as his guidelineIf you want to argue about it theres no end to itOne says right another says wrong One says wrong another says right In truth we dont really know right and wrong at allBut at a useful practical level we can say that right is not to harm oneself and not to harm othersThis way fulfills a useSo after all both rules and conventions and liberation are simply dhammasOne is higher than the other but they go hand in handThere is no way that we can guarantee that anything is definitely like this or like that so the Buddha said to just leave it beLeave it be as uncertainHowever much you like it or dislike it you should understand it as uncertainRegardless of time and place the whole practice of Dhamma comes to completion at the place where there is nothingIts the place of surrender of emptiness of laying down the burdenThis is the finishIts not like the person who says Why is the flag fluttering in the windI say its because of the wind Another person says its because of the flagThe other retorts that its because of the windTheres no end to thisThe same as the old riddle Which came first the chicken or the egg Theres no way to reach a conclusion this is just NatureAll these things we say are merely conventions we establish them ourselvesIf you know these things with wisdom then youll know impermanence unsatisfactoriness and notselfThis is the outlook which leads to enlightenmentYou know training and teaching people with varying levels of understanding is really difficultSome people have certain ideas you tell them something and they dont believe youYou tell them the truth and they say its not trueIm right youre wrong Theres no end to thisIf you dont let go there will be sufferingIve told you before about the four men who go into the forestThey hear a chicken crowing Kakkadehhh One of them wonders Is that a rooster or a hen Three of them say together Its a hen but the other doesnt agree he insists its a roosterHow could a hen crow like that he asksThey retort Well it has a mouth hasnt it They argue till the tears fall really getting upset over it but in the end theyre all wrongWhether you say a hen or a rooster theyre only namesWe establish these conventions saying a rooster is like this a hen is like that a rooster cries like this a hen cries like that and this is how we get stuck in the worldRemember thisActually if you just say that really theres no hen and no rooster then thats the end of itIn the field of conventional reality one side is right and the other side it wrong but there will never be complete agreementArguing till the tears fall has no useThe Buddha taught not to clingHow do we practice nonclingingWe practice simply to give up clinging but this nonclinging is very difficult to understandIt takes keen wisdom to investigate and penetrate this to really achieve nonclingingWhen you think about it whether people are happy or sad content or discontent doesnt depend on their having little or having much  it depends on wisdomAll distress can be transcended only through wisdom through seeing the truth of thingsSo the Buddha exhorted us to investigate to contemplateThis contemplation means simply to try to solve these problems correctlyThis is our practiceLike birth old age sickness and death  they are the most natural and common of occurrencesThe Buddha taught to contemplate birth old age sickness and death but some people dont understand thisWhat is there to contemplate they sayTheyre born but they dont know birth they will die but they dont know deathA person who investigates these things repeatedly will seeHaving seen he will gradually solve his problemsEven if he still has clinging if he has wisdom and sees that old age sickness and death are the way of Nature then he will be able to relieve sufferingWe study the Dhamma simply for this  to cure sufferingThere isnt really much as the basis of Buddhism theres just the birth and death of suffering and this the Buddha called the truthBirth is suffering old age is suffering sickness is suffering and death is sufferingPeople dont see this suffering as the truthIf we know truth then we know sufferingThis pride in personal opinions these arguments they have no endIn order to put our minds at rest to find peace we should contemplate our past the present and the things which are in store for usLike birth old age sickness and deathWhat can we do to avoid being plagued by theseEven though we may still have a little worry if we investigate till we know according to the truth all suffering will abate we will no longer cling to itWe hear some parts of the teachings and cant really understand themWe think they shouldnt be the way they are so we dont follow them but really there is a reason to all the teachingsMaybe it seems that things shouldnt be that way but they areAt first I didnt even believe in sitting meditationI couldnt see what use it would be to just sit with your eyes closedAnd walking meditation walk from this tree turn around and walk back again Why bother I thought Whats the use of all that walking I thought like that but actually walking and sitting meditation are of great useSome peoples tendencies make them prefer walking meditation others prefer sitting but you cant do without either of themIn the scriptures they talk about the four postures standing walking sitting and lyingWe live with these four posturesWe may prefer one to the other but we must use all fourThey say to make these four postures even to make the practice even in all posturesAt first I couldnt figure out what this meant to make them evenMaybe it means we sleep for two hours then stand for two hours then walk for two hours maybe thats itI tried it  couldnt do it it was impossibleThats not what it meant to make the postures evenMaking the postures even refers to the mind to our awarenessThat is to make the mind give rise to wisdom to illumine the mindThis wisdom of ours must be present in all postures we must know or understand constantlyStanding walking sitting or lying we know all mental states as impermanent unsatisfactory and notselfMaking the postures even in this way can be done it is possibleWhether like or dislike are present in the mind we dont forget our practice we are awareIf we just focus our attention on the mind constantly then we have the gist of the practiceWhether we experience mental states which the world knows as good or bad we dont forget ourselves we dont get lost in good or badWe just go straightMaking the postures constant in this way is possibleIf we have constancy in our practice and we are praised then its simply praise if we are blamed then its just blameWe dont get high or low over it we stay right hereWhyBecause we see the danger in all those things we see their resultsWe are constantly aware of the danger in both praise and blameNormally if we have a good mood the mind is good also we see them as the same thing if we have a bad mood the mind goes bad as well we dont like itThis is the way it is this is uneven practiceIf we have constancy just to the extent of knowing our moods and knowing were clinging to them this is better alreadyThat is we have awareness we know whats going on but we still cant let goWe see ourselves clinging to good and bad and we know itWe cling to good and know its still not right practice but we still cant let goThis is  or  of the practice alreadyThere still isnt release but we know that if we could let go that would be the way to peaceWe keep going like that seeing the equally harmful consequences of all our likes and dislikes of praise and blame continuouslyWhatever there is the mind is constant in this wayBut for worldly people if they get blamed or criticized they get really upsetIf they get praised it cheers them up they say its good and get really happy over itIf we know the truth of our various moods if we know the consequences of clinging to praise and blame the danger of clinging to anything at all we will become sensitive to our moodsWe will know that clinging to them really causes sufferingWe see this suffering and we see our very clinging as the cause of that sufferingWe begin to see the consequences of grabbing and clinging to good and bad because weve grasped them and seen the result before  no real happinessSo now we look for the way to let goWhere is this way to let goIn Buddhism we say Dont cling to anything We never stop hearing about this dont cling to anything This means to hold but not to clingLike this flashlightWe think What is this So we pick it up Oh its a flashlight then we put it down againWe hold things in this wayIf we didnt hold anything at all what could we doWe couldnt walk meditation or do anything so we must hold things firstIts wanting yes thats true but later on it leads to paramiLike wanting to come here for instance Venerable Jagaro came to Wat Pah PongHe had to want to come firstIf he hadnt felt that he wanted to come he wouldnt have comeFor anybody its the same they come here because of wantingBut when wanting arises dont cling to itSo you come and then you go back What is thisWe pick it up look at it and see Oh its a flashlight then we put it downThis is called holding but not clinging we let goWe know and then we let goTo put it simply we say just this Know then let go Keep looking and letting goThis they say is good this they say is not good know and then let goGood and bad we know it all but we let it goWe dont foolishly cling to things but we hold them with wisdomPracticing in this posture can be constantYou must be constant like thisMake the mind know in this way let wisdom ariseWhen the mind has wisdom what else is there to look forWe should reflect on what we are doing hereFor what reason are we living here what are we working forIn the world they work for this or that reward but the monks teach something a little deeper than thatWhatever we do we ask for no returnWe work for no rewardsWorldly people work because they want this or that because they want some gain or other but the Buddha taught to work just in order to work we dont ask for anything beyond thatIf you do something just to get some return itll cause sufferingTry it out for yourselfYou want to make your mind peaceful so you sit down and try to make it peaceful  youll sufferTry itOur way is more refinedWe do and then let go do and then let goLook at the brahman who makes a sacrifice he has some desire in mind so he makes a sacrificeThose actions of his wont help him transcend suffering because hes acting on desireIn the beginning we practice with some desire in mind we practice on and on but we dont attain our desireSo we practice until we reach a point where were practicing for no return were practicing in order to let goThis is something we must see for ourselves its very deepMaybe we practice because we want to go to Nirvana  right there you wont get to NirvanaIts natural to want peace but its not really correctWe must practice without wanting anything at allIf we dont want anything at all what will we getWe dont get anythingWhatever you get is just a cause for suffering so we practice not getting anythingJust this is called making the mind empty Its empty but there is still doingThis emptiness is something people dont usually understand but those who reach it see the value of knowing itIts not the emptiness of not having anything its emptiness within the things that are hereLike this flashlight we should see this flashlight as empty because of the flashlight there is emptinessIts not the emptiness where we cant see anything its not like thatPeople who understand like that have got it all wrongYou must understand emptiness within the things are hereThose who are still practicing because of some gaining idea are like the brahman who makes a sacrifice just to fulfill some wishLike the people who come to see me to be sprinkled with holy water When I ask them Why do you want this holy water they say We want to live happily and comfortably and not get sick ThereTheyll never transcend suffering that wayThe worldly way is to do things for a reason to get some return but in Buddhism we do things without any gaining ideaThe world has to understand things in terms of cause and effect but the Buddha teaches us to go above cause beyond effect to go above birth and beyond death to go above happiness and beyond sufferingThink about it theres nowhere to stayWe people live in a home To leave home and go where there is no home we dont know how to do it because weve always lived with becoming with clingingIf we cant cling we dont know what to doSo most people dont want to go to Nirvana theres nothing there nothing at allLook at the roof and the floor hereThe upper extreme is the roof thats an abiding The lower extreme is the floor and thats another abiding But in the empty space between the floor and the roof theres nowhere standOne could stand on the roof or stand on the floor but not on that empty spaceWhere there is no abiding thats where theres emptiness and to put it bluntly we say that Nirvana is this emptinessPeople hear this and they back up a bit they dont want to goTheyre afraid they wont see their children or relativesThis is why when we bless the laypeople we say May you have long life beauty happiness and strength This makes them really happy Sadhu they all sayThey like these thingsIf you start talking about emptiness they dont want it theyre attached to abidingBut have you ever seen a very old person with a beautiful complexionHave you ever seen an old person with a lot of strength or a lot of happiness No But we say Long life beauty happiness and strength and theyre all really pleased every single one says Sadhu This is like the brahman who makes oblations to achieve some wishIn our practice we dont make oblations we dont practice in order to get some returnWe dont want anythingIf we still want something then there is still something thereJust make the mind peaceful and have done with itBut if I talk like this you may not be very comfortable because you want to be born againSo all you lay practitioners should get close to the monks and see their practiceTo be close to the monks means to be close to the Buddha to be close to his DhammaThe Buddha said Ananda practice a lot develop your practiceWhoever sees the Dhamma sees me and whoever sees me sees the Dhamma Where is the BuddhaWe may think the Buddha has been and gone but the Buddha is the Dhamma the TruthSome people like to say Oh if I was born in the time the Buddha I would go to Nirvana Here stupid people talk like thisThe Buddha is still hereThe Buddha is truthRegardless of whoever is born or dies the truth is still hereThe truth never departs from the world its there all the timeWhether a Buddha is born or not whether someone knows it or not the truth is still thereSo we should get close to the Buddha we should come within and find the DhammaWhen we reach the Dhamma we will reach the Buddha seeing the Dhamma we will see the Buddha and all doubts will dissolveTo put it simply its like Teacher ChooAt first he wasnt a teacher he was just MrChooWhen he studied and passed the necessary grades he became a teacher and became known as Teacher ChooHow did he become a teacherThrough studying the required things thus allowing MrChoo to become Teacher ChooWhen Teacher Choo dies the study to become a teacher still remains and whoever studies it will become a teacherThat course of study to become a teacher doesnt disappear anywhere just like the Truth the knowing of which enabled the Buddha to become the BuddhaSo the Buddha is still hereWhoever practices and sees the Dhamma sees the BuddhaThese days people have got it all wrong they dont know where the Buddha isThey say If I was born in the time of the Buddha I would have become a disciple of his and become enlightened Thats just foolishnessYou should understand thisDont go thinking that at the end of the rains retreat youll disrobeDont think like thatIn an instant an evil thought can arise in the mind you could kill somebodyIn the same way it only takes a splitsecond for good to flash into the mind and youre there alreadyDont think that you have to ordain for a long time to be able to meditateWhere the right practice lies is in the instant we make kammaIn a flash an evil thought arises before you know it youve committed some really heavy kammaAnd in the same way all the disciples of the Buddha practiced for a long time but the time they attained enlightenment was merely one thought momentSo dont be heedless even in minor thingsTry hard try to get close to the monks contemplate things and then youll know about monksWell thats enough huhIt must be getting late now some people are getting sleepyThe Buddha said not to teach Dhamma to sleepy peopleThe practice of Dhamma goes against our habits the truth goes against our desires so there is difficulty in the practiceSome things which we understand as wrong may be right while the things we take to be right may be wrongWhy is thisBecause our minds are in darkness we dont clearly see the TruthWe dont really know anything and so are fooled by peoples liesThey point out what is right as being wrong and we believe it that which is wrong they say is right and we believe thatThis is because we are not yet our own mastersOur moods lie to us constantlyWe shouldnt take this mind and its opinions as our guide because it doesnt know the truthSome people dont want to listen to others at all but this is not the way of a man of wisdomA wise man listens to everythingOne who listens to Dhamma must listen just the same whether he likes it or not and not blindly believe or disbelieveHe must stay at the halfway mark the middle point and not be heedlessHe just listens and then contemplates giving rise to the right results accordinglyA wise man should contemplate and see the cause and effect for himself before he believes what he hearsEven if the teacher speaks the truth dont just believe it because you dont yet know the truth of it for yourselfIts the same for all of us including myselfIve practiced before you Ive seen many lies beforeFor instance This practice is really difficult really hard Why is the practice difficultIts just because we think wrongly we have wrong viewPreviously I lived together with other monks but I didnt feel rightI ran away to the forests and mountains fleeing the crowd the monks and novicesI thought that they werent like me they didnt practice as hard as I didThey were sloppyThat person was like this this person was like thatThis was something that really put me in turmoil it was the cause for my continually running awayBut whether I lived alone or with others I still had no peaceOn my own I wasnt content in a large group I wasnt contentI thought this discontent was due to my companions due to my moods due to my living place the food the weather due to this and thatI was constantly searching for something to suit my mindAs a dhutanga monk I went traveling but things still werent rightSo I contemplated What can I do to make things rightWhat can I do Living with a lot of people I was dissatisfied with few people I was dissatisfiedFor what reasonI just couldnt see itWhy was I dissatisfiedBecause I had wrong view just that because I still clung to the wrong DhammaWherever I went I was discontent thinking Here is no good there is no good on and on like thatI blamed othersI blamed the weather heat and cold I blamed everythingJust like a mad dogIt bites whatever it meets because its madWhen the mind is like this our practice is never settledToday we feel good tomorrow no goodIts like that all the timeWe dont attain contentment or peaceThe Buddha once saw a jackal a wild dog run out of the forest where he was stayingIt stood still for a while then it ran into the underbrush and them out againThen it ran into a tree hollow then out againThen it went into a cave only to run out againOne minute it stood the next it ran then it lay down then it jumped up That jackal had mangeWhen it stood the mange would eat into its skin so it would runRunning it was still uncomfortable so it would lie downThen it would jump up again running into the underbrush the tree hollow never staying stillThe Buddha said Monks did you see that jackal this afternoonStanding it suffered running it suffered sitting it suffered lying down it sufferedIn the underbrush a tree hollow or a cave it sufferedIt blamed standing for its discomfort it blamed sitting it blamed running and lying down it blamed the tree the underbrush and the caveIn fact the problem was with none of those thingsThat jackal had mangeThe problem was with the mangeWe monks are just the same as that jackalOur discontent is due to wrong viewBecause we dont exercise sense restraint we blame our suffering on externalsWhether we live at Wat Pah Pong in America or in London we arent satisfiedGoing to live at Bung Wai or any of the other branch monasteries were still not satisfiedWhy notBecause we still have wrong view within us just thatWherever we go we arent contentBut just as that dog if the mange is cured is content wherever it goes so it is for usI reflect on this often and I teach you this often because its very importantIf we know the truth of our various moods we arrive at contentmentWhether its hot or cold we are satisfied with many people or with few people we are satisfiedContentment doesnt depend on how many people we are with it comes only from right viewIf we have right view then wherever we stay we are contentBut most of us have wrong viewIts just like a maggotA maggots living place is filthy its food is filthy but they suit the maggotIf you take a stick and brush it away from its lump of dung itll struggle to crawl back into itIts the same when the Ajahn teaches us to see rightlyWe resist it makes us feel uneasyWe run back to our lump of dung because thats where we feel at homeWere all like thisIf we dont see the harmful consequences of all our wrong views then we cant leave them the practice is difficultSo we should listenTheres nothing else to the practiceIf we have right view wherever we go we are contentI have practiced and seen this alreadyThese days there are many monks novices and laypeople coming to see meIf I still didnt know if I still had wrong view Id be dead by nowThe right abiding place for monks the place of coolness is just right view itselfWe shouldnt look for anything elseSo even though you may be unhappy it doesnt matter that unhappiness is uncertainIs that unhappiness your selfIs there any substance to itIs it realI dont see it as being real at allUnhappiness is merely a flash of feeling which appears and then is goneHappiness is the sameIs there a consistency to happinessIs it truly an entityIts simply a feeling that flashes suddenly and is goneThereIts born and then it diesLove just flashes up for a moment and then disappearsWhere is the consistency in love or hate or resentmentIn truth there is no substantial entity there they are merely impressions which flare up in the mind and then dieThey deceive us constantly we find no certainty anywhereJust as the Buddha said when unhappiness arises it stays for a while then disappearsWhen unhappiness disappears happiness arises and lingers for a while and then diesWhen happiness disappears unhappiness arises again on and on like thisIn the end we can say only this  apart from the birth the life and the death of suffering there is nothingThere is just thisBut we who are ignorant run and grab it constantlyWe never see the truth of it that theres simply this continual changeIf we understand this then we dont need to think very much but we have much wisdomIf we dont know it then we will have more thinking than wisdom  and maybe no wisdom at allIts not until we truly see the harmful results of our actions that we can give them upLikewise its not until we see the real benefits of practice that we can follow it and begin working to make the mind goodIf we cut a log of wood and throw it into the river and that log doesnt sink or rot or run aground on either of the banks of the river that log will definitely reach the seaOur practice is comparable to thisIf you practice according to the path laid down by the Buddha following it straightly you will transcend two thingsWhat two thingsJust those two extremes that the Buddha said were not the path of a true meditator  indulgence in pleasure and indulgence in painThese are the two banks of the riverOne of the banks of that river is hate the other is loveOr you can say that one bank is happiness the other unhappinessThe log is this mindAs it flows down the river it will experience happiness and unhappinessIf the mind doesnt cling to that happiness or unhappiness it will reach the ocean of NirvanaYou should see that there is nothing other than happiness and unhappiness arising and disappearingIf you dont run aground on these things then you are on the path of a true meditatorThis is the teaching of the BuddhaHappiness unhappiness love and hate are simply established in Nature according to the constant law of natureThe wise person doesnt follow or encourage them he doesnt cling to themThis is the mind which lets go of indulgence in pleasure and indulgence in painIt is the right practiceJust as that log of wood will eventually flow to the sea so will the mind which doesnt attach to these two extremes inevitably attain peaceDo you know where it will endOr will you just keep on learning like this Or is there an end to it Thats okay but its the external study not the internal studyFor the internal study you have to study these eyes these ears this nose this tongue this body and this mindThis is the real studyThe study of books is just the external study its really hard to get it finishedWhen the eye sees form what sort of things happensWhen ear nose and tongue experience sounds smells and tastes what takes placeWhen the body and mind come into contact with touches and mental states what reactions take placeAre there still greed aversion and delusion thereDo we get lost in forms sounds smells tastes textures and moodsThis is the internal studyIt has a point of completionIf we study but dont practice we wont get any resultsIts like a person who raises cowsIn the morning he takes the cow out to eat grass in the evening he brings it back to its pen  but he never drinks the cows milkStudy is alright but dont let it be like thisYou should raise the cow and drink its milk tooYou must study and practice as well to get the best resultsHere Ill explain it furtherIts like a person who raises chickens but he doesnt get the eggsAll he gets is the chicken dungThis is what I tell people who raise chickens back homeWatch out you dont become like thatThis means we study the scriptures but we dont know how to let go of defilements we dont know how to push greed aversion and delusion from our mindStudy without practice without this giving up brings no resultsThis is why I compare it to someone who raises chickens but doesnt collect the eggs he just collects the dungIts the same thingBecause of this the Buddha wanted us to study the scriptures and then to give up evil actions through body speech and mind to develop goodness in our deeds speech and thoughtsThe real worth of mankind will come to fruition through our deeds speech and thoughtsBut if we only talk well without acting accordingly its not yet completeOr if we do good deeds but the mind is still not good this is still not completeThe Buddha taught to develop fine deeds fine speech and fine thoughtsThis is the treasure of mankindThe study and the practice must both be goodThe Eightfold Path of the Buddha the path of practice has eight factorsThese eight factors are nothing other than this very body two eyes two ears two nostrils one tongue and one bodyThis is the pathAnd the mind is the one who follows the pathTherefore both the study and the practice exist in our body speech and mindHave you ever seen scriptures which teach about anything other than the body the speech and the mindThe scriptures only teach about this nothing elseDefilements are born hereIf you know them they die right hereSo you should understand that the practice and the study both exist right hereIf we study just this much we can know everythingIts like our speech to speak one word of Truth is better than a lifetime of wrong speechDo you understandOne who studies and doesnt practice is like a ladle of soup potIts in the pot every day but it doesnt know the flavor of the soupIf you dont practice even if you study till the day you die you wont know the taste of FreedomVenerable Ajahn Chah was born into a typical farming family in Bahn Gor village in the province of Ubol Rachathani NEThailand inHe lived the first part of his life as any other youngster in rural Thailand and following the custom took ordination as a novice in the local village Wat for a number of years where he learned to read and write in addition to some basic Buddhist teachingsAfter a number of years he returned to the lay life to help his parents but feeling an attraction to the monastic life at the age of twenty he again entered a Wat this time for higher ordination as a bhikkhu or Buddhist monkHe spent the first few years of his bhikkhu life studying scriptures and learning Pali but the death of his father awakened him to the transience of life and instilled in him a desire to find the real essence of the Buddhas teachingHe began to travel to other monasteries studying the monastic discipline in detail and spending a very brief but significant time with Venerable Ajahn Mun the most outstanding meditation Master of the ascetic forestdwelling traditionFollowing his time with Venerable Ajahn Mun he spent a number of years traveling around Thailand spending his time in forests and charnel grounds ideal places for developing meditation practiceAt length he came within the vicinity of the village of his birth and when word got around that he was in the area he was invited to set up a monastery at the Pa Pong forest a place at that time reputed to be the habitat of wild animals and ghostsVenerable Ajahn Chahs impeccable approach to meditation or Dhamma practice and his simple direct style of teaching with the emphasis on practical application and a balanced attitude began to attract a large following of monks and laypeopleIn the first westerner came to stay at Wat Pa Pong Venerable Sumedho BhikkhuFrom that time on the number of foreign people who came to Ajahn Chah began to steadily increase until in the first branch monastery for western and other nonThai nationals Wat Pa Nanachat was set up with Venerable Ajahn Sumedho as the abbotIn Venerable Ajahn Chah was invited to England together with Ajahn Sumedho the outcome of which was eventually the establishment of the first branch monastery of Wat Pa Pong outside of ThailandSince then further branch monasteries have been established in England Switzerland Australia New Zealand and ItalyIn Venerable Ajahn Chah began to feel more acutely the symptoms of dizziness and memory lapse which he had been feeling for some yearsThis led to an operation in which however failed to reverse the onset of the paralysis which eventually rendered him completely bedridden and unable to speakHowever this did not stop the growth of monks and laypeople who came to practice at his monastery for whom the teachings of Ajahn Chah are a constant guide and inspirationModern man in his search for pleasure and affluence has exploited nature without any moral restraint to such an extent that nature has been rendered almost incapable of sustaining healthy lifeInvaluable gifts of nature such as air and water have been polluted with severely disastrous consequencesMan is now searching for ways and means of overcoming the pollution problem as his health too is alarmingly threatenedHe also feels that it is irresponsible and morally wrong on his part to commit the future generations to a polluted planetIf man is to act with a sense of responsibility to the natural world to his fellow human beings and to unborn future generations he has to find an appropriate environmental ethic today to prevent further aggravation of the present pollution problemHence his search for wisdom and attitudes in a hitherto neglected area of knowledge namely religionBuddhism strictly limits itself to the delineation of a way of life designed to eradicate human sufferingThe Buddha refused to answer questions which did not directly or indirectly bear on the central problem of human suffering and its endingFurthermore environmental pollution is a problem of the modern age unheard of and unsuspected during the time of the BuddhaTherefore it is difficult to find any specific discourse which deals with the topic we are interested in hereNevertheless as Buddhism is a fullfledged philosophy of life reflecting all aspects of experience it is possible to find enough material in the Pali canon to delineate the Buddhist attitude towards natureThe word nature means everything in the world which is not organized and constructed by manThe Pali equivalents which come closest to nature are loka and yathabhutaThe former is usually translated as world while the latter literally means things as they really are The words dhammata and niyama are used in the Pali canon to mean natural law or wayAccording to Buddhism changeability is one of the perennial principles of natureEverything changes in nature and nothing remains staticThis concept is expressed by the Pali term aniccaEverything formed is in a constant process of changeThe world is therefore defined as that which disintegrates the world is so called because it is dynamic and kinetic it is constantly in a process of undergoing changeIn nature there are no static and stable things there are only everchanging evermoving processesRain is a good example to illustrate this pointThough we use a noun called rain which appears to denote a thing rain is nothing but the process of drops of water falling from the skiesApart from this process the activity of raining there is no rain as such which could be expressed by a seemingly static nominal conceptThe very elements of solidity liquidity heat and mobility recognized as the building material of nature are all everchanging phenomenaEven the most solid looking mountains and the very earth that supports everything on it are not beyond this inexorable law of changeOne sutta explains how the massive king of mountains  Mount Sineru which is rooted in the great ocean to a depth of leagues and which rises above sea level to another great height of leagues and which is very classical symbol of stability and steadfastness  also gets destroyed by heat without leaving even ashes with the appearance of multiple sunsThus change is the very essence of natureThe world passes through alternating cycles of evolution and dissolution each of which endures for a long period of timeThough change is inherent in nature Buddhism believes that natural processes are affected by the morals of manAccording to the Aggañña Sutta which relates the Buddhist legend regarding the evolution of the world the appearance of greed in the primordial beings  who at that time were selfluminous subsisting on joy and traversing in the skies  caused the gradual loss of their radiance and their ability to subsist on joy and to move about in the skyThe moral degradation had effects on the external environment tooAt that time the entire earth was covered over by a very flavorsome fragrant substance similar to butterWhen beings started partaking of this substance with more and more greed on the one hand their subtle bodies became coarser and coarserOn the other hand the flavorsome substance itself started gradually diminishingWith the solidification of bodies differences of form appeared some were beautiful while others were homelyThereupon conceit manifested itself in those beings and the beautiful ones started looking down upon the othersAs a result of these moral blemishes the delicious edible earthsubstance completely disappearedIn its place there appeared edible mushrooms and later another kind of edible creeperIn the beings who subsisted on them successively sex differentiation became manifest and the former method of spontaneous birth was replaced by sexual reproductionSelfgrowing rice appeared on earth and through laziness to collect each meal man grew accustomed to hoarding foodAs a result of this hoarding habit the growth rate of food could not keep pace with the rate of demandTherupon land had to be divided among familiesAfter private ownership of land became the order of the day those who were of a more greedy disposition started robbing from others plots of landWhen they were detected they denied that they had stolenThus through greed vices such as stealing and lying became manifest in societyTo curb the wrong doers and punish them a king was elected by the people and thus the original simple society became much more complex and complicatedIt is said that this moral degeneration of man had adverse effects on natureThe richness of the earth diminished and selfgrowing rice disappearedMan had to till the land and cultivate rice for foodThis rice grain was enveloped in chaff it needed cleaning before consumptionThe point I wish to emphasize by citing this evolutionary legend is that Buddhism believes that though change is a factor inherent in nature mans moral deterioration accelerates the process of change and brings about changes which are adverse to human well being and happinessThe Cakkavattisihanada Sutta of the Digha Nikaya predicts the future course of events when human morals undergo further degenerationGradually mans health will deteriorate so much that life expectancy will diminish until at last the average human lifespan is reduced to ten years and marriageable age to five yearsAt that time all delicacies such as ghee butter honey etcwill have disappeared from the earth what is considered the poorest coarse food today will become a delicacy of that dayThus Buddhism maintains that there is a close link between mans morals and the natural resources available to himAccording to a discourse in the Anguttara Nikaya when profligate lust wanton greed and wrong values grip the heart of man and immorality becomes widespread in society timely rain does not fallWhen timely rain does not fall crops get adversely affected with various kinds of pests and plant diseasesThrough lack of nourishing food the human mortality rate risesThus several suttas from the Pali canon show that early Buddhism believes there to be a close relationship between human morality and the natural environmentThis idea has been systematized in the theory of the five natural laws in the later commentariesAccording to this theory in the cosmos there are five natural laws or forces at work namely utuniyama bijaniyama cittaniyama kammaniyama and dhammaniyamaThey can be translated as physical laws biological laws psychological laws moral laws and causal laws respectivelyWhile the first four laws operate within their respective spheres the lastmentioned law of causality operates within each of them as well as among themThis means that the physical environment of any given area conditions the growth and development of its biological component ieflora and faunaThese in turn influence the thought pattern of the people interacting with themModes of thinking determine moral standardsThe opposite process of interaction is also possibleThe morals of man influence not only the psychological makeup of the people but the biological and physical environment of the area as wellThus the five laws demonstrate that man and nature are bound together in a reciprocal causal relationship with changes in one necessarily bringing about changes in the otherThe commentary on the Cakkavattisihanada Sutta goes on to explain the pattern of mutual interaction furtherWhen mankind is demoralized through greed famine is the natural outcome when moral degeneration is due to ignorance epidemic is the inevitable result when hatred is the demoralizing force widespread violence is the ultimate outcomeIf and when mankind realizes that largescale devastation has taken place as a result of his moral degeneration a change of heart takes place among the few surviving human beingsWith gradual moral regeneration conditions improve through a long period of cause and effect and mankind again starts to enjoy gradually increasing prosperity and longer lifeThe world including nature and mankind stands or falls with the type of moral force at workIf immorality grips society man and nature deteriorate if morality reigns the quality of human life and nature improvesThus greed hatred and delusion produce pollution within and withoutGenerosity compassion and wisdom produce purity within and withoutThis is one reason the Buddha has pronounced that the world is led by the mind cittena niyati lokoThus man and nature according to the ideas expressed in early Buddhism are interdependentFor survival mankind has to depend on nature for his food clothing shelter medicine and other requisitesFor optimum benefits man has to understand nature so that he can utilize natural resources and live harmoniously with natureBy understanding the working of nature  for example the seasonal rainfall pattern methods of conserving water by irrigation the soil types the physical conditions required for growth of various food crops etc man can learn to get better returns from his agricultural pursuitsBut this learning has to be accompanied by moral restraint if he is to enjoy the benefits of natural resources for a long timeMan must learn to satisfy his needs and not feed his greedsThe resources of the world are not unlimited whereas mans greed knows neither limit nor satiationModern man in his unbridled voracious greed for pleasure and acquisition of wealth has exploited nature to the point of near impoverishmentOstentatious consumerism is accepted as the order of the dayOne writer says that within forty years Americans alone have consumed natural resources to the quantity of what all mankind has consumed for the last yearsThe vast nonreplenishable resources of fossil fuels which took millions of years to form have been consumed within a couple of centuries to the point of near exhaustionThis consumerism has given rise to an energy crisis on the one hand and a pollution problem on the otherMans unrestrained exploitation of nature to gratify his insatiate greed reminds one of the traditional parable of the goose that laid the golden eggsBuddhism tirelessly advocates the virtues of nongreed nonhatred and nondelusion in all human pursuitsGreed breeds sorrow and unhealthy consequencesContentment is a much praised virtue in BuddhismThe man leading a simple life with few wants easily satisfied is upheld and appreciated as an exemplary characterMiserliness and wastefulness are equally deplored in Buddhism as two degenerate extremesWealth has only instrumental value it is to be utilized for the satisfaction of mans needsHoarding is a senseless antisocial habit comparable to the attitude of the dog in the mangerThe vast hoarding of wealth in some countries and the methodical destruction of large quantities of agricultural produce to keep the market prices from falling while half the world is dying of hunger and starvation is really a sad paradox of the present affluent ageBuddhism commends frugality as a virtue in its own rightOnce Ananda explained to King Udena the thrifty economic use of robes by the monks in the following orderWhen new robes are received the old robes are used as coverlets the old coverlets as mattress covers the old mattress covers as rugs the old rugs as dusters and the old tattered dusters are kneaded with clay and used to repair cracked floors and wallsThus nothing is wastedThose who waste are derided as woodapple eaters A man shakes the branch of a woodapple tree and all the fruits ripe as well as unripe fallThe man would collect only what he wants and walk away leaving the rest to rotSuch a wasteful attitude is certainly deplored in Buddhism as not only antisocial but criminalThe excessive exploitation of nature as is done today would certainly be condemned by Buddhism in the strongest possible termsBuddhism advocates a gentle nonaggressive attitude towards natureAccording to the Sigalovada Sutta a householder should accumulate wealth as a bee collects pollen from a flowerThe bee harms neither the fragrance nor the beauty of the flower but gathers pollen to turn it into sweet honeySimilarly man is expected to make legitimate use of nature so that he can rise above nature and realize his innate spiritual potentialThe wellknown Five Precepts form the minimum code of ethics that every lay Buddhist is expected to adhere toIts first precept involves abstention from injury to lifeIt is explained as the casting aside of all forms of weapons being conscientious about depriving a living being of lifeIn its positive sense it means the cultivation of compassion and sympathy for all living thingsThe Buddhist layman is expected to abstain from trading in meat tooThe Buddhist monk has to abide by an even stricter code of ethics than the laymanHe has to abstain from practices which would involve even unintentional injury to living creaturesFor instance the Buddha promulgated the rule against going on a journey during the rainy season because of possible injury to worms and insects that come to the surface in wet weatherThe same concern for nonviolence prevents a monk from digging the groundOnce a monk who was a potter prior to ordination built for himself a clay hut and set it on fire to give it a fine finishThe Buddha strongly objected to this as so many living creatures would have been burnt in the processThe hut was broken down on the Buddhas instructions to prevent it from creating a bad precedent for later generationsThe scrupulous nonviolent attitude towards even the smallest living creatures prevents the monks from drinking unstrained waterIt is no doubt a sound hygienic habit but what is noteworthy is the reason which prompts the practice namely sympathy for living creaturesBuddhism also prescribes the practice of metta lovingkindness towards all creatures of all quarters without restrictionThe Karaniyametta Sutta enjoins the cultivation of lovingkindness towards all creatures timid and steady long and short big and small minute and great visible and invisible near and far born and awaiting birthAll quarters are to be suffused with this loving attitudeJust as ones own life is precious to oneself so is the life of the other precious to himselfTherefore a reverential attitude must be cultivated towards all forms of lifeThe Nandivisala Jataka illustrates how kindness should be shown to animals domesticated for human serviceEven a wild animal can be tamed with kind wordsParileyya was a wild elephant who attended on the Buddha when he spent time in the forest away from the monksThe infuriated elephant Nalagiri was tamed by the Buddha with no other miraculous power than the power of lovingkindnessMan and beast can live and let live without fear of one another if only man cultivates sympathy and regards all life with compassionThe understanding of kamma and rebirth too prepares the Buddhist to adopt a sympathetic attitude towards animalsAccording to this belief it is possible for human beings to be reborn in subhuman states among animalsThe Kukkuravatika Sutta can be cited as a canonical reference which substantiates this viewThe Jatakas provide ample testimony to this view from commentarial literatureIt is possible that our own close relatives have been reborn as animalsTherefore it is only right that we should treat animals with kindness and sympathyThe Buddhist notion of merit also engenders a gentle nonviolent attitude towards living creaturesIt is said that if one throws dishwashing water into a pool where there are insects and living creatures intending that they feed on the tiny particles of food thus washed away one accumulates merit even by such trivial generosityAccording to the Macchuddana Jataka the Bodhisatta threw his leftover food into a river in order to feed the fish and by the power of that merit he was saved from an impending disasterThus kindness to animals be they big or small is a source of merit  merit needed for human beings to improve their lot in the cycle of rebirths and to approach the final goal of NibbanaBuddhism expresses a gentle nonviolent attitude towards the vegetable kingdom as wellIt is said that one should not even break the branch of a tree that has given one shelterPlants are so helpful to us in providing us with all necessities of life that we are expected not to adopt a callous attitude towards themThe more strict monastic rules prevent the monks from injuring plant lifePrior to the rise of Buddhism people regarded natural phenomena such as mountains forests groves and trees with a sense of awe and reverenceThey considered them as the abode of powerful nonhuman beings who could assist human beings at times of needThough Buddhism gave man a far superior Triple Refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha these places continued to enjoy public patronage at a popular level as the acceptance of terrestrial nonhuman beings such as devatas and yakkhas did not violate the belief system of BuddhismTherefore among the Buddhists there is a reverential attitude towards specially longstanding gigantic treesThey are vanaspati in Pali meaning lords of the forests As huge trees such as the ironwood the sala and the fig are also recognized as the Bodhi trees of former Buddhas the deferential attitude towards trees is further strengthenedIt is well known that the ficus religiosa is held as an object of great veneration in the Buddhist world today as the tree under which the Buddha attained EnlightenmentThe construction of parks and pleasure groves for public use is considered a great meritorious deedSakka the lord of gods is said to have reached his status as a result of social services such as the construction of parks pleasure groves ponds wells and roadsThe open air natural habitats and forest trees have a special fascination for the Eastern mind as symbols of spiritual freedomThe home life is regarded as a fetter that keeps man in bondage and miseryRenunciation is like the open air nature unhampered by mans activityThe chief events in the life of the Buddha too took place in the open airHe was born in a park at the foot of a tree in Kapilavatthu he attained Enlightenment in the open air at the foot of the Bodhi tree in Bodhgaya he inaugurated his missionary activity in the open air in the sala grove of the Malas in PavaThe Buddhas constant advice to his disciples also was to resort to natural habitats such as forest groves and gladesThere undisturbed by human activity they could zealously engage themselves in meditationEnvironmental pollution has assumed such vast proportions today that man has been forced to recognize the presence of an ecological crisisHe can no longer turn a blind eye to the situation as he is already threatened with new pollutionrelated diseasesPollution to this extent was unheard of during the time of the BuddhaBut there is sufficient evidence in the Pali canon to give us insight into the Buddhist attitude towards the pollution problemSeveral Vinaya rules prohibit monks from polluting green grass and water with saliva urine and fecesThese were the common agents of pollution known during the Buddhas day and rules were promulgated against causing such pollutionCleanliness was highly commended by the Buddhists both in the person and in the environmentThey were much concerned about keeping water clean be it in the river pond or wellThese sources of water were for public use and each individual had to use them with proper publicspirited caution so that others after him could use them with the same degree of cleanlinessRules regarding the cleanliness of green grass were prompted by ethical and aesthetic considerationsMoreover grass is food for most animals and it is mans duty to refrain from polluting it by his activitiesNoise is today recognized as a serious personal and environmental pollutant troubling everyone to some extentIt causes deafness stress and irritation breeds resentment saps energy and inevitably lowers efficiencyThe Buddhas attitude to noise is very clear from the Pali canonHe was critical of noise and did not hesitate to voice his stern disapproval whenever occasion aroseOnce he ordered a group of monks to leave the monastery for noisy behaviorHe enjoyed solitude and silence immensely and spoke in praise of silence as it is most appropriate for mental cultureNoise is described as a thorn to one engaged in the first step of meditation but thereafter noise ceases to be a disturbance as the meditator passes beyond the possibility of being disturbed by soundThe Buddha and his disciples reveled in the silent solitary natural habitats unencumbered by human activityEven in the choice of monasteries the presence of undisturbed silence was an important quality they looked forSilence invigorates those who are pure at heart and raises their efficiency for meditationBut silence overawes those who are impure with ignoble impulses of greed hatred and delusionThe Bhayabherava Sutta beautifully illustrates how even the rustle of leaves by a falling twig in the forest sends tremors through an impure heartThis may perhaps account for the present craze for constant auditory stimulation with transistors and cassettesThe moral impurity caused by greed avarice acquisitive instincts and aggression has rendered man so timid that he cannot bear silence which lays bare the reality of selfawarenessHe therefore prefers to drown himself in loud musicUnlike classical music which tends to soothe nerves and induce relaxation rock music excites the sensesConstant exposure to it actually renders man incapable of relaxation and sound sleep without tranquilizersAs to the question of the Buddhist attitude to music it is recorded that the Buddha has spoken quite appreciatively of music on one occasionWhen Pañcasikha the divine musician sang a song while playing the lute in front of the Buddha the Buddha praised his musical ability saying that the instrumental music blended well with his songAgain the remark of an Arahant that the joy of seeing the real nature of things is far more exquisite than orchestral music shows the recognition that music affords a certain amount of pleasure even if it is inferior to higher kinds of pleasureBut it is stressed that the ear is a powerful sensory channel through which man gets addicted to sense pleasuresTherefore to dissuade monks from getting addicted to melodious sounds the monastic discipline describes music as a lamentThe psychological training of the monks is so advanced that they are expected to cultivate a taste not only for external silence but for inner silence of speech desire and thought as wellThe subvocal speech the inner chatter that goes on constantly within us in our waking life is expected to be silenced through meditationThe sage who succeeded in quelling this inner speech completely is described as a muni a silent oneHis inner silence is maintained even when he speaksIt is not inappropriate to pay passing notice to the Buddhist attitude to speech as wellModeration in speech is considered a virtue as one can avoid four unwholesome vocal activities thereby namely falsehood slander harsh speech and frivolous talkIn its positive aspect moderation in speech paves the path to selfawarenessBuddhism commends speaking at the appropriate time speaking the truth speaking gently speaking what is useful and speaking out of lovingkindness the opposite modes of speech are condemnedThe Buddhas general advice to the monks regarding speech is to be engaged in discussing the Dhamma or maintain noble silenceThe silence that reigned in vast congregations of monks during the Buddhas day was indeed a surprise even to the kings of the timeSilence is serene and noble as it is conducive to the spiritual progress of those who are pure at heartEven Buddhist laymen were reputed to have appreciated quietude and silencePañcangika Thapati can be cited as a conspicuous exampleOnce Mahanama the Sakyan complained to the Buddha that he is disturbed by the hustle of the busy city of KapilavatthuHe explained that he experiences calm serenity when he visits the Buddha in the quiet salubrious surroundings of the monastery and his peace of mind gets disturbed when he goes to the cityThough noise to the extent of being a pollutant causing health hazards was not known during the Buddhas day we have adduced enough material from the Pali canon to illustrate the Buddhas attitude to the problemQuietude is much appreciated as spiritually rewarding while noise condemned as a personal and social nuisanceThe Buddha and his disciples regarded natural beauty as a source of great joy and aesthetic satisfactionThe saints who purged themselves of sensuous worldly pleasures responded to natural beauty with a detached sense of appreciationThe average poet looks at nature and derives inspiration mostly by the sentiments it evokes in his own heart he becomes emotionally involved with natureFor instance he may compare the suns rays passing over the mountain tops to the blush on a sensitive face he may see a tear in a dew drop the lips of his beloved in a rose petal etcBut the appreciation of the saint is quite differentHe appreciates natures beauty for its own sake and derives joy unsullied by sensuous associations and selfprojected ideasThe simple spontaneous appreciation of natures exquisite beauty is expressed by the Elder Mahakassapa in the following wordsAgain the poem of Kaludayi inviting the Buddha to visit Kapilavatthu contains a beautiful description of springThe long poem of Talaputa is a fascinating soliloquyHis religious aspirations are beautifully blended with a profound knowledge of the teachings of the Buddha against the background of a sylvan resortMany more poems could be cited for saintly appreciation of nature but it is not necessary to burden the essay with any more quotationsSuffice it to know that the saints too were sensitive to the beauties and harmony of nature and that their appreciation is colored by spontaneity simplicity and a nonsensuous spiritualityIn the modern age man has become alienated from himself and natureWhen science started opening new vistas of knowledge revealing the secrets of nature one by one man gradually lost faith in theistic religionsConsequently he developed scanty respect for moral and spiritual values as wellWith the advent of the Industrial Revolution and the acquisition of wealth by mechanical exploitation of natural resources man has become more and more materialistic in his attitudes and valuesThe pursuit of sense pleasures and the acquisition of possessions have become ends in themselvesMans sense faculties dominate him to an unrelenting degree and man has become a slave to his insatiable passionsThus man has become alienated from himself as he abandoned himself to the influence of sense pleasures and acquisitive instinctsIn his greed for more and more possessions he has adopted a violent and aggressive attitude towards natureForgetting that he is a part and parcel of nature he exploits it with unrestrained greed thus alienating himself from nature as wellThe net result is the deterioration of mans physical and mental health on the one hand and the rapid depletion of nonreplenishable natural resources and environmental pollution on the otherThese results remind us of the Buddhist teachings in the suttas discussed above which maintain that the moral degeneration of man leads to the decrease of his lifespan and the depletion of natural resourcesMoral degeneration is a doubleedged weapon it exercises adverse effects on mans psychophysical well being as well as on natureAlready killer diseases such as heart ailments cancer diabetes AIDS etc are claiming victims on an unprecedented scaleIn the final analysis these can all be traced to mans moral deteriorationDepletion of vast resources of fossil fuels and forests has given rise to a very severe energy crisisIt cannot be emphasized too strongly that such rapid depletion of nonrenewable natural resources within less than two centuries an infinitesimal fraction of the millions of years taken for them to form is due to modern mans inordinate greed and acquisitivenessA number of simple ancient societies had advanced technological skills as is evident by their vast sophisticated irrigation schemes designed to feed the fundamental needs of several millionsYet they survived in some countries over years without such problems as environmental pollution and depletion of natural resourcesThis was no doubt due to to validity of the philosophy which inspired and formed the basis of these civilizationsIn the present ecocrisis man has to look for radical solutionsPollution cannot be dealt with in the long term on a remedial or cosmetic basis or by tackling symptoms all measures should deal with basic causesThese are determined largely by our values priorities and choices Man must reappraise his value systemThe materialism that has guided his lifestyle has landed him in very severe problemsBuddhism teaches that mind is the forerunner of all things mind is supremeIf one acts with an impure mind iea mind sullied with greed hatred and delusion suffering is the inevitable resultIf one acts with a pure mind iewith the opposite qualities of contentment compassion and wisdom happiness will follow like a shadowMan has to understand that pollution in the environment has been caused because there has been psychological pollution within himselfIf he wants a clean environment he has to adopt a lifestyle that springs from a moral and spiritual dimensionBuddhism offers man a simple moderate lifestyle eschewing both extremes of selfdeprivation and selfindulgenceSatisfaction of basic human necessities reduction of wants to the minimum frugality and contentment are its important characteristicsEach man has to order his life on normal principles exercise selfcontrol in the enjoyment of the senses discharge his duties in his various social roles and conduct himself with wisdom and selfawareness in all activitiesIt is only when each man adopts a simple moderate lifestyle that mankind as a whole will stop polluting the environmentThis seems to be the only way of overcoming the present ecocrisis and the problem of alienationWith such a lifestyle man will adopt a nonexploitative nonaggressive gentle attitude towards natureHe can then live in harmony with nature utilizing its resources for the satisfaction of his basic needsThe Buddhist admonition is to utilize nature in the same way as a bee collects pollen from the flower neither polluting its beauty nor depleting its fragranceJust as the bee manufactures honey out of pollen so man should be able to find happiness and fulfillment in life without harming the natural world in which he livesAll Pali texts referred to are editions of the Pali Text Society LondonAbbreviations used are as followsThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Dhamma is just like this talking in similes because the Dhamma doesnt have anythingIt isnt round doesnt have any cornersTheres no way to get acquainted with it except through comparisons like thisIf you understand this you understand the DhammaDont think that the Dhamma lies far away from youIt lies right with you its about youTake a lookOne minute happy the next minute sad satisfied then angry at this person hating that person Its all Dhamma Venerable Ajahn Chah was a master at using the apt and unusual simile to explain points of DhammaSometimes he would make an abstract point clear with a vivid and simple image sometimes hed tease out the implications of an image in a way that suggested many layers of meaning offering food for continued thoughtIn other words some of his similes provided answers whereas others provoked questionsSince his death several collections of similes have been drawn from his Dhamma talksThe present translation is based primarily on a collection compiled by one of his Thai students Ajahn Jandee in the early years of this decadeI say primarily because I have introduced the following changesAjahn Jandee transcribed his collection directly from recordings of Ajahn Chahs talks with minimal editing and I have tried to follow his example by giving as full and accurate translation as I canThe unpolished nature of some of the similes is precisely what reveals unexpected layers of meaning making them so provocative and I hope that this translation succeeds in conveying some of the same unfinished thoughtprovoking quality in English as wellSeveral people have looked over the original manuscript and have provided helpful recommendations for improving itIn particular I would like to thank Ajahn Pasanno Ginger Vathanasombat and Michael ZollMay all those who read this translation realize Ajahn Chahs original intention in explaining the Dhamma in such simple and graphic termsYour external home isnt your real homeIts your supposed home your home in the worldAs for your real home thats peaceThe Buddha has us build our own homeby letting go till we reach peaceThe streams lakes and rivers that flow down to the ocean when they reach the ocean all have the same blue color the same salty tasteThe same with human beings It doesnt matter where theyre from  when they reach the stream of the Dhamma its all the same DhammaThe Buddha is the Dhamma the Dhamma is the BuddhaThe Dhamma the Buddha awakened to is something always there in the worldIt hasnt disappearedIts like groundwaterWhoever digs a well down to the level of the groundwater will see waterIts not the case that that person created or fashioned the water into beingAll hes done is to put his strength into digging the well so that its deep enough to reach the water already thereSo if we have any discernment well realize that were not far from the Buddha at allWere sitting right in front of him right nowWhenever we understand the Dhamma we see the BuddhaThose who are intent on practicing the Dhamma continuously  wherever they sit stand or walk  are sure to hear the Buddhas Dhamma at all timesThe Buddha is the Dhamma the Dhamma is the BuddhaHe didnt take away the knowledge he awakened toHe left it right hereTo put it in simple terms its like the teachers in schoolsThey havent been teachers from birthThey had to study the course of study for teachers before they could be teachers teaching in school and getting paidAfter a while theyll die away  away from being teachersBut you can say that in a way the teachers dont dieThe qualities that make people into teachers remain right hereIts the same with the BuddhaThe noble truths that made him the Buddha still remain right hereThey havent run off anywhere at allTraining the mind well is a useful activityYou can see this even in draft animals like elephants oxen and water buffaloesBefore we can put them to work we have to train themOnly when theyre well trained can we use their strength and put it to different purposesAll of you know thisA mind well trained is of many times greater valueLook at the Buddha and his noble disciplesThey changed their status from being runofthemill people to being noble ones respected by people all overAnd theyve benefited us in more wideranging ways than we could ever determineAll of this comes from the fact that theyve trained their minds wellA mind well trained is of use in every occupationIt enables us to do our work with circumspectionIt makes us reasonable instead of impulsive and enables us to experience a happiness appropriate to our station in lifeWere like a tree with roots a base and a trunkEvery leaf every branch depends on the roots to absorb nutrients from the soil and send them up to nourish the treeOur body plus our words and deeds our senses of sight hearing smell taste and feeling are like the branches leaves and trunkThe mind is like the roots absorbing nutrients and sending them up the trunk to the leaves and branches so that they flower and bear fruitIts as if you leave home and lose your walletIt fell out of your pocket onto the road away back there but as long as you dont realize what happened youre at ease  at ease because you dont yet know what this ease is forIts for the sake of disease at a later timeWhen you eventually see that youve really lost your money Thats when you feel disease  when its right in your faceThe same holds true with our bad and good actionsThe Buddha taught us to acquaint ourselves with these thingsIf we arent acquainted with these things well have no sense of right or wrong good or badThe cycle of rebirth is like a wagon wheelAn ox is pulling the wagonIf it keeps on pulling the wagon without stop the wagon tracks will keep on erasing the ox tracks without stopThe wagon wheels arent long but theyre roundYou could say that theyre long but their length is roundWe see their roundness but we dont see their lengthAs long as the ox pulls without stopping the wagon wheels turn without stoppingOn a later day the ox stopsIts tiredIt drops the yokeThe ox then goes its way the wagon goes its wayThe wagon wheels stop of their own accordIf you leave them there a long time they disintegrate into earth water wind and fire turning back into grass and dirtIts the same with people who are still making kamma They dont come to closurePeople speaking the truth dont come to closurePeople with wrong views dont come to closureIf you place a large block of ice out in the open sun you can see it deteriorate  in the same way the body ages  bit by bit bit by bitAfter only a few minutes only a few hours it will all melt into waterThis is called khayavaya ending deteriorationThe deterioration of fabricated things has been going on for a long time ever since the world came into beingWhen were born we take on these things as wellWe dont discard them anywhereWhen were born we take on illness aging and deathWe gather them up at the same timeLook at the ways it deteriorates this body of oursEvery part deterioratesHair of the head deteriorates hair of the body deteriorates fingernails and toenails deteriorate skin deterioratesEverything no matter what deteriorates in line with its natureA gun shoots its children  its bullets  outwardWe shoot ours inward into our heartWhen theyre good were shot in the heartWhen theyre bad were shot in the heartTheyre an affair of kamma our childrenThere are good ones there are bad ones but both the good and bad are our children all the sameWhen theyre born look at us The worse off they are the more we love themIf one of them comes down with polio and gets crippled thats the one we love the mostWhen we leave the house we tell the older ones Look after your little sisterLook after this one  because we love herWhen were about to die we tell them Look after herLook after my child Shes not strong so you love her even moreWe human beings dont want sufferingWe want nothing but pleasureBut actually pleasure is nothing but subtle sufferingPain is blatant sufferingTo put it in simple terms suffering and pleasure are like a snakeIts head is suffering its tail is pleasureIts head contains poisonIts mouth contains poisonIf you get near its head itll bite youIf you catch hold of its tail it seems safe but if you hold onto its tail without letting go it can turn around and bite you just the sameThats because both the head of the snake and the tail of the snake are on the same snakeBoth happiness and sadness come from the same parents craving and delusionThats why there are times when youre happy but still restless and ill at ease  even when youve gotten things you like such as material gain status and praiseWhen you get these things youre happy but your mind isnt really at peace because theres still the sneaking suspicion that youll lose themYoure afraid theyll disappearThis fear is the cause that keeps you from being at peaceSometimes you actually do lose these things and then you really sufferThis means that even though these things are pleasant suffering lies fermenting in the pleasureWere simply not aware of itJust as when we catch hold of a snake Even though we catch hold of its tail if we keep holding on without letting go it can turn around and bite usSo the head of the snake and the tail of the snake evil and goodness These form a circle that keeps turning aroundThats why pleasure and pain good and bad are not the pathWe live like a chicken who doesnt know whats going onIn the morning it takes its baby chicks out to scratch for foodIn the evening it goes back to sleep in the coopThe next morning it goes out to look for food againIts owner scatters rice for it to eat every day but it doesnt know why its owner is feeding itThe chicken and its owner are thinking in very different waysThe owner is thinking How much does the chicken weigh The chicken though is engrossed in the foodWhen the owner picks it up to heft its weight it thinks the owner is showing affectionWe too dont know whats going on where we come from how many more years well live where well go who will take us thereWe dont know this at allThe King of Death is like the owner of the chickenWe dont know when hell catch up with us for were engrossed  engrossed in sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideasWe have no sense that were growing olderWe have no sense of enoughWhen were born were already dead you knowAging and death are the same thingIts like a treePart of its the base part of its the end at the tipWhen theres a base theres an endWhen theres an end theres a baseWhen theres no base theres no endWhen theres an end there has to be a baseAn end without a base That cant beThats how it isSo its kind of amusingWhen a person dies were sad and upsetWe sit and cry grieving  all kinds of thingsThats delusionIts delusion you knowWhen a person dies we sob and cryThats the way its been since who knows whenWe dont stop to examine this carefullyActually  and excuse me for saying this  it appears to me that if youre going to cry when a person dies itd be better to cry when a person is bornBut we have it all backwardsWhen a child is born people beam and laugh from happinessBut actually birth is deathDeath is birthThe beginning is the end the end is the beginningWhen we sit in a quiet forest when theres no wind the leaves are stillWhen the wind blows the leaves flutterThe mind is the same sort of thing as leavesWhen it makes contact with an object it vibrates in line with its natureThe less you know of the Dhamma the more the mind vibratesWhen it feels pleasure it dies with the pleasureWhen it feels pain it dies with the painIt keeps flowing on in this wayOur heart when its at normalcy is like rainwaterIts clean water clear pure and normalIf we put green coloring in the water yellow coloring in the water the color of the water turns to green turns to yellowThe same with our mind When it meets with an object it likes its happyWhen it meets with an object it doesnt like it gets murky and uncomfortable  just like water that turns green when you add green coloring to it or yellow when you add yellow coloringIt keeps on changing its colorOur mind when theres no one looking after it is like a child without parents to look after it  an orphaned child a child with no protectorA person without a protector suffers and its the same with the mindIf its not trained if its views arent straightened out into right views its put to a lot of difficultiesWhen suffering arises you have to see that its suffering and to see what this suffering arises fromWill you see anythingIf we look at things in an ordinary way theres no sufferingFor example while were sitting here were at easeBut at another moment we want this spittoon so we lift it upNow things are differentTheyre different from when we hadnt yet lifted up the spittoonWhen we lift the spittoon we sense that were more weighed downTheres a reason for itWhy do we feel weighed down if its not from having lifted the spittoonIf we dont lift it theres nothingIf we dont lift it we feel lightSo whats the cause and whats the resultAll you have to do is observe just this much and you knowYou dont have to go off studying anywhere elseWhen we grasp onto something thats the cause of sufferingWhen we let go theres no sufferingThis is sufferingOrdinary suffering is one thing suffering above and beyond the ordinary is something elseThe regular pains of this bodily fabrication  pains when youre standing pains when youre sitting down pains when youre lying down This sort of thing is ordinary suffering the regular suffering of these bodily fabricationsThe Buddha experienced feelings like theseHe felt pleasures like these pains like these but he realized that they were ordinaryAll these ordinary pleasures and pains he was able to bring to stillness because he understood themHe understood ordinary suffering It was just the way it wasIt wasnt all that strongInstead he kept a lookout for visiting suffering suffering above and beyond the ordinaryIts like when were sick and go to the doctor for a shotThe hypodermic needle gets inserted through our skin and into our fleshIt hurts a little but thats an ordinary thingNo big dealThis is the way it has to be for everybodyThe suffering above and beyond the ordinary is the suffering of upadana or clingingIts like bathing a hypodermic needle in poison and sticking it into the bodyThis doesnt hurt in just an ordinary way this isnt just ordinary sufferingIt hurts enough to kill youSensual desire is something hard to escape fromIts no different from eating meat and getting a piece of meat stuck in your teethBoy does it hurtEven before you finish the meal you have to take a toothpick to get it outOnce its out you feel relieved for a while and you dont want to eat meat anymoreBut when more meat comes your way another piece gets stuck in your teethYou take it out again and you feel relieved againThats all there is to sensual desire nothing more than a piece of meat stuck in your teethYou feel agitated and unsettled and then you get it out of your system in whatever the wayYou dont understand what its all aboutIts crazyIts like a man with a strong thirst from having traveled a long wayHe asks for water but the person with the water tells him You can drink this water if you wantIts color is good its smell is good its flavor is good but its poisonous I want you to knowIt can poison you to death or give you pains like death But the thirsty man wont listen because hes so thirstyOr like a person after surgeryHes been told by the doctors not to drink water but he asks for water to drinkA person thirsty for sensuality is like this thirsty for sights thirsty for sounds for smells for tastes all of which are poisonousThe Buddha tells us that sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas are poisonousTheyre trapsBut we dont listen to himLike the man thirsty for water who wont listen to the warning because his thirst is so great No matter how much trouble or pain hell get into all he asks is for water to drinkHe doesnt care if after he drinks the water hell die or suffer pains like deathAs soon as he gets his hand on a glass he keeps on drinkingA person thirsty for sensuality drinks in sights drinks in sounds drinks in smells drinks in tastes drinks in tactile sensations drinks in ideasThey seem delicious so he keeps on drinking them inHe cant stopHell drink them in until he dies  caught in the act right in the middle of sensualitySensuality is like taking a stick and using it to poke a big red ants nestThe more we poke it the more the red ants come falling on us onto our face into our eyes stinging our ears and eyesBut we dont see the drawbacks of what were doingIts all good as far as we can seeUnderstand that if you dont see the drawbacks of these things youll never work your way free of themAnimals caught in traps and snares sufferTheyre tied down strapped down tightAll they can do is wait for the hunter to come and get themLike a bird caught in a snare The snare pulls at its neck and no matter how much it struggles it cant get freeIt keeps struggling thrashing back and forth but its trappedAll it can do is wait for the hunterWhen the hunter comes thats itThats MaraBirds are afraid of him all animals are afraid of him because they cant get awayOur snares are sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideasThey tie us downWhen were attached to sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas were like a fish on a hook waiting for the fisherman to comeNo matter how much we struggle we cant get awayActually were worse off than a fish on a hookWere more like a frog on a hook  for when a frog swallows a hook it goes all the way down to its gutWhen a fish swallows a hook it goes only as far as its mouthThe Buddhas teachings are direct straightforward and simple but hard for someone whos starting to practice them because his knowledge cant reach themIts like a hole People by the hundreds and thousands complain that the hole is deep because they cant reach to its bottomTheres hardly anybody who will say that the problem is that his arm is shortThe Buddha taught us to abandon evil of every kindWe skip over this part and go straight to making merit without abandoning evilIts the same as saying the hole is deepThose who say their arms are short are rareI once saw a dog who couldnt eat all the rice I had given it so he lay down and kept watch over the rice right thereHe was so full he couldnt eat any more but he still lay keeping watch right thereHe would drift off and get drowsy and then suddenly glance over at the food that was leftIf any other dog came to eat no matter how big or how small hed growl at itIf chickens came to eat the rice hed bark RowfRowfRowfHis stomach was ready to burst but he couldnt let anyone else eatHe was stingy and selfishPeople can be the same wayIf they dont know the Dhamma if they have no sense of their duties to their superiors and inferiors if their minds are overcome by the defilements of greed anger and delusion then even when they have lots of wealth theyre stingy and selfishThey dont know how to share itThey have a hard time even giving donations to poor children or old people who have nothing to eatIve thought about this and its struck me how much theyre like common animalsThey dont have the virtues of human beings at allThe Buddha called them manussatiracchano humancommonanimalsThats the way they are because they lack good will compassion empathetic joy and equanimityThis is like a dog lying on a pile of unhusked riceIts stomach is gurgling  jawk jawk  and it lies there thinking Where can I get something to eat Its stomach is hungry so it jumps off the pile of unhusked rice and goes looking for some garbageTheres food right there in the pile but it doesnt realize itIt doesnt see the riceIt cant eat unhusked riceKnowledge exists but if we dont practice it we dont understand itWere as stupid as the dog on the pile of unhusked riceIts really a pityEdible rice is there but its hidden by the husks  in the same way that release is here but its hidden by our suppositionsThe Buddha said Monks did you see the jackal running around here in the eveningDid you see himStanding still it sufferedRunning around it sufferedSitting down it sufferedLying down it sufferedGoing into the hollow of a tree it sufferedGoing into a cave it felt ill at easeIt suffered because it thought Standing here isnt goodSitting isnt goodLying down isnt goodThis bush isnt goodThis tree hollow isnt goodThis cave isnt good So it kept running all the timeActually that jackal has mangeIts discomfort doesnt come from the bush or the tree hollow or the cave from sitting standing or lying downIt comes from the mangeYou monks are the sameYour discomfort comes from your wrong viewsYou hold onto ideas that are poisonous and so youre tormentedYou dont exert restraint over your senses so you blame other thingsYou dont know whats going on inside youWhen you stay here at Wat Nong Pah Pong you sufferYou go to America and sufferYou go to London and sufferYou go to Wat Bung Wai and sufferYou go to every branch monastery and sufferWherever you go you sufferThis comes from the wrong views that still lie within youYour views are wrong and you hold onto ideas that are poisonous in your heartsWherever you go you sufferYoure like that jackalOnce you recover from your mange though you can be at ease wherever you go at ease out in the open at ease in the wildI think about this often and keep teaching it to you because this point of Dhamma is very usefulWhen we give rise to right view in our hearts we can be at ease wherever we areIts because we still have wrong views still hold onto ideas that are poisonous that were not at easeHolding on in this way is like being a maggotWhere it lives is filthy its food is filthyIts food isnt fit to be food  but it seems fitting to the maggotTry taking a stick and flicking it out of the excrement where its feeding and see what happensItll wiggle and wriggle eager to get back to the pile of excrement where it was beforeOnly then does it feel rightIts the same with you monks and novicesYou still have wrong viewsTeachers come and advise you on how to have right view but it doesnt feel right to youYou keep running back to your pile of excrementRight view doesnt feel right because youre used to your old pile of excrementAs long as the maggot doesnt see the filth in where its living it cant escapeIts the same with usAs long as we dont see the drawbacks of those things we cant escape from themThey make it difficult to practiceIts like rivers that flow down to the lowlandsThey flow down in line with their natureThe Ayutthaya River the Muun River  whatever the river They all flow downhillNone of them flow uphillThats the way they ordinarily areSuppose there were a man standing on the bank of a river watching its current flow swiftly downhill but his thinking is wrongHe wants the river to flow uphillHes going to have to sufferHe wont find any peaceSitting standing walking lying down he wont find any peaceWhy is thatBecause his thinking is wrongTwo people see a chicken and a duckThe first person wants the chicken to be a duck and the duck to be a chicken but it simply cant beThroughout their life it cant happenIf the first person doesnt stop thinking in this way hell have to sufferThe second person sees the chicken as a chicken and the duck as a duckThat way theres no problemWhen your views are right theres no sufferingThe same holds hereAnicca  things that are inconstant  we want to make constantAs long as theyre inconstant were sadThe person who sees that inconstant things are simply inconstant can be at easeTheres no problemEver since the day of our birth weve been running away from the truthWe dont want things to be the way they are but we cant stop them from being that wayThats just the way they areThey cant be any other wayIts like trying to make a duck be the same as a chickenItll never be the sameIts a duckOr like trying to make a chicken be the same as a duck Itll never be the sameIts a chickenWhoever thinks that he wants to change things like this will have to sufferBut if you think Oh thats just the way it is you gain strength  for no matter how much you try you cant make the body permanent or lastingA monk who claimed to be a meditator once came and asked to live here with meHe asked about the way we practice and I told him If you live with me you cant keep money or stored up thingsI follow the VinayaHe said that he practiced nonattachmentI said I dont know what you meanSo he asked If I use money but without attachment can I stay hereSo I said SureIf you can eat salt but it doesnt taste salty then you canIf you simply claim to be unattached because you dont feel like observing these bothersome rules then it would be difficult to stay hereBut if you can eat salt without its tasting salty then Ill believe youCan you really eat a halfbushel of salt without its tasting saltyThis business of nonattachment isnt something you can just talk about or guess aboutIf you talk like this you cant live with meSo he leftWhatever there is in the mind If our reasons arent yet good enough we cant let it goIn other words there are two sides this side here and that side therePeople tend to walk along this side or along that sideTheres hardly anybody who walks along the middleIts a lonely pathWhen theres love we walk along the path of loveWhen theres hatred we walk along the path of hatredIf we try to walk by letting go of love and hatred its a lonely pathWe arent willing to follow itThings are simply the way they areThey dont give us sufferingLike a thorn Does a sharp thorn give us sufferingNoIts simply a thornIt doesnt give suffering to anybodyIf we step on it we suffer immediatelyWhy do we sufferBecause we stepped on itSo the suffering comes from usLetting go actually means this Its as if were carrying a heavy rockAs we carry it we feel weighed down but we dont know what to do with it so we keep on carrying itAs soon as someone tells us to throw it away we think EhIf I throw it away I wont have anything left So we keep on carrying itWe arent willing to throw it awayEven if someone tells us Come onThrow it awayItll be good like this and youll benefit like that were still not willing to throw it away because were afraid we wont have anything leftSo we keep on carrying it until were so thoroughly weak and tired that we cant carry it anymoreThats when we let it goOnly when we let it go do we understand letting goWe feel at easeAnd we can sense within ourselves how heavy it felt to carry the rockBut while we were carrying it we didnt know at all how useful letting go could beThe Buddha teaches us to escape through discernmentIts like having a tiny splinter or thorn in our footAs we walk along there are times when it hurts and times when it doesntIf we ram it into a stump it hurtsSo we feel around on our foot but dont feel the splinter so we let the matter goAfter a while were walking along and we stub our toe on a bump and the splinter starts hurting againThis keeps happening over and over againWhyBecause the splinter or thorn is still in our footIt hasnt yet come outThe pain keeps coming backWhen it hurts we feel for the splinter but we cant find it so we let the matter goAfter a while it hurts again so we feel for it againThis keeps happening again and againWhen pain arises we have to determine what it isWe dont have to just let it goWhen our foot hurts OhThat damned thorn is still thereWhen the pain comes the desire to take out the thorn comes along with itIf we dont take it out the pain will keep coming back and back and backOur interest in getting the thorn out is still there all the timeEventually the day will come when we decide no matter what that weve got to get it out because it hurtsOur determination to put energy into the practice has to be like thisWherever theres interference wherever theres discomfort we have to examine things right there solve the problem right there  solve the problem of the thorn in our foot by digging it right outAs long as you dont see the dangers of these things enough to let them go dont see the rewards that will come when you do your work wont achieve any purposeIts as if youre just playing around with these things scratching at them with your fingernailsIf we see their drawbacks clearly see the rewards that come from letting it go clearly  AhIts like when you go trapping fish with a basketYou keep at it until you sense theres something in your basketYou can hear the noise as it bangs against the side of the basketYou think its a fish so you put your hand into your basket and grope around but what you catch hold of isnt a fishIts something else that lives in the waterYour eyes cant see what it isPart of you thinks it might be an eel part of you thinks it might be a snakeYoud regret letting it go if it actually was an eelBut if its a snake and you keep holding on its going to bite youUnderstandYoure in doubt because things arent clearYour desire is so strong that you hold onto it in case its an eelAs you pull it up out of the water and see the pattern on the back of its neck you immediately let goTheres nobody there to tell you Thats a snakeLet goLet go Nobody tells youThe mind tells itself  even more clearly than if someone else were to tell itWhy is thatBecause you see the danger The snake can biteWho needs to tell this mindIf you train it until it knows in this way it wont hold onAbout anatta In simple terms this means notself But it depends on there being a sense of self it depends on there being a sense of attaThats why theres anattaAnd its a correct anatta tooWhen theres no atta anatta doesnt appearFor example You dont have this spittoon in your house so the affairs of this spittoon dont bother youWhether it breaks or gets cracked or gets stolen by thieves none of these things bother your heart  because theres no cause no conditionHow is thatBecause theres no spittoon in your houseIf theres a spittoon in your house thats a sense of self arisingWhen the spittoon breaks it hits youWhen it gets lost it hits you  because the spittoon now has an ownerThats called attaThats the state it hasAs for the state of anatta it means that theres no spittoon in your house so theres no mind state that has to keep watch over the spittoon and protect it no fear that thieves will steal itThose states are no longer thereThese things are called statephenomenaThere are causes and conditions but theyre simply there thats allIll give you a simple comparisonSuppose youve bought a banana or a coconut in the market and you walk along carrying itSomeone asks you Why did you buy the bananaI bought it to eat itBut do you have to eat the peel tooNoI dont believe youIf youre not going to eat the peel why are you carrying it tooOr suppose youre carrying a coconutWhy are you carrying the coconutIm carrying it home to make a curryAnd youre going to curry the husk tooNoThen why are you carrying itSoHow are you going to answer his questionThrough desireIf theres no desire you cant give rise to ingenuity to discernmentThats the way it is as we make an effort in our meditationEven though we do this through letting go its like the banana or the coconut Why are you carrying the peel or the huskBecause the time hasnt come yet to throw it awayIts still protecting the inner fleshThe time hasnt come yet to throw it away so you hold onto it for the time beingThe same with our practice Suppositions and release have to be mixed together just as the coconut has a husk mixed together with a shell and the flesh so you carry them all togetherIf they accuse us of eating the coconut husk so whatWe know what were doingThe Dhamma is like doing mathTheres multiplication division addition and subtractionIf we can think in this way well be intelligentWe know the right time and place for thingsWe subtract when we should subtract multiply when we should multiply divide when we should divide add together when we should add togetherIf we multiply every time our hearts will die from the burdenIn other words we have no sense of enoughNo sense of enough means no sense that were growing oldAnyone with a sense of growing old is a person with a sense of enoughWhen theres enough the words Okay thats plenty can make their way upIf theres not enough that okay cant make its way up because we keep on wanting to takeWeve never thrown anything away let anything go put anything downWere always takingIf we can okay were at easeThats enoughYou may say Dont break my glass But you cant prevent something breakable from breakingIf it doesnt break now itll break later onIf you dont break it someone else willIf someone else doesnt break it one of the chickens willThe Buddha says to accept thisHe penetrated all the way to seeing that this glass is already brokenThis glass that isnt broken he has us know as already brokenWhenever you pick up the glass put water in it drink from it and put it down he tells you to see that its already brokenUnderstandThe Buddhas understanding was like thisHe saw the broken glass in the unbroken oneWhenever its conditions run out itll breakDevelop this attitudeUse the glass look after itThen one day it slips out of your hand Smash No problemWhy no problemBecause you saw it as broken before it brokeSeeBut usually people say Ive taken such good care of this glassDont ever let it break Later on the dog breaks it and you hate the dogIf your child breaks it you hate him tooYou hate whoever breaks it  because youve dammed yourself up so that the water cant flowYouve made a dam without a spillwayThe only thing the dam can do is burst rightWhen you make a dam you have to make a spillway tooWhen the water rises up to a certain level it can flow off safely to the sideWhen its full to the brim it can flow out the spillwayYou need to have a spillway like thisSeeing inconstancy is the Buddhas spillwayWhen you see things this way you can be at peaceThats the practice of the DhammaIf you do merit for the sake of putting an end to suffering you have to make merit and develop skillful qualities in the mind at the same timeIf you dont develop skillful qualities no discernment will ariseMerit on its own is like raw meat or raw fishIf you just let it sit out like that it goes rottenBut if you salt it itll last for a long timeOr the same if you put it in the refrigeratorOnce weve abandoned doing evil then even when we make merit only a bit at a time theres still hope that our perfections will grow fullLike a basin set upright out in the open Even if rain falls only a drop at a time theres a chance that the basin will get fullBut if we make merit without abandoning evil its like putting a basin upsidedown out in the openWhen the rain falls it still lands on the bottom of the basin but on the outside bottom not on the insideTheres no way the water will fill the basinIf we do evil and then try to plug the leak by doing good its like plugging a leak in the bottom of a pot and pouring water inOr like plugging a leak in the bottom of a basin and pouring water inThe bottom of the pot the bottom of the basin isnt in good shapeOur abandoning of evil isnt yet in good shapeIf you pour water in it all still seeps out and the basin goes dryEven if you pour water in all day it still seeps out bit by bit and eventually theres no water leftYou dont gain the benefits from it that you wantedWhen no forms of evil are in our hearts all our troubles disappearA sense of coolness arises because we look after ourselvesThe mind becomes virtuousWhen it grows still it becomes concentratedWhen its still it starts to bloom into discernmentWe know how to make the mind clear and brightWhatevers evil we let goWhatevers wrong we put asideWe contemplate and put things aside let them goIts kind of like water in a jarWe take out a dipperful and then throw it awayTake out a second dipperful and throw it away  keep on taking out water and throwing it awayThe water in the jar will eventually go dryThe mind that enters into the practice is like thatBut if we dont see things in this way its like adding water to the jar and then taking it out adding water and then taking it outMerit evil merit evil wrong right wrong right good bad good bad at ease for a moment and then we sufferYou schoolteachers are a mold for forming people so you should turn toward the direction of the Dhamma and practice the DhammaBehave yourselves in a way that can be an example for othersYoure like a mold for making Buddha amuletsHave you ever seen oneJust a single mold They carve it well carving the face the eyebrows the chin so that they arent crooked or missing anything so that the Buddha amulets they stamp out of it will come out beautifulAnd when they come out they really are beautiful because of that one good moldIts the same with schoolteachers who are molds for their students and for people at largeYou have to make yourselves beautiful in terms of the personal qualities of a good teacherYou always have to behave in line with your ethical discipline and the pattern of a leader and guideAbandon all forms of intoxication and unskillful behaviorTry to restore high standards of moralityYou have to be a good example to the childrenChildren are like vinesWherever a vine sprouts up it has to look for a tree to climb upIf one tree is centimeters away and another meters away which tree do you think the vine will climb upItll climb up the nearest treeIts probably not going to climb up the tree meters away because that one is too far offIn the same way schoolteachers are the people closest to their studentsTheyre the people who children are most likely to take as examplesSo its essential that you schoolteachers have good manners and standards of behavior  in terms of what you should do and should abandon  for children to seeDont teach them just with your mouthsThe way you stand the way you walk the way you sit  your every movement your every word  you have to make into a teaching for the childrenTheyll follow your example because children are quick to pick things upTheyre quicker than adultsLots of people come here with a high position in society and views about things about themselves about the practice of meditation about the Buddhas teachingsSome of them are wealthy merchants some have degrees some are teachers or government officialsTheir brains are full of views about all kinds of thingsTheyre too clever to listen to other peopleIts like water in a cupIf the cup is full of dirty water it cant be used for anythingOnly when you pour out the water can the cup be put to useYou have to empty your mind of views before you can learnOur practice steps beyond both cleverness and stupidityIf you think Im smartIm richIm importantI understand all the Buddhas teachings clearly youll never see the truth of anatta or notselfYoull have nothing but self  me and mineBut the Buddhas teachings are the abandoning of selfEmptinessFreedom from sufferingTotal disbandingThats nibbanaIf a mango is five meters off the ground and we want it we cant use a tenmeter picking pole to pick it because its too longWe cant use a twometer picking pole either because its too shortDont go thinking that a person with a PhDhas an easy time practicing the Dhamma because he knows so muchDont go thinking that waySometimes people with a PhDare too longThe teachings Ive given you today If listening to this Dhamma has made your mind empty and still thats good enoughYou dont have to memorize anythingSome of you may not believe thisIf you make your mind still and then allow whatever you hear to pass by pass by but you keep on contemplating youre like a tape recorderWhenever its open like this turned on like this its all right hereDont be afraid that there wont be anythingEvery time you open your recorder turn on your recorder everythings right thereExternal recorders can run downAfter youve bought them they can run downBut your inner recorder when things go straight to the heart Oh its really goodIts there all the time and it doesnt use up your batteriesIn the Buddhas time there were those who broke through to the highest level of Dhamma while sitting and listening to the DhammaThey were fastLike a balloon The air in the balloon has the force to push itself outAs soon as you prick it just a little bit with a needle it all comes gushing out at onceIts the same hereWhen you hear Dhamma in line with your propensities it turns your views upside down from this to that and you can break through to the genuine DhammaAn ox thats been pulling a loaded wagon a long way  the closer the sun lowers to the horizon and evening comes on the faster it walks because it wants to reach its destination quicklyIt misses its homeWe human beings the older we get the sicker we get the closer we are to dying Thats the time when you have to practiceYou cant make old age and illness an excuse not to practice or else youll just be worse than an oxEach of us here is the sameWere no different from one anotherWe have no teacher at present  for if youre going to awaken to the Dhamma the heart has to teach itselfIf it doesnt teach itself then no matter how much you have other people teach you it wont listen it wont understandThe heart itself has to be the teacherIts not easy for us to see ourselvesIts hardSo think about this a little bitWeve all done evilNow that were old we should stopMake it lighterMake it lessTheres really nothing elseThis is all there isTurn your minds in the direction of virtueWater is different from oil just as smart people are different from stupid peopleThe Buddha lived with sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas but he was an arahant so he saw these things as just that thats allHe kept on letting go ever since he saw that the heart was just that  the heart thats all thoughts were just that  thoughts thats allHe didnt mix them togetherIf you can think in this way if you can feel in this way you can keep these things separateThoughts and feelings are on one side the heart is on another side just as water and oil in the same bottle stay separateOnce youve been ordained in the Buddhas teachings youve been supposed into being a monkBut youre not yet a genuine monk you knowYoure a monk as far as your body the shaved head the yellow robesYoure a monk on the level of suppositionIts the same as when they carve wood sculpt cement or mold bronze to be a Buddha on the level of suppositionIts not the genuine BuddhaThose who are still monks just on the level of supposition  in other words they still have greed anger and delusion in their hearts These things keep us fenced into states of becoming and birthThe reason we cant reach peace is because of greed anger and delusionIf you take the greed anger and delusion out of your heart youll reach purityYoull reach genuine monkness  which means being a monk in your heartIts good to make the mind pure and at peace but its hardYou have to start with the externals  your bodily actions and words  and work your way inThe path that leads to purity to being a contemplative is a path that can wash away greed anger and delusionYou have to exercise restraint and selfcontrol which is why its hard  but so what if its hardIts like taking wood to make a table or make a chairIts hard but so what if its hardThe wood has to go through that processBefore it can become a table or a chair we have to go through the coarse and heavy stagesIts the same with usWe have to become skillful where we arent yet skillful admirable where we arent yet admirable competent where we arent yet competentWhen lots of us come to live together its easy to practice if our views are correct and in line with one anotherWhen were willing to bend and abandon our pride in the same way we all come together at the level of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaYou cant say that having a lot of monks interferes with your practiceIts kind of like a millipedeA millipede has lots of legsWhen you look at it you think that its sure to get all confused with so many legsBut it walksIt walks back and forth and theres really no confusionIt has its rhythm its orderIts the same with the Buddhas teachings If you practice like a disciple of the Buddha its easyIn other words you practice rightly practice straightforwardly practice to gain release from suffering and practice correctlyEven if there are hundreds of us thousands of us however many of us it doesnt matterWe can all fall into the same currentOur routines give us lots of strengthWherever in the monastery you can do them  regardless of whether its your own hut or someone elses If its dirty or messy straighten it outYou dont have to do it for anyones sakeYou dont have to do it to impress anyoneYou do it for the sake of your practiceWhen we sweep our huts sweep our buildings its as if we sweep all the dirty things out of our hearts because were people who practiceI want each of us to have this attitude in our heartsThen we wont have to ask for harmony or cooperationItll already be thereThe Buddha our Teacher said that the way things go is up to themIf we stick with our effort in the practice we cant control whether itll go quickly or slowlyIts like planting a pepper treeThe tree knows what its doingIf we want it to grow fast we have to know that thats an affair of delusionIf we want it to grow slowly we have to know that thats an affair of delusionOnly when we actually plant it will we get the fruit that we wantWhen we plant a pepper tree our duty is to dig the hole give the tree water give it fertilizer get rid of the insects for itThats allThats what depends on us depends on our convictionAs for whether the peppers will appear or not thats up to the treeIts not up to usWe cant pull on the tree to make it growVirtue concentration and discernment These three things the Buddha called a pathThe path isnt the religion and its not what the Buddha really wanted but theyre the way we get thereIts the same as your coming from Bangkok to Wat Nong Pah PongYou didnt want the road coming hereYou wanted to reach the monastery insteadBut the road was needed for you to get hereThe road coming here isnt the monasteryIts just the road to the monasteryYou have to follow the road to get to the monasteryVirtue concentration and discernment are the road to peace which is what we really wantIts like a doctor handing a bottle of medicine to a patient with a feverOn the outside of the bottle is a label telling the different diseases the medicine can cureAs for the medicine that cures the diseases its inside the bottleIf the patient spends all his time reading the label  even if he reads it a hundred times a thousand times  hell end up dying and never get any benefit out of the medicineHell then go around making a big fuss complaining that the doctor is bad the medicine cant cure the diseases its claimed to cure even though he never opened the cap on the bottle to take the medicineThe practice is like a man rubbing fire sticks togetherHes heard people say Take two pieces of bamboo and rub them together and youll get fire So he takes two pieces of bamboo and rubs them togetherBut his heart is impatientAfter rubbing them together a bit he wants there to be fireHis heart keeps pushing for the fire to come quickly but the fire just wont comeHe starts getting lazy so he stops to restThen he tries rubbing the sticks together again for a little bit and then stops to restWhatever warmth there was disappears because the warmth isnt connectedIf he keeps acting like this stopping whenever he gets tired  although just being tired isnt so bad His laziness gets mixed in too so the whole thing goes to piecesHe decides that there is no fire he doesnt want fire after all so he gives upHe stopsHe wont rub the sticks anymoreThen he goes about announcing There is no fireYou cant get it this wayThere is no fireIve already triedPractice is like a key the key of meditationIt doesnt matter what the lock is like for we have the key to the lock in our handWe dont care how tight the lock may be for whenever we turn the key to open the lock we accomplish our purposeIf the lock doesnt have a key we cant accomplish our purposeWhatevers locked in the box we cant get it outIts the same as wherever fire is burning wherever its hot thats where it goes outWherever its hot you make it cool right thereIn the same way nibbana lies in the same place as samsara the round of wanderingon samsara lies in the same place as nibbanaJust as hot and cold lie in the same place Cold lies where its hotWhen it gets hot the cold disappearsWhen it the cold disappears it gets hotTo practice is to go against the flow against the flow of the currents in our heart against the flow of defilementAnything that goes upstream against the flow is bound to be hardIf you row a boat upstream its hardTo build goodness and virtue is a little bit hard because we people have defilementsWe dont want to do itWe dont want to be botheredWe dont want to build enduranceWe want for the most part to let things flow in line with our moodsLike water It flows in line with its waysIf we let things flow in line with the water its easy but its not practiceWith practice you have to resistYou have to resist defilement resist your own heart force your own heart increase your powers of enduranceThats when your practice will go against the flowDefilements are like catsIf you give a cat something to eat whenever it wants itll keep coming back more and more oftenBut the day will come when itll scratch you if you dont feed itSo you dont have to feed itItll keep meowing and meowing but if you dont feed it for a day or two itll stop coming backIts the same with the defilementsIf you dont feed them they wont bother youYour mind can then settle down and be stillSome people come and practice to get nothing but pleasureBut what does pleasure come fromWhat is its causeAll forms of pleasure have to come following from painOnly then can there be pleasureWhatever we do We have to work first before we get the wages to buy things dont weWe have to work in the fields before we get rice to eatEverything has to go through pain and suffering firstHave you ever eaten sugarcaneWhen you eat from the tip to the base what is it likeThe closer you get to the base the sweeter it becomes  to the point where even when theres only an inch left you dont want to throw it awayIt seems such a wasteThe ants want to eat it but you wont let them have itSo let your practice be like thatPractice the Dhamma like a person eating sugarcaneAs for the practice start out by establishing your powers of endurance and then contemplateContemplate your activities your comings and goingsContemplate what youre up toWhatever arises the Buddha has us know all aroundWhatever direction things come in from he has us know all aroundIf we know all around whatever comes in this way we see itWhatever comes in that way we see itRight we knowWrong we knowHappy we knowGlad we knowWe know all aroundBut our minds when they contemplate arent yet all aroundWe know just this side but leave that side wide openIts like putting a fence around a field or around a house but it doesnt go all aroundIf we put it up just on that side thieves will come in this side the side that the fence hasnt gone aroundWhy is thatWe havent closed the gateOur fence isnt yet goodSo its normal that theyll have to come through that openingSo we contemplate again adding more fence closing things off continuallyPutting up a fence means establishing mindfulness and always being alertIf we do this the Dhamma wont go anywhere elseItll come right hereGood and bad the Dhamma we should see and should know will arise right hereIn practicing dont think that you have to sit in order for it to be meditation that you have to walk back and forth in order for it to be meditationDont think like thatMeditation is simply a matter of practiceWhether youre giving a sermon sitting here listening or going away from here keep up the practice in your heartBe alert to whats proper and whats notDont decide that its okay to observe the ascetic practices during the Rains retreat and then drop them when the retreat is overIts not okayThings dont balance out in that wayIts like clearing a fieldWe keep cutting away cutting away and then stop to rest when were tiredWe put away our hoe and then come back a month or two laterThe weeds are now all taller than the stumpsIf we try to clear away the area we cleared away before its too much for usAjaan Mun once said that we have to make our practice the shape of a circleA circle never comes to an endKeep it going continuallyKeep the practice going continually without stopI listened to him and I thought When Ive finished listening to this talk what should I doThe answer is to make your alertness akaliko timelessMake sure that the mind knows and sees whats proper and whats not at all timesThe Buddha taught that this is the way the mind and body areThis is the way theyll continue to beThey wont be any other wayIn other words at first they arise then they grow old then they hurt and then they dieThis is such a genuine truth grandma that youre experiencing in the presentIts a noble truthSo look at it with discernment in order to see it thats allEven if fire burns your house even if water floods your home have it go only as far as the house only as far as your homeIf fire burns dont let it burn your heartIf water floods dont let it flood your heartLet it flood just the houseLet it burn just the house which is something that lies outside your bodyAs for your heart have it let go for nows the proper timeIts time to let goPractice by letting goDont hold onOr if you hold on dont hold on tightDo you understand not holding onThis glass here We hold on to it to pick it up and look at itWhen we know all about it we put it downThats called not holding on  in other words holding on but not holding on tightYou hold on to take a look and to know and then you put it downYoure at easeIts the same with thisI came to live in a monastery ordained as a novice when I was nineI kept trying to practice but I didnt understand much of anything in those daysI came to understand only when I was ordained as a monkOhoI saw the fear in everythingI looked at the sensuality with which people live and instead of seeing it as fun as they did I saw it more as sufferingIts like a custard bananaWhen we eat it its nice and sweetWe know the sweetness of its tasteBut if we know that someone put poison in that banana we dont care how sweet it is if we know that well die when we eat it rightThats the way my views always wereAs I was about to eat Id always see the poison placed inside itThats how I kept pulling further and further away to the point where Ive stayed ordained for these many yearsOnce you see that sort of thing doesnt tempt you to eatThere have been some scholarly monks whove researched in the texts who have studied a lotI tell them to give the meditation a tryThis matter of going by the book When you study you study in line with the texts but when you go into battle you have to go outside of the textsIf you simply fight in line with the texts youll be no match for the enemyWhen things get serious you have to go outside of the textsThose who study the texts and those who practice the Dhamma tend to misunderstand each otherThose who study the texts tend to say Monks who do nothing but practice simply speak in line with their views They say that without any evidence of any kindTheres actually a way in which both sides are the same thing which helps us to understand things betterIts like the palm of your hand and the back of your handWhen you stick your hand out straight ahead of you its as if the palm has disappearedBut actually it hasnt disappeared anywhereIts just hidden underneathIn the same way when you turn your hand palmup the back of your hand disappearsBut actually it hasnt disappeared anywhereIts just underneathYou should remember this when you contemplate practicingIf you think that your practice has dwindled away you stop studying and set your hopes on getting resultsBut no matter how much youve studied the Dhamma you wont understand because you dont yet know in line with the truthOnce you understand the true nature of the Dhamma you begin to let goThis is a willingness to strip away attachments where you dont hold on to anything anymoreOr if you do hold on itll gradually grow less and lessThis is the difference between study and practiceStopPut your scholarly knowledge in a bundle or a trunkDont bring it out to speakYou cant bring that kind of knowledge into hereHere its a new kind of knowledgeWhen things actually arise its not the same sort of thingIts like writing the word greed When greed arises in the heart its not the same as the written wordThe same when youre angry When you write anger on the blackboard its one thingIts lettersWhen it arises in the heart its too fast for you to read anythingIt comes up in the heart all at onceThis is importantVery importantIts the same with dependent coarisingIgnorance is the condition for fabricationsFabrications are the condition for consciousnessConsciousness is the condition for name and form Weve studied this and memorized it and its true the way the Buddha has divided things up like this for students to studyBut when these things actually arise theyre too fast for you to countIts like falling from the top of a tree  thump to the groundWe dont know which branches weve passedThe moment the mind is struck by a good object if its something it likes it goes straight to good It doesnt know the connecting steps in betweenThey follow in line with the texts but they also go outside of the textsThey dont say Right here is ignoranceRight here is fabricationRight here is consciousnessRight here is name and form They dont have signs for you to readIts like falling out of a treeThe Buddha talks about the mental moments in full detail but I use the comparison with falling out of a treeWhen you slip out of a tree  thump you dont measure how many feet and inches youve fallenAll you know is youve crashed to the ground and are already hurtingExercising the body to strengthen it and exercising the mind to strengthen it are the same sort of thing but the methods are differentIn exercising the body you have to move the different parts but in exercising the mind you make it stop and rest as when you do concentrationTry to get the mind to let go of everythingDont let it think about this that or anything at allGet it to stay with one objectItll then gain strengthDiscernment will ariseIts like having a knife that youve kept well sharpenedIf you just keep on using it to cut stones cut bricks cut grass cut without choosing the knife will lose its edgeMake sure you practice every day every dayWhen you feel lazy keep doing itWhen you feel diligent keep doing itPractice the Dhamma whether its day or nightWhen the mind is at peace keep doing itWhen it isnt at peace keep doing itIts like when you were a child learning how to writeAt first the letters didnt look prettyTheir bodies were too long their legs were too longYou wrote like a childWith time though the letters looked better because you practicedConcentration and discernment have to go togetherIn the first stage the mind will go into peace and quiet through the methods of concentrationThe mind will be able to stay quiet only when you sit with your eyes closedThats tranquilityYou have to depend on concentration as a foundation to help give rise to discernment or insight in the endThen the mind will stay quiet whether youre sitting with your eyes closed or walking in the middle of a frenzied cityIts the same as this Once you were a childNow youre an adultThe child and the adult are the same personIn the same way you could say that tranquility and insight are separate thingsOr like food and excrement You can say that theyre the same thing but looking from another angle you can say that theyre differentMeditation is like a stickInsight lies on this end of the stickTranquility lies on that end of the stickIf you lift this stick up will one end of the stick come up with it or will both ends come upIf you lift it up both ends will come up with itWhatevers insight whatevers tranquility its all this mindSuccess in the practice is connected with discernment insight meditation where discernment and the mind stay togetherSome people dont have to do very much and yet these things come together on their ownPeople with discernment dont have to do much at allConcentration is like being an artistYou look at something and you understand itYou understand it until it stays there in your heartYou can paint a picture out of whats in your heartYou dont have to sit right there in front of it and paint it from sightThe person who doesnt understand is the one who has to sit there sketching until it seeps into his heartWith discernment you dont have to sit there and sketchYou look and you understandYou can paint straight from your understandingThats the way it isThe object of your tranquility meditation if its not in line with your character wont give rise to dispassion or chastened dismayThe object in line with your character is the one you find yourself thinking about oftenWe dont usually notice this but we should notice this to get some benefit out of itIts like lots of different foods arranged on a trayYou taste the food from each bowl each type of food and youll know for yourself which ones you like which ones you dontThe ones you like youll say are more delicious than the othersHere Im speaking about the foodYou can compare it to your meditationWhichever object is in line with your character will feel comfortableThe way to focus your mind on an object to catch hold of the object is to acquaint yourself with your mind and to acquaint yourself with your objectsIts like the way men catch a lizardThe lizard lies inside the hollow of a termites nest with six holesThe men close off five of the holes leaving just one hole for the lizard to come outThen they sit there watching that one holeWhen the lizard comes out they can catch itYou focus on the mind in just the same wayClose off your eyes close off your ears close off your nose close off your tongue close off your body and leave just the mind openIn other words exercise restraint over your senses and focus just on the mindMeditation is like men catching a lizardYou focus your mind on the breath being mindful and careful to be awareWhatever youre doing be alert to what youre doingThe feeling that arises in the mind at that moment is that youre alert to what youre doingThat feeling is what makes you awareStart out by contemplating your own mindAlways be careful to look after your five preceptsIf you make a mistake stop come back and start over againMaybe youll go astray and make another mistakeWhen you realize it come back start over again each and every timeYour mindfulness will gain a higher frequency like water poured from a kettleIf we tilt the kettle just a little the water comes out in drops glug glug glugThere are breaks in the flowIf we tilt the kettle a little bit more the drops become more frequent glugglugglugIf we tilt the kettle even further the glugs disappear and the water turns into a continuous streamThere are no more drops but they didnt go anywhereTheyre so frequent that theyve turned into a continuous stream of waterTheyve become so frequent that theyre beyond frequencyThey meld into one another in a stream of waterIts the same with the practiceWhen we keep watch over our mind when awareness keeps watch over its own mind whoever keeps track of the mind will escape from Maras snaresIts like keeping herd on a water buffaloone rice plantstwo buffalothree buffalos ownerThe buffalo wants to eat the rice plantsThe rice plants are what the buffalo wants to eatThe mind is like the buffaloIts objects are like the rice plantsAwareness is like the buffalos ownerWhen we keep herd on a buffalo we have to follow it to make sure it doesnt eat the rice plantsWe let it loose but we try to keep watch over itIf it gets near the rice plants we yell at itWhen the buffalo hears us itll back offBut we cant be complacentAt the very least dont take a nap in the middle of the dayIf you take a nap in the middle of the day the rice plants will be all gone for sureThe mind is like the buffaloIts objects are like the rice plantsAwareness is like the buffalos ownerWhat do you do when you keep herd on a buffaloYou let the buffalo loose but you try to keep watch over itIf it gets near the rice plants you yell at itWhen the buffalo hears you itll back offBut you cant be complacentIf its stubborn and wont listen to you you have to take a heavy stick and really beat itAnd then where do you think itll goSo in this practice were told to sitThats the practice of sittingAnd then you keep watchingThere will be good moods and bad moods all mixed together in line with their normal natureDont simply praise your mind dont simply punish itHave a sense of time and place with itWhen the time comes to praise it give it a little praise  just enough dont spoil itIts like teaching a childSometimes you have to spank itTake a small switch and spank itYou cant not spank itIn other words you have to punish it sometimesBut you cant keep punishing it all the timeIf you punish it all the time itll simply go astrayIf you keep on giving it pleasure keep on giving it rewards it wont be able to get anywhereThe standard way to sit in concentration is to sit with your legs crossed right leg on top of the left leg right hand on top of the left handSit up straightSome people say you can do it walking you can do it sitting so can you do it kneelingSure  but youre beginning studentsWhen you learn how to write you have to practice making clear letters first with all their partsOnce you understand your letters and youre writing just for yourself to read you can write in a scrawl if you wantIts not wrongBut you have to learn the standard form firstSit watching your inandout breathStay relaxed and comfortable but dont let yourself get distractedIf youre distracted stopLook to see where the mind went and why it isnt following the breathGo looking for it and bring it backGet it to keep running along with the breath and one of these days youll come across something goodBut keep on doing what youre doingDo it as if youre not expecting to get anything from it nothing will happen you dont know whos doing it  but you keep on doing itIts like taking rice from the granary and sowing it on the groundIt looks like youre throwing it awayYou scatter it all over the ground as if youre not interested in itBut itll turn into sprouts and plantsYou put the plants in the paddies and in return you get to eat rice treatsThats just how it goesSometimes the breath isnt rightIts too long too short and it puts you in a frenzyThats because youre fixing your mind too strongly on it youre squeezing it too muchIts like teaching a child how to sitIf you beat it every time will it become intelligentYoure controlling it too muchIts the same hereThink about it When you walk from your house to your orchard or from your house to your workplace why arent you irritated by the breathBecause you dont grab hold of itYou leave it alone in line with its affairsThe parts of the body that hurt are because you focus and fix your mind on them too stronglyWatch the breathFocus on the breathGather the mind at the breathIn other words make it aware at the breath in the presentYou dont have to be aware of a lot of thingsFocus on inclining the mind inclining the mind to get more and more refined more and more refined continually continually until the feeling of the breath is very subtle and the mind is extremely awakeAny pains that arise in the body will gradually grow still gradually grow stillEventually youll be watching the breath like a relative whos come to visit youYou go with him to send him off at the bus station or the boat dockYou accompany him to the bus to the boatOnce they start up the motor the bus or boat goes running off and you stand there watching it go off into the distanceWhen your relative has gone you go back homeIts the same with watching the breathWhen the breath is coarse we knowWhen its refined we knowAs it gets more and more refined we keep watching watching following it inclining the mind inclining the mind making the mind more and more awake letting the breath grow more and more refinedEventually the breath will grow so subtle that theres no more inandout breathTheres just a sense of awakeIf youre forgetful for a minute youre crazy for a minuteIf your mindfulness lapses two minutes youre crazy for two minutesIf it lapses for half a day youre crazy for half a dayThats how it isMindfulness means keeping something in mindWhen you do or say anything you have to remember to be alertWhen youre doing something youre alert to what youre doingKeeping this in mind is like having things for sale in your houseYou keep watch over your things over the people coming to buy your things and over the thieves coming to steal your thingsIf you always keep track of these things youll know what each person is coming forWhen you keep your weapon in your hands like this  in other words you keep watching  then when thieves see you they wont dare do anything to youIts the same with the objects of the mindIf youre mindful and alert they wont be able to do anything to youYou know A good object like this wont put you in a good mood foreverIts not for sureIt can disappear at any timeSo why should you hold onto itI dont like this Its not for sureWhen this is the case objects are simply null and void thats allWe keep teaching ourselves this way we keep being mindful we keep looking after ourselves continually by day by night whatever the timeMake your mind aware and awakeKeep looking after itIf anyone comes to visit wave them awayTheres no place for them to sit for theres only one seatTry to sit here receiving visitors all day longThis is whats meant by buddho Stay firmly right hereKeep this awareness going so that it can look after the mindAs you sit right here all the visitors that have been coming to visit since way back when  when you were born little and tiny  will come right here where you buddho all by yourselfAs for the guests the visitors that come wandering by fabricating all kinds of different things you let them go along in line with their own issuesThe act of the minds going along with them is called a cetasikaWhatever it is wherever its going who caresJust acquaint yourself with the visitors who want to come and stayYou have only one seat to receive them so you put one person there all the timeThe others will have no place to sitNow when they come here and talk to you they dont get to sit down anymoreThe next time they come whenever they come they keep finding the person sitting here who never goes awayHow many more times will they keep on coming if all they get to do is talk to youYoull get to know them all all those whove been coming since way back when you were first aware of thingsTheyll all come to visitWhen mindfulness and the mind in charge come together theres a kind of feelingIf the mind is ready to be at peace itll be caged in a peaceful place like a chicken weve put into a cageThe chicken doesnt leave the cage but it can walk back and forth in the cageIts walking back and forth is no problem for its walking back and forth in the cageThe feelings of the mind when we use mindfulness to keep it at peace the feelings in that peaceful place arent anything that will stir us upIn other words when it feels when it thinks let it feel within the peaceIts no problemIts as if a mischievous child is having some fun irritating us until we have to yell at it and spank itWe have to understand that thats simply the nature of the childWhen you understand this you can let the child go ahead and playYour sense of bother and irritation will disappear because youre willing to accept the nature of the childThats how your feelings about the matter changeWhen we accept the nature of things we can let them go leave them aloneOur mind can be peaceful and coolThis means that we understand correctlyWe have right viewThats the end of the problems we have to solveRemember this All the objects of the mind regardless of whether theyre things you like or things you dont like are like poisonous cobrasIf they attack and bite you you can dieObjects are like cobras whose poison is fierceThe objects we like have lots of poisonThe objects we dont like have lots of poisonThey can keep the mind from being freeThey can make it go astray from the principles of the Buddhas DhammaObjects and moods of the mind are like cobras whose poison is fierceIf nothing gets in the way of the cobra it slithers along in line with its natureEven though it contains poison it doesnt show itIt doesnt cause us any danger because we dont get near itThe cobra just goes along in line with its cobra affairsIt keeps going that wayIf youre intelligent you leave everything aloneYou leave good things alone you leave bad things alone you leave the things you like alone in the same way you leave a poisonous cobra aloneYou let it slither along on its wayIt slithers along even though it contains poisonTry to see these things clearly in yourself Thats called paccattamWhatever outside object comes in and makes contact itll always be paccattam without stopTo put it in simple terms its like firing charcoal or bricksHave you ever seen a kiln for firing charcoal or bricksThey build a fire about a meter outside the mouth of the kiln and the kiln draws the smoke and the fire inside itselfLook at it in that wayIts clear in that wayThis is a comparisonIf you build your kiln for firing charcoal or bricks in the right way to the right specifications you build a fire about a meter or a meter and a half outside the mouth of the kilnWhen the smoke starts coming up itll all get drawn into the kiln without any left outsideThe heat goes in builds up in the kiln and doesnt escape outsideThe heat goes in and burns things very quicklyThats the way it isThe same with the feelings of a person who practices Theres a feeling that everything gets drawn into being right viewThe eye sees forms the ear hears sounds the nose smells aromas the tongue tastes flavors and all of them get drawn into being right viewThere will be a contact that gives rise to discernment that way continually at all timesUse your stillness to contemplate sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas that make contact regardless of whether theyre good or bad happy or sadIts as if a person has climbed a mango tree and is shaking it so that the mangoes fall to the groundWere under the tree gathering up the mangoesWe dont take the ones that are rottenWe take only the ones that are goodIt doesnt waste our strength because we havent climbed the mango treeWe just pick up whats on the groundI got a good example from watching spidersA spider makes a web like a netIt weaves its web and spreads it at different openingsI once sat and contemplated oneIt hung up its web like a movie screen and when it was done it curled itself up quietly right in the middle of the webIt didnt run aroundAs soon as a fly or another insect flew into its web the web would vibrateAs soon as the web vibrated the spider came running out of its place and caught the insect for foodWhen it was finished it curled itself up in the middle of the web as beforeIt didnt matter what kind of insect got caught in its web a bee or whatever As soon as the web vibrated the spider ran out to catch itThen it would go back and hold on quiet in the middle of the web where no one could see it every timeSeeing the spider act in this way I came to an understandingThe six sense spheres are the eye ear nose tongue body and mindThe mind stays in the middleThe eye ear nose tongue and body are spread out like a netSense objects are like insectsAs soon as a sight comes to the eye or a sound to the ear an aroma to the nose a taste to the tongue or a tactile sensation to the body the mind is what knowsThings vibrate right to the mindJust this is enough to give rise to an understandingWe can live by curling up inside just as the spider curls up on its webWe dont have to go anywhereWhen insects run into the net and it vibrates to the heart then as soon as were aware we go out and catch the insectsThen we return to our original placeAfter watching the spider you can apply what youve learned to your mindIts the same sort of thingIf the mind sees inconstancy stress and notself its spread wide openIts no longer the owner of happiness no longer the owner of suffering for it sees clearly in this wayIt gets the pointWhatever you do youre at easeYou dont want anything else anymoreYour meditation can do nothing but progressIll give you a simple exampleIts like wild chickensWe all know what wild chickens are likeTheres no animal in the world more wary of human beingsWhen I first came to this forest I taught the wild chickensI observed them and learned many lessons from themAt first only one of them would come past me while I was doing walking meditationWhen it came close I didnt look in its directionWhatever it did I didnt look in its directionI didnt make any movement that would startle itAfter a while I tried stopping still and looking at itAs soon as my eyes hit it it ran right offWhen I stopped looking at it it would start scratching in the dirt looking for food as beforeBut every time I looked at it it would run right awayAfter a little while it probably came to notice how quiet I was so it let down its guardBut as soon as I tossed some rice in its direction it ran right offBut I didnt careI just kept tossing some rice out for itAfter a while it would come back but it didnt dare eat the riceIt didnt know what it wasIt thought I was planning to kill it and curry itBut I didnt care whether it ate or notAfter a while it started scratching around in the dirt right thereIt probably began to get a sense of what the rice wasThe next day it came back to the same place and got to eat rice againWhen the rice was gone I tossed out some more for itIt ran off againBut when I kept doing this again and again it got so that it would walk off only a little way and then come right back and eat the riceThats when it understoodAt first the chicken saw the rice as an enemy because it wasnt acquainted with itIt didnt see it clearlyThats why it kept running offBut as it grew more tame it came back to see what the rice actually wasThats when it knew This is riceThis isnt an enemyIts not dangerous Thats how the wild chickens here came to eat rice from that day up to the presentIn this way I learned a lesson from the wild chickensWere just like themSights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas are means for giving us knowledge of the DhammaThey give lessons to anyone who practicesIf we see them clearly in line with the truth well see that thats how they areIf we dont see them clearly theyll always be our enemies and well keep running away from them all the timeLet me give you an exampleSuppose you have a pet monkey at homeIt doesnt sit stillIt likes to jump around and grab hold of this and that  all kinds of thingsThats how monkeys areNow you come to the monasteryWe have a monkey here too and this monkey doesnt stay still eitherIt jumps around and grabs things just the same but it doesnt irritate you does itWhyBecause youve had a monkeyYou know what monkeys are likeThe one at my home is just like your monkey here at the monasteryYour monkey is just like my monkeyTheyre the same monkey If you know just one monkey no matter how many provinces you go to no matter how many monkeys you see they dont irritate you rightThats someone who understands monkeysIf we understand monkeys then we wont become monkeysIf you dont understand monkeys then as soon as you see a monkey you become a monkey yourself rightWhen you see it grabbing this and that you think Grrr You get angry and irritatedThat damned monkey Thats someone who doesnt understand monkeysSomeone who understands monkeys sees that the monkey at home and the monkey at Wat Tham Saeng Phet are the same monkey so why should they irritate youWhen you see that thats what monkeys are like thats enoughYou can be at peaceIf the monkey runs around its only the monkey runningYou dont become a monkey tooYoure at peaceIf it jumps in front of you and behind you you dont get irritated by the monkeyWhyBecause you understand monkeys and so you dont become a monkeyIf you dont understand monkeys you get irritatedWhen you get irritated you become a monkey  understandThis is how things grow calmWhen we know sense objects observe sense objects Some are likable some are not but so whatThats their businessThats what theyre likeJust like monkeysAll monkeys are the same monkeyWe understand sense objectsSometimes theyre likable sometimes theyre notThats what theyre likeWe have to get acquainted with themWhen were acquainted with them we let them goSense objects arent for sureTheyre all inconstant stressful and notselfWe keep looking at them in that wayWhen the eye ear nose tongue body and mind receive objects coming in we know them just like seeing monkeysThis monkey is just like the monkey at homeThen we can be at peaceCraving and desire lead us to sufferingBut if we contemplate our contemplation leans out from cravingIt contemplates craving and it pulls on the craving shakes it up so that it goes away or lessens on its ownIts like a treeDoes anyone tell it what to doDoes anyone give it hintsYou cant tell it what to doYou cant make it do anythingBut it leans over and pulls itself downWhen you look at things in this way thats DhammaMindfulness and alertness are like two people lifting a heavy logA third person is watching and when he sees that the log is heavy he comes to helpWhen its heavy like that he cant not helpHe has to helpThe person helping here is discernmentIt cant stay stillWhen theres mindfulness and alertness discernment has to run in and join themIts like putting water in a bottle and giving it to someone to drinkOnce hes finished drinking it hell have to come back and ask for more  for the water isnt water in a springIts water in a bottleBut if you show the spring to the person and tell him to get water there he can sit there and keep on drinking water and wont ask you for any more for the water never runs outIts the same when we see inconstancy stress and notselfIt goes deep for we really know we know all the way inOrdinary knowledge doesnt know all the way inIf we know all the way in it never grows staleWhatever arises we know it correctly  and things disbandWe know correctly without stopHave you ever seen flowing waterHave you ever seen still waterIf your mind is peaceful its like still flowing waterHave you ever seen still flowing waterThereYouve only seen flowing water and still waterYouve never seen still flowing waterRight there right where your thinking cant take you where the mind is still but can develop discernmentWhen you look at your mind itll be like flowing water and yet stillIt looks like its still it looks like its flowing so its called still flowing waterThats what its likeThats where discernment can ariseIts like cutting a log throwing it into a canal and letting it flow along with the water in the canalIf it doesnt get wormeaten doesnt rot doesnt get smashed doesnt get snagged on this bank or that bank itll keep flowing down the canalIm convinced that itll ultimately reach the oceanIts the same with usIf we practice in line with the Lord Buddhas way if we follow the path he taught if we correctly follow the current we have to avoid two thingsWhich twoThe two extremes that the Buddha said contemplatives shouldnt get seriously involved withThe first is sensual indulgenceThe second is selftormentThese are the two banks of the canal of the riverThe log flowing down the river following the current of the water is our mindSuffering and mental stress arent for sureTheyre inconstantKeep this point in mindWhen these things arise we know them right now and we let them goThis strength of mind will gradually see more and moreWhen its grown more resilient it can suppress defilements extremely fastAs time passes whatever arises right here disbands right here like waves on the sea coming ashoreAs soon as they reach the shore they simply dissolveA new wave comes and it dissolves tooIt cant go beyond the shoreInconstancy stress and notself are the shore of the seaAs for the sense objects that come passing in thats all there is to themBut when the mind sees and knows everything it doesnt carry the Dhamma along with itLike this saw Theyre going to use it to cut woodWhen all the wood is cut and everything is done they put the saw awayThey dont need to use it anymoreThe saw is the DhammaWe have to use the Dhamma to practice the paths leading to the fruitionsWhen the job is done we put the Dhamma thats there awayLike a saw used to cut wood They cut this piece cut that pieceWhen theyre finished cutting they put the saw away hereWhen thats the case the saw has to be the saw the wood has to be the woodThis is called reaching the point of stopping the point thats really importantThats the end of cutting woodWe dont have to cut wood for weve cut enoughWe take the saw and put it awayFrom time immemorial man has been preoccupied with the pursuit of happiness in life from the cradle to the graveHe works and struggles very hard to attain happiness very often without knowing exactly what happiness means because of his ignorance of the nature of lifeAlthough all religions provide advice and guidelines for their adherents to practice in order to attain happiness in life more often than not these advices and guidelines are ignored owing to mans craving hatred and illusionMany people who experienced frustrations and sufferings hope and pray to find happiness for present life and here after others though enjoying a large measure of happiness on earth are still not contented and crave for eternal bliss in heaven after leaving this worldFor the ordinary man as for the child it is difficult to make a distinction between happiness and pleasureTo him that which gives pleasure give happiness and to be happy is to experience pleasureVery often we consider childhood days to be a period of happinessIn reality as children we do not understand what happiness isUnder the protection of our parents we pass our days in a perpetual round of enjoyment which undoubtedly gives us pleasureAs we enter adolescence changes take place in the mind and physical body causing us to become aware of the existence of the opposite sex and we begin to experience a new kind of attraction giving rise to disturbing emotionsAt the same time curiosity drives us to find out about the facts of life through peer discussion and book readingBefore long we find ourselves on the threshold of adulthood the crucial time in our life when we look for a suitable lifepartner to begin a relationship that will put to the test all the qualities that we have acquired earlier in lifeLove sex and marriage then become matters of great importance that will determine the quality of the married life we will haveYoung people today are exposed to a large variety of Western influences which are disseminated through the mass media such as books and magazines television video cassettes and movies resulting in the acquisition of distorted ideas regarding love sex and marriageThe ageold Eastern moral virtues and values are being gradually eroded in the face of these influencesPractices unheard of and never carried out by the older generation have become common place among young people todayAre the Western influences really responsible for this state of affairs or should the parents be blamed for the misdeeds of their children for not exercising proper control and supervision over themIn this book it is explained that most television programs and movies do not represent the way most decent people in the West think or behave and that there is a vast silent majority of decent couples who are as deeply religious and conservative about love sex and marriage as any Eastern coupleIf young people want to ape the West they are advised to ape this silent majority who are no different from their decent neighbor who lives next door to themModern life is fraught with all kinds of tension and stressDoubtless very often it is tension and stress that creates problems in many a marriageIf a proper analysis is made into the root causes of such social problems as premarital sex teenage pregnancies unhappy marriages and divorces childabuse and wifebattering we inevitably discover that it is due mainly to selfishness and lack of patience tolerance and mutual understandingIn the Sigalovada Sutta the Buddha gives good advice on how to maintain peace and harmony in the home between husband and wife in order to achieve a happy married lifeParental responsibilities for children and the childrens duties toward parents are also clearly mentioned in the Sutta as useful guidelines for the attainment of a happy homeIn this book the VenAuthor stresses the important point that marriage is a partnership of two individuals and that this partnership is enriched and enhanced when it allows the personalities involved to growIn the Buddhist perspective marriage means understanding and respecting each others beliefs and privacyThe present time is most opportune for a book of this nature to be published to provide the followers of the Buddhist religion in particular the young with a clear understanding of lifes important matters like love sex and marriage which will not only help them to live a happy married life but also assist them to lead peaceful and contented livesOn behalf of the Buddhist Missionary Society I wish to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation to many of our devoted members for all the help and services rendered in the preparation of this bookOur special thanks are due to MrVijaya Samarawickrama for undertaking the editorial work MrTeh Thean Choo Miss Quah Pin Pin and MrsChong Hong Choo for their valuable assistance and MrPaw Oo Thett of Burma for the cover designFrom the Buddhist point of view marriage is neither holy nor unholyBuddhism does not regard marriage as a religious duty nor as a sacrament that is ordained in heavenA cynic has said that while some people believe that marriage is planned in heaven others say that it is recorded in hell alsoMarriage is basically a personal and social obligation it is not compulsoryMan and woman must have freedom either to get married or to remain singleThis does not mean that Buddhism is against marriageNobody in this world would say that marriage is bad and there is no religion which is against marriagePractically all living things come into being as a result of sex lifeAmong human beings the institution of marriage has come about so that society guarantees the perpetuation of the human species and also ensures that the young would be cared forThis is based on the argument that children born through the pleasure of sex must be the responsibility of the partners involved at least until they have grown upAnd marriage ensures that this responsibility is upheld and carried outA society grows through a network of relationships which are mutually intertwined and interdependentEvery relationship is a wholehearted commitment to support and to protect others in a group or communityMarriage plays a very important part in this strong web of relationships of giving support and protectionA good marriage should grow and develop gradually from understanding and not impulse from true loyalty and not just sheer indulgenceThe institution of marriage provides a fine basis for the development of culture a delightful association of two individuals to be nurtured and to be free from loneliness deprivation and fearIn marriage each partner develops a complementary role giving strength and moral courage to one another each manifesting a supportive and appreciative recognition of the others skill in caring and providing for a familyThere must be no thought of either man or woman being superior  each is complementary to the other marriage is a partnership of equality gentleness generosity calm and dedicationIn Buddhism one can find all the necessary advice which can help one to lead a happy married lifeOne should not neglect the advice given by the Enlightened Teacher if one really wants to lead a happy married lifeIn His discourses the Buddha gave various kinds of advice for married couples and for those who are contemplating marriageThe Buddha has said If a man can find a suitable and understanding wife and a woman can find a suitable and understanding husband both are fortunate indeedThere are different kinds of love and these are variously expressed as motherly love brotherly love sensual love emotional love sexual love selfish love selfless love and universal loveIf people develop only their carnal or selfish love towards each other that type of love cannot last longIn a true love relationship one should not ask how much one can get but how much one can giveWhen beauty complexion and youth start to fade away a husband who considers only the physical aspects of love may think of acquiring another young oneThat type of love is animal love or lustIf a man really develops love as an expression of human concern for another being he will not lay emphasis only on the external beauty and physical attractiveness of his partnerThe beauty and attractiveness of his partner should be in his heart and mind not in what he seesLikewise the wife who follows Buddhist teachings will never neglect her husband even though he has become old poor or sickI have a fear that the modern girl loves to be Juliet to have a dozen RomeosShe loves adventureThe modern girl dresses not to protect herself from wind rain and sun but to attract attentionShe improves upon nature by painting herself and looking extraordinary GandhiSex by itself is not evil although the temptation and craving for it invariably disturbs the peace of mind and hence is not conducive to spiritual developmentIn the ideal situation sex is the physical culmination of a deeply satisfying emotional relationship where both partners give and take equallyThe portrayal of love by commercial groups through the mass media in what we call western culture is not real loveWhen an animal wants to have sex it shows its love but after having experienced sex it just forgets about loveFor animals sex is just an instinctive drive necessary for procreationBut a human being has much more to offer in the concept of loveDuties and responsibilities are important ingredients to maintain unity harmony and understanding in a relationship between human beingsSex is not the most important ingredient for happiness in a married lifeThose who have become slaves to sex would only ruin love and humanity in marriageApart from that a woman must cease to consider herself as the object of a mans lustThe remedy is more in her hand than in a mansShe must refuse to adorn herself simply to please a man even if he is her husbandIf she wants to be an equal partner with a man she should dress so that her dignity is enhanced and she does not become a sex symbolMarriage for the satisfaction of the sexual appetite is no marriageIt is concupiscenceLove may indeed be a product of sex but the reverse is likewise true sex is an expression of loveIn the ideally happy married life both love and sex are inseparableWe can study the Buddhas teaching regarding the feelings that man and woman have for each otherThe Buddha says that he had never seen any object in this world which attracts mans attention more than the figure of a womanAt the same time the main attraction for the woman is the figure of a manIt means that by nature woman and man give each other worldly pleasureThey cannot gain happiness of this kind from any other objectWhen we observe very carefully we notice that among all the things which provide pleasure there is no other object that can please all the five senses at the same time beside the male and female figuresThe ancient Greeks knew this when they said that originally man and woman were oneThey were separated and the two parts that were divided are constantly seeking to be reunited as man and womanYoung people by nature like to indulge in worldly pleasures which can include both good and bad thingsGood things like the enjoyment of music poetry dance good food dress and similar pursuits do no harm to the bodyThey only distract us from seeing the fleeting nature and uncertainty of existence and thereby delay our being able to perceive the true nature of the selfThe faculties and senses of young people are very fresh and alert they are very keen to satisfy all the five sensesAlmost everyday they plan and think out ways and means to experience some form of pleasureBy the very nature of existence one will never be completely satisfied with whatever pleasure one experiences and the resultant craving in turn only creates more anxieties and worriesWhen we think deeply about it we can understand that life is nothing but a dreamIn the end what do we gain from attachment to this lifeOnly more worries disappointments and frustrationsWe may have enjoyed brief moments of pleasure but in the final analysis we must try to find out what the real purpose of our lives isWhen one ceases to crave for sensual pleasure and does not seek to find physical comfort in the company of others the need for marriage does not ariseSuffering and worldly enjoyment are both the outcome of craving attachment and emotionIf we try to control and suppress our emotions by adopting unrealistic tactics we create disturbances in our mind and in our physical bodyTherefore we must know how to handle and control our human passionWithout abusing or misusing this passion we can tame our desires through proper understandingJohn JRobinson in his book Of Suchness gives the following advice on love sex and married lifeBe careful and discreet it is much easier to get married than unmarriedIf you have the right mate its heavenly but if not you live in a twentyfourhour daily hell that clings constantly to you it can be one of the most bitter things in lifeLife is indeed strangeSomehow when you find the right one you know it in your heartIt is not just an infatuation of the momentBut the powerful urges of sex drive a young person headlong into blind acts and one cannot trust his feelings too muchThis is especially true if one drinks and get befuddled the most lousy slut in a dark bar can look like a Venus then and her charms become irresistibleLove is much more than sex though it is the biological foundation between a man and a woman love and sex get all intertwined and mixed upAlmost everyday we hear people complaining about their marriagesVery seldom do we hear stories about a happy marriageYoung people reading romantic novels and seeing romantic films often conclude that marriage is a bed of rosesUnfortunately marriage is not as sweet as one thinksMarriage and problems are interrelated and people must remember that when they are getting married they will have to face problems and responsibilities that they had never expected or experienced hithertoPeople often think that it is a duty to get married and that marriage is a very important event in their livesHowever in order to ensure a successful marriage a couple has to harmonize their lives by minimizing whatever differences they may have between themMarital problems prompted a cynic to say that there can only be a peaceful married life if the marriage is between a blind wife and a deaf husband for the blind wife cannot see the faults of the husband and a deaf husband cannot hear the nagging of his wifeOne of the major causes of marital problems is suspicion and mistrustMarriage is a blessing but many people make it a curse due to lack of understandingBoth husband and wife should show implicit trust for one another and try not to have secrets between themSecrets create suspicion suspicion leads to jealously jealousy generates anger anger causes enmity and enmity may result in separation suicide or even murderIf a couple can share pain and pleasure in their daytoday life they can console each other and minimize their grievancesThus the wife or husband should not expect to experience only pleasureThere will be a lot of painful miserable experiences that they will have to faceThey must have the strong will power to reduce their burdens and misunderstandingsDiscussing mutual problems will give them confidence to live together with better understandingMan and woman need the comfort of each other when facing problems and difficultiesThe feelings of insecurity and unrest will disappear and life will be more meaningful happy and interesting if there is someone who is willing to share anothers burdenWhen two people are in love they tend to show only the best aspects of their nature and character to each other in order to project a good impression of themselvesLove is said to be blind and hence people in love tend to become completely oblivious of the darker side of each others naturesIn practice each will try to highlight his or her sterling qualities to the other and being so engrossed in love they tend to accept each other at face value onlyEach lover will not disclose the darker side of his or her nature for fear of losing the otherAny personal shortcomings are discreetly swept under the carpet so to speak so as not to jeopardize their chances of winning each otherPeople in love also tend to ignore their partners faults thinking that they will be able to correct them after marriage or that they can live with these faults that love will conquer allHowever after marriage as the initial romantic mood wears off the true nature of each others character will be revealedThen much to the disappointment of both parties the proverbial veil that had so far been concealing the innermost feelings of each partner is removed to expose the true nature of both partnersIt is then that disillusion sets inLove by itself does not subsist on fresh air and sunshine aloneThe present world is a materialistic world and in order to meet your material needs proper financing and budgeting is essentialWithout it no family can live comfortablySuch a situation aptly bears out the saying that when poverty knocks at the door love flies through the window This does not mean that one must be rich to make a marriage workHowever if one has the basic necessities of life provided through a secure job and careful planning many unnecessary anxieties can be removed from a marriageThe discomfort of poverty can be averted if there is complete understanding between the coupleBoth partners must understand the value of contentmentBoth must treat all problems as our problems and share all the ups and downs in the true spirit of a longstanding life partnershipThe Anguttara Nikaya contains some valuable advice which the Buddha gave to young girls prior to their marriageRealizing that there could be difficulties with the new inlaws the girls were enjoined to give every respect to their mothersinlaw and fathersinlaw serving them lovingly as their own parentsThey were expected to honor and respect their husbands relatives and friends thus creating a congenial and happy atmosphere in their new homesThey were also advised to study and understand their husbands natures ascertain their activities characters and temperaments and to be useful and cooperative at all times in their new homesThey should be polite kind and watchful of their husbands earnings and see to it that all household expenditures were properly administeredThe advice given by the Buddha more than twenty five centuries ago is still valid even todayIn view of what has been said about birth and suffering some people have criticized Buddhism saying that is against married lifeThey are wrongThe Buddha never spoke against married lifeHowever he pointed out all the problems difficulties and worries that people would have to face when they take on the responsibility of marriageJust because he warned one against problems in marriage does not mean that the Buddha condemned marriageThe act of marriage itself implies that a person is still more attached to the physical world and since our mental faculties are influenced by craving attachment and human emotions it is but natural that problems would ariseThis happens when we have to consider the need of others and to give in to what others needA deep analysis of the nature of self is important to help us to understand the origin of our problems worries miseries and how to overcome themHere religious advice is important for maintaining a tranquil lifeHowever a man should not become a slave to any religionMan is not for religion religion is for manThat means man must know how to make use of religion for his betterment and for his happiness in a respectable waySimply by following certain religious vows precepts or commandments with blind faith or by force thinking that we are dutybound to observe them will not develop proper understandingOne important aspect of Buddhism is that the Buddha did not impose any religious laws or commandmentsThe Buddha was a unique teacher who had set out a number of disciplinary codes for us to uphold according to our way of lifeThose who follow the precepts observe them voluntarily but not as obligatory religious lawsIt is up to us to follow the advice through our own understanding and experience of what is good for us and for othersThrough trial and error we will learn to follow the advice which will give us just peace and happinessOne should try to understand the nature of the worldly lifeBy knowing that you have to face problems you will be able to strengthen your mind and be more prepared to face the problems that could arise if you get marriedReligion is important to help you overcome your problemsWhatever you learned about religious principle when you were young can be adopted to avoid misunderstanding disappointment and frustrationAt the same time certain good qualities such as patience and understanding which we learned through religion are important assets to help us to lead a peaceful married lifeNormally it is due to a lack of mutual understanding that many married couples lead miserable livesThe result of this is that their innocent children also have to sufferIt is better to know how to handle your problems in order to lead a happy married lifeReligion can help you to do thisOne of the causes of greatest concern among those who do not belong to the nonsemitic religions is the problem of conversion before marriageWhile Buddhists and Hindus never demand that a couple must belong to the same religion before a marriage can be solemnized many others tend to take advantage of this toleranceMarriage contrary to what many romantic novels say does not mean the total and absolute merging of two people to the extent that each loses his or her own identityWhen a religion demands that both partners must have the same religious label it denies the basic human right of an individual to believe what he or she wantsSocieties throughout history have proved that Unity in Diversity is not only possible but desirableOut of diversity comes greater respect and understandingThis should apply to marriage alsoThere are many living examples all over the world where the husband and wife maintain their own beliefs and yet are able to maintain their happy married life without confronting each otherBuddhists do not oppose the existence of other religions even within the same householdUnfortunately this generous attitude has been exploited by unscrupulous religionists who are out to gain converts by all meansIntelligent Buddhists must be aware of this stratagemNo selfrespecting intelligent human being who really understands what he believes according to his own conviction should give up his beliefs merely to satisfy the manmade demands of another religionBuddhists do not demand that their partners embrace BuddhismNeither should they surrender their own beliefsWhen young people are in love they are prepared to make many sacrifices so long as they can get marriedBut after a few years when the real task of building a successful marriage begins frustrations begin to set inWhen a partner who had given up his deepseated religious beliefs for love begins to regret having done so unnecessary misunderstandings ariseThese provide added tensions at a period when there is boredom in a marriageThere will be quarrelsAnd normally one of the main causes of these quarrels will be the question of which religion the children should belong toTherefore it is most important for one to know that if there is a process of conversion involved it must be based on true conviction and not mere convenience or compulsionBuddhists maintain the freedom of the individual to chooseThis principle should be respected by allThere is no specific Buddhist ritual or procedure to conduct a marriageBuddhism recognizes the traditions and cultures practiced by people in different countriesHence Buddhist religious ceremonies differ from one country to anotherIn general practice a religious service for blessing and to give advice to the couple is customarily performed either in the temple or at home to give a greater significance to the marriageNowadays in many countries besides the blessing service religious organizations also have been given the authority to solemnize and register marriages together with the issuance of legal marriage certificatesBy and large the most important point is that the couple should be utterly sincere in their intention to cooperate with and understand each other not only during times of happiness but also whenever they face difficultiesIn the past there was no such thing as a legal registration of marriagesA man and woman mutually decided to accept each other as husband and wife and thereafter they lived togetherTheir marriage was carried out in the presence of the community and separation was rareThe most Important thing was that they developed real love and respected their mutual responsibilitiesA legal registration of marriage is important today to ensure security and to safeguard property and childrenDue to the sense of insecurity a couple performs legal marriages to ensure that they are legally bound not to neglect their duties and not to illtreat each otherToday some couples even draw up a legal contract on what would happen to their property if they are divorcedAccording to Buddhist teaching in a marriage the husband can expect the following qualities from his wifeIn return the wifes expectation from husband isApart from these emotional and sensual aspects the couple will have to take care of daytoday living conditions family budget and social obligationsThus mutual consultations between the husband and wife on all family problems would help to create an atmosphere of trust and understanding in resolving whatever issues that may ariseIn advising women about their role in married life the Buddha appreciated that the peace and harmony of a home rested largely on a womanHis advice was realistic and practical when he explained a good number of daytoday characteristics which a woman should or should not cultivateOn diverse occasions the Buddha counseled that a wife shouldIn the days of the Buddha other religious teachers also spoke on the duties and obligations of a wife towards her husband  stressing particularly on the duty of a wife bearing an offspring for the husband rendering faithful service and providing conjugal happinessSome communities are very particular about having a son in the familyThey believe that a son is necessary to perform their funeral rites so that their afterlife will be a good oneThe failure to get a son from the first wife gives a man the liberty to have another wife in order to get a sonBuddhism does not support this beliefAccording to what the Buddha taught about the law of Karma one is responsible for ones own action and its consequencesWhether a son or a daughter is born is determined not by a father or mother but the karma of the childAnd the wellbeing of a father or grandfather does not depend upon the action of the son or grandsonEach is responsible for his own actionsSo it is wrong for men to blame their wives or for a man to feel inadequate when a son is not bornSuch Enlightened Teachings help to correct the views of many people and naturally reduce the anxiety of women who are unable to produce sons to perform the rites of the ancestorsAlthough the duties of a wife towards the husband were laid down in the Confucian code of discipline it did not stress the duties and obligations of the husband towards the wifeIn the Sigalovada Sutta however the Buddha clearly mentioned the duties of a husband towards the wife and vice versaThe Buddha in reply to a householder as to how a husband should minister to his wife declared that the husband should always honor and respect his wife by being faithful to her by giving her the requisite authority to manage domestic affairs and by giving her befitting ornamentsThis advice given over twenty five centuries ago still stands good for todayKnowing the psychology of the man who tends to consider himself superior the Buddha made a remarkable change and uplifted the status of a woman by a simple suggestion that a husband should honor and respect his wifeA husband should be faithful to his wife which means that a husband should fulfill and maintain his marital obligations to his wife thus sustaining the confidence in the marital relationship in every sense of the wordThe husband being a breadwinner would invariably stay away from home hence he should entrust the domestic or household duties to the wife who should be considered as the keeper and the distributor of the property and the home economicadministratorThe provision of befitting ornaments to the wife should be symbolic of the husbands love care and attention showered on the wifeThis symbolic practice has been carried out from time immemorial in Buddhist communitiesUnfortunately it is in danger of dying out because of the influence of modern civilizationIn the past since the social structure of most communities was different from that we find today a husband and wife were interdependent on each otherThere was mutual understanding and the relationship was stable because each knew exactly what his or her role was in the partnershipThe love that some husbands and wives try to show others by embracing each other in public does not necessarily indicate true love or understandingIn the past although married couples did not express their love or inner feeling publicly they had a deep even unspoken understanding and mutual respect for each otherThe ancient customs which people had in certain countries that the wife must sacrifice her life after her husbands death and also the custom which prevents a widow from remarrying is foreign to BuddhismBuddhism does not regard a wife as being inferior to a husbandSome women feel that for them to concentrate on the upbringing of the family is degrading and conservativeIt is true that in the past women had been treated very badly but this was due more to the ignorance on the part of men than the inherent weakness in the concept of depending on women to bring up childrenWomen have been struggling for ages to gain equality with men in the field of education the professions politics and other avenuesThey are now at par with men to a great extentThe male generally tends to be aggressive by nature and the female more emotionalIn the domestic scene particularly in the East the male is more dominant as head of the family whilst the female tends to remain as passive partnerPlease remember passive here does not mean weak Rather it is a positive quality of softness and gentleness If man and woman maintain their masculine and feminine qualities inherited from nature and recognize their respective strengths then that attitude can contribute towards a congenial mutual understanding between the sexesGandhis remarksI believe in the proper education of womanBut I do believe that woman will not make her contribution to the world by mimicking or running a race with manShe can run the race but she will not rise to the great heights she is capable of by mimicking manShe has to be the complement of manThe basis of all human society is the intricate relationship between parent and childA mothers duty is to love care and protect the child even at extreme costThis is the selfsacrificing love that the Buddha taughtIt is practical caring and generous and it is selflessBuddhists are taught that parents should care for the child as the earth cares for all the plants and creaturesParents are responsible for the wellbeing and upbringing of their childrenIf the child grows up to be a strong healthy and useful citizen it is the result of parents effortsIf the child grows up to be a delinquent parents must bear the responsibilityOne must not blame others or society if children go astrayIt is the duty of parent to guide children on the proper pathA child at its most impressionable age needs the tender love care and attention of parentsWithout parental love and guidance a child will be handicapped and will find the world a bewildering place to live inHowever showering parental love care and attention does not mean pandering to all the demands of the child reasonable or otherwiseToo much pampering would spoil the childThe mother in bestowing her love and care should also be strict and firm in handling the tantrums of a childBeing strict and firm does not mean being harsh to the childShow your love but temper it with a disciplined hand  the child will understandUnfortunately amongst presentday parents parental love is sadly lackingThe mad rush for material advancement the liberation movements and the aspiration for equality have resulted in many mothers joining their husbands spending their working hours in offices and shops rather than remaining at home tending to their offspringThe children left to the care of relations or paid servants are bewildered on being denied tender motherly love and careThe mother feeling guilty about her lack of attention tries to placate the child by giving in to all sorts of demands from the childSuch an action spoils the childProviding the child with all sorts of modern toys such as tanks machine guns pistols swords and such like equipment as an appeasement is not psychologically goodLoading a child with such toys is no substitute for a mothers tender love and affectionsDevoid of parental affection and guidance it will not be surprising if the child subsequently grows up to be a delinquentThen who is to be blamed for bringing up a wayward childThe parents of courseThe working mother especially after a hard days work in an office to be followed by household chores can hardly find time for the child that is yearning for her care and attentionParents who have no time for their children should not complain when these same children have no time for them when they are oldParents who claim that they spend a lot of money on their children but are too busy should not complain when their busy children in turn leave them in expensive Homes for the AgedMost women work today so that the family can enjoy more material benefitsThey should seriously consider Gandhis advice for men to seek freedom from greed rather than freedom from needOf course given todays economic setup we cannot deny that some mothers are forced to workIn such a case the father and mother must make extra sacrifices of their time to compensate for what their children miss when they are awayIf both parents spend their nonworking hours at home with their children there will be greater understanding between parents and childrenIn his discourses the Buddha has listed certain primary duties and functions as essential guidelines for parents to observeOne of the primary guidelines is by precept practice and action to lead the children away from things that are evil and through gentle persuasion to guide them to do all that is good for the family for society and for the countryIn this connection parents would have to exercise great care in dealing with their childrenIt is not what the parents profess but what they really are and do that the child absorbs unconsciously and lovinglyThe childs entry to the world is molded by emulating parental behaviorIt follows that good begets good and evil begets evilParents who spend much time with their children will subtly transmit their characteristics to their offspringIt is the duty of parents to see to the welfare of their childrenIn fact the dutiful and loving parents shoulder the responsibilities with pleasureTo lead children on the right path parents should first set the example and lead ideal livesIt is almost impossible to expect worthy children from unworthy parentsApart from the Karmic tendencies children inherit from previous births they invariably inherit the defects and virtues of parents tooResponsible parents should take every precaution not to transmit undesirable tendencies to their progenyAccording to the Sigalovada Sutta there are five duties that should be performed by parentsHome is the first school and parents are the first teachersChildren usually take elementary lessons in good and evil from their parentsCareless parents directly or indirectly impart an elementary knowledge of lying cheating dishonesty slandering revenge shamelessness and fearlessness for evil and immoral activities to their children during childhood daysParents should show exemplary conduct and should not transmit such vices into their childrens impressionable mindsParents are the teachers at home teachers are the parents in schoolBoth parents and teachers are responsible for the future wellbeing of the children who become what they are made intoThey are and they will be what the adults areThey sit at the feet of the adults during their impressionable ageThey imbibe what they impartThey follow in their footstepsThey are influenced by their thoughts words and deedsAs such it is the duty of the parents to create the most congenial atmosphere both at home and in the schoolSimplicity obedience cooperation unity courage selfsacrifice honesty straightforwardness service selfreliance kindness thrift contentment good manners religious zeal and other kindred virtues should be inculcated in their juvenile minds by degreesSeeds so planted will eventually grow into fruitladen treesA decent education is the best legacy that parents can bequeath to their childrenA more valuable treasure there is notIt is the best blessing that parents could confer on their childrenEducation should be imparted to them preferably from youth in a religious atmosphereThis has farreaching effects on their livesMarriage is a solemn act that pertains to the whole lifetime this union should be one that cannot be dissolved easilyHence marriage has to be viewed from every angle and in all its aspects to the satisfaction of all parties before the weddingAccording to Buddhist culture duty supersedes rightsLet both parties be not adamant but use their wise discretion and come to an amicable settlementOtherwise there will be mutual cursing and other repercussionsMore often than not the infection is transmitted to progeny as wellParents not only love and tend their children as long as they are still in their custody but also make preparations for their future comfort and happinessThey hoard up treasures at personal discomfort and ungrudgingly give them as a legacy to their childrenBuddhism is the religion of compassion and the parents should never forget to present it to the children as suchThe Buddha taught the Dhamma out of compassion for the worldParents should practice the Four Sublime States of Mind taught by the Buddha in raising their childrenThey areThese four states well practiced will help parents remain calm throughout the difficult period of childrearingThis is the right or ideal way of conduct towards living beingsThese four attitudes of mind provide the framework for all situations arising from social contactThey are the great removers of tension the great peacemakers in social conflict the great healers of wounds suffered in the struggle for existence levelers of social barriers builders of harmonious communities awakeners of slumbering magnanimity long forgotten revivers of joy and hope long abandoned promoters of human brotherhood against the forces of egotismPerhaps the greatest challenge that a married couple has to face is the proper upbringing of a childThis is another aspect which distinguishes us from animalsWhile an animal does care for its offspring with great devotion a human parent has a greater responsibility which is the nurturing of the mindThe Buddha has said that the greatest challenge a man faces is to tame the mindEver since a child is born from infancy through adolescence to maturity a parent is primarily responsible for the development of a childs mindWhether a person becomes a useful citizen or not depends mainly on the extent to which its mind has been developedIn Buddhism a good parent can practice four great virtues to sustain him or her and to overcome the great frustrations which are so closely related with parenthoodWhen a child is yet a toddler unable to express its needs it is quite prone to indulge in tantrums and cryingA parent who practices the first virtue of loving kindness can maintain peace within herself or himself to continue to love the child while it is being so difficultA child who enjoys the effects of this loving kindness will himself learn to radiate it spontaneouslyAs the child becomes more mature as an adolescent parents should practice karuna or Compassion towards himAdolescence is a very difficult time for childrenThey are coming to terms with adulthood and therefore are rebellious with a great deal of their anger and frustrations directed at their parentsWith the practice of Compassion parents will understand that this rebelliousness is a natural part of growing up and that children do not mean to hurt their parents willfullyA child who has enjoyed loving kindness and compassion will himself become a better personHaving not had hate directed at him he will only radiate love and compassion towards othersJust before he becomes an adult a child will probably meet with some success in examinations and other activities outside the homeThis is the time for parents to practice sympathetic joyToo many parents in modern society use their children to compete with their associatesThey want their children to do well for selfish reasons it is all because they want others to think well of themBy practicing sympathetic joy a parent will rejoice in the success and happiness of his or her child with no ulterior motiveHe is happy simply because his child is happyA child who has been exposed to the effects of sympathetic joy will himself become a person who does not envy others and who is not overly competitiveSuch a person will have no room in his heart for selfishness greed or hatredWhen a child has reached adulthood and has a career and family of his own his parents should practice the last great virtue of equanimityThis is one of the most difficult things for Asian parents to practiceIt is hard for them to allow their children to become independent in their own rightWhen parents practice equanimity they will not interfere with the affairs of their children and not be selfish in demanding more time and attention than the children can giveYoung adults in the modern society have many problemsAn understanding parent of a young couple should not impose extra burdens by making unnecessary demands on themMost importantly elderly parents should try not to make their married children feel guilty by making them feel that they have neglected their filial obligationsIf parents practice equanimity they will remain serene in their old age and thereby earn the respect of the younger generationWhen parents practice these four virtues towards their children the children will respond favorably and a pleasant atmosphere will prevail at homeA home where there is loving kindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity will be a happy homeChildren who grow up under such an environment will grow up to be understanding compassionate willing workers and considerate employersThis is the greatest legacy any parent can give to his childOne of the saddest things about modern society is the lack of parental love which children in highly industrialized countries suffer fromWhen a couple gets married they usually plan to have a number of childrenAnd once the child is born parents are morally obliged to care for him to the best of their abilityParents are responsible to see that a child is not only satisfied materially the spiritual and psychological aspects are very important tooThe provision of material comfort is of secondary importance when compared to the provision of parental love and attentionWe know of many parents from the notsowelltodo families who have brought up their children well and with plenty of loveOn the other hand many rich families have provided every material comfort for their children but have deprived them of parental loveSuch children will just grow up devoid of any psychological and moral developmentA mother should consider carefully whether she should continue to be a working mother of a housewife giving all the affection and care for the wellbeing of her childThe modern trend and attitude of working mothers towards their children also tends to erode the timehonored filial piety which children are expected to shower on their parentsThe replacement of breastfeeding by bottle feeding could also be another factor which has contributed to the erosion of the affection between mother and childWhen mothers breastfeed and cuddle babies in their arms the tender affection between mother and child is much greater and the influence the mother had on the child for its wellbeing is much more pronouncedUnder such circumstances filial piety family cohesion and obedience are invariably presentThese traditional traits are for the good and wellbeing of the childIt is up to the parents especially the mother to provide themThe mother is responsible for the childs being good or waywardMothers can reduce delinquencyMany parents try to keep their married children under their controlThey do not give due freedom to them and tend to interfere with a young married couples lifeWhen parents try to control their married son or married daughter and want them to follow their way of life strictly this will create a lot of misunderstanding between the two generations as well as unhappiness between the coupleParents may be doing it in good faith due to love and attachment towards the children but in so doing they are inviting more problems to themselves and to the childrenParents must allow their children to shoulder the responsibilities of their own lives and familiesFor example if some seeds are dropped under a tree plants might grow after sometimeBut if you want those plants to grow healthy and independent you must transplant them to open ground somewhere else to grow separately so that they are not hampered by the shade of the parent treeParents should not neglect the ancient wisdom based on advice given by religious teachers wise people and elders who have developed a knowledge of the world through their own trial and errorsDivorce is a controversial issue among the followers of different religionsSome people believe that marriage is already recorded in heaven thus it is not right to grant a divorceBut if a husband and wife really cannot live together instead of leading a miserable life and harboring more jealousy anger and hatred they should have the liberty to separate and live peacefullyHowever the separation of the couple must be done in an atmosphere of understanding by adopting reasonable solutions and not by creating more hatredIf a couple has children they should try to make the divorce less traumatic for the children and help them to adjust to the new situationAnd it is most important to ensure that their future and welfare will be takencare ofIt is an inhuman attitude if the couple desert their children and allow them to lead a miserable lifeIn Buddhism there is no law stating that a husband and wife should not be separated if they cannot live together harmoniouslyBut if people follow the advice given by the Buddha to fulfill their duties towards each other then such unfortunate occurrences like divorce or separation will never happen in the first placeIn the past where religious values were highly respected there were greater efforts on the part of married couples  in the east as well as in west  to reach an amicable understanding to develop happy relationships based on respect love and regard for one anotherCouples developed and made their marriages an important feature which they cherished in their heartsDivorce cases were very rare and were considered a disgrace because they indicated the selfishness of one party or the otherIt is a fact that until recently divorce cases were still rather rare in Buddhist countriesThis is mainly because couples considered their duties and obligations towards each other and also basically divorce is not approved by the community as a wholeIn many cases when married couples were in trouble the community elders usually rallied round and played an important role to improve the situationUnfortunately in the modern society of today divorce has become such a common practiceIn certain countries it has even become fashionableInstead of regarding divorce as shameful or a failure to order their lives some young couples seem to be proud of itThe main cause of the failure in marriage in modern society is the abuse of freedom and too much independence and individualism on the part of the partnersThere must be a limit to their independent lives or else both husband and wife will go astray very easilyTo the question of whether Buddhists can keep more than one wife the direct answer is not available in the Buddhas teaching because as mentioned earlier the Buddha did not lay down any religious laws with regard to married life although he has given valuable advice on how to lead a respectable married lifeTradition culture and the way of life as recognized by the majority of a particular country must also be considered when we practice certain things pertaining to our livesSome religions say that a man can have only one wife whilst others say a man can have more than one wifeAlthough the Buddha did not mention anything regarding the number of wives a man could have he explicitly mentioned in His discourses that should a married man go to another woman out of wedlock that could become the cause of his own downfall and he would have to face numerous other problems and disturbancesThe Buddhas way of teaching is just to explain the situation and the consequencesPeople can think for themselves as to why certain things are good and certain things are badThe Buddha did not lay down rules about how many wives a man should or should not have which people are forced to followHowever if the laws of a country stipulate that marriages must be monogamous then such laws must be complied with because the Buddha was explicit about His followers respecting the laws of a country if those laws were beneficial to allSome religions are not in favor of family planningThey say it is against the will of GodBuddhism does not interfere in this personal choiceMan is at liberty to follow any method in order to prevent conceptionAccording to Buddhism certain physical and mental conditions must be present for conception to take placeWhen any one of these conditions is absent no conception takes place therefore a life does not come into beingBut after conception abortion is NOT acceptable in Buddhism because it means taking away a life that is already present in the form of fetusSome people are interested in the moral implication or religious attitude with regard to testtube babiesIf a woman is unable to conceive a baby in the normal way and if she is anxious to have a baby by adopting modern medical methods there is no ground in Buddhism to say that it is either immoral or irreligiousReligions must give due credit to mans intelligence and to accommodate new medical discoveries if they are harmless and beneficial to mankindAs was mentioned earlier so long as the conditions are right conception can be allowed to take place naturally or artificiallyPremarital sex is a problem which is much discussed in modern societyMany young people would like to know the opinion regarding this sensitive issueSome religionists say it can be considered as committing adultery while others say it is immoral and unjustifiableIn the past young boys and girls were not allowed by their parents to move around freely until they were marriedTheir marriages were also arranged and organized by the parentsOf course this did cause unhappiness in some cases when parents chose partners on the basis of money social status family obligations and related issuesBut generally the majority of parents did try very hard to choose partners who would be acceptable to their childrenToday young people are at the liberty to go out and find their own partnersThey have a lot of freedom and independence in their livesThis is not a bad thing in itself but some of these people are just too young and too immature to see the difference between sexual attraction and true compatibilityThat is why the problem of premarital sex arisesToo much laxity in matters concerning sex has also given rise to social problems in modern societyThe sad part is that some societies do not express liberal attitudes towards unmarried mothers illegitimate children and the divorcees while they are quite liberal about free sexAs a result young people are being punished by the same society which encourages free mixing of the sexesThey become social outcasts and suffer much shame and humiliationMany young girls have become victims of their own freedom and have ruined their future by violating ageold traditions which were valued in the east as well as in the westPremarital sex is a modern development which has come about as a result of excessive social freedom prevalent amongst present day young peopleWhilst Buddhism holds no strong views either for or against such action it is thought that all Buddhists particularly people of both sexes in love and contemplating marriage should adhere to the ageold traditional concept that they maintain chastity until the nuptial dateThe human mind is unstable and forever changing with the result that any illicit action or indiscretion may cause undue harm to either party if the legal marriage does not take place as expectedIt must be remembered that any form of sexual indulgence before a proper marriage is solemnized will be looked down upon by the elders who are the guardians of the young peopleLaymen are advised in the Buddhas Teaching to avoid sexual misconductThat means if one wants to experience sex he must do so without creating any violence or by using any kind of force threat or causing fearA decent sex life which respects the other partner is not against this religion it accepts the fact that it is a necessity for those who are not yet ready to renounce the worldly lifeAccording to Buddhism those who are involved in extramarital sex with someone who is already married who has been betrothed to someone else and also with those who are under the protection of their parents or guardians are said to be guilty of sexual misconduct because there is a rupture of social norms where a third party is being made to suffer as a result of the selfishness of one or the other partnerThe Buddha also mentioned the consequences that an elderly man would have to face if he married without considering the compatibility of age of the other partyAccording to the Buddha irresponsible sexual behavior can become the cause of ones downfall in many aspects of lifeAll the nations of the world have clearly defined laws concerning the abuse of sexHere again Buddhism advocates that a person must respect and obey the law of the country if the laws are made for the common goodThe following are extracts from a book by the celebrated Japanese author DrNikkyo NiwanoIn his book The Richer Life DrNiwano deals with matters relating to love and marriage both from the Eastern and Western points of viewIn the West marriage on the basis of romantic love has often been considered natural and sometimes idealIn Asia in recent years the number of young people who abandon the traditional arranged marriage and select partners out of romantic consideration has been growingBut in some cases romantic marriages lead to separation and unhappiness within a short time whereas the arranged marriage often produces a couple who live and work together in contentment and happinessIn spite of its emotional appeal all romantic marriages cannot be called unqualified successesRomantic love is like the bright flame of a woodfire that leaps up and burns clear but lasts only a short timeLove between man and wife burns quietly and slowly like the warming fire of burning coalOf course bright flaming Love can  and ideally ought to  eventually become the calm enduring fire of mature affectionBut too often the flame of romantic love is quickly extinguished leaving nothing but ashes which are a poor foundation for a successful married lifeYoung people in love think of nothing but their emotionsThey see themselves only in the light of the feeling of the momentEverything they think and do is romantic and has little bearing on the practical affairs of the life they must lead after marriageIf the lovers are fortunate enough to have compatible personalities to have sound and similar ideas about life to share interests to enjoy harmonious family relations on both sides and to be financially secure even after the first passion has calmed down they will still have a basis for a good life togetherIf they are not so blessed they may face marital failureWhen the time of dates emotional pictures dances and parties has passed the young married couples will have to live together share meals and reveal to each other their defects as well as their meritsThey will have to spend more than half of their life each day together this kind of living makes demands that are different from the less exacting needs of dating and first loveFamily relations become very important in married lifeIt is necessary to think about the personalities of the mother and father of the prospective marriage partnerYoung people sometimes think that the strength of their love will enable them to get along well with the most quarrelsome difficult inlaws but this is not always trueIn short romance is a matter of a limited time and does not become rooted in actualities and must be regulated to conform to the needs of work and environment in order to bind the couple together in lasting devotionThe two kinds of love are differentTo mistake one for the other invites grave troubleGiving serious dispassionate thought to the nature of the person one contemplates marrying lessens the likelihood of failureTo prevent romance from vanishing after marriage mutual understanding between the couple is indispensableBut the percentage of successful marriages is higher among young people whose choice of a partner agrees with the opinions of their parentsTo live peacefully it is necessary to realize the difference between romance and married loveCelibacy is refraining from the pleasure of sexual activitySome critics of Buddhism say that The Teaching goes against Nature and they claim that sex life is natural and therefore necessaryBuddhism is not against sex it is a natural sensual pleasure and very much a part of the worldly lifeOne may ask why then did the Buddha advocate celibacy as a preceptIs it not unfair and against NatureWell the observance of celibacy for spiritual development was not a new religious precept at the time of the BuddhaAll the other existing religions in India at that time also had introduced this practiceEven today some other religionists like the Hindus and Catholics do observe this as a vowBuddhists who have renounced the worldly life voluntarily observe this precept because they are fully aware of the commitments and disturbances which come along if one commits oneself to the life of a family personThe married life can affect or curtail spiritual development when craving for sex and attachment occupies the mind and temptation eclipses the peace and purity of the mindPeople tend to ask If the Buddha did not preach against married life why then did He advocate celibacy as one of the important precepts to be observed and why did He advise people to avoid sex and renounce the worldly lifeOne must remember that renunciation is not compulsory in BuddhismIt is not obligatory to renounce the worldly life totally in order to practice BuddhismYou can adjust your way of life according to your understanding by practicing certain religious principles and qualitiesYou can develop your religious principles according to the needs of a lay lifeHowever when you have progressed and attained greater wisdom and realize that the laymans way of life is not conducive for the ultimate development of spiritual values and purification of the mind you may choose to renounce the worldly life and concentrate more on spiritual developmentThe Buddha recommended celibacy because sex and marriage are not conducive to ultimate peace and purity of the mind and renunciation is necessary if one wishes to gain spiritual development and perfection at the highest levelBut this renunciation should come naturally and must never be forcedRenunciation should come through a complete understanding of the illusory nature of the self of the unsatisfactory nature of all sense pleasuresThe Buddha experienced his worldly life as a prince husband and a father before his Renunciation and he knew what married life entailedPeople may question the Buddhas renunciation by saying that he was selfish and cruel and that it was not fair for him to desert his wife and childIn actual fact the Buddha did not desert his family without a sense of responsibilityHe never had any misunderstanding with his wifeHe too had the same love and attachment towards his wife and child as any normal man would have perhaps even greaterThe difference was that his love was not mere physical and selfish love he had the courage and understanding to detach that emotional and selfish love for a good causeHis sacrifice is considered all the more noble because he set aside his personal needs and desires in order to serve all of mankind for all timeThe main aim of his renunciation was not only for his own happiness peace or salvation but for the sake of mankindHad he remained in the royal palace his service would have been confined to only his own family or his kingdomThat was why he decided to renounce everything m order to maintain peace and purity to gain Enlightenment and then to enlighten others who were suffering in ignoranceOne of the Buddhas earliest tasks after gaining his Enlightenment was to return to his palace to enlighten the members of his familyIn fact when his young son Rahula asked the Buddha for his inheritance the Buddha said that Rahula was heir to the richest wealth the treasure of the DhammaIn this way the Buddha served his family and he paved the way for their salvation peace and happinessTherefore no one can say that the Buddha was a cruel or selfish fatherHe was in fact more compassionate and selfsacrificing than anybody elseWith his high degree of spiritual development the Buddha knew that marriage was a temporary phase while Enlightenment was eternal and for the good of all mankindAnother important fact was that the Buddha knew that his wife and son would not starve in his absenceDuring the time of the Buddha it was considered quite normal and honorable for a young man to retire from the life of a householderOther members of the family would willingly look after his dependentsWhen he gained his enlightenment he was able to give them something no other father could give  the freedom from slavery to attachmentMarriage is a partnership of two individuals and this partnership is enriched and enhanced when it allows the personalities involved to growMany marriages fail because one partner tries to swallow another or when one demands total freedomAccording to Buddhism marriage means understanding and respecting each others belief and privacyA successful marriage is always a twoway path humpy bumpy  it is difficult but it is always a mutual pathYoung people in this country and elsewhere sometimes think that old fashioned ideas are not relevant to modern societyThey should be reminded that there are some eternal truths which can never become outofdateWhat was true during the time of Buddha still remains true todayThe socalled modern ideas we receive through the highly glamourous television programs do not represent the way most decent people in the west think or behaveThere is a vast silent majority of decent couples who are as deeply religious and conservative about marriage as any Eastern coupleThey do not behave in the manner that the mass media has portrayed themNot all the people in the west run off to get a divorce or abortion after their first quarrel or disputeDecent people all over the world are the same they are unselfish and care deeply about those whom they loveThey make enormous sacrifices and develop love and understanding to ensure happy and stable marriagesSo if you want to ape the west ape the silent majority they are no different from your decent neighbor who lives next door to youYoung people must also listen to their elders because their own understanding about married life is not matureThey should not make hasty conclusions regarding marriages and divorcesThey must have a lot of patience tolerance and mutual understandingOtherwise their life can become very miserable and problematicPatience tolerance and understanding are important disciplines to be observed and practiced by all people in marriageA feeling of security and contentment comes from mutual understanding which is the SECRET of a HAPPY MARRIED LIFEIn the Buddhist Jataka story  Sonadanda the Bodhisatta sings the virtues of a mother in the following strain Jataka translation VolV pp The most important element of the Buddhist reform has always been its social and moral codeThat moral code taken by itself is one of the most perfect which the world has ever knownOn this point all testimonials from hostile and friendly quarters agree philosophers there may have been religious preachers subtle metaphysicists disputants there may have been but where shall we find such an incarnation of love love that knows no distinction of caste and creed or color a love that overflowed even the bounds of humanity that embraced the whole of sentient beings in its sweep a love that embodied as the gospel of universal Maitri and Ahimsa ProfMax Muller A German Buddhist ScholarBuddhist morality is based on freedom ie on individual developmentIt is therefore relativeIn fact there cannot be any ethical principle if there is compulsion or determination from an agent outside ourselves Anagarika BGovinda A German Buddhist ScholarIn Buddhism there can be no real morality without knowledge no real knowledge without morality both are bound up together like heat and light in a flameWhat constitutes Bodhi is not mere intellectual enlightenment but humanityThe consciousness of moral excellence is of the very essence of Bodhi Bhikkhu Dhammapala A Netherland Buddhist ScholarNow Grandma set your heart on listening respectfully to the Dhamma which is the teaching of the BuddhaWhile Im teaching you the Dhamma be as attentive as if the Buddha himself were sitting right in front of youClose your eyes and set your heart on making your mind oneBring the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha into your heart as a way of showing the Buddha respectToday I havent brought you a gift of any substance aside from the Dhamma of the BuddhaThis is my last gift to you so please accept itYou should understand that even the Buddha  with all his virtues and perfections  couldnt avoid the weakening that comes with agingWhen he reached the age you are he let goHe let go of the fabrications of lifeLetting go means that he put these things downDont carry them aroundDont weigh yourself downAccept the truth about the fabrications of the body whatever they may be Youve relied on them since you were born but now its enoughNow that theyre old theyre like the utensils in your home  the cups the saucers and the plates  that youve held onto all these yearsWhen you first got them they were bright and clean but now theyre wearing outSome of them are broken some of them are lost while the ones remaining have all changedThey havent stayed the sameThats just the way things areThe same holds true with the parts of your bodyFrom the time of birth and on through your childhood and youth they kept changingNow theyre called old So accept the factThe Buddha taught that fabrications arent us they arent ours whether theyre inside the body or outThey keep changing in this wayContemplate this until its clearThis body of yours lying here and decaying is the truth of the DhammaThis truth is a teaching of the Buddha thats certain and sureHe taught us to look at it to contemplate it to accept whats happeningAnd its something you should accept regardless of whats happeningThe Buddha taught when were imprisoned to make sure that its only the body thats imprisonedDont let the mind be imprisonedAnd the same thing applies hereWhen the body wears out with age accept itBut make sure that its only the body thats wearing outMake sure that the affairs of the mind are something else entirelyThis gives your mind energy and strength because you see into the Dhamma that this is the way things areThis is the way they have to beAs the Buddha taught this is the way the body and mind are of their own accordThey cant be any other wayAs soon as the body is born it begins to ageAs it ages it gets sickAfter its sick it diesThis truth is so true this truth youre encountering todayIts the truth of the DhammaLook at it with your discernment so that you seeEven if fire were to burn your house or water were to flood it or whatever the danger that would come to it make sure that its only the house that gets burnedMake sure your heart doesnt get burned along with itIf water floods your house dont let it flood your heartMake sure it floods only the house which is something outside the bodyAs for the mind get it to let go and leave things be  because now is the proper time the proper time to let goYouve been alive for a long time now havent youYour eyes have had the chance to see all kinds of shapes colors and lightsThe same with your other sensesYour ears have heard lots of sounds all kinds of sounds  but they were no big dealYouve tasted really delicious foods  but they were no big dealThe beautiful things youve seen They were no big dealThe ugly things youve seen They were no big dealThe alluring things youve heard were no big dealThe ugly and offensive things youve heard were no big dealThe Buddha thus taught that whether youre rich or poor a child or an adult  even if youre an animal or anyone born in this world Theres nothing in this world thats lastingEverything has to change in line with its conditionThe truth of these conditions  if you try to fix them in a way thats not right  wont respond at allBut there is a way to fix thingsThe Buddha taught us to contemplate this body and mind to see that they arent us they arent ours theyre just suppositionsFor example this house of yours Its only a supposition that its yoursYou cant take it with youAll the belongings that you suppose to be yours are just an affair of suppositionThey stay right where they areYou cant take them with youThe children and grandchildren that you suppose to be yours are just an affair of suppositionThey stay right where they areAnd this isnt just true for youThis is the way things are all over the worldEven the Buddha was this wayEven his enlightened disciples were this wayBut they differed from usIn what way did they differThey accepted thisThey accepted the fact that the fabrications of the body are this way by their very natureThey cant be any other wayThis is why the Buddha taught us to contemplate this body from the soles of the feet on up to the top of the head and from the top of the head on down to the soles of the feetThese are the parts of your bodySo look to see what all is thereIs there anything cleanAnything of any substanceThese things keep wearing down with timeThe Buddha taught us to see that these fabrications arent usTheyre just the way they areThey arent oursTheyre just the way they areWhat other way would you have them beThe way they are is already rightIf youre suffering from this then your thinking is wrongWhen things are right but you see them wrong it throws an obstacle across your heartIts like the water in a river that flows downhill to the lowlandsIt flows in line with its natureThe Ayutthaya River the Muun River whatever the river they all flow downhillThey dont flow uphillThats their natureSuppose a man were to stand on the bank of a river watching the current flowing downhill but his thinking is wrongHe wants the river to flow uphillHes going to sufferHe wont have any peace of mindWhether hes sitting standing walking or lying down he wont find any peaceWhyBecause his thinking is wrongHis thinking goes against the flowHe wants the water to flow uphill but the truth of the matter is that the water cant flow uphillIts not appropriateThe nature of the water is that it has to flow along with the flowThats its natureWhen this is the case the man is upsetWhy is he upsetBecause his thinking is wrong his ideas are wrong all because of his wrong viewRight view sees that water has to flow downhillThis is a truth of the Dhamma that we can contemplate and see that its trueWhen that man sees this truth he can let go  he can let the water flow along with its flowThe problem that was eating away at his heart disappearsWhen the problem disappears theres no more problemWhen theres no problem theres no sufferingIts the same hereThe water flowing downhill is like the life of your bodyAfter its young its oldWhen its old it flows along in its wayDont think that you dont want it to be that wayDont think like thatWe dont have the power to fix itThe Buddha looked at things in line with their conditions that they simply have to be that waySo we let them go we leave them beTake your awareness as your refugeMeditate on the word buddho buddhoEven though youre really tired put your mind with the breathTake a good long outbreathTake a

like to die right now and get it all over with thats not the right way either you knowIt makes you suffer too because fabrications arent yoursYou cant fix them upTheyre just the way they areYou can fix them up a little bit as when you fix up the body to make it look pretty or cleanOr like children They paint their lips and let their nails grow long to make them look prettyBut thats all there is to itWhen they get old they all end up in the same bucketThey fix up the outside but cant really fix thingsThats the way it is with fabricationsThe only thing you can fix is your heart and mindThis house youre living in You and your husband built itOther people can build houses too making them large and lovelyThose are outer homes which anyone can buildThe Buddha called them outer homes not your real homeTheyre homes only in nameHomes in the world have to fall in line with the way of the worldSome of us forgetWe get a big home and enjoy living in it but we forget our real homeWhere is our real homeIts in the sense of peaceOur real home is peaceThis home you live in here  and this applies to every home  is lovely but its not very peacefulFirst this then that youre worried about this youre worried about that This isnt your real homeIts not your inner homeIts an outer homeSomeday soon youll have to leave itYou wont be able to live here anymoreIts a worldly home not yoursThis body of yours that you still see as you and yours is a home that stays with you a whileYou think that its you and yours but its notIt too is a worldly homeIts not your real homePeople prefer to build outer homes they dont like to build inner homesYou rarely see any homes where people can really stay and be at peacePeople dont build themThey build only outer homesThink about it for a minuteHow is your body right nowThink about it from the day you were born all the way up to the present momentWe keep running away from progressWe keep running until were old running until were sickWe dont want things to be that way but we cant prevent itThats just the way things areThey cant be any other wayIts like wanting a duck to be like a chicken but it cant because its a duckIf you want a chicken to be like a duck it cant because its a chickenIf you want ducks to be like chickens and chickens to be like ducks you simply suffer  because these things are impossibleIf you think Ducks have to be the way they are and chickens the way they are they cant be any other way then that kind of thinking gives you energy and strengthNo matter how much you want this body to stay stable and permanent it cant be that wayIts just the way it isThe Buddha called it a fabricationThis fabrication  this bodyandmind  is inconstantIts not dependableIts here and then its notIts born and then it passes awayBut we human beings want it to be constantThats the thinking of a foolJust look at your breathIt goes out and then it comes inIt comes in and then it goes outThats the nature of breathIt has to be that wayIt has to change to go back and forthThe affairs of fabrication depend on changeYou cant have them not changeJust look at your breathCan you keep it from coming inDoes it feel comfortableIf you draw in a breath and then dont let it go out is that any goodEven if you want it to be constant it cant be constantIts impossibleIt goes out and then it comes inIt comes in and then it goes outIts such a normal thingWere born and then we age we age and then we get sick and dieIts so normalBut we dont like itIts as if we wanted the breath to come in and not go out or to go out and not come inWhen it comes in and out out and in we can liveHuman beings and animals have been living right up to the present because fabrications follow their duty in line with their conditionsThats their truthSo we have to see their truth in line with their truthAs with the affair of birth aging illness and death Once were born were already deadBirth and death are all the same thingOne part is the beginning and one part the endJust like a tree When it has a base it has an upper tipWhen it has an upper tip it has a baseWhen theres no base theres no upper tipTheres no upper tip without a baseThats the way things areIts kind of funny you knowWe human beings when somebody dies get all sad and upsetWe cry and grieve  all kinds of thingsIts delusionIts delusion you know to cry and lament when somebody diesThats the way weve been since who knows whenWe hardly ever reflect to see things clearlyIn my opinion and youll have to forgive me for saying this but if youre going to cry when somebody dies itd be better to cry when somebodys bornBut we have things all backwardsIf somebodys born we laugh were happy and gladBut really birth is death and death is birthThe beginning is the end and the end is the beginningWhen someone dies or is about to die we cryThats foolishnessIf youre going to cry itd be better to cry from the very beginningFor birth is deathWithout birth theres no deathDo you understandDeath is birth and birth is deathDont think in a way that puts you in a turmoilJust let things be the way they areThis is your duty nowNo one else can help youYour children cant help you your grandchildren cant help you your wealth cant help youThe only thing that can help you is if you correct your sense of things right nowDont let it waver back and forthLet goLet goEven if we dont let things go theyre already ready to goThe parts of your body are trying to run awayDo you see thisWhen you were young your hair was blackNow its grayThis is how its already running awayWhen you were young your eyes were bright and clear but now theyre blurryDo you see thisTheyre already running awayThey cant hold out any longer so they have to run awayThis is no longer their place to stayEvery part of your body has started running awayWhen you were young were your teeth solid and sturdyNow theyre looseYou may have put in false teeth but theyre something new not the original onesThe original ones have run awayEvery part of your body  of everybodys body  is trying to run awayYour eyes ears nose tongue and body All of these things are trying to run awayWhyBecause this isnt their place to stayTheyre fabrications so they cant stayThey can stay for only a while and then they have to goAnd its not just youEvery part of the body  hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin everything  is getting ready to run awaySome parts have already gone but not yet everythingAll thats left are a few house sittersTheyre looking after the house but theyre no goodThe eyes are no good the teeth are no good the ears are no goodThis bodys no good because the good things have already run awayThey keep running away one after anotherYou have to understand that this is no place for human beings to stayIts just a shelter where you can rest a bit and then you have to move onSo dont let yourself be worried about so many thingsYouve come to live in the world so you should contemplate the world to see that thats the way it is Everythings getting ready to run awayLook at your bodyIs there anything there thats like what it used to beIs the skin like it used to beIs your hair like it used to beAre your eyes like they used to beAre your ears like they used to beAre your teeth like they used to beNo theyre notTheyve run off to who knows whereThis is what their nature is likeOnce theyve served their time they have to goWhy do they have to goBecause thats their dutyThats their truthThis isnt a place where anything can stay permanentlyAnd while theyre staying here theyre a turmoil sometimes pleasant sometimes painful with no respite or peaceIts like a person whos traveling back home but hasnt yet arrivedHes still on the way sometimes going forward sometimes going back a person with no place to stayAs long as he hasnt reached home hes not at his ease no ease while hes sitting no ease while hes lying down no ease while hes walking no ease while hes riding in a carWhyBecause he hasnt yet reached homeWhen we reach our home were at our ease because we understand that this is our homeIts the same hereThe affairs of the world are never peacefulEven if were rich theyre not peacefulIf were poor theyre not peacefulIf were adults theyre not peacefulIf were children theyre not peacefulIf we lack education theyre not peacefulIf were educated theyre not peacefulAll these affairs are not peaceful Thats just the way they areThats why poor people suffer rich people suffer children suffer adults sufferOld people suffer the sufferings of old peopleThe sufferings of children the sufferings of rich people the suffering of poor people Theyre all sufferingEvery part in your body is running away one thing after anotherWhen you contemplate this youll see aniccam Theyre inconstantDukkham Theyre stressfulWhy is thatAnatta Theyre notselfThis body youre living in this body sitting and lying here sick along with the mind that knows pleasure and pain that knows that the body is sick Both of these things are called DhammaThe mental things with no shape that can think and feel are called namaTheyre namadhammaThe things that have physical shape that can hurt that can grow and shrink back and forth Thats called rupadhammaMental things are dhammaPhysical things are dhammaThats why we say we live with the DhammaTheres nothing there thats really usIts just DhammaDhamma conditions arise and then pass awayThey arise and then pass awayThats how conditions areThey arise and then pass awayWe arise and pass away with every momentThis is how conditions areThis is why when we think of the Buddha we can see that hes really worth respecting really worth bowing down to for he spoke the truthHe spoke in line with the truthOnce we see that thats the way it is we see the DhammaSome people practice the Dhamma but dont see the DhammaSome people study the Dhamma practice the Dhamma but dont see the DhammaThey still dont have any place to staySo you have to understand that everybody all the way down to ants and termites and all the other little animals is trying to run awayTheres no one who can stay hereLiving things stay for a while and then they all go rich people poor people children old people even animalsThey all keep changingSo when you sense that the world is like this you see that its disenchantingTheres nothing thats really you or yoursYoure disenchanted  nibbidaDisenchantment isnt disgust you knowIts just the heart sobering upThe heart has seen the truth of the way things are Theres no way you can fix themTheyre just the way they areYou let them goYou let go without gladnessYou let go without sadnessYou just let things go as fabrications seeing with your own discernment that thats the way fabrications areThis is called anicca vata sankhara Fabrications are inconstantThey change back and forthThats inconstancyTo put it in simple terms Inconstancy is the BuddhaWhen we really see that these things are inconstant thats the BuddhaWhen we look clearly into inconstancy well see that its constantHow is it constantIts constant in being that wayIt doesnt change into any other wayHuman beings and animals once theyre born are all that wayTheyre constant in that way  in that theyre inconstantThey keep changing changing from children to young people to old people Thats how theyre inconstantBut the fact that everyone is that way Thats constantThat doesnt changeThings keep changing in that wayWhen you see this your heart can be at peace for its not just youIts everyoneWhen you think in this way its disenchantingNibbida arisesIt cures you of your lust and desire for sensuality for the world for the baits of the worldIf you have a lot of them you abandon a lotIf you have a little you abandon a littleLook at everyoneHave you seen any of these things since you were bornHave you seen poor peopleHave you seen rich peopleHave you seen people who die youngHave you seen people who die oldWeve all seen these thingsTheyre no big dealThe important point is that the Buddha has us build a home for ourselves to build a home in the way Ive described to youBuild a home so you can let go so that you can leave things beLet them go and then leave them beLet the mind reach peacePeace is something that doesnt move forward doesnt move back doesnt stay in placeThats why its peaceIts peace in that its free from going forward free from moving back free from staying in placePleasure isnt a place for you to stayPain isnt a place for you to stayPain wears awayPleasure wears awayOur foremost Teacher said that all fabrications are inconstantSo when we reach this last stage in life he tells us to let go and leave things beWe cant take them with usWell have to let them go anyhow so wouldnt it be better to let them go beforehandIf we carry them around they weigh us downWhen we sense that they weigh us down we wont carry them aroundWouldnt it be better to let them go beforehandSo why carry them aroundWhy be attached to themLet your children and grandchildren look after you while you can rest at your easeThose who look after the sick should be virtuousThose who are sick should give others the opportunity to look after themDont give them difficultiesWherever theres pain learn how to keep your mind in good shapeThose who look after their parents should have their virtues tooYou have to be patient and tolerantDont feel disgustThis is the only time you can really repay your parentsIn the beginning you were children and your parents were adultsIt was in dependence on them that youve been able to grow upThe fact that youre all sitting here is because your parents looked after you in every wayYou owe them a huge debt of gratitudeSo now you should understand that your mother is a childBefore you were her children but now shes your childWhy is thatAs people get older they turn into childrenThey cant remember things their eyes cant see things their ears cant hear things they make mistakes when they speak just like childrenSo you should understand and let goDont take offense at what the sick person says and doesLet her have her way in the same way youd let a child have its way when it wont listen to its parentsDont make it cryDont make it frustratedIts the same with your motherWhen people are old their perceptions get all skewedThey want to call one child but they say another ones nameThey ask for a bowl when they want a plateThey ask for a glass when they want something elseThis is the normal way things are so I ask you to contemplate it for yourselfAt the same time the sick person should think of those looking after herHave the virtue of patience and endurance in the face of painMake an effort in your heart so that it isnt a turmoilDont place too many difficulties on the people looking after youAs for those looking after the sick person have the virtue of not feeling disgust over mucus and saliva urine and excrementTry to do the best you canAll of the children should help in looking after herShes now the only mother you haveYouve depended on her ever since you were born to be your teacher your nurse your doctor  she was everything for youThis is the benefaction she gave in raising youShe gave you knowledge she provided for your needs and gave you wealthEverything you have  the fact that you have children and grandchildren nice homes nice occupations the fact that you can send your children to get an education  the fact that you even have yourself What does that come fromIt comes from the benefaction of your parents who gave you an inheritance so that your family line is the way it isThe Buddha thus taught benefaction and gratitudeThese two qualities complement each otherBenefaction is doing good for othersWhen weve received that goodness received that help Whoever has raised us whoever has made it possible for us to live whether its a man or a woman a relative or not that person is our benefactorGratitude is our responseWhen weve received help and support from benefactors we appreciate that benefactionThats gratitudeWhatever they need whatever difficulty theyre in we should be willing to make sacrifices for them to take on the duty of helping themThis is because benefaction and gratitude are two qualities that undergird the world so that your family doesnt scatter so that its at peace so that its as solid and stable as it isToday Ive brought you some Dhamma as a gift in your time of illnessI dont have any other gift to giveTheres no need to bring you any material gift for you have plenty of material things in your house and over time they just cause you difficultiesSo Ive brought you some Dhamma something of substance that will never run outNow that youve heard this Dhamma you can pass it on to any number of other people and itll never run outItll never stopIts the truth of the Dhamma a truth that always stays as it isIm happy that Ive been able to give you this gift of Dhamma so that youll have the strength of heart to contend with all the things you faceI compiled the Uposatha Sila when I still held the rank of MahaAt that time the manuscript had some errors but now these have been correctedThis text will be used in the curriculum of Nak Dhamm Tri for the men and women who will be taking the examinations though for the laity the subject of lay discipline replaces that of monastic discipline in the examsThe tests will be held every year starting in BEI hope that this translation of the Uposatha Sutta along with its commentary will be of benefit to Englishspeaking Buddhists who are intent on practiceThe original Thai text was compiled by His Eminence Somdet Phra Buddhaghosacaraya of Wat Thepsirintaravas in BE and due to the depth and comprehensiveness of HEs understanding this text has proved useful down to the presentThis text contains many technical Pali terms some of which have been difficult to translate accuratelyFor example some Pali terms dealing with Vinaya are still used today but the true meanings have long been lost or misusedIt is auspicious that this translation will be finished in time to commemorate Her Majesty Queen Sirikits fifth cycle or sixtieth birthday anniversary which will be celebrated on AugustMay Her Majesty Queen Sirikit reap the merits and benefits of this printing of the Uposatha SilaBy the power of the Triple Gem may she develop in the four dhammas of long life beauty happiness and strength for ages to comeIn the past ten years computers have played an increasingly important part in the spread of Buddhism to the WestNew computer programs have made Dhamma publishing increasingly convenient facilitating the printing of previously difficulttoreproduce diacriticals which are necessary to accurately render technical Pali termsThe English language has been affected as well gradually incorporating a number of words of Pali originThis sometimes causes problems for authors and translators who are confronted with the decision of how to present these terms to their readers in EnglishThis translation was first printed to commemorate Her Majesty Queen Sirikits fifth cycle or sixtieth birthday anniversary which was celebrated on AugustNow a second revised edition has been prepared and it is auspicious that it will be printed in time to commemorate His Holiness Somdet Phra Nyanasamvara the Supreme Patriarchs eightieth birthday anniversary on OctoberI would like to thank Bhikkhu Nirodho for his helpful suggestions and corrections making the reprinting of this text possibleEvamme sutam ekam samayam bhagava savatthiyam viharati jetavane anathapindikassa arame tatra kho

behavior is spotlessAll of you have given up the taking of what has not been given are ones who do not take what is not given are intent on taking only what is given are not thievesYour behavior is

as having followed the arahants and the Uposatha will have been observed by youThis is the eighth factor of the UposathaBhikkhusThe Uposatha is comprised of these eight factors which the Ariyan disciple observes and it is of great and glorious fruit and benefitThus the Blessed One spoke on the UposathaThe bhikkhus were delighted and rejoiced at his wordsIn all of the eight if one breaks a precept then it is done bodilyIf one orders another to do so then the precept is broken through speechThis must be accompanied by intention before the precept is broken but this is true for the first and second precepts only for the third to the eighth precept even if one asks another to do so one does not break the preceptBreaking a precept through ones own effort is known as sahatthikapayogaThe ordering of another to behave in a way that breaks a precept is called anattikapayogaThus one who is careful and does not stray from the precepts is known as a virtuous personThe wise say that sila or keeping precepts is an instrument by which body and speech can be purifiedIt is a way to vanquish the coarse defilements which appear through body and speechWhether people observe the precepts or not when they do something that goes against any of the first five precepts it is known as lokavajjaIt will be a personal loss and will be something the world condemnsAs for the last three precepts if they are broken it is called paññativajjaThis occurs when one intends to break the ruleIf there is no intention to break the rule then no fault resultsThe breaking of any of the first five precepts brings about peril for the breakerThat is to say the fruit of such actions will follow one resulting in for example a short lifeIn the breaking of any of the last three precepts there is no perilThe time from dawn to midday is called purebhattakalaFrom midday to dusk is called pacchabhattakalaOne may eat as many times as necessary in the first periodFrom dusk to the next dawn is called ratti and meals may not be taken at this timeThis is the reason for the passage with the words to the effect that one refrains from eating at nightThe undertaking of precepts one after another is called paccekasamadanaFor example the undertaking of each individual precept starting with panatipata veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami and ending with uccasayana mahasayana veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami is called paccekasamadanaThe undertaking of all eight precepts with one utterance is called ekajjhasamadanaThis is done by determining all the precepts at the one time and uttering the following Buddhapaññattam Uposatham adhitthami  I determine the Uposatha laid down by the BuddhaThis method is called ekajjhasamadanaThose who use either of the two methods mentioned above should begin by venerating the Triple Gem reciting namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassaThen they take the Three Refuges before undertaking the preceptsThose who do not know Pali may undertake the precepts in their own languageThe method of requesting and observing the copalauposatha is correct according to the DhammaVinaya as we see in the example of todays upasakas and upasikasBut after they request the Uposatha they indulge in low speechThere is talk of villages towns mountains trees fields gardens buying and selling grandchildren here and there this and that person etcSuch talk is not conducive to wholesomeness and does not lead one to reap the benefits of happiness and faith in the Uposatha that one has observedThe Atthakatha Acariyas have thus compared such people to hired cowhandsIn the morning the hired hands herd the cattle in search of foodIn the evening they herd the cattle back to the ownerAfter they are paid a fair amount of money they think Tomorrow we will feed the cattle here and the next day we will feed them over thereGrass and water are abundant here but not so over there Again and again this is what takes placeThe hired hands never partake of the products of the cow such as fresh milk and butterSuch observance is called copalauposathaFrom the time that the ariyauposatha is undertaken if it is the right time and place then samatha and vipassana should be practiced in accordance with ones preference and skillIf ones practice of kammatthana leads to a stilling of the unwholesome states through such practices as tadangapahana then one should continue with this effortIf the mind becomes unsettled or it is not the time or place for meditation practice and if there is faithinspiring Dhamma talk taking place then one should join in such conversationThis is useful in that it leads to knowledge and can correct any misunderstandings we may haveOne should not participate in such talk with a sense of competition winning losing etcIf such Dhamma talk does not lead to the benefits mentioned above and if there is a Dhammadesana then one should go and listen so as to fortify ones saddha hiri ottappa suta viriya sati and pañña causing them to developWe also listen to the Dhamma in order to cause samvega to ariseIf for whatever reason problems arise so that listening to Dhamma does not lead to benefits as mentioned above then one should practice a kammatthana that is suitableThe Atthakatha Acariyas have pointed out six objects for kammatthana practice which are suitable for the ariyauposathaThey areTherefore in the ariyauposatha samatha and vipassana should also be practiced thus not making it difficult for those who are samathayanika and vipassanayanikaIn brief this means that one is benefiting oneself at the time of observing by practicing kammatthanaThis is called ariyauposathaThe times for keeping the patijagarauposatha are the five days of the waxing moon ie the th th th th and the th and the six days of the waning moon the st th th th th and th or thThat makes eleven days in a month for the observance of this type of UposathaThe four months of the rainy season or vasso starting on the first night of the waning moon of the seventh month and ending in the middle of the eleventh month is the period for observing the patiharikapakkhauposathaThe commentary to the Raja Sutta explains that the patiharikapakkhauposatha is the Uposatha that is observed continuously throughout the three months of the rainsIf one cannot keep the observance for the full three months of the rains then it should be kept for one month from the first day of the waning moon of the tenth month to the eleventh monthIf one is not able to keep the observance for one full month then it should be kept for a half month from the first day of the waning moon of the tenth month to the end of that monthAny period of this observance is called patiharikapakkhauposathaSome texts define as the five months from the seventh month up to the eleventh monthSome Acariyas say the three months are the seventh eleventh and third monthsYet other sources explain that the four days ie the th th th and th both waxing and waning are the only days for the observance of the patiharikapakkhauposathaFor those who desire merit the Uposatha should be kept on the days shown hereDays other than these mentioned are for the observance of the Five Precepts and not the Uposathamayam bhante tisaranena saha attangasamaññagatam uposatham yacamanamo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassaHomage to the Exalted One the Arahant the Buddha perfected by himselfThe Uposatha which was laid down by the Buddha and consists of the eight sila has been determined by me  I will keep it well for one full day and nightThe assembed lay people answer ama bhanteThis is the end of requesting the preceptsThe laity should pay respect to the bhikkhu by bowingThis book contains two sets of newly revised Dhamma talksThe edition of Amata Dhamma has been completely revised and has new additions including its new title To the Last BreathDirections for Insight  the second part of this book  was only slightly revised although it now has its proper title back which somehow had become lost in the first printingAs Acharn Panyavaddho explained in the introduction he wrote for the Amata Dhamma  of these talks were given for the benefit of MrsPowpanga Vathanakul who had been staying in Wat Pa Bahn Tahd Udornthani Thailand since the beginning of NovemberThe other talk The Middle Way was actually given to the assembly of bhikkhus at the Wat in and was one which MrsPowpanga found useful She stayed at Wat Pa Bahn Tahd for almost four months and VenAcharn Maha Boowa gave about talks during that periodThe second part of this collection Directions for Insight seems to fit in well with the general approach of To the Last BreathIt is made up of six Dhamma Talks by Acharn Kor KhaosuanluangKhun Phoon Phongphanit a lay disciple of Acharn Kor suggested a joint translation of these six Dhamma talks originally printed under the title Na Naew Mong Darn NyThey form one booklet of a series printed over the years by Upasika Kee Nanayon who used the pen name Kor KhaosuanluangKhun Phoon Phongphanit should receive special thanks for all his work in seeing that translation into printThe first translation of To the Last Breath was mainly the work of VenBhikkhu AjThe present editor who also assisted at that time has now completely revised the whole translation and so must bear responsibility for the errorsAny merit arising from my work on this book may it be dedicated to my motherMay she find peace and happinessAnyone who has visited the forest monasteries of Thailand will need no introductionThey will have seen Acharns who teach in a spontaneous and direct way and who live as they teachThis is Forest Dhamma vigorous but without pretension inspiring one to live and practice the Way rather than reading about itYet here is a book  and a translation of a book at that  that can only attempt to offer a partial view of certain aspects of that TeachingThis is especially so with the first part of this collection of Dhamma talks To the Last BreathFor these were given under quite special circumstances A person quite knowledgeable about Buddhism is dying of cancerThe emphasis is therefore very much on dealing with pain suffering and finally deathAnd pointing towards that which is beyond suffering and deathThese circumstances mean that the beginning fundamentals of Dhamma practice are generally assumed to be already understoodFor those new to Dhamma however it is important to remember the special context and to take into account the other Dhamma qualities that make an essential foundation that will need to be cultivatedThe Lord Buddha gave an important example of this when he would begin his Dhamma Teaching with the Progressive or Graduated SermonThen the Lord delivered a graduated discourse to Kutadanta on generosity on morality and on heaven showing the danger degradation and corruption of sensedesires and the profit of renunciationAnd when the Lord knew that Kutadantas mind was ready pliable free from the hindrances joyful and calm then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief on suffering its origin its cessation and the path It is this joyful calm pliable ready mind  already settled firmly upon foundations of generosity and morality  that is receptive to the powerful Truths about pain suffering and deathIt is at this point that the emphasis changes to energetic striving to overcoming the obstacles that prevent insight and pin us blindly to the wheel of birth and deathThen the Lord said to the monks Now monks I declare to you all conditioned things are of a nature to decay  strive on untiringly These were the Tathagatas last words In this book you will find both these aspectsThere are constant references to gradually steadily step by step level by levelThese lead into a growing emphasis on earnestness and diligence in practiceAny translation is the impossible search for just the right wordThe expression that conveys both the sense and accuracy in a pleasing way and that also brings with it the spirit of the originalThis translation is much more of a blind gropingFirst there is the wide language and cultural gap between Thai and EnglishThen there is the change of medium from the living word to the printed page which must always lose the dynamism of the original experienceFinally and perhaps the most important point there is the great profundity of Dhamma which is really beyond the translators level of understandingThe reader will therefore need to make due allowance for the deficiencies in this translation effortThe only way truly to understand is to translate it back into your own life your own experience and practiceEven with its errors and inadequacies this book is the result of a great effort by many peopleIt will have all been worth while if a single person finds some truth in it that can help him or her face up to their situation their illness and painInsight into that suffering may they go beyond a mere books description to true liberationKee Nanayon was born in in the provincial town of Rajburi about kilometres west of BangkokWhen she was young she liked to visit the nearby Buddhist monastery especially on the weekly Observance Day when she listened to Dhamma from the monks and kept the Eight PreceptsSometimes she would rest from her work around the house by developing tranquillity meditation in any suitably quiet cornerKhaosuanluang is the name of a secluded picturesque hill about kilometres from Rajburi near where her uncle and aunt livedWhenever she visited them she always felt comfortable there and eventually in persuaded her relatives to move their house over to the hillThis was the beginning  the first three members  of the community that was later to develop thereUpasika Kee attracted Dhamma students and residents included both female lay devotees and whiterobed nunsShe taught her disciples to develop meditation to chant at least every morning and evening and to avoid stimulants like coffee cigarettes and meatThey could listen to her talks and try to follow the example of her simple way of livingShe made herself comfortable on the barest necessities and never indulged in luxuries either in food or material thingsStrictly keeping the Eight Precepts and constantly trying to guard the sense doors were basic to her practiceIn later years she developed corneal ulcers and eventually became blindShe passed away in but her community still continues with about thirty residentsThese Dhamma talks were given mainly to the women who stayed at her center to practice meditationAfter listening with calmed centered minds they would all sit in meditation togetherSome nuns or lay devotees would take on the special practice and go into retreat alone in a separate meditation hutIt was known as guarding the sense doors and could last for one or two weeksDhamma talks given to those practicing at Khaosuanluang on the weekly Observance Day have regularly been printed and this book continues the seriesThey aim to encourage and support Dhamma practice following the Way of the Lord Buddha and his Noble Disciples whose brilliance dispels the darkness of every age and timeDevotion to practice always brings great benefit in leading to the end of sufferingI wish to acknowledge the generosity of all those who have joined together to make merit by printing this book to be given away freely as a pure gift of Dhamma to anyone interested in practiceOther books in this series have already been widely distributed to various monasteries and libraries and as opportunity allows we hope to continue this serviceAs you steadily develop your selfinspection carefully note where it is heading so that any lapse or imprudence in your daily life can be correctedFailing to uphold a high standard will cause a continuous deterioration in the mind due to selfishnessYou must persevere with the selfinspection because any lapse will cause this disease of selfishness to spread its infection everywhereWhenever you become neglectful make sure that you then purge any selfishness that has arisenThis is especially necessary when it flares up in force but even when it manifests more subtly it still needs to be thoroughly searched outIf you do not eradicate this virulent disease your practice cannot be considered to accord with the Lord Buddhas TeachingIts therefore imperative that your selfinspection becomes comprehensive and that it is based and develops out of the Five or Eight PreceptsGenerally the precepts can reduce selfishness at one level and then our minddevelopment can come in and remove it at a medium levelThis is something you should all understand quite wellFinally however mindfulness and wisdom will need to become engaged in eradicating the selfishness that results from overlooking the truth about impermanence suffering and not selfWith repeated attention your concern will deepen and the defilements  craving and clinging  and self in its various manifestations can be disposed ofIts not seeing the impermanence and deception of things that permits desire to grasp hold and cherish themThis disease is made even more difficult to treat by our predilection in examining other people before ourselvesTo be able to turn within and apprehend self with its machinations concealed deep in ones nature does indeed require potent mindfulness and wisdomYet also actually to get rid of them isnt so simple and one really only manages to view selfs deceptions and desiresThese multifarious schemes of greed are worthy of great attention and need to be carefully examinedAny shortcoming will force the practice to veer off course and may end by actually facilitating and increasing ones sense of selfIn the beginning we should be content with what we already have so as not to feed and inflate this sense of selfGreed for anything  however coarse or refined no matter how attractive  must be put asideThis is something each one of us must see and understand for ourselves but because it can be all so misleading and deceptive that isnt so easyThe predicament is compounded because self is always looking out for distractions to involve us inShould we enquire what it is grasping for what it is in turmoil over  it just pretends not to have heardIt is only interested in wanting more and more without endA basic feature of human beings is the enterprise they apply when acquiring thingsThe defilements possess a certain cleverness in procuring but not in giving up or forgoingIf only this could be transposed so that instead we became creative in bestowing and giving awayThe benefit would be great because the grasping at things would stop and gradually with intensive contemplation the basic attachment would be destroyedBlocking the defilements from taking their fill by cutting off their nutriment is following the Way of the Noble DiscipleBut the other way the way of deception and sponsoring self makes one a firm follower of Maara the Evil One who personifies the defilementsInstead of dispensing things one then endlessly acquires and consumes themThere are therefore two possible ways to goYou have to discern in yourself the existence of the acute disease of selfishness with its gettingclevernessYet if you arent sharp enough youll be fooled by selfs duplicity The more the merrier as Maara would sayAsk yourself Am I really following the way to enlightenment or is it the way of Maara and selfishnessOn which path does my proficiency really lie This is something to always questionThe household stores in this area have been donated for the use of those who come here to practice DhammaBe careful never to appropriate such communal property to yourself and always ask about such things firstGrabbing this and that to make yourself as comfortable as possible even if it may have been done unthinkingly is still the same as theftThese communal household utensils should therefore not be requisitioned as your own even those things donated specifically for your use should on occasion be brought out and sharedIn that case there is no attachment and one does not plan just for ones own convenienceOtherwise the instinct of self  which needs to appropriate things to itself  is too manipulative and cunning and its villainy is so difficult to seeOne then mistakenly endorses the dictum the more I can get the better and such selfishness puts one under the domination of MaraNow that we have become disciples of the Lord Buddha how can we possibly be like thatIf we should see that the greed arisen in ourselves becomes particularly grasping then the only way out is to give up the thingLet go of itUnder no circumstances should you quietly appropriate it on the sideAbsolutely notI will tell you plainly anyone living in a religious community who behaves in such a way will only go from bad to worse because there is no sense of shame or fear of doing evilWithout these two fundamental principles as a foundation how can Dhamma possibly be built upThough one might be knowledgeable and skilled in reciting the scriptures one cant even put right such an underlying character defectA personality that knows no bounds to its greed really seems disgusting or rather the disease that infects that mind doesWhat can we do to cleanse such a mindAnyway to associate with extremely selfish people will inflame the disease still more and its infection will penetrate deep into the mindAll this remains a hidden subject which people dont wish to speak aboutIts not pleasant talk for it disturbs and disconcerts with its sinister implicationsIts only through mindfulness and wisdom examining within yourself that youll be able to know the deceit of the defilements and greedHow can they all be eradicatedThis is not a matter about which you can be halfheartedYoull have to disavow and give away as much as possibleAnything that is involved in upholding such selfishness must be relinquishedDont agree amongst yourselves that everyone may grab as much as they can but rather encourage one another to give as much as possibleFailure to do this will cause the mind to fall into anguish because you twist round and infect yourself with the dirt and disease of selfishnessWho else can possibly come and treat youWhen you decide to examine this malignant disease youll have to recall all this for yourself because nobody else will want to discuss it with youEven though they too are saturated with the same infection they prefer to talk of other mattersThe occasional giving away of various things is relatively easy but to relinquish self is both recondite and extremely difficultNevertheless the effort is worthwhile because this self is the sole source of all sufferingShould this root not be destroyed it will continue to sprout and flourish so we must turn and apprehend this selfThe Lord Buddha has laid down the Recollections of the Four Requisites which for the monks are robe material alms food shelter and medicineHe said that if they werent considered merely as material exigencies as elements free of all ideas of self then the yellow robe the lump of rice the hut and medicines would all burst into flameEven though we may not be monks and only beginners in Dhamma practice if we really have the determination to be rid of the defilements and self then theres no loss in trying to follow a similar basic ruleIf we dont imagine how the defilements craving clinging and self will relentlessly proliferateSo we have to make our choice simply to follow the old way or to strive towards the ending of selfEach one of you should take this to heartTurning to examine internally is difficult but even modest application will result in great benefitActually catching the deceit of self in the act of plunging one still deeper into suffering and being able there and then to wipe it out  this is truly a reward beyond priceThe failure to implement this eradication this giving up of self lays the basis for the intensification of sufferingFor by not bringing it in for examination it is able to grow freelyYou may be able to quote and recite the scriptures  and even skillfully teach others  yet the mind remains impure and confusedBy clearly seeing this you will feel revulsion for everything involved with this craving and desireYou will start to give generously and to make sacrifices no matter how difficult it seems and thereby suffering can no longer secure a holdEach small renunciation builds its own reward in the mind until there is complete victoryAnyone having a strong tendency towards stinginess  which is a particular defilement  seems unable to give anything upThey are reluctant to examine themselves or admit that they can possibly harbor a disease as severe as selfishnessIf they would frequently make an inspection that sort of defilement wouldnt dare to show its faceBut by being negligent the defilement grows strong and bold and is capable of the most selfish and despicable actsSuch people will then be able to appropriate the property of a community such as we have here for their own selfish purposesBy turning to a constant probing of your mind youll be able to succeed in the giving up of unworthy attachmentsWhatever you do will then become Dhamma and will be of assistance to our companions in birth sickness old age and deathThe getting rid of selfishness will also allow you to come to the aid of others without caring about the hardships involvedWithout self we are truly on the noble wayThe practice of Dhamma needs orderliness in daily lifeAny slackness is inappropriateAnother point here is that any shortcomings in behavior allow defilements a chance to come forth more easilyOrderliness helps to arouse mindfulness which may in its turn forestall the defilementsDisregard for rules and regulations brings nothing whereas conscientiously abiding by them can bring benefitThey give one a sense of how properly to respond to any situation and this is necessary because we still cant completely understand by ourselvesThe Lord Buddha knew the situation from every side whereas we are surrounded by darkness and ignoranceThis means we cant be sure of ourselves  either externally or internally  and so must depend on Dhamma and the Way it points out to usThe decision  to follow Dhamma or to wander away  remains with each one of youAnyone who wishes to be rid of their defilements and suffering will need vigilance as an asset of mind and must then be diligent and persevereForever encountering the scorching fire of suffering they will finally have to stop turn and set themselves the task of struggling to be freeWithout a clear and thorough understanding about oneself the defilements will thrive and spread their virulent infection which can only bring more and more sufferingWe must therefore reinforce our mindfulness and wisdom for no other instrument can fight and destroy the defilementsThe persistent quest to train the mind needs mindfulness and wisdom to point the wayHalfheartedness merely wastes time and one remains the same unmitigated foolWhen you come to realize this the benefits from the resulting effort are immenseEventually you will be able to destroy the defilements relinquish all attachment and the mind will transcend sufferingBut any failure to achieve this will see you swept away by the power of craving and defilementsNegligence and carelessness will allow them to lead you away by the nose theyll pull you here and drag you thereThis is why the Lord Buddha emphasized in so many ways the necessity of letting go sacrificing and disentangling yourselfThis is the way to excise the cancer from the mindThis kind of malignant disease is very insidious and though it may reveal a few symptoms its usually not enough to alert one to the situationEventually it will usually triumph and sometimes you may even submit to its terms with alacrityYour examination therefore must be circumspect and alert otherwise its like plugging one hole in a leaking boat only to find its leaking elsewhereThere are six holes or apertures  the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind  and if you have no control over them they are left open to follow after emotional objectsAnd this causes great sufferingYou must use mindfulness and wisdom to seek out and review the true situation present within yourself and this must become the most important activity throughout the dayOur life is for working on the elimination of the defilements not for anything elseYet the defilements and suffering continue to hover about and if we arent equal to their threat well surely get burntWe need to pull ourselves around and question how to deal with this for then well be heading for great successWhile we still have breath and our body isnt yet rotting in its coffin we must take counsel and search for a way to eradicate the root infection of this terrible disease the germ of defilements and cravingThis cancer which has gnawed deeply into the mind can only be remedied with DhammaThe Lord Buddha prescribed his Dhamma medicines with their various propertiesEach one of us must carefully select from them and blend what is correct and most suitable and then use it to destroy the root infectionAll this necessitates great circumspectionShould your selfinspection remain insufficient to destroy the defilements they will grow stronger and burn like an unseen fire inside the mindIntrospection is the extinguisher to use so that when you notice greed arising for an object you can snuff it out and let go of itNow look at the mind is it free or entangled in turmoilIf you dont persevere it can only end in your getting burntNo matter how smart you think you are you always seem to succumb to greedGreed seizes the commanders position and you make no attempt to dislodge it  and even go out to receive it in with complimentsThe mind is then the oppressed slave of desire and has fallen into delusion with the grasping of this and thatTheres no obvious way out of such wretched entanglement we just dont know how to escape the dilemma that viciously encircles our mindWe are trapped by our lack of true resolve and finally when we are at our wits end we become slaves to the defilements just as beforeThe more often we submit to them the more their power growsThe only true way to overthrow them is strenuously to bring mindfulness and wisdom to bearWe can then examine from all angles the suffering they bring until the mind refuses to stay a slave any longerIts no use just making an external show of it because the greater the fuss the more stubborn the defilements becomeYet we also cant be halfhearted about itYou must have the appropriate response for whatever the situation bringsYou cant rush in with massive good intention to wipe them out but must first carefully focus and enhance mindfulness and wisdomThis will all require great circumspection and all these points will need to be rememberedTo genuinely understand the mind will have to investigate in every posture with every breathIt will then be equal to the task of stopping those moods and tendencies that continually fabricate notions without reason or value under the compulsion of delusionWithout true determination practice becomes halfheartedThis leads to distraction and a waste of valuable time with it all being nothing more than delusionWe must turn our vision within and persevere until we see clearlyOnce we are adept its actually more enjoyable to look inside than outExternally there is just the dissolution of things seen  why be so engrossed in thatBut the inner eye can penetrate to the clear light and then to the Truth of DhammaBy seeing the nature of the dissolution of all determinations new insight will arise as to that nature that doesnt deteriorate a nature that cant be altered but just isIf your allround mindfulness and wisdom remain insufficient and weak the defilements will be overwhelmingHowever if you can persistently build up mindfulness and wisdom the strength of the defilements will proportionally declineYoull notice that though the mind was previously confused it has now become resoluteIts able to see the impermanence of things more clearly so that they can be let go ofThis insight into impermanence empowers mindfulness and wisdom to move towards an even deeper discernmentYet this penetration must be truly focused otherwise the slightest inattention will be disruptiveIf it doesnt wander off target even for a moment then this is truly the way to control the defilementsNegligence however means that they can never be threatened and theyll regroup stronger than everMindfulness and clear comprehension must be developed in every posture with every breathWe must make the effort so that the mind is attentive and doesnt drift away following various emotional objects or lose itself in the confusion of concocting thoughtsYou should be forewarned here about the tendency to think I know when you dont really know at allUntil the mind penetrates to true insight there must always be doubt and uncertainty but when you begin truly to see such doubts fall away and speculation is no longer necessaryOne truly knowsHow can you be certain that you have true insightWhen the mind truly comprehends the defilements and suffering are really eliminatedHowever if one just thinks that one sees  whilst having no real insight  then one cant possibly destroy the defilements and sufferingThis insight penetrates into the mind for this is where the desire for things is activated and that which blocks out Dhamma residesWhen this concocting stops one sees through to the nature of mind that is without the fire and anguish of desireThis can be seen anytime when one focuses properly and with determinationOne can see other things why not thisJust truly look and you will certainly seeBut you must look correctly to be able to penetrate otherwise you wont see anythingIf you grasp at things  which goes against the basic principles of true knowledge  and then try to go straight on to the truth its probable that youll get all twisted and an element of pride or something similar will insinuate itselfThe only way is to see the arising and ceasing of things merely seeing and understanding without graspingSeeThis is the way to freedom from attachmentIt has been said See the world as if it were empty and we must similarly see our moods as they arise and cease as emptyWhen the mind truly realizes the transience of things the deceit of the world and our moods it doesnt grasp at them any moreThis is the free mindThere are many levels to this but even a temporary experience is still of benefit just dont go and grasp after anythingThe free mind that is called vimokkha  attaining to true and final release  we find described in one of the scriptures we chant vimokkha is not subject to change Those levels of freed mind that change are not true vimokkha so we must continue to examine each level and press for the fruit which is always freedom from attachmentIt doesnt matter how many levels one has to work through until it finally doesnt change which is when it is without any aim or attachment for anythingThis is the true way to penetrative insightMay all of you who practice Dhamma work tirelessly to see and know this truthWe all have suffering and the most important task of our life is to let go and be rid of itThe mind is besieged by defilements and is left helpless owing to its deficient study of DhammaIt is continually scorched with suffering and unless we turn to Dhamma it will be consumed throughout this life and on into the nextOnly Dhamma practice can extinguish and release us from sufferingThis practice of Dhamma is precisely a constant self examination because body and mind are the basis of our existenceThe condition of changing which they naturally exhibit needs to be correctly examinedOtherwise you will follow the unthinking normal course understanding nothing and grasping after things which only go to compound your sufferingThis however is difficult to see and will require your full attention and concernIn examining the unrest and anxiety of the mind youll find it emerges from the disease of greed hatred and delusionThe desire for things can only bring turmoil to the mind and its like a virulent infection has taken holdIts normal to be afraid of bodily disease but the affliction of the defilements which disturb and depress the mind doesnt concern us at allWe choose not to recognize the seriousness of this infection and sometimes in our ignorance even to aggravate mattersTo actually get down to eliminating the defilements is therefore difficult and unattractive especially with the myriad outside distractions that stir up desireThe indifferent common person just spins with their desires leaving the mind dizzy and unbalanced all the timeThis is plainly suffering and torment yet if we dont concern ourselves with this affliction dont struggle to overcome the tendency to follow our desires then we must abjectly submit to itIts our ignorance concerning the defilements successful infiltration and infection of the mind that makes this disease so difficult to seeYou must turn your attention away from external things and set it on your own body and mindWhether mind or body its all subject to impermanence and changeYet this is difficult for the ordinary person to comprehendIts like what we think of as the growth of people from their mothers womb onwards there is continual change and transformation so that this growth really refers to changeNothing remains immutable in this worldThe decline and decay of either the body or material things shouldnt be so difficult to notice and yet it still somehow escapes our attentionThe mind and mental states are constantly changing but instead of seeing this we grasp at the sight or sound of any object experienced and this drops us into even more sufferingIf we could penetrate to the actual experience of sights sounds smells tastes tangibles and mind objects we would find a continual change a constant arising and passing awayHow does the old emotional object pass away how does a new one ariseHow is it that the mind is overpowered by the defilements into conceivings and imaginings that proliferate out of handBut we pay no interest to such matters and are consequently overwhelmed by suffering which extends into actions and speech full of intense greed hatred and delusionThis incessant torment of the defilements  hotter than the hottest fire  can only be relieved through the practice of DhammaYet the ordinary worldling though being roasted alive behaves as if she is immune to the fire and pays it no attentionShe even smiles and thinks herself content in habitually grasping at transient things as me and mineShe doesnt realize that whatever she reaches out to and falls in love with is forever out of reach edging towards dissolutionThis all needs the deepest examination so as to see the truth and not fall into attachment and delusionPeople learn from the scriptures of such diseases as the fetters or underlying tendencies but they dont turn to check them out in themselvesOne takes up words and translates their definitions yet one doesnt see that the wrong view of holding to personality is the direct source of all ones suffering and tormentOne not only fails to comprehend this plain truth but then one turns and unthinkingly submits to upholding such wrong viewThis is why the mind is in such a state of profound ignoranceIt is normal for people to have knowledge about many things sometimes to the extent that they cant relax and must be forever researching new mattersThey know whats good whats right  they know it allWhatever the subject they manage to concoct an answer finally spiralling out into wild conceptualizationsThey simply know too muchThis style of knowledge is that of the defilements and craving its antidote is the knowledge arising from mindfulness and wisdom that penetrates to the truth of the mindIf we should give free rein to this obsession with wild imaginings the mind will exhaust itself and we will eventually suffer a nervous breakdownIf we allow ourselves to get into such a state then well end up insaneSome cases may stay deluded until their death and on being reborn they will return to that same delusionThis transpires from a lack of critical examination and from not trusting in the application of DhammaTranquilizers and similar drugs for the mentally ill merely relieve the external symptoms but do not get to the root causeA radical cure depends on the control of ones own mind using mindfulness and wisdom to brake and critically check enabling the mind to free itself from its delusionsThis is the complete cure of DhammaThat Dhamma practice should be able to cure every kind of illness should merit some thoughtEach stage in your understanding of Dhamma will depend on mindfulness and wisdomThose who show no interest in Dhamma  no matter how great their knowledge of worldly matters  will fall under the domination of the defilements and become subject to birth old age sickness and deathOnce you come to understand Dhamma following the Lord Buddha the mind will become bright calm and pureThis knowledge is of far more value than that which you have acquired for your livelihoods sake or that which you obtained by being pleasurably  but temporarily engrossed in various entertainmentsWhen you come around to constantly examining your mind youll see that when anxiety arises the mind is not free and will not accept the truth of the Lord Buddhas words Go out from desire in happiness Being burned alive in the maw of desire through indulging in the five sense strands  sight sound smell taste touch  is hardly going out from desire with happinessBut if you correctly see that the penalty of desire is suffering it will cease to gratify and the mind will be freed from desireAt that moment when the mind is unattached to sense objects and is free of desire you can penetrate to more profound levels and truly know whether it is really happinessThe free mind will know of itself that happiness is not being overwhelmed by suffering or aroused to passionThe mind without passion will immediately incline solely towards freedomIs this what you want or are you satisfied with lust and insatiable desireConsider carefully and make your choiceInclining the mind towards freedom and release from the entanglements of passion and lust brings a natural state of purity and calmSurely compared to this freedom and happiness the turmoil of sense desires will seem loathsome and repellentIf you dont reflect upon this youll become absorbed and lost in neverending desires and passions caught and confined in the cage of cravingHeld in the grip of this disease so difficult to cure isnt it high time you turned to radically curing it by destroying its root infectionWhen the mind fixes on a desired object you must reflect and see the harm and suffering that arise and compare it with the happiness of the mind freed from desireYou must constantly examine this suffering and the freedom from suffering in your own mind attending to it with every in and outbreathThe principle is set down in the scriptures in the Foundations of Mindfulness which describes many different ways to examine and reflectBut if you dont actually apply them in your practice no matter how many of the texts you read it will be of no benefitYou will continue merely groping along in the dark without understanding anythingTo detect this insidious disease requires mindfulness and wisdom and these must be nurtured and applied so that they become well establishedIf you only do this sporadically and irresolutely you will always end in laxity and make no progress in Dhamma practiceIt is just this progress that leads to a lessening of suffering and a decline in desire  as you will see for yourselfYoull realize that the most direct way of practice is constant reflection and examination and will see how best this can be applied in your daily lifeThose of us here who devote our lives to Dhamma through following the training rule of chastity must especially consider this carefullyThis way of Dhamma practice needs an earnest application of mindfulness and wisdom persevering with them until true knowledge arisesBut initially how should one investigate so that new understanding may arise where previously there was ignoranceWhen the mind is possessed by ignorance and delusion you cant relax or be indifferent but must concern yourself energetically with escaping from that which brings harm and sufferingYou must discern what it is that brings brightness and clarity to the mindIf this isnt done the mind will tend to be seduced by surrounding sense objects and you are left with just scholarly knowledge and talkIn fact your mind truly doesnt know what is what and any scrap of insight that does genuinely arise will not be followed upYoull relax become preoccupied with things and neglect the practiceIt is therefore important to be very careful about this and bring mindfulness and wisdom to bear so that they can be steadily trained and perfectedWhen you can penetrate to the truth of impermanence suffering and notself even if just for a moment youll see that this is truly the perfect way to extinguish all sufferingWhatever remains undiscerned must be earnestly investigated and related to what one already knowsThis leads to disattachment from self and others from mine and theirsJust a momentary insight gives value to your life otherwise youll remain in the continual darkness of ignorance and ceaseless imaginingsThe mind being caught in constant turmoil is truly a wretched state of affairsMeditation must therefore be steadfastly developedYou must build it up as an asset of the mind and not be concerned only with eating sleeping and other bad habitsYou must watch over the mind so that it stays under the direction of mindfulness and wisdom always pulling it back and never leading it out to other concerns that are a waste of timeA first step in the practice is the code of conduct necessary because otherwise things only slide into distraction and confusionYou must therefore place yourself under precepts and discipline for its this that can bring great benefitYoull then come to see that this life is meant only for training yourself towards the elimination of defilements and suffering and doing it before the body itself is laid out in its coffinWithout this concern for practice and for finding a suitably quiet place the mind will tend to overextend itself with notions of conceitTherefore you must all decide on the way to go blocking the wandering of the mind after sense objects and moods and bringing it back to investigate within yourself so as to steadily develop calm and tranquillityThe Lord Buddha rightly set down various methods for developing meditation including mindfulness of breathingIf we dont take up one of these methods as a basis for practice even though it may still be possible to gain results they will be unsteady and fleetingBut with a basis of practice to aid one the mind can be brought under the control of mindfulness and clear comprehension without fading into distractionHow should each of us go about this to obtain the desired resultsIn your daily life how can you improve your practiceThese questions warrant great concern and considerationDont be careless and forgetfulWhatever you do in your practice  including the guarding of the sense doors  must be followed through steadfastly without vacillation or distractionOtherwise time flies by your life ebbs away and you achieve nothingInattentive and halfhearted how can you expect to escape from sufferingWhat a waste  be earnestSuch concern when it arises authentically enables you to correct and right yourselfIt steadily wears away at your distractionYour investigation should center on impermanence the suffering involved in such change and the lack of self in all of itYou then must focus on the central point of knowing and penetrate through to clearly understand impermanence suffering and notself in both body and mindWhen you succeed in clearly realizing this you can truly be called wise awakened and happy through DhammaIf it is genuine insight youll no longer feel any attachment or involvement with anythingYou will be free of feelings of me and mineDoes this sound appealingIm not talking about trivial mattersThis is serious  I tell you plainly  and you must concern yourselves seriouslyHalfhearted listening to what I say is no use you must really try to gain insight within yourselfThis brings such great rewards that it deserves your special attentionAbove all things concentrate your attention on thisMay Dhamma be the guiding light in your lifeConcern for Dhamma practice is of the greatest value because it leads on to wisdomIts steady development will allow you to  read yourself by using a careful examination of suffering and the harm caused by the defilementsOccasionally youll be able clearly to discern the situation and resolve to get freeThe mind is then calm and serene without those agitating thoughts that through ones negligence had previously been allowed a free reinThe principle of selfexamination is a tool of vital importance and requires regular and specific developmentIt brings the mind to stability by securing it with mindfulness is essentialOtherwise the mind will waver and vacillate following contact with various objects which will eventually lead to proliferating imaginings and turmoilBy controlling the six sense doors  which means having mindfulness constantly in attendance  one lays a deep immovable foundationThis can be compared to driving piles into firm ground rather than mud where they would sway under any external forceMindfulness is therefore necessary for controlling the mind so that it is stable and can withstand contact with objects neither craving them nor being repelled by themThis firm mindfulness must be maintained in each posture and with every breath and this will effectively check the minds wild chasing after sense objectsOtherwise the mind will be like a rudderless ship battered by wind and waves and drifting helplesslyMindfulness is therefore essential in securing the mind allowing it to stabilize and investigate for insightInitially in order to establish a foundation of mindfulness youll have to concentrate on centering and balancing the mind in impartialityAt this stage theres no need to speculate or be concerned about any matterIf you can fortify and hold this centeredness it will become the base and standard for your investigationBut this impartiality needs careful checking to make sure that its not just a state of indifference and inertia or absentminded preoccupationYou must be neither scattered nor engrossed in thingsSitting straightbacked in meditation maintaining mindfulness and centeredness is all that is requiredTheres no need to think of anythingThe mind is firm unswayed by whatever may arise be it pleasant or painful feelingsOnes attention is locked onto the stability of mind and excludes all feelings and its this that leads to equanimityGuard against any inclination towards either absentmindedness or infatuation with some objectSo that if youre sitting in meditation after thirty minutes of the hours session the mind is established and continues to be so for the remaining timeWhen changing posture to standing walking or lying down notice that though the body has shifted the mind is still centered and unshakenMindfulness which must be sustained with every breath is the kingpin in this forestalling the imaginings and concoctions of mindThen with the mind centered and neutral the intense concentration on the in and outbreath can be relaxed to a suitably moderate levelIn the hours session the mind will then be without worries and distracting thoughtsAfterwards youll start to notice that in whatever you do or say the mind has a natural poise with knowingnessWhen the mind is thus stationed it will have allround protection so that contact with external objects will not affect its stabilityEven if it should be drawn out for a moment it will quickly and without coercion return to maintaining its baseWhat had previously stimulated attraction or repulsion a pull to this or that side is rendered ineffectual because the mind is now centered and neutralAny wandering or distraction can be countered by a critical examination of the virtues and attributes of the centered stable mindThe foundation of mindfulness must be deeply laid within every posture and constantly developed in every actionOnce the base is set the mind becomes compliant calm and free of imaginings and turmoilIt steadily grows more refined and is able to penetrate and examine knowing both its stability and its disinterestedness in those brief external contactsAny craving can thus be disposed withWhen changing your position  perhaps in response to painful bodily feeling  the mind will neither fix on the pain nor on the new pleasant feeling but will be intent in itselfThis stability permits you comfortably to avoid the cravings involved with feelingsThe ordinary untrained mind on the other hand will be irritated into pursuing pleasant feelingsWith repeated practice the foundations piles are driven deeper and deeper so that there is no swaying under the impact of sense objects and moodsNo longer are you restlessly drawn out after sights sounds smells tastes and tangibles no longer indulging in meaningless thought fabrications because of your lack of mindfulnessThis stability of mind needs constant attention and strengtheningThen the examination of impermanence and not self which usually deceive the mind can be set upThe mind like a mischievous monkey tends to wander awayYet even monkeys can be caught and trained and so it is with the mindIt must be first caught and tied with mindfulness then tamed and disciplinedThe training of the mind can neither be excessively forced nor abandoned to complacencyEveryone must find out for themselves exactly what brings resultsIf you are only casually mindful the mind will lack a foundation and be easily distracted by sense objects and moodsIt will then be impossible to brake to calm down and free yourselfThe firm establishing of mindfulness in every posture  standing walking sitting or lying down  becomes essential so that the monkey is tethered and can only circle its post without being able to get into mischiefOnce the mind is trained it will be calm and capable of selfexaminationHowever any obsessive imaginings show up a deficiency and youll have to train yourself further because its precisely this lack of firmness that underlies all your turmoilWhy should the mind be so wild and disobedientPractice  so that it calms down and rests in stabilityAt this stage the mind is stabilized and supported by mindfulness in all posturesAny distraction occurs for only a moment and without attachmentYoull now have to perfect this so that all distractive imaginings and moods arising from contact with external objects are subdued and completely ceaseThis training isnt so very difficultThe vital point is being aware of the minds centeredness in whichever of the various meditation subjects you choose to useIf attention wanders always bring it back to the established mind and the foundation will continue to be laidSuch mindfulness is then always available for investigation because the firmly settled mind is also able to see clearlyIt can discern the truth and falseness within oneself whereas the unsettled mind can only swing around to haunt and jumble everything up to fool youThe established mind can therefore get rid of the defilements and suffering from every sideThis way of practice depends very much on diligence and perseverance in establishing the mindThen just as a firmly anchored post isnt shaken in a storm so the various defilements with their resulting anguish and distress can no longer afflict the mindWhen this is realized youll no longer go out with fondness for this thing or aversion for thatSuch equanimity can then become a basis for investigation and insightBut initially in stabilizing the mind to a deeper level theres no need to involve yourself with any thinking processesPreoccupations and absentmindedness must both be guarded against for its at this point that delusion and the machinations of craving takes overThe firmly settled mind might waver a little but it will quickly correct itself so that the basis of mindfulness can be used for examining impermanence suffering and notselfIn the beginning stages though not absolutely essential its better to concentrate on stabilizing the mindIf you try to focus the mind without such stability its liable to fly off into uncontrolled imaginingsTherefore settle your mind steadily focusing it so that it develops to the profound level imbued with freedomThe torment of the defilements with their domination of the sensedoors will then be overthrownThis is because with such firm control over the mind the eyes and ears the nose tongue and touch will also be guardedWithout a firm foundation of mindfulness there is no restraint of the senses for the eyes want to look the ears want to hear and come into contact with the myriad sense objectsWith the mind centered its already protected and so theres no need to guard the actual senses themselvesThen whatever you say the mind is settled without harking after notions of Thats good  I like it Thats bad  I dislike it Thats pretty Thats ugly The mind is no longer fixed on externals but keeps to the principle of being centered and uninvolvedEvery experience is now received with impartiality because five of the six sense doors have been closed and the mind is centered and steadyWhen sights sounds smells tastes or tangibles arise the mind isnt attracted but remains centered controlling allJust like thatTry itIt is now the end of the Rainy SeasonDuring this week you should all make an extra special effort to establish the heart with mindfulnessIn the Lord Buddhas time it was during this period  when the lotus and water lily bloom  that a meeting was arranged between the Lord Buddha and his senior disciplesThey had just finished training newly ordained monks and novices during the RainsAs in other years I want to stress this again to encourage you to make the mind steadfastWhen this is achieved the mind will bloom unwithered by the defilements heat and myriad afflictionsSo you should all try for this during the coming seven daysWatch over the firmly centered mind so that it receives constant supportExcept that is for when youre asleep and even then the mind should be centered right up to the last wakeful momentTry it and youll find on Awakening that the mind has remained centeredIt will be free of craving and all the suffering this involvesThen youll be able to see for yourself how the mind gently bloomsWith the mind established it is naturally cooled and soothed without effortYou can be assured that this mind will neither be scorched by the defilements nor led into selfinflicted craving and tormentThe fires of lust hatred and delusion cant touch itBut please understand that this can only be achieved with genuine exertion and constant mindfulnessPlaying about and being irresolute will only hand you over to the torments of the defilementsDhamma practice is one of restraint and steadfastness clear of any mischievous pursuits after sense distractionsWhatever you do whether eating or excreting make sure the mind is established withinWhen you realize this state the mind will be unshaken by turmoil and free of weaknessIt will be established in a freedom beyond harm from those things that had burnt itIt is free for through introspection it no longer grasps and embraces such things and is therefore constantly protectedIn such a state there are no thoughts of self theres just the stabilized mindSustain it for seven days and you will know the results for yourselfSo please persevereEach day keep a check and record of your progressDont become lax and erraticKeep the mind steady and dont weaken in your resolve  really try to make an end of sufferingIf you are irresolute you will fall for the provocations of wanting things and doing things and thereby youll enslave yourself and sufferYour daily life should give good opportunity for self examinationEnter the battlefieldFirmly center yourselfThe uprising feelings and moods should be seen as neutral without involvement in notions of good or badEverything is halted in centeredness because without intention there is no good or bad or selfSustain this centeredness and freedom from self and know exactly how the lotus bloomsIf it doesnt bud and flower know that its withering and rotting in the heat of the defilements and your inattentionPlease apply yourselves to establishing the mind and do your best to bring the lotus to bloomMake sure it doesnt become scorched in the fire of the defilementsWe are meeting here again today and some of you have already spoken to me of your practiceI would like further to emphasize that your development of mindfulness and self inspection requires a suitable basis in effort and perseveranceWe have all heard about the mind being enshrouded in defilements and we can only falter and slip back by not pressing on with practiceIf the mind lacks energy its time to increase and maintain the pressure of practice thereby enabling us to break through with insightSuch insight isnt merely a matter of thinking it out for its an examination based in the concentrated mind which is calm and stabilized to a sufficient degreeThis calm centered mind without imaginings or thought fabrications without positive or negative reactions to emotional objects requires a careful and subtle investigation into its various conditions without disturbing its balanceA cursory understanding is hardly true knowledge for one knows merely the external calm or those characteristics of mind that still sway under the defilements without any lucid insightMake the effort to analyze and examine within searching for the understanding to help you along and constantly sharpening your investigationIf you arent at this investigative stage true knowledge wont arise because your knowledge and mindfulness are still at a relatively superficial levelTaking the physical body up for examination you can analyze it as either made up of the various elements  earth water fire air  or inspect aspects of its loathsomenessThis will lead to an understanding about the body which can be advanced in each posture so that your thoughts never wander off courseYour work is meticulously to focus on and destroy the defilements in whatever guise they appearThe qualities of heedfulness and nondistraction will advance your practice along smoothlyIts as if one becomes experienced and proficient in treating and eradicating the subtle disease within the mind  which is the malady of nescience and delusionNormally we cant comprehend even the grosser aspects of this condition but when its been stilled by firmly establishing the mind well be able to penetrate through to the deeper levels and discern the deceit and cunning of the defilementsWith this seeing and understanding youll be ready to renounce them as they swerve away to find a sight or sound a delicious taste or smellWhether its
