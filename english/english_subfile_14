Through the succession of lifeterms kamma holds sway over the individual evolutionary currentActs of will once completed recede into the forward moving mental stream out of which they emerged and remaining in the form of psychic potencies pilot the future course of evolution to be taken by that particular current of experience called an individual being Just as the kamma rises up out of the stream of consciousness so does the stream of consciousness again flow forth from the germinative kamma which thus serves to link into a single chain the series of separated livesThe kammic force drives the current of consciousness onward into new modes of existence conformable to its nature it determines the specific form of life in which the individual will take remanifestation the set of faculties with which the new being will be endowed and a substantial portion of the happiness and suffering that being will meet during the course of its lifeIt is therefore not God or chance in the Buddhist picture but the differentiation in volitional action functioning across the succession of lives that accounts for the differentiation in the animate order and the differentiation in action again that divides beings into the high and low the happy and the miserable the gifted and the deprivedAs the Buddha declares Beings are the owners of their actions heirs of their actionsTheir action is the source from which they spring their kinsman and their refugeAction divides beings into the inferior and the superiorSince the effective determinant of destiny is kamma and kamma is essentially volition this means that the operative factor in the formation of future becoming is lodged in the individual willThe will from the Buddhist perspective is no accidental offshoot of the machinery of nature compelled to its course by the conspiracy of cosmic forces it is rather in the deepest sense the artisan behind the entire process of animate evolutionHere will is primary and the material factors secondary the plastic substance with which the will works and by which it gives tangible expression to its store of dispositional tendenciesThe varied landscape of sentient existence for Buddhism represents but an outward register of the inward transactions of the will and the hierarchy of living forms  the great chain of being  but a congellation of its functional modalities in the world of spatiotemporal extensionDifferentiation in the biological sphere is thus preceded and paralleled by a set of transformations in the mental sphere which finds in animate nature the channel for actualizing its own potentialities throughout the series of successive becomings comprising the individual continuumThrough the exercise of our will therefore we build for ourselves our own world independent of coercion by extrinsic forces and mould the destiny that awaits us in time to come whether for happiness or misery for bondage or liberationFor the spiritual aspirant however it is not sufficient merely to understand the theoretical ground for the differentiation of living beingsFor us it is of the utmost importance to know what we can do to further our own progress along the scale of spiritual evolution  to advance to higher levels of attainment during the course of our earthly life to secure a rebirth conducive to spiritual growth in the life to come and ultimately to transcend this repetitive cycle of birth and death and attain Nibbana the supreme and irreversible deliveranceThe answer to this problem begins with the fact that kamma divides itself according to its moral quality into two types  the unwholesome and the wholesomeUnwholesome kamma is action  physical verbal or mental  that springs from the three unwholesome roots of action greed hatred and delusionAny action grounded in these roots is spiritually detrimental and morally defectiveIt destroys the higher faculties entails suffering as its consequence and causes a plunge into lower states of existence in short it brings decline along the scale of spiritual evolution and deeper immersion in the mire of phenomenal existenceWholesome kamma on the other hand is action springing from the three contrary wholesome roots  nongreed nonhatred and nondelusion finding positive expression in the qualities of charity lovingkindness and wisdom respectivelyWholesome action functions in a way diametrically opposite to its dark counterpartIt is spiritually beneficial and morally commendable stimulates the unfolding of the higher faculties and entails happiness both in the present and in time to comeConsistently practiced it promotes progress along the evolutionary scale leading to higher states of existence in successive lifespans and finally to the realization of deliveranceOn ultimate analysis life is a selfregenerating sequence of occasions of experience comprising occasions of action and occasions of receptionAction is volition and volition inevitably involves decision or choice  a selection from the welter of possibilities open to the will of that alternative most conformable to the individuals purpose a selection even at a higher level of the purposes themselvesEvery moment of morally significant action therefore confronts us with the call for a decision with the necessity for choiceChoice must work within the gamut of options open to the will and these options despite their great differences of qualitative character necessarily fall into one of two classes according to their ethical nature  into the wholesome or the unwholesomeThe one leads to progress the other to declineThence progress or decline depends entirely upon our choice and not upon any external agency whether conceived in spiritualistic or materialistic garbThrough our fleeting momentary decisions accumulated over long periods we model our fortune and chisel out of the unshaped block of futurity the destiny that will befall us in the span of time to comeEach call for a decision may be depicted as a ladder one end leading upward to unknown heights and the other extending downward into forbidding depths while our successive decisions may be taken as the steps that lead us up or down the ladders graded rungsOr again each moment of action may be compared to a crossroad at which we stand a forked road one side of which leads to a city of bliss and the other to a swampland of misery and despairThe two roads stand fixed and silent awaiting our choice and only our decision determines whether we shall reach the one destination or the otherIn sum then it is our kamma that precipitates our destiny for it is kamma that brings about manifestation of all the destinations or realms of sentient existence and kamma ultimately that fashions the entire variegated landscape of sentient existence itself according to the ethical tone of its associated moral rootsAs the Exalted One explains speaking not through speculation but through his own direct penetration of the paths leading to all destinationsIt is not creatures of the hells of the animal kingdom of the ghostly realm or any others of a miserable form of existence that appear through action born of nongreed born of nonhate born of nondelusion it is rather celestial beings humans or any other creatures belonging to a happy form of existence that make their appearance through action born of nongreed nonhate and nondelusionAnguttara NikayaThe performance of deeds of merit forms one of the most essential elements of Buddhist practiceIts various modes provide in their totality a compendium of applied Buddhism showing Buddhism not as a system of ideas but as a complete way of lifeBuddhist popular belief has often emphasized merit as a productive source of worldly blessings  of health wealth long life beauty and friendsAs a result of this emphasis meritorious activity has come to be conceived rather in terms of a financial investment as a religious business venture yielding returns to the satisfaction of the agents mundane desiresWhile such a conception no doubt contains an element of truth its popularization has tended to eclipse the more important function merit plays in the context of Buddhist practiceSeen in correct perspective merit is an essential ingredient in the harmony and completeness of the spiritual life a means of selfcultivation and an indispensable steppingstone to spiritual progressThe accumulation of a stock of merit is a primary requisite for acquiring all the fruits of the Buddhist religious life from a pleasant abiding here and now to a favorable rebirth in the life to come from the initial stages of meditative progress to the realization of the states of sanctity that come as the fruits of entering upon the noble pathThe highest fruition of merit is identical with the culmination of the Buddhist holy life itself  that is emancipation from the shackles of samsaric existence and the realization of Nibbana the unconditioned state beyond the insubstantial phenomena of the worldThe mere piling up of merit to be sure is not in itself sufficient to guarantee the attainment of this goalMerit is only one requisite and it must be balanced by its counterpart to secure the breakthrough from bondage to final freedomThe counterpart of merit is knowledge the direct confrontation with the basic truths of existence through the eye of intuitive wisdomMerit and knowledge together constitute the two sets of equipment the spiritual aspirant requires in the quest for deliverance the equipment of merit and the equipment of knowledge respectivelyEach set of equipment has its own contribution to make to the fulfillment of the spiritual lifeThe equipment of merit facilitates progress in the course of samsaric wandering it brings a favorable rebirth the encounter with good friends to guide ones footsteps along the path the meeting with opportunities for spiritual growth the flowering of the lofty qualities of character and the maturation of the spiritual faculties required for the higher attainmentsThe equipment of knowledge brings the factor directly necessary for cutting the bonds of samsaric existence the penetration of truth enlightenment the undistorted comprehension of the nature of actualityEither set of equipment functioning in isolation is insufficient to the attainment of the goal either pursued alone leads to a deviant onesided development that departs from the straight path to deliverance taught by the BuddhaMerit without knowledge produces pleasant fruit and a blissful rebirth but cannot issue in the transcendence of the mundane order and entrance upon the supramundane pathAnd knowledge without the factors of merit deteriorates into dry intellectualism mere erudition or scholasticism impotent when confronted with the task of grasping a truth outside the pale of intellectionBut when they function together in unison in the life of the aspirant the two sets of equipment acquire a potency capable of propelling him to the heights of realizationWhen each set of equipment complements the other polishes the other and perfects the other then they undergo a graduated course of mutual purification culminating at the crest in the twin endowments of the Emancipated One  in that clear knowledge and flawless conduct which make him in the words of the Buddha supreme among gods and humansBut while merit and knowledge thus occupy coordinate positions it is merit that claims priority from the standpoint of spiritual dynamicsThe reason is that works of merit come first in the process of inner growthIf knowledge be the flower that gives birth to the fruit of liberation and faith the seed out of which the flower unfolds then merit is the soil water and fertilizer all in one  the indispensable nutriment for every stage of growthMerit paves the way for knowledge and finds in knowledge the sanction for its own claim to a place in the system of Buddhist trainingThe reason for this particular sequential structure is closely linked to the Buddhist conception of noetic realizationFrom the Buddhist standpoint the comprehension of spiritual truth is not a matter of mere intellectual cogitation but of existential actualizationThat is it is a matter of grasping with our whole being the truth towards which we aspire and of inwardly appropriating that truth in a manner so total and complete that our being becomes transformed into a very reflex and effusion of the truth upon which we standThe understanding of truth in the context of the spiritual life in other words is no affair of accumulating bits and pieces of information publicly accessible and subjectively indifferent it is rather a process of uncovering the deepest truths about ourselves and about the world and of working the understanding that emerges into the entire complex of the inner lifeHence the use of the words actualization and realization which bring into the open the ontological backdrop underlying the noetic processIn order to grasp truth in this totalistic manner at any particular stage of spiritual development the tenor of our inner being must be raised to a pitch where it is fit for the reception of some new disclosure of the truthWisdom and character though not identical are at any rate parallel terms which in most cases mature in a delicately balanced ratioWe can grasp only what we are fit to grasp and our fitness is largely a function of our characterThe existential comprehension of truth thus becomes a matter of inward worth of deservingness or of meritThe way to effect this inward worthiness is by the performance of works of merit not merely outwardly but backed by the proper attitudes and disposition of mindFor the capacity to comprehend truths pertaining to the spiritual order is always proportional to the store and quality of accumulated meritThe greater and finer the merit the larger and deeper the capacity for understandingThis principle holds at each level of maturation in the ascent towards full realization and applies with special force to the comprehension of ultimate truthUltimate truth in the Buddhas Teaching is Nibbana the unconditioned element and realization of ultimate truth the realization of NibbanaNibbana is the perfection of purity the destruction of all passions the eradication of clinging the abolition of every impulse towards selfaffirmationThe final thrust to the realization of Nibbana is the special province of wisdom since wisdom alone is adequate to the task of comprehending all conditioned phenomena in their essential nature as impermanent suffering and notself and of turning away from them to penetrate the unconditioned where alone permanent freedom from suffering is to be foundBut that this penetration may take place our interior must be made commensurate in purity with the truth it would grasp and this requires in the first instance that it be purged of all those elements obstructive to the florescence of a higher light and knowledgeThe apprehension of Nibbana this perfect purity secluded from the dust of passion is only possible when a corresponding purity has been set up within ourselvesFor only a pure mind can discern through the dark mist of ignorance and defilement the spotless purity of Nibbana abiding in absolute solitude beyond the turmoil of the phenomenal processionThe achievement of such a purification of our inward being is the work of meritMerit scours the mind of the coarser defilements attenuates the grip of the unwholesome roots and fortifies the productive power of the wholesome beneficial statesThrough its cumulative force it provides the foundation for wisdoms final breakthrough to the unconditionedIt is the fuel so to speak for the ascent of wisdom from the mundane to the supramundaneJust as the initial stages of a lunar rocket work up the momentum that enables the uppermost stage to break the gravitational pull of the earth and reach the moon so does merit give to the spiritual life that forward thrust that will propel the wisdomfaculty past the gravitational pull of the mundane order and permit it to penetrate the transcendental truthThe classical Buddhist commentators underscore this preparatory purgative function of merit when they define merit etymologically as that which purges and purifies the mental continuumMerit performs its purgative function in the context of a complex process involving an agent and object of purification and a mode of operation by which the purification takes placeThe agent of purification is the mind itself in its creative formative role as the source and matrix of actionDeeds of merit are as we have already seen instances of wholesome kamma and kamma ultimately reduces to volitionTherefore at the fundamental level of analysis a deed of merit consists in a volition a determinative act of will belonging to the righteous orderSince volition is a mode of mental activity this means that merit turns out under scrutiny to be a mode of mental activityIt is at the core of the behaviorpattern which serves as its vehicle a particular application of thought by which the mind marshalls its components for the achievement of a chosen endThis discovery cautions us against misconstruing the Buddhist stress on the practice of merit as a call for blind subjection to rules and ritesThe primary instrument behind any act of merit from the Buddhist point of view is the mindThe deed itself in its physical or vocal dimension serves mainly as an expression of a corresponding state of consciousness and without a keen awareness of the nature and significance of the meritorious deed the bare outward act is devoid of purgative valueEven when rules of conduct are observed or rituals and worship performed with a view to the acquisition of merit the spiritual potency of these structures derives not from any intrinsic sanctity they might possess in themselves but from their effectiveness in channelizing the current of mental activity in a spiritual beneficial directionThey function in effect as skillful means or expedient devices for inducing wholesome states of consciousnessMechanical conformity to moral rules or the performance of religious duties through unquestioning obedience to established forms far from serving as a means to salvation in the Buddhist outlook actually constitute obstaclesThey are instances of clinging to rules and rituals the third of the fetters binding beings to the wheel of becoming which must be abandoned in order to enter upon the path to final deliveranceEven in such relatively external forms of meritmaking as the undertaking of moral precepts and ceremonial worship mindfulness and clear comprehension are essential much more then are they necessary to the predominantly internal modes of meritorious activity such as meditation or the study of the DhammaThe object of the purifying process of merit is again the mind only here considered not from the standpoint of its immediacy as a creative source of action but from the standpoint of its duration as a continuumFor looked at from the temporal point of view the mind is no stable entity enduring selfidentical through its changing activities it is rather a serial continuity composed of discrete acts of mentation bound to one another by exact laws of causal interconnectionEach thoughtunit flashes into being persists for an extremely brief moment and then perishes passing on to its immediate successor its storage of recorded impressionsEach individual member of the series inherits preserves and transmits along with its own novel modifications the entire content of the series as a whole which thus underlies every one of its componentsThence the series maintains despite its discontinuous composition an element of uniformity that gives to the flow of separate thoughtmoments the character of a continuumThis sequential current of mentation has been going on according to Buddhism without discernible beginningDriven forward from life to life by ignorance and craving it appears now in one mode of manifestation now in anotherEmbedded in the mental continuum throughout its beginningless journey is a host of particularly afflictive and disruptive mental forces known as kilesas defilements Foremost among them are the three unwholesome roots  greed hatred and delusion from this triad spring the remaining members of the set such as pride opinion selfishness envy sloth and restlessnessDuring moments of passivity the defilements lie dormant at the base of the mental continuum as anusaya or latent tendenciesBut when either through the impact of outer sensory stimuli or their own subliminal process of growth they acquire sufficient force they surge to the surface of consciousness in the form of obsessionsThe obsessions pollute the mind with their toxic flow and rebound upon the deeper levels of consciousness reinforcing their roots at the base of the continuumIf they should gather still additional charge the defilements may reach the even more dangerous stage of transgression when they erupt as bodily or verbal actions that violate the fundamental laws of morality and lead to pain and suffering as their retributive consequenceWhen merit is said to purge and purify the mental continuum it is so described in reference to its capacity to arrest the surging tide of the defilements which threatens to sweep the mind towards the perilous deep of transgressional actionOnly wisdom  the supramundane wisdom of the noble paths  can eradicate the defilements at the level of latency which is necessary if the bonds of existence are to be broken and deliverance attainedBut the practice of merit can contribute much towards attenuating their obsessive force and establishing a foothold for wisdom to exercise its liberating functionWisdom can operate only upon the base of a purified mind the accumulation of merit purifies the mind hence merit provides the supporting condition for wisdomWhen the mind is allowed to flow according to its own momentum without restraint or control like a turbulent river it casts up to the surface  ie to the level of active consciousness  the store of pollutants it harbors at its base lust hatred delusion and their derivative defilementsIf the defilements are then given further scope to grow by indulging them they will wither the potential for good darken the beam of awareness and strangle the faculty of wisdom until it is reduced to a mere vestigeThe performance of meritorious deeds serves as a means of resisting the upsurge of defiling states of replacing them with their wholesome opposites and of thereby purifying the mental continuum to an extent sufficient to supply wisdom with the storage of strength it requires in the work of abolishing the defilementsThe effectiveness of merit in purifying the mental continuum stems from the concordance of a number of psychological lawsThese laws which can only be indicated briefly here together function as the silent groundwork for the efficacy of the entire corpus of Buddhist spiritual practiceThe first is the law that only one state of consciousness can occur at a time though seemingly trivial this law leads to important consequences when taken in conjunction with the restThe second holds that states of consciousness with mutually opposed ethical qualities cannot coexistThe third stipulates that all the factors of consciousness  feeling perception volition and the remaining states included in the aggregate of mental formations  must partake of the same ethical quality as the consciousness itselfA kammically active state of consciousness is either entirely wholesome or entirely unwholesome it cannot be bothTherefore if a wholesome state is occurring no unwholesome state can simultaneously occurA wholesome spiritually beneficial state of consciousness necessarily shuts out every unwholesome detrimental state as well as all unwholesome concomitant factors of consciousnessSo at the moment one is performing an act of merit the consciousness and volition behind that meritorious deed will automatically preclude an unwholesome consciousness volition and the associated defilementsAt that moment at least the consciousness will be pureAnd the frequent performance of meritorious acts will on every occasion bar out the opportunity for the defilements to arise at the time of their performanceThus the performance of deeds of merit always induces a momentary purification while the frequent performance of such deeds induces many occasions of momentary purificationBut that some more durable result might be achieved an additional principle is necessaryThis principle is supplied by the fourth lawThe fourth law holds that repetition confers strengthJust as the exercise of a particular muscle can transform that muscle from a frail ineffectual strip of flesh into a dynamo of power and strength so the repeated exercise of individual mental qualities can remodel them from sleeping soldiers into invincible warriors in the spiritual questRepetition is the key to the entire process of selftransformation which constitutes the essence of the spiritual lifeIt is the very grounding that makes selftransformation possibleBy force of repetition the fragile tender shoots of the pure and wholesome qualities  faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom  can blossom into sovereign faculties in the struggle for enlightenment or into indomitable powers in the battle against the defilementsBy repeated resistance to the upsurge of evil and repeated application to the cultivation of the good the demon can become a god and the criminal a saintIf repetition provides the key to selftransformation then volition provides the instrument through which repetition worksVolition acts as a vector force upon the mental continuum out of which it emerges reorienting the continuum according to its own moral toneEach act of will recedes with its passing into the onward rushing current of mentation and drives the current in its own directionWholesome volitions direct the continuum towards the good  towards purity wisdom and ultimate liberation unwholesome volitions drive it towards the evil  towards defilement ignorance and inevitable bondageEvery occasion of volition modifies the mental life in some way and to some degree however slight so that the overall character of an individual at any one time stands as a reflex and revelation of the volitions accumulated in the continuumSince the will propels the entire current of mental life in its own direction it is the will which must be strengthened by force of repetitionThe restructuring of mental life can only take place through the reformation of the will by leading it unto wholesome channelsThe effective channel for reorientation of the will is the practice of meritWhen the will is directed towards the cultivation of merit it will spontaneously hamper the stream of defilements and bolster the company of noble qualities in the storage of the continuumUnder its gentle tutelage the factors of purity will awaken from their dormant condition and take their place as regular propensities in the personalityA will devoted to the practice of charity will generate kindness and compassion a will devoted to the observance of the precepts will generate harmlessness honesty restraint truthfulness and sobriety a will devoted to mental culture will generate calm and insightFaith reverence humility sympathy courage and equanimity will come to growthConsciousness will gain in tranquillity buoyancy pliancy agility and proficiencyAnd a consciousness made pure by these factors will advance without hindrance through the higher attainments in meditation and wisdom to the realization of Nibbana the consummation of spiritual endeavorPrince Siddhattha renounced the life of the palace and entered the forest as a hermit seeking a solution to the problem of sufferingSix years after entering he came out a Buddha ready to show others the path he had found so that they too could work out their deliveranceIt was the experience of being bound to the perishable and unsatisfying that gave the impetus to the Buddhas original quest and it was the certainty of having found the unperishing and perfectly complete that inspired the execution of his missionThence the Buddha could sum up his Teaching in the single phrase I teach only suffering and the cessation of suffering But though the Buddhas Teaching might be simple in its statement the meaning behind the verbal formulation is profound and preciseThe Buddha envisages suffering in its full range and essence rather than in its mere manifest formsIt is not just physical or mental pain that he means by suffering but the recurrent revolution of the wheel of becoming with its spokes of birth aging and deathTaking our immersion in a condition intrinsically inadequate as the starting point of his doctrine he devotes the remainder to showing the way out of this conditionThe solution the Buddha offers to the problem of suffering draws its cogency from the strict logic of causalitySuffering is neither an accident nor an imposition from without but a contingent phenomenon arising through the force of conditionsIt hangs upon a specific set of supports and is therefore susceptible to treatment by tackling the genetic structure which maintains it in beingBy removing the conditions out of which it arises it is possible to bring the whole phenomenon of suffering to an endIn order to reach the state of emancipation it is of the first importance that the causal chain which originates suffering be snapped in the right placeAny proposed solution which does not remedy the problem of suffering at its source will eventually prove to be only a palliative not a final cureThat the chain be broken in the right place requires an accurate determination of the interconnection of its linksThe chain must be traced back to its most fundamental factor and cut off at that very pointThen suffering will no longer be able to ariseAccording to the Buddhas Teaching the primary link in the sequence of conditions generating suffering is ignoranceIgnorance is a primordial blindness to the true nature of phenomena it is a lack of understanding of things as they really areIt functions as a mental obscuration cloaking our normal process of cognition and permeating our thought patterns with distortion and errorAmong the various misconceptions produced by ignorance the most basic is the apprehension of phenomena through the category of substantial existencePhenomena are not isolated units locked up in themselves but participants in an interconnected field of eventsTheir being derives from the entire system of relata to which they belong not from some immutable core of identity intrinsic to themselvesThence they are devoid of an abiding essence their mode of being is insubstantial relational and interdependentHowever under the influence of ignorance this essenceless nature of phenomena is not understoodIt is blotted out by the basic unawareness and as a consequence phenomena present themselves to cognition in a mode different from their actual mode of beingThey appear substantial selfsubsistent and exclusivisticThe sphere where this illusion is most immediately felt is the sphere where it is most accessible to us  namely our own experienceThe experiential domain is reflectively divisible into two sectors  a cognizing or subjective sector made up of consciousness and its adjuncts and a cognized or objective sector made up of the cognitive dataThough the two sectors are interlocking and mutually dependent through the operation of ignorance they are conceptually bifurcated and reduced to an adventitious subjectobject confrontationOn the one side the cognizing sector is split off from the experiential complex and conceived as a subject distinct from the cognitive act itself the objective sector in turn congeals into a world of external things pointing to the subject as its field of action and concernConsciousness awakens to itself as a persisting ego standing up against the world as an other perpetually estranged from itselfThence it commences its long career of conquest control and domination in order to justify its own suspect claim to a selfsubsistent mode of beingThis cognitive error with its consequent solidification of the ego is the source of the afflictions which hold us in subjection to sufferingThe lurking suspicion that the mode of being we credit to ourselves may be unfounded arouses an inner disquietude a chronic anxiety compelling a drive to fortify the sense of egoity and give it solid ground on which to standWe need to establish our existence to ourselves to give inner confirmation to our conception of personal substantiality and this need occasions the ordering of the psychic life around the focal point of egoThe bid for selfconfirmation makes its impact felt on both the emotional and intellectual frontsThe dominion of the ego in the emotional sphere appears most conspicuously in the weight of the unwholesome roots  greed hatred and delusion  as determinants of conductBecause the ego is essentially a vacuum the illusion of egohood generates a nagging sense of insufficiencyWe feel oppressed by an aching incompleteness an inner lack requiring constantly to be filledThe result is greed a relentless drive to reach out and devour whatever we can  of pleasure wealth power and fame  in a never successful attempt to bring the discomfort fully to an endWhen our drive to satisfaction meets with frustration we react with hatred the urge to destroy the obstacle between our desire and its satisfactionIf the obstructions to our satisfaction prove too powerful for the tactics of aggression a third strategy will be used dullness or delusion an attitude of deliberate unawareness adopted as a shell to hide our vulnerability to painOn the intellectual front the egoillusion engenders a move by reason to establish on logical grounds the existence of a substantial selfThe idea I am is a spontaneous notion born of ignorance the basic unawareness of the egoless nature of phenomenaBy accepting this idea at its face value as pointing to a real I and by attempting to fill in the reference we develop a view of self a belief confirming the existence of a self and giving it an identity in the framework of our psychophysical constitutionThe theories which emerge invariably fall into one or another of the two metaphysical extremes  either eternalism when we assume the self to enjoy eternal existence after death or annihilationism when we assume the self to be extinguished at deathNeither doctrine can be established on absolutely compelling grounds for both are rounded on a common error the assumption of a self as an enduring substantial entityBecause the pivot of our cognitive adherences and their emotional ramifications is the notion of an ego a powerful current of psychic energy comes to be invested in our interpretive schemesAnd because the notion of an ego is in actuality groundless the product of a fundamental misconception this investment of energy brings only disappointment in the endWe cling to things in the hope that they will be permanent satisfying and substantial and they turn out to be impermanent unsatisfying and insubstantialWe seek to impose our will upon the order of events and we find that events obey a law of their own insubordinate to our urge towards controlThe result of our clinging is eventual sufferingYet this suffering which arises from the breakdown of our egocentric attempts at dominance and manipulation is not entirely negative in valueIt contains a tremendous positive value a vast potential for by shattering our presumptions it serves to awaken our basic intelligence and set us on the quest for liberationIt forces us to discover the ultimate futility of our drive to structure the world from the standpoint of the ego and makes us recognize the need to acquire a new perspective free from the compulsive patterns which keep us tied to sufferingSince the most fundamental factor in the bondage of the ego is ignorance to reach this new perspective ignorance must be eliminatedTo eliminate ignorance it is not sufficient merely to observe rules of conduct to generate faith devotion and virtue or even to develop a calm and concentrated mindAll these are requisites to be sure essential and powerful aids along the path but even in unison they are not enoughSomething more is required some other element that alone can ensure the complete severing of the conditional nexus sustaining the round of samsaric sufferingThat something more is understandingThe path to liberation is essentially a path of understandingIts core is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are It is for one who knows and sees that the destruction of the defilements takes place not for one who does not know and does not see The objective domain where understanding is to be aroused is our own experienceSince our distorted interpretations of our experience provide the food which nourishes the process of ego it is here in experience that the egoillusion must be dispelledOur own experience is of all things that which is closest to ourselves for it is through this that everything else is registered and knownAnd yet though so close our own experience is at the same time shrouded in darkness its true characteristics hidden from our awareness by the screen of ignoranceThe Buddhas Teaching is the key which helps us to correct our understanding enabling us to see things as they areIt is the light which dispels the darkness of ignorance so that we can understand our own understanding of things just as a man with eyes might see forms illuminated by a lampThe correct understanding of experience takes place in the context of meditationIt requires the development of insight based on a foundation of meditative calmNo amount of merely intellectual knowledge can replace the need for personal realizationBecause our tendency to misconceive phenomena persists through a blindness to their true nature only the elimination of this blindness through direct vision can rectify our erroneous patterns of cognitionThe practice of Buddhist meditation is not a way of dissolving our sense of individual identity in some undifferentiated absolute or of withdrawing into the bliss of a selfcontained interiorityIt is rather a way of understanding the nature of things through the portal where that nature is most accessible to ourselves namely our own processes of body and of mindThe practice of meditation has profound effects upon our sense of identity the alterations it produces however do not come about by subordinating the intelligence to some uncritically accepted generalization but through a detached sober and exhaustive scrutiny of the experiential field that provides the locus for our sense of identityThe focal method of the practice of meditation is reflective awareness a bending back of the beam of awareness upon itself in order to illuminate the true characteristics of existence implicated in each occasion of cognitionThe path of understanding unfolds in three successive stages called the three full understandings In the first stage the full understanding of the known the domain of experience is broken down by meditative analysis into its constituting factors which are then carefully defined in terms of their salient qualities and functionsThe categories employed in this operation are the key terms in the Buddhist analysis of personality  the aggregates sense bases and elementsThe purpose of this dissection is to dispel the illusion of substantiality that hovers over our gross perception of our experienceBy revealing that what common sense takes to be a solid monolithic whole is in reality a conglomeration of discrete factors the contemplation deprives the sense of selfidentification of its chief support the notion of the ego as a simple unityThe factors which emerge from this analytical investigation are then correlated with their causes and conditions disclosing their contingency and lack of independenceThe second stage of understanding is the full understanding of scrutinizationAt this stage the experiential field is examined not as before in terms of its individuating features but by way of its universal marksThese universal marks are three impermanence suffering and nonselfUnder the limitations of ordinary cognition phenomena are apprehended as permanent pleasurable and selfIn the contemplative situation these assumptions must be corrected replaced by the perception of phenomena as impermanent unpleasurable and nonselfThe task of the meditative process at this level is to ascribe these qualities to the material and mental processes and to attempt to view all phenomena in their lightWhen the second stage is fully mature it gives way gradually to the third type of comprehension the full understanding of abandonmentHere the momentary insights achieved at the previous level blossom into full penetrationsImpermanence suffering and selflessness are no longer merely understood as qualities of phenomena but are seen with complete clarity as the nature of phenomena themselvesThese realizations bring about the final abandonment of the deluded perceptions as well as the destruction of the egotainted emotions which cluster around themTo walk the path of understanding is to begin to see through the deceptions which have held our imaginations captive through the long stretch of beginningless timeIt is to outgrow our passions and prejudices and to cast off the mask of false identities we are accustomed to assume the vast array of identities that constitute our wandering in samsaric existenceThe path is not an easy one but calls for great effort and personal integrityIts reward lies in the happiness of growing freedom which accompanies each courageous step and the ultimate emancipation which lies at the endBhikkhu Bodhi is a Buddhist monk of American nationality born in New York City inAfter completing a doctorate in philosophy at Claremont Graduate School he came to Sri Lanka in for the purpose of entering the SanghaHe received pabbajja in and upasampada in both under the eminent scholarmonk the Venerable Balangoda Ananda Maitreya with whom he studied Pall and DhammaHe is the author of several works on Theravada Buddhism including four translations of major Pali suttas along with their commentariesSince he has been the Editor for the Buddhist Publication Society and its President sinceThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAs a skilled and versatile teacher with mastery over pedagogic technique the Buddha adopted different styles of presentation to communicate the Dhamma to his disciplesOften he would explain a teaching in detailHaving introduced his topic with a short statement technically called the uddesa or synopsis he would then embark on the detailed exposition the niddesa also called the analysis the vibhangaIn this stage of the discourse he would break the subject introduced by the synopsis down into its component strands define each strand in turn and draw out its implications sometimes attaching a simile to illustrate the message of the discourseFinally he would restate the introductory declaration as a conclusion now supported by the entire weight of the foregoing analysisOn other occasions however the Buddha would not teach in detailInstead he would present the Dhamma briefly offering only a short sometimes even cryptic statement charged with a profound but highly concentrated meaningThe Buddha did not teach the Doctrine in this way in order to conceal an esoteric message or because he delighted in obscurantismHe used this technique because it sometimes proved a more effective means of shaking and transforming the minds of his auditors than would have been possible by a full elaborationAlthough direct explanation of the meaning might have transmitted information more quickly such a method might not have produced the lasting and edifying effect the Dhamma is intended to instilBut by requiring the disciples to reflect upon the meaning and to tease it out by sustained inquiry as well as by mutual discussion the Buddha ensured that when the disciples did come to understand his utterance its message would penetrate deep into the silent recesses of the mindWhile such brief teachings would escape the understanding of the great majority of the monks the mature disciples with sharp faculties of wisdom could readily fathom their meaningUnder such circumstances the ordinary monks reluctant to trouble their Master with requests for explanation would turn for clarification to the senior disciples whose comprehension of the Dhamma had already been confirmed by the Blessed OneSo important did this function become in the early Buddhist Sangha that the Buddha himself established in the ranks of his most eminent disciples a separate category called the foremost of those who analyze in detail the meaning of what was stated in briefThe bhikkhu who was assigned to this position by the Master was the Venerable Maha Kaccana  Kaccana the Great so called to distinguish him from others who bore the common brahmanical clan name of KaccayanaAfter his ordination as a bhikkhu the Venerable Maha Kaccana usually resided in his homeland of Avanti a remote region to the southwest of the Middle Country where the Buddha dwelt and thus he did not spend as much time in the Blessed Ones presence as some of the other great disciples did such as Sariputta Maha Moggallana and AnandaFor this reason we do not find in the records of the Sutta Pitaka that the Venerable Maha Kaccana figured as prominently in Sangha affairs and in the Buddhas ministry as the aforementioned eldersNevertheless on account of the astuteness of his intellect the profundity of his insight into the Dhamma and his skill as a speaker whenever Maha Kaccana did join the Buddha for extended periods the other monks frequently turned to him for help in illuminating the meaning of brief statements of the Buddha that had been causing them bafflementAs a result we find in the Pali canon a sheaf of discourses spoken by the Venerable Maha Kaccana that occupy a place of primary importanceThese texts always methodically refined and analytically precise demonstrate with astounding lucidity the farranging implications and practical bearings of several brief statements of the Buddha that would otherwise without his explication of them escape our understandingAs in the case of all the Buddhas chief disciples the Venerable Maha Kaccanas elevation to a position of preeminence in the Sangha was the flowering of a seed that had been planted long ago in the rolling cycles of samsara the round of rebirths and had been brought to gradual maturity over countless livesThe biographical sketch of Maha Kaccana relates the story of the future disciples original aspiration to a leading role in the SanghaAccording to this account the aspiration was formed aeons in the past during the Dispensation of the Buddha PadumuttaraAt that time Kaccana had been reborn into a wealthy householder familyOne day he went to hear the Buddha preach and on that occasion during his sermon the Buddha appointed a certain bhikkhu as the foremost of those who can analyze in detail what had been stated by him in briefThe young householder was deeply impressed by the monk on whom this honor was bestowed and the thought occurred to him Great indeed is that bhikkhu in that the Teacher praises him soI ought to attain such a position in the Dispensation of some future BuddhaBut to attain such a lofty status in the Dispensation the generation of a wish is by no means sufficientThe aspiration must be supported by a base of meritorious deedsThus the young householder invited the Teacher to receive alms at his home and for a full week he bestowed lavish offerings on the Buddha and his company of monksAt the weeks end he prostrated himself at the Blessed Ones feet and voiced his hearts desire Venerable sir as the fruit of this offering I do not wish for any other achievement but this that in the future in the Dispensation of a Buddha I might obtain the same position as the bhikkhu you appointed to that position last weekThen Lord Padumuttara looking into the future with his unimpeded knowledge of a Fully Enlightened One saw that the youths aspiration would be fulfilledHe told him Young man in the future after aeons have elapsed a Buddha named Gotama will ariseIn his Dispensation you will be the foremost of those who can analyze in detail the meaning of what the Buddha has stated in briefThe Apadana relates that in this same past life Kaccana had built for the Buddha Padumuttara a stupa with a stone seat which he had covered with gold he had the stupa embellished with a jewelled parasol and an ornamental fanAccording to the above text it was after he made this offering that the Lord Padumuttara predicted his future attainment to the position of a great disciple in the Dispensation of the Buddha GotamaIn this prediction the Blessed One also makes other prophecies concerning Kaccanas future sojourn in samsara which from our temporal perspective would now constitute his past historyThe Buddha foretold that as the fruit of his meritorious gifts the householder would become a lord of the gods for thirty aeons exercising rulership over the godsHaving returned to the human world he would become a world monarch named Pabhassara whose body would emit rays of light all aroundHe would spend his next to last existence in the Tusita heaven and passing away from there he would be reborn in a brahman family with the clan name KaccanaIn that life he would attain arahantship and be appointed a great disciple by the BuddhaA later section of the Apadana gives a somewhat different account of Maha Kaccanas original aspiration to great discipleshipIn this version at the time of the Buddha Padumuttara the future disciple was an ascetic living in seclusion in the HimalayasOne day while traveling through the sky by supernormal power he passed over a populated area and saw the Victorious One down belowHe descended approached the Master to listen to the Dhamma and heard him praise a certain bhikkhu as the chief among those who can elaborate on brief statementsThereupon the ascetic amazed by this unexpected encounter went to the Himalayas collected a bouquet of flowers and quickly returning to the assembly presented them to the BuddhaAt that point he formed the aspiration to become the chief expositor of the Dhamma in the Dispensation of some future BuddhaThe Lord Padumuttara then prophesied that his aspiration would be fulfilled aeons later when the Buddha Gotama arises in the worldIn this same series of verses Maha Kaccana states that as a result of his offering to the Buddha he never took rebirth thereafter in the nether world  in the hells the animal realm or the sphere of ghosts  but was always reborn either in the world of gods or in the human realmAlso when he took rebirth as a human being he was always reborn into the upper two social classes  among nobles or brahmans  and never into lowclass familiesOne important incident which determined a particular feature of the great disciples physical appearance during his final existence took place during the Dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa the immediate predecessor of Gotama in the lineage of Enlightened OnesAt the time of the Buddha Kassapa Kaccana had taken rebirth in a family of BenaresAfter the Lord Kassapas Parinibbana he offered a precious golden brick for the construction of a golden stupa for the BuddhaOn presenting it he made the wish Whenever I am reborn may my body always have a golden hue As a result of this when he was reborn during the time of our Buddha his body was endowed with a beautiful golden hue which deeply impressed those who beheld itIn one case which we will discuss below this physical attribute of the elder led to a bizarre series of eventsIn his last existence when the Buddha Gotama appeared in the world Kaccana was born as the son of the chaplain in the city of Ujjeni the capital of Avanti to the southwest of the Middle CountryHis fathers personal name was Tiritivaccha his mothers Candima and they were of the Kaccayana clan one of the oldest and most highly respected lines of brahmansSince he was born with a golden colored body his parents exclaimed that he had brought his name along with him at birth and they named him Kañcana which means golden As a brahman and the son of the court chaplain when Kañcana grew up he studied the Three Vedas the traditional sacred scriptures of the brahmans and after his fathers death he succeeded him in the position of court chaplainThe king of Avanti at the time that Kaccana became chaplain was Candappajjota Pajjota the ViolentHe was known by this epithet because of his explosive and unpredictable temperWhen King Candappajjota heard that the Buddha had arisen in the world he assembled his ministers and asked those who were so capable to go and invite the Blessed One to visit UjjeniThe ministers all agreed that the only one who was truly capable of bringing the Buddha to Avanti was the chaplain KaccanaThe king therefore assigned him to go on this mission but Kaccana laid down a condition before he would accede to the kings request he would go only if he would be permitted to become a monk after meeting the Enlightened OneThe king ready to accept any condition in exchange for a meeting with the Tathagata gave his consentKaccana set out accompanied by seven other courtiersWhen they met the Master he taught them the Dhamma and at the end of the discourse Kaccana and his seven companions all attained arahantship together with the four analytical knowledgesThe Buddha granted them ordination simply by welcoming them into the Sangha with the words Come bhikkhusThe new bhikkhu now the Venerable Maha Kaccana then began to praise the splendors of Ujjeni to the BuddhaThe Master realized that his new disciple wanted him to travel to his native land but he replied that it would be sufficient for Kaccana to go himself as he was already capable of teaching the Dhamma and of inspiring confidence in King CandappajjotaIn the course of their return journey the party of monks arrived at a town named Telapanali where they stopped to gather almsIn that town lived two maidens merchants daughters of different familiesOne girl was beautiful with lovely long hair but both her parents had expired and she lived in poverty looked after by her governessThe other girl was wealthy but was afflicted with an illness that had caused her to lose her hairRepeatedly she had tried to persuade the poor girl to sell her hair so she could make a wig but the poor girl had consistently refusedNow when the poor girl saw the Venerable Maha Kaccana and his fellow monks walking for alms their bowls as empty as if they had just been washed she felt a sudden surge of faith and devotion arise in her towards the elder and she decided to offer alms to the party of bhikkhusHowever as she had no wealth the only way she could obtain money to buy provisions was to sell her hair to the rich girlThis time as the hair came to the rich girl already cut she paid only eight coins for itWith these eight coins the poor girl had almsfood prepared for the eight bhikkhus using one coin for each portionAfter she had presented the alms as an immediate fruit of the meritorious deed her full head of hair instantly grew back to its original lengthWhen the Venerable Maha Kaccana arrived back in Ujjeni he reported this incident to King CandappajjotaThe king had the girl conveyed to his palace and at once appointed her his chief queenFrom that time onwards the king greatly honored Maha KaccanaMany people of Ujjeni who heard the elder preach gained faith in the Dhamma and went forth under him as monksThus the entire city became a single blaze of saffron robes a blowing back and forth of the banner of sages The queen who was exceedingly devoted to the elder built for him a dwelling in the Golden Grove ParkSo says the Anguttara Commentary but the Pali canon itself suggests that the Sangha was not as well established in Avanti as the commentator would lead us to believeThis fact can be discerned from a story involving the Venerable Maha Kaccana that is reported in the Mahavagga of the Vinaya PitakaWhen this story unfolds the elder was dwelling in Avanti at his favorite residence the Ospreys Haunt on Precipice MountainA lay disciple of his named Sona Kutikanna came to him and expressed the wish to go forth under him as a monkBut Kaccana seeing perhaps that the householder was not yet ready to take such a big step discouraged him with the words Difficult Sona is it to sleep alone to eat one meal a day and to observe celibacy for as long as life lastsWhile remaining a householder you should apply yourself to the Buddhas teaching and at the proper times you may sleep alone eat one meal a day and observe celibacyWith these words Sonas enthusiasm for ordination subsidedSome time later however the urge was rekindled and he approached the Venerable Maha Kaccana with the same requestA second time the elder discouraged him and a second time Sonas desire for ordination abatedWhen Sona approached him for the third time and asked for ordination Maha Kaccana gave him the going forth that is the initial ordination as a noviceDuring the Buddhas time it seems to have been customary to grant mature men already endowed with faith in the Dhamma and well acquainted with its tenets both ordinations in immediate successionThe novice ordination would be given first and then right afterwards the ceremony of higher ordination would be performed making the postulant a bhikkhu a full member of the SanghaBut at the time that the above incident took place Avanti was short of monks being a region quite far from the Buddhas own missionary rounds and from the other centers of Buddhist activityAccording to the disciplinary regulations that were still in effect the higher ordination had to be performed by a chapter of at least ten bhikkhusBut such was the situation in Avanti that the Venerable Maha Kaccana could not easily find even nine other bhikkhus to confer the higher ordination on SonaIt was only three years later that the elder could with trouble and difficulty convene an assembly of ten bhikkhus from different places in the region to give Sona the higher ordinationWhen the Venerable Sona had completed his first rains retreat as a bhikkhu the wish arose in him to pay a visit to the BuddhaHe had heard many times the highest praise of the Blessed One his lord and refuge yet he had never seen the Master face to face and now the desire to do so had become irresistibleHe went to his preceptor to ask for his permission to make the long journey to Savatthi where the Buddha was residingNot only did the Venerable Maha Kaccana applaud his disciples desire to see the Buddha but he asked Sona to convey to the Lord an appeal that certain monastic regulations be relaxed to suit the different social and geographical conditions that prevailed in Avanti and in other border regionsWhen the Venerable Sona came to the Buddha and explained his preceptors request the Master readily agreedFirst to determine what districts should count as border regions the Buddha defined the boundaries of the Middle Country wherein the original regulations were to remain bindingThen he announced the revised versions of the rules that would apply in the border regions though not in the Middle CountryThese revised rules are the following The higher ordination would not require ten bhikkhus but could now be given by a chapter of five one of whom must be a master of the Vinaya the monastic disciplineMonks are allowed to use sandals with thick linings as the ground in those regions is rough and hard on the feetMonks are permitted to bathe frequently as the people of Avanti attach great importance to bathingSheepskins and goatskins etc could be used as coverletsRobes could be accepted on behalf of a monk who has left the district and the ten days period during which an extra robe could be kept would begin only when the robe actually reaches his handsNeither the suttas nor the commentaries offer us abundant biographical information about the Venerable Maha Kaccanas life in the SanghaThey focus rather on his role as teacher especially on his detailed expositions of the Buddhas brief statementsFrom the settings to the suttas in which Maha Kaccana appears we can infer that after his ordination he spent most of his time in AvantiUsually it seems he dwelt quietly in seclusion though when occasion arose he gave instruction to othersPeriodically he would go to visit the Buddha at his main places of residence and it seems likely that he also sometimes accompanied him on his preaching toursThe three suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya in which Maha Kaccana appears in the role of expositor open at three different locales  in Kapilavatthu Rajagaha and SavatthiAs these cities were relative to the geographical extent of the Ganges Valley widely separated from each other and as all were far from Avanti this suggests either that the Venerable Maha Kaccana spent long periods accompanying the Buddha on his journeys or that he would travel to the different monastic centers where the Buddha resided when he heard that the Master intended to stay there for some timeWe do not find in the texts indications that Maha Kaccana entered into close friendships with the other leading monks as for instance Sariputta Maha Moggallana and Ananda did with one anotherHe seems to be one who generally lived aloof though he did not place a strict emphasis on seclusion in the manner of one like the Venerable Maha Kassapa nor did he seem especially stern in his asceticismHe was ready to assume teaching duties on request as we shall see but we find that he always appears in the suttas in the role of expositor and elucidator of the Dhamma to othersWe do not see the Venerable Maha Kaccana engage in persontoperson dialogues with other monks as we see in the case of all the abovementioned elders neither do we see him address inquiries to the Buddha as even the wisest of the bhikkhus the Venerable Sariputta often didHis absence is conspicuous in the Mahagosinga Sutta wherein the other outstanding disciples gather on a fullmoon night to discuss the ideal bhikkhu who could illuminate the forestOn that occasion six great elders  Sariputta Moggallana Ananda Maha Kassapa Anuruddha and Revata  each describe the ideal bhikkhu according to their particular dispositions and at the end the Buddha offers his own picture of the most worthy monkSurely if Maha Kaccana was present on that occasion he would have described such a monk as one skilled in the detailed exposition of brief sayingsMaha Kaccana did grant ordination as we saw above in the case of Sona though his pupils were probably not very numerous despite the words of the Anguttara CommentaryOne of his pupils was the bhikkhu Isidatta who even while very young had impressed many of the older monks with his incisive replies to difficult questions on the DhammaThere can be little doubt that Isidattas adroitness in tackling subtle points of doctrine reflects the rigorous training he must have received from the Venerable Maha KaccanaOn one occasion when the Venerable Maha Kaccana visited the Buddha he received special homage from Sakka the king of the godsThis occurred when the Buddha was dwelling at the Eastern Park at Savatthi in the Mansion of Migaras MotherThe Lord was sitting surrounded by a company of great disciples on the occasion of the pavarana the ceremony of mutual criticism among the monks which ends the annual rains retreatBecause Maha Kaccana regularly used to visit the Buddha in order to hear the Dhamma coming even from a long distance the other chief elders would always reserve a seat for him in case he should unexpectedly turn upOn this occasion Sakka along with his celestial retinue drew near to the holy assembly and prostrated himself before the Blessed OneSince he did not see the Venerable Maha Kaccana he thought to himself It would be good indeed if the noble elder would arrive Just at that moment Maha Kaccana approached and took his seatWhen Sakka beheld him he grasped him firmly by the ankles expressed his joy over the elders arrival and honored him with gifts of scents and flowersSome of the younger monks were upset and complained that Sakka was being partial in his display of reverence but the Buddha reproved them with the words Monks those monks who like my son Maha Kaccana guard the doors of the senses are beloved both among gods and humans He then pronounced the following stanza of the DhammapadaThat the Venerable Maha Kaccana was actually one who devoted much attention to the mastery of the sense faculties is borne out by his discourses which often emphasize the need for guarding the doors of the sensesThe commentaries record two curious series of events both of which stemmed from the impression that the elders physical form made on the minds of othersOne of these reported in the Dhammapada Commentary involved a young man named Soreyya who was the son of the treasurer in the city of the same nameOne day the youth Soreyya was driving out of the city in a carriage en route to a bathing spot together with an intimate friend and a merry band of companionsJust as they were leaving the city the Venerable Maha Kaccana was standing at the city gate putting on his outer robe before entering to walk on alms roundWhen the youth Soreyya beheld the goldenhued body of the elder he thought to himself Oh that this elder might become my wifeOr may the hue of my wifes body become like the hue of his bodyAt the very moment this thought passed through his mind Soreyya was instantly transformed from a man into a womanStartled by this inexplicable change of sex he jumped out of the carriage and fled before the others could notice what had occurredGradually he made his way to the city of TakkasilaHis companions searched for him in vain and reported his strange disappearance to his parentsWhen all attempts to trace him proved futile his parents concluded that he had died and they had the funeral rites performedMeanwhile the woman Soreyya on reaching Takkasila met the son of the citys treasurer who fell in love with her and took her as his wifeIn the first years of their marriage she gave birth to two sonsPreviously while a man Soreyya had fathered two sons through his wife in his native cityThus he was the parent of four children two as a father and two as a motherOne day the former intimate friend of Soreyya came to Takkasila on some personal businessLady Soreyya saw him in the street and recognized himShe called him into her house and revealed to him the secret of her mysterious metamorphosis from a man into a womanThe friend proposed that Soreyya should offer alms to the Venerable Maha Kaccana who was living close by and then beg pardon from him for having given rise to such a lewd thoughtThe friend then went to the elder and invited him to come to the ladys house for alms on the following dayWhen the Venerable Maha Kaccana arrived the friend brought Lady Soreyya into his presence informed him of what had happened long ago and asked him to pardon her for that transgressionAs soon as the elder uttered the words I pardon you Lady Soreyya was transformed back into a manShaken out of all worldly complacency by this double metamorphosis Soreyya determined that he could never again lead the household lifeHe took ordination as a bhikkhu under Maha Kaccana and after a short time attained arahantship together with the supernormal powersVassakara the chief minister of Magadha under the parricide King Ajatasattu was less fortunate though his misfortune sprang entirely from his own pride and obstinacy and not from some force outside his controlThe commentary to the Majjhima Nikaya reports that one day when Vassakara saw the Venerable Maha Kaccana coming down from the mountain Vulture Peak he exclaimed He looks just like a monkey Such an exclamation seems strange particularly as Maha Kaccana is described in the texts as being especially handsome and graceful in his physical presenceWhatever the reason for the remark news of the incident spread and eventually reached the BuddhaThe Blessed One said that if Vassakara should go to the elder and beg his pardon all would be well but if he does not ask pardon he would be reborn as a monkey in the Bamboo Grove in RajagahaThis was reported back to VassakaraAs the chief minister of the kingdom he must have been too proud to beg forgiveness from a mendicant monkThus reflecting that whatever the Buddha says must turn out to be true he resigned himself to his future fate and made preparations for his next existence by planting trees in the Bamboo Grove and setting up a guard to protect the wild life thereIt is said that some time after his death a monkey was born in the Bamboo Grove who would draw near when one called out VassakaraThe circumstances of the Venerable Maha Kaccanas death are not recorded in the texts but at the end of the Madhura Sutta Maha Kaccana declares that the Buddha has attained Parinibbana so it is evident from this that he himself outlived his MasterThe Buddha honored the Venerable Maha Kaccana by naming him his foremost disciple in the ability to provide detailed expositions of his own brief statementsMaha Kaccana earned this distinguished title principally because of eight suttas found in the Nikayas three in the Majjhima three in the Samyutta and two in the AnguttaraBesides these we find in the Nikayas several other discourses that the Venerable Maha Kaccana spoke without basing himself upon a brief utterance of the Buddha as his textAll these discourses taken together have a uniform and distinctive flavor revealing the qualities of the mind from which they sprangThey are thorough balanced careful and cautious substantial in content meticulous in expression incisive well conceived and well roundedThey are also admittedly a little dry  unemotional and unsentimental  but with no wastage of words they never fail to lead us straight to the heart of the DhammaThe discourses of Maha Kaccana are bare of the rhetorical devices utilized by other renowned exponents of the Dhamma we find in them no similes parables or stories their language is plain but impeccably preciseIn this respect his sermons contrast with those of the Buddha the Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Ananda all of whom were skilled in devising striking similes that impress the formal message of the discourse indelibly on the auditors mindThe Venerable Maha Kaccanas discourses it seems owe their effectiveness entirely to their content and analytical exactitude rather than to literary embellishmentAs an analyst of the Dhamma the Venerable Maha Kaccana most closely approximates to the Venerable Sariputta and indeed the discourses of both exhibit similar traitsThe difference between them is principally a matter of emphasis rather than of substanceSariputtas analytic disquisitions as seen for example in the Sammaditthi Sutta and the Mahahatthipadopama Sutta begin with a specified topic and then develop by dissecting that topic into its component strands and exploring each component in turnWithin his own specialized sphere Maha Kaccana starts not with a general topic but with a short utterance of the Buddha often one that is intuitive poetic or exhortatory in characterHis exposition then unfolds by reformulating the gnomic or inspirational phrasing of the Buddhas statement in ways that link it up with established more familiar frameworks of doctrine usually with the six spheres of sense and the practice of sense restraintYet despite their differences in emphasis both these great disciples share a predilection for systematic analysis and both display the same concern for razorsharp precision in their thinkingFor this reason no doubt within the Theravada tradition each has come to be regarded as the father of a particular methodology for interpreting the Dhamma exegetical systems that rose to prominence in the early centuries of Buddhist intellectual historySariputta is of course viewed as the original systematizer of the Abhidhamma which he elaborated in detail based on the outlines that the Buddha taught him during his periodic visits to the human realm while expounding the Abhidhamma to the devas in the Tavatimsa heavenMaha Kaccana is regarded as the author of a method of exposition embedded in two postcanonical works that exerted an important influence on the early Buddhist commentatorsAbout these two works  the Petakopadesa and the Nettippakarana  we shall have more to say belowThe first sutta in the Majjhima Nikaya in which the Venerable Maha Kaccana plays a prominent role is the Madhupindika Sutta the Honeyball Discourse a title assigned to it by the Buddha himself  perhaps a unique instance of the Buddhas conferring a title upon a sutta spoken by a discipleThe sutta opens on an occasion when the Buddha is dwelling at the city of Kapilavatthu in his native land the Sakyan republicOne day while the Buddha is sitting in meditation in Nigrodhas Park an arrogant Sakyan named Dandapani approaches him and asks him in a deliberately discourteous tone What does the recluse assert what does he proclaim The Buddha replies with an answer intended to underscore his own refusal to be dragged into the type of contention that his questioner wants to provokeThe reply is utterly incomprehensible to Dandapani who raises his eyebrows in bewilderment and departsLater in the evening the Buddha informs the bhikkhus what had transpiredOne monk inquires What exactly is the teaching that the Blessed One proclaims whereby one can avoid all quarrels and at the same time be free from the pernicious influence of craving The Buddha answers with the following pithy statementHaving said this before the monks even have time to ask for an explanation the Lord rises from his seat and enters his dwellingAfter the Buddha has retired the bhikkhus ponder his statement and realizing that they cannot understand it on their own they consider The Venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy lifeHe is capable of expounding the detailed meaningSuppose we went to him and asked him the meaning of thisWhen they approach Maha Kaccana and make their request he first chides them for coming to him rather than asking the Buddha to clarify itTo come to him when the Blessed One is present he says is like seeking heartwood among the branches and leaves of a great tree after passing over the trunkThe Blessed One is the one who knows and sees he is vision he is knowledge he has become the Dhamma become the holy one he is the sayer the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the Deathless the Lord of the Dhamma the TathagataThe bhikkhus however while admitting that the elders reproach is warranted still insist that he himself is able to explain the meaningFinally the elder consents and then gives the following explanation of the Buddhas brief statementThe same pattern is repeated for each of the other sense basesThe elder then connects the entire exposition with the principle of conditionality showing how each term in the series arises in dependence on the preceding term and ceases with the cessation of its predecessorThis passage rich in implications offers a penetrative account of the process by which the deluded mind becomes overwhelmed by its own imaginary creations  its distorted perceptions and mental constructsThe sequence begins as a straightforward description of the conditioned genesis of cognition each type of consciousness arises in dependence on its respective sense faculty and objectThe process unfolds in the natural order through contact feeling and perception as far as the stage of thinkingBut in the unenlightened worldling who lacks correct insight into the true nature of things at the stage of thought cognition is vitiated by the influence of papañca a difficult Pali word best rendered as conceptual proliferation Instead of correctly comprehending the objects of perception the deluded mind infiltrated by papañca spins out a complex mental commentary which embellishes things with the erroneous notions of mine I and my self Thereby the person is overrun by perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferationThe underlying springs of this conceptual proliferation are three defilements craving conceit and wrong viewWhen these three gain control of the thought process cognition runs wild churning up a host of delusive ideas obsessions and passions which overpower the subject and reduce him to their hapless victimThis process of sense perception as Maha Kaccana shows is the source through which perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a person referred to by the Buddha in his brief statementWhen there is no delighting in the process of perception by way of craving which elaborates upon experience in terms of the notion mine when there is no welcoming it by way of conceit which introduces the notion I am when there is no holding to it by way of wrong view which proliferates in notions of a self then all the underlying tendencies to the defilements will be uprooted and one can dwell in the world as a liberated sage holy and wise without quarrels conflicts and disputesSuch was the explanation of the Buddhas words that the Venerable Maha Kaccana offered to the monksAfterwards the monks approached the Blessed One and told him what Maha Kaccana had saidThe Buddha replied with words of the highest praise for his disciple Maha Kaccana is wise bhikkhus Maha Kaccana has great wisdomIf you had asked me the meaning of this I would have explained it to you in the same way that Maha Kaccana has explained itSuch is the meaning of this and so you should remember itJust then the Venerable Ananda standing nearby added a memorable simile to highlight the beauty of Maha Kaccanas exposition Just as if a man exhausted by hunger and weakness came upon a honeyball in the course of eating it he would find a sweet delectable flavor so too venerable sir any able bhikkhu in the course of scrutinizing with wisdom the meaning of this discourse on the Dhamma would find satisfaction and confidence of mind On the basis of this simile the Buddha named the discourse the Madhupindika Sutta The Honeyball DiscourseThe other two Majjhima Nikaya suttas featuring Maha Kaccana and one in the Anguttara Nikaya conform to this same stereotyped pattern the Buddha makes a brief statement gets up and enters his dwelling the monks approach the Venerable Maha Kaccana to ask for an explanation of the meaning he reprimands them for coming to him rather than asking the Lord himself but finally he complies with their request and elucidates the Buddhas utterance the monks return to the Buddha and repeat his analysis which the Master applauds with words of praise for the elderThe Maha Kaccana Bhaddekaratta Sutta centers around the famous Bhaddekaratta poem a set of verses spoken by the Buddha that had been circulating within the SanghaThe poem stresses the need to abandon longing for the past and anticipation of the future it calls instead for urgent effort to marshal ones energies for penetrating with insight the present reality itselfMany of the monks had learned the poem by heart along with the Buddhas own exegesis of it and had been using it as an inspiration for their meditation practice and as a theme for sermonsOne bhikkhu named Samiddhi however did not know even the poem let alone its exegesisOne day a benevolent deity taking compassion on him came to him in the early morning and urged him to learn the Bhaddekaratta poem and expositionThe Venerable Samiddhi went to the Buddha and asked him to teach him the Bhaddekaratta summary and its analysisThe Buddha recited the poemThen the Blessed One rose from his seat and entered his dwellingSamiddhi and the other monks present at the time went to the Venerable Maha Kaccana in search of an explanationAs in the prelude to the Madhupindika Sutta Maha Kaccana at first remonstrates with them but then agrees to share his understanding of the poemTaking up the first two lines as the theme of his exposition he explicates each by way of the six sense basesOne revives the past when one recollects the eye and forms seen in the past dwelling upon them with desire and lust so too with the other five sense faculties and their objectsOne builds up hope upon the future when one sets ones heart on experiencing in the future sense objects one has not yet encounteredOne who does not bind himself by desire and lust to memories of past sensory experience and yearnings for future sensory experience is one who does not revive the past or build up hope upon the future Similarly one whose mind is shackled by lust to the present sense faculties and their objects is called one vanquished in regard to presently arisen states while one whose mind is not bound to them by lust is called one invincible in regard to presently arisen statesAgain the monks return to the Buddha who says if you had asked me the meaning of this I would have explained it to you in the same way that Maha Kaccana has explained itThe third Majjhima sutta the Uddesavibhanga Sutta opens with the Buddha announcing to the monks that he will teach them a summary and an expositionHe recites the summary thusThen as on prior occasions he rises from his seat and retires without giving the exposition  a strange omission as he had announced that he would teach the expositionBut the monks do not feel lost for the Venerable Maha Kaccana is in their midst and after his usual protest he begins his analysisHe proceeds by taking up each phrase in the Buddhas summary and dissecting it in minute detailHow is consciousness distracted and scattered externallyWhen a monk has seen a form with the eye if his consciousness follows after the sign of form is tied and shackled by gratification in the sign of form is fettered by the fetter of gratification in the sign of form then his consciousness is called distracted and scattered externally  But if on seeing a form with the eye etc the monk does not follow after the sign of form does not become tied and shackled to the sign of form then his consciousness is called not distracted and scattered externally His mind is stuck internally if he attains any of the four jhanas the meditative absorptions and his mind becomes tied and shackled by gratification in the superior rapture bliss peace and equanimity of the jhanaIf he can attain the jhanas without becoming attached to them his mind is not stuck internallyThere is agitation due to clinging in the uninstructed worldling who regards his five aggregates as selfWhen his form or feeling or perception or volitional formations or consciousness undergoes change and deterioration his mind becomes preoccupied with the change and he becomes anxious distressed and concernedThus there is agitation due to clingingBut the instructed noble disciple does not regard the five aggregates as his selfTherefore when the aggregates undergo change and transformation his mind is not preoccupied with the change and he dwells free from anxiety agitation and concernThis the elder states is how he understands in detail the summary stated in brief by the Blessed One and when the monks report to the Master he endorses his disciples explanationThe Samyutta Nikaya contains three suttas in which the Venerable Maha Kaccana displays his ingenuity in elaborating upon brief utterances of the Buddha SN SN and SNThese suttas are different both in setting and character from the three analytical discourses of the Majjhima NikayaIn all three Maha Kaccana is not dwelling in the midst of the Sangha in close proximity to the Buddha but in Avanti at the Ospreys Haunt on Precipice Mountain presumably a remote place difficult of accessThen a lay devotee named Haliddikani evidently quite learned in the Dhamma comes to him and asks him to explain in detail a short discourse of the BuddhaMaha Kaccanas reply is addressed to the householder Haliddikani alone not to a group of monks and there is no subsequent confirmation of his exposition by the Buddha at the end of the discourseIt seems impossible to determine whether these exchanges took place during the Buddhas life or after his demise but obviously to have been incorporated into the Canon reports of the discussions must have reached the main centers of the Buddhist communityIn SN Haliddikani asks the elder to explain in detail the meaning of a verse from The Questions of Magandiya included in the Atthakavagga of the Sutta NipataIn responding to the lay devotees request the Venerable Maha Kaccana introduces a methodology that is strikingly different from his approach to interpretation in the three suttas of the Majjhima NikayaHere he does not simply elaborate upon the literal meaning of the Buddhas statement drawing out its philosophical and practical implications as he did in those suttasInstead he transposes the key expressions of the verse to a different level of discourse treating these expressions not merely as obscure terms in need of clarification and exemplification but as metaphors or figures of speech that to be properly understood must be redefined in terms of their nonfigurative meaningsHe does this as we shall see just below by first eliciting from the selected figurative terms their implicit literal meanings and then mapping those meanings on to other more systematic frames of doctrineThis technique was to become characteristic of the Pali commentaries in later centuries and we might even regard Maha Kaccanas style of exegesis here as being in certain respects at least the original prototype of the commentarial methodTaking up first the expression having left home Maha Kaccana treats the word home not as bearing the literal meaning of a place where people live but as an elliptical reference to the home of consciousnessHe explains that the home of consciousness is the other four aggregates  material form feeling perception and volitional formations  which are here referred to as elements elsewhere these are described as the four stations of consciousnessIf consciousness is bound by lust to these four elements one is said to move about in a homeIf one has abandoned all desire lust delight and craving for these four homes of consciousness one is said to roam about homelessIt should be noted that this last term does not itself occur in the verse but Maha Kaccana has introduced it into his exegesis as a description of one who has abandoned homeNext the elder explicates the phrase to roam without abodeHe first defines the counterpart roaming about in an abode which also does not appear in the verseAs before Maha Kaccana treats this expression as a metaphor to be reformulated in terms of systematic doctrineIn this instance rather than using the five aggregates as his scaffold he draws in the six external sense basesBy being shackled to the sign of forms by moving about in the abode of forms etc one is called one who roams about in an abode When one has abandoned all bondage to the sign of forms etc cut them off at the root then one is said to roam without abodeThe remaining sections of the exposition proceed more literally and simply explicate with straightforward definition the meaning of the phrases used in the verse always in terms of contrasting pairsOne who is intimate with none in the village is defined as a bhikkhu who keeps aloof from lay people and their worldly concernsOne rid of sensual pleasures is one devoid of lust and craving for sensual pleasuresOne without preferences is one who does not yearn for the futureAnd one who would not engage people in dispute is one who does not become embroiled in quarrels and disputes over the interpretation of the DhammaIn the next sutta Haliddikani asks how one should understand in detail the following brief statement of the Buddha found in The Questions of Sakka Those recluses and brahmans who are liberated by the full destruction of craving are those who have reached the ultimate end the ultimate security from bondage the ultimate holy life the ultimate goal and are best among devas and humans Maha Kaccana explainsThus householder it is in such a way that the meaning of what was stated in brief by the Blessed One should be understood in detailIn a third sutta Haliddikani begins a query with a quotation from the Buddha but this time he does not ask how should the meaning of this brief statement be understood in detail Rather he simply requests the Venerable Maha Kaccana to explain the following excerpt from the Dhatusamyutta Bhikkhus it is in dependence on the diversity of elements that there arises the diversity of contacts in dependence on the diversity of contacts that there arises the diversity of feelingsThe Buddha himself had explained this assertion by showing how the different kinds of elements condition their corresponding kinds of contact and feeling In dependence on the eye element there arises eyecontact in dependence on eyecontact there arises feeling born of eyecontact And so for the other sense facultiesThe Venerable Maha Kaccana however does not merely parrot the Buddhas analysis but carries the divisions down to a finer levelThe same analysis is applied to each of the other sense facultiesThus while the Buddha merely differentiates the contact and feeling by way of the sense faculty the Venerable Maha Kaccana distinguishes within each sense sphere three qualities of the object  agreeable disagreeable and indifferent three qualities of the contact  to be felt as pleasant to be felt as painful and to be felt as neither and three qualities of the feeling  pleasant painful and neitherpainfulnorpleasantThese triads are then collated and shown to originate in a conditional relationship the quality of the object conditions the quality of the contact the quality of the contact conditions the quality of the feelingAs the entire process is said to be contemplated by a bhikkhu endowed with understanding this also implies that he has the capacity for overcoming the bondage to feelings by means of insight into their conditioned originationThe Anguttara Nikaya offers two further examples of Maha Kaccanas exegetical skillsIn one short sutta in this collection we see how the elder interprets a verse the meaning of which seems completely explicit as it stands by transposing it into a figurative mode and then extracting the implicit meaning by mapping it on to a framework of systematic doctrineHere a woman lay disciple named Kali comes to the elder and asks him to explain in detail a verse from The Girls Questions The reference is to the account of the Buddhas encounter with Maras daughters when they tried to seduce him in the first year after his EnlightenmentThe daughter Tanha had asked him why instead of forming intimate relationships in the village he squanders his time meditating alone in the woodsTo this the Buddha repliedIt is this verse that Kali asks the Venerable Maha Kaccana to elucidateThe elder explicates the verse in a way that does not appear to be derivable from the words themselvesHis interpretation contrasts the Buddhas attitude to the kasinas  the meditations on special devices for inducing concentration  with that of other recluses and brahmansHe explains that some contemplatives regarding the attainment of the earth kasina as the supreme goal thereby generate this attainmentOthers may take one of the other kasinas as supreme  the water kasina the fire kasina etc and reach the corresponding meditative stateBut for each kasina the Blessed One has directly understood to what extent it is supreme and having understood this he saw its origin he saw the danger he saw the escape and he saw the knowledge and vision of the true path and the wrong pathHaving seen all this he understood the attainment of the goal and the peace of the heartIt is in this way the elder concludes that the meaning of the above verse should be understood in detailInterpreted by way of its apparent meaning the verse seems to be extolling the bliss of secluded meditation above the pleasures of sensual and social contact  the very enjoyments with which Maras daughters have been trying to tempt the Enlightened OneBut the Venerable Maha Kaccana gives a different twist to the meaningFor him the contrast is not merely between sensual pleasure and meditative bliss but between two different attitudes to advanced stages of meditative absorptionThe ordinary recluses and brahmans understand the jhanas and other extraordinary states of consciousness attainable through the kasina meditations to be the final goal of spiritual endeavorBy doing so they remain caught in the trap of craving for becoming and thus fail to find the way to final deliveranceBecause they become attached to the exalted bliss and quiet serenity of the jhanas they cannot see that these states too are conditioned and transient and thus they cannot relinquish their attachment to themThey therefore remain within Maras domain vanquished by his army of agreeable and pleasant forms however sublime such may beBut the Buddha has seen the origin of these attainments ie craving as the origin of suffering he has seen the danger ie that they are impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change he has seen the escape from them ie Nibbana and he has obtained the knowledge and vision by which he can distinguish the true path from the false ie the Noble Eightfold Path from the wrong eightfold pathBy means of this fourfold knowledge which in effect is knowledge of the Four Noble Truths he has attained the goal Nibbana experienced as the peace of heart that can arise only when all defilements have been extinguished without residueFinally towards the end of the massive Anguttara Nikaya we find one more sutta constructed on the same pattern as the three Majjhima Nikaya suttasThis sutta opens with a short statement of the BuddhaHaving said this the Blessed One rose from his seat and entered his dwellingThe monks then approach the Venerable Maha Kaccana to request an explanationFollowing the stock formulas of protest and insistence Maha Kaccana interprets the Buddhas injunction by way of the ten unwholesome and ten wholesome courses of kamma taking life is nondhamma abstaining from taking life is dhamma the numerous evil unwholesome states that arise on account of taking life  this is harm the numerous wholesome states that arise conditioned by abstinence from taking life and that go to fulfillment by development  this is benefitThe same pattern is applied to stealing sexual misconduct lying slander harsh speech and gossipFinally covetousness ill will and wrong view are nondhamma and the evil states that arise from them are harm noncovetousness goodwill and right view are dhamma and the wholesome states conditioned by them that go to fulfillment by development are benefitNot all the discourses spoken by the Venerable Maha Kaccana take the form of commentaries on brief statements by the BuddhaHe also delivered Dhamma talks that unfold along independent lines and he was skilled too in resolving the doubts of inquirers and fellow monks with his own original insights into the TeachingThe Majjhima Nikaya contains a fulllength dialogue between the great elder and King Avantiputta of Madhura who was the grandson of King Candappajjota of AvantiOnce when the Venerable Maha Kaccana was dwelling at Madhura the king heard the favorable report that was circulating about him He is wise discerning sagacious learned articulate and perspicacious he is aged and he is an arahant Desiring to converse with such a worthy monk the king drove out to his hermitage to meet him and the conversation that resulted has been recorded as the Madhura SuttaThe question with which the king opened this dialogue did not concern a profound problem about the nature of reality or the deeper realizations of insight meditationIt revolved around a practical issue that must have been weighing heavily on the minds of many of the noblecaste rulers of the time the attempts of the brahmans to establish their own hegemony over the entire Indian social systemThe brahmans tried to justify this drive for power by appeal to their divinely ordained statusKing Avantiputta relates to Maha Kaccana the claim that they had been putting forth The brahmans are the highest caste those of any other caste are inferior brahmans are the fairest caste those of any other caste are dark only brahmans are purified not nonbrahmans brahmans alone are the sons of Brahma the offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of BrahmaThe Venerable Maha Kaccana though of pedigree brahman stock himself is well aware of the presumption and arrogance that lay behind this proclamationHe replies that the claim of the brahmans is just a saying in the world one with no divine sanction at all to support itTo prove his point Maha Kaccana brings forth a powerful array of arguments in its favor one of any social class who gains wealth can command the labor of those in the other castes even a menial could enrol a brahman in his serviceOne of any caste who violates the principles of morality would be reborn in hell while one of any caste who observes the moral precepts would be reborn in a happy realmOne of any caste who breaks the law would be punishedOne of any caste who renounces the world and becomes an ascetic would receive homage and respectAs each argument draws to a close the king proclaims These four castes are all the same there is no difference between them at allAt the end of the discussion after expressing his appreciation of Master Kaccanas replies King Avantiputta declares I go to Master Kaccana for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus But Maha Kaccana corrects him Do not go to me for refuge great kingGo for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge  the Fully Enlightened BuddhaWhen the king asks where the Blessed One is now living the elder explains that he has attained ParinibbanaThis reply indicates that Maha Kaccanas own demise must have taken place at some date after that of the BuddhaThe Samyutta Nikaya includes a sutta that shows how the Venerable Maha Kaccanas skill in handling a group of rowdy young brahman boys helped to transform the attitude of a learned old brahman and his entourage of pupilsOn one occasion the elder was living in Avanti in a forest hutThen a number of young brahmans boys pupils of the renowned brahman teacher Lohicca drew near to the hut while collecting firewoodAs the brahmans of that period often harbored hostile feelings towards the renunciant Buddhist monks these boys behaving as boys typically do when on a group outing trampled around the hut deliberately making a racket to disturb the meditating monkThey also shouted the words which the brahmans used to taunt the nonbrahman ascetics These baldpated ascetic rascals menials swarthy offspring of the Lords feet are honored respected esteemed worshipped and venerated by their servile devoteesThe Venerable Maha Kaccana came out from the hut and addressed the boys with verses in which he reminded them of the ancient brahmanical ideals so badly neglected by the brahmans of that dayOn hearing this the brahman boys were angry and displeasedOn returning to their teacher the brahman Lohicca they reported that the recluse Maha Kaccana was denigrating and scorning the sacred brahman hymnsAfter his first flush of anger had subsided Lohicca being a man of sense realized that he should not rush to conclusions merely on the basis of hearsay reported by youngsters but should first inquire from Maha Kaccana himself whether there was any truth in their accusationWhen Lohicca went to the Venerable Maha Kaccana and asked him about the conversation he had with the boys Maha Kaccana reported everything as it occurredLohicca was deeply impressed by Maha Kaccanas poem on the proper brahman way of life and even more so by the elders following discourse on how to guard the doors of the sensesAt the end of the discussion not only did he go for refuge to the Triple Gem but he invited the elder to visit his household assuring him that the brahman boys and maidens there will pay homage to Master Kaccana they will stand up for him out of respect they will offer him a seat and water and that will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long timeThe Venerable Maha Kaccana seems to have had a particularly deep insight into the causal basis of human quarrels and disputesWe have already seen how he traces out the causal roots of conflict in his exposition in the Madhupindika Sutta and his skill in transforming Lohiccas retinue of disciplesOn another occasion a brahman named Aramadanda came to him and asked Why is society rent by such bitter conflicts  conflicts that pit nobles against nobles brahmans against brahmans householders against householders To this the elder replies It is because of sensual lust attachment greed and obsession with sensual pleasures that nobles fight with nobles brahmans with brahmans householders with householders Next Aramadanda asked Why is it that recluses fight with recluses And Maha Kaccana replies It is because of lust for views attachment greed and obsession with views that recluses fight with recluses Finally the brahman asked whether there was anyone in the world who had transcended both sensual lust and lust for viewsAlthough Maha Kaccana as an arahant could have put himself forth as an example of such a one with characteristic modesty and selfeffacement he named instead the Blessed One who was dwelling at Savatthi at the timeWhen this was said the brahman Aramadanda knelt down on the ground held out his hands in reverential salutation and exclaimed three times Homage to the Blessed One the Arahant the Fully Enlightened OneIn the next sutta a brahman named Kandarayana reproaches Maha Kaccana for not showing proper respect towards aged brahmansThe elder defends himself by distinguishing the conventional usage of the words aged and young from their proper meaning within the Discipline of the Noble OneOn this latter criterion even if a person is eighty ninety or a hundred years from birth if he is still addicted to sensual pleasures he is reckoned as a fool not an elderBut even if a person is young with jet black hair endowed with the blessing of youth if he has broken free from sensual desires he is then reckoned as an elderOnce the Venerable Maha Kaccana gave the monks a discourse on the six recollections  the contemplations of the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha virtue generosity and the devasHe declared that it is wonderful and marvellous how the Blessed One has discovered these six recollections as the way to freedom for those still trapped in the confines of the worldHe describes the six recollections in exactly the same terms that the Buddha himself has used to describe the four foundations of mindfulnessThey are the means for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the passing away of pain and grief for the arrival at the right method and for the realization of NibbanaOn another occasion some elder bhikkhus were holding a discussion about the right time to approach a monk worthy of esteemOne said he should be approached after he has finished his meal another said he should he approached in the evening while still another contended that the early morning was the most fitting time to speak with himUnable to reach accord they came to Maha Kaccana with their problemThe elder replied that there were six proper times for approaching a worthy monkThe first five are when the mind is overcome and obsessed by the five mental hindrances  sensual desire ill will sloth and torpor restlessness and remorse and doubt  and one cannot find an outlet from them on ones ownThe sixth occasion to approach is when one does not know a suitable object to attend to in order to reach the destruction of the cankersIt was not always with words that the Venerable Maha Kaccana taught but also by silent exampleOn one such occasion the Buddha was moved to extol Maha Kaccana in an udana  an inspired utterance  preserved for us in the canonical collection of that nameOne evening the Buddha was seated in his cottage at Jetas Grove in Savatthi when he saw the Venerable Maha Kaccana nearby sitting crosslegged holding his body erect having mindfulness with regard to the body set up and well established within him On realizing the significance of this the Blessed One uttered this inspired utteranceIn its explanation of this sutta the Udana Commentary helps shed light on the approach that the Venerable Maha Kaccana adopted to reach arahantshipWhile this explanation conflicts with the account of the elders instantaneous enlightenment found in the biographical sketch of the Anguttara Commentary it appears more realisticThe Udana Commentary explains that in his endeavor to attain arahantship Maha Kaccana first developed jhana using mindfulness of the body as his subject of meditationUtilizing that jhana as his foundation of calm concentration he then redirected mindfulness of the body on to the track of insight meditationWith the wisdom of insight that arose from the contemplation of the body he reached the supramundane paths and fruits culminating in the final fruit of arahantshipThereafter he would regularly resort to this same approach in order to enter upon the fruition attainment of arahantship the special meditative absorption unique to the arahant in which the bliss of Nibbana is experienced even in this very lifeIt was just on such an occasion when the elder was sitting absorbed in fruition attainment that the Buddha caught sight of him and extolled him in this inspirational verseThe couplet by which the Buddha expresses the theme of contemplation is taken by the commentary to signify fourcornered emptiness the absence of I and mine in the past and present and the absence of I and mine in the futureBy applauding the Venerable Maha Kaccana with this inspired utterance the Buddha has held him up as a model for others to emulate in their own quest to overcome attachment to the worldThe Theragatha the verses of the ancient elders includes eight verses ascribed to the Venerable Maha KaccanaThese verses are in no way exceptional and merely express in verse form injunctions to proper discipline for monks and practical advice for householdersAlthough Maha Kaccanas verses addressed to the brahman Lohicca did serve effectively as a didactic tool he does not seem to have been as amply endowed with the gift of poetic expression as several of the other great disciples such as Maha Kassapa Sariputta and VangisaHis sphere of excellence was analysis and exegesis not inspirational eloquence or artistic creativityThe first two verses according to the commentary were spoken as an exhortation to the bhikkhusOne day the elder had noticed that a number of monks had laid aside their meditation practice in order to delight in work and in companyThey were also growing too fond of the delicious food provided by their devoted lay supportersHe therefore admonished them thusThe other six verses again according to the commentary were spoken as exhortations to King CandappajjotaThe king it is said placed faith in the brahmans and at their behest performed animal sacrifices he also would impose penalties and confer favors arbitrarily presumably on account of that impulsive temperament of his that earned him the title the Violent Therefore to dissuade the king from such reckless behavior the elder recited the next four versesThe last two stanzas were spoken by the elder when the king came to him one day and informed him of a disturbing dream he had seen the previous nightThe commentary explains the purport of the verses thus A wise person should not reject everything but should first investigate virtues and faults and then should reject whatever should be rejected and accept whatever is acceptableTherefore in regard to what should be rejected though one possesses vision one should be as if blind and though able to hear one should be as if deafOne who is intelligent able to speak well should be as if dumb when tempted to speak what is unfit to be uttered and one who is strong should be as if feeble in regard to what should not be doneThe last line is ambiguous in the Pali as well and is interpreted in two different ways by the commentary When a task that should be done has arisen one should investigate it and not neglect it even if one is lying on ones death bedOr alternatively if a task that one should not do has arisen one should prefer to die  to lie down on ones death bed  rather than do itNeither explanation sounds convincing and the sense consonant with the spirit of the Theragatha as a whole would seem to be One should die as one who has attained the goal ie as an arahantBefore concluding this survey of the Venerable Maha Kaccanas contribution to the Buddhas Dispensation we should briefly take note that the Theravada tradition ascribes to him two exegetical treatises  the Petakopadesa and the Nettippakarana  and an influential grammar of the Pali language called the KaccayanaVyakaranaThe two treatises are not included in the Pali canon but have exerted a major influence on the evolution of exegetical methodBhikkhu anamoli who translated both treatises into English holds that the Netti is a later more refined version of the PetakopadesaBoth deal with essentially the same method of exegesis which in the Netti is clearer and more conciseThe method described there is designed to elicit from the Buddhas discourses the unifying principles that underlie the variegated expressions of the DhammaIt is founded on the assumption that beneath the many diverse utterances of the Master adapted according to the temperament and situation of the auditors there runs a single consistent system which with the right exegetical techniques can be extracted from the particular statement under investigation and displayed in its unadorned essenceThe Netti as Venanamoli has explained is not itself a commentary but a guide for commentatorsIt explicates not so much the teachings themselves but the tools that are to be used to elicit the structural elements that underlie and shape the expression of the teachingsThe Netti sets up its methodology under two main headings the phrasing and the meaningThe phrasing is handled by sixteen modes of conveyance techniques of verbal and logical analysis that can be applied to any specified passage in order to extract the principles that lie behind the verbal formulation and logical organization of its contentThe meaning is handled by three methods or guidelinesThese take the meaning to be the aim or goal of the doctrine which is the attainment of Nibbana and they then disclose how the teaching in question points to the attainment of that goal as its underlying purportTwo additional methods are then proposed for correlating the suttas terminology with the methods for explicating the meaningThe method is applied by the subcommentaries to the first sutta of each of the four Nikayas in special supplements to the main portion of the subcommentaryA commentary on the Netti attributed to Acariya Dhammapala also existsThe colophons of both exegetical treatises  the Petakopadesa and the Nettippakarana  attribute them to the Buddhas disciple Maha KaccanaThe Netti colophon states further that it was approved by the Blessed One and chanted at the original Buddhist CouncilWestern scholars have been inclined to dismiss the ascription of authorship to Maha Kaccana as fancifulVenanamoli however in the Introduction to his translation of the Nettippakarana offers an explanation that preserves at least a grain of credibility in the traditional Buddhist view without falling into the opposite extreme of credulityVenanamoli proposes that we distinguish between the authorship of the exegetical method on the one hand and the authorship of the treatises on the otherHe suggests as a hypothesis  possible though neither provable nor refutable  that the Elder Maha Kaccana and his lineage of pupils in Avanti may have formulated a compendious method for interpreting the Buddhas discourses and that this method  or at least its elements  may have been discussed at the early Councils and transmitted orally in skeletal formAt a later date the method could have given birth to a treatise which attempts to coordinate its elements and to illustrate their application to specific textsThis treatise eventually became the PetakopadesaSome time later perhaps even centuries later a more polished and perspicuous version of the same work was made this being the NettippakaranaAs the original methodology embedded in these treatises was derived from the Venerable Maha Kaccana or at any rate was believed to have been derived from him out of reverence for its architect  and also to boost the prestige of the treatises  their compilers ascribed authorship to the elderGPMalalasekera offers a parallel hypothesis to explain the imputed authorship of the Pali grammar the KaccayanaVyakarana to the Buddhas great discipleWhile such propositions must remain conjectural as both Venanamoli and Malalasekera themselves acknowledge the type of detailed analysis of textual statements found in the Nettippakarana is consonant with the approach that the historical Maha Kaccana brought to bear on the interpretation of the Buddhas brief utterancesThus it would seem that even if no direct connection actually exists between the great elder and the ancient Pali treatises ascribed to him the fact remains that they embody the spirit that he representedThis spirit so evident in the suttas that record his elucidations of the Buddha Word couples acuity of insight with terseness of expression precision of formulation with profundity of meaningIt was on the basis of such skills that the Enlightened One named him the foremost master of doctrinal exposition and it is this that constitutes his outstanding contribution to the Buddhas DispensationThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseJust as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid and unsullied  where a man with good eyes standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting and it would occur to him This pool of water is clear limpid and unsulliedHere are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting so too the monk discerns as it actually is that This is stress This is the origin of stress This is the stopping of stress This is the way leading to the stopping of stress These are mental effluents This is the origin of mental effluents This is the stopping of mental effluents This is the way leading to the stopping of mental effluents His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the effluent of sensuality released from the effluent of becoming released from the effluent of unawarenessWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is no more the holy life is fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis great king is a reward of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublimeAnd as for another visible reward of the contemplative life higher and more sublime than this there is none Samaññaphala Sutta Digha NikayaThese talks  except for the first  were originally given extemporaneously to the monks at Venerable Acariya Maha Boowas monastery Wat Pa Baan Taad in Udorn Thani Province ThailandAs might be expected they deal in part with issues particular to the life of Buddist monks but they also contain much that is of more general interestSince the monks who had assembled to listen to these talks were at different stages in their practice each talk deals with a number of issues on a wide variety of levelsThus there should be something of use in these pages for every reader interested in the training of the mindThe title of this collection is taken from a Pali term that directly or indirectly forms the theme of a number of the talks yathabhutañanadassana  knowledge and vision of things as they areMy hope is that these talks will aid and encourage the reader in his or her own efforts to taste the liberation that comes with the reality to which this term refersThanissaro BhikkhuRayongJanuary In these talks as in Thai usage in general the words heart and mind are used interchangeblyToday Id like to take the opportunity to tell you some of my own ignorance and doubts with the thought that we all come from the land of ignorance and doubt inasmuch as our parents and their ancestors before them were people with the defilements that led them to ignorance as wellEven all of us here Theres probably not a one of us who slipped through to be born in the land of intelligence and freedom from doubtThis being the case we all must be subject to doubtsSo today Id like to take the opportunity to resolve some of the issues that are on your minds by giving a talk instead of answering the questions you have asked from the standpoint of your various doubts ranging from the most basic to the highest levels  which Im not sure I can answer or notBut the questions you have asked seem to follow so well on one another that they can provide the framework for a talk instead of a questionandanswer sessionEach of us before starting the practice and in the beginning stages of the practice is sure to suffer from ignorance and doubt as these are the qualities that lead to the states of becoming and birth into which all living beings are bornWhen we lay the groundwork for the beginning of the practice we dont have enough starting capital for intelligence to take the lead in every situation and so ignorance is sure to find an opening to take the leadAnd as for this ignorance If we have never trained our intelligence to show us the way the ignorance that holds the upper hand in the heart is sure to drag us in the wrong direction as a matter of courseIn the beginning of my own training I felt doubts about whether the teachings of the Buddha  both the practices to be followed and the results to be obtained  were as complete as he said they wereThis was an uncertainty that ran deep in my heart during the period in which I was debating whether or not to practice for the really high levels of Dhamma  or to put it bluntly for the sake of nibbanaBefore I had considered practicing for the sake of nibbana these doubts hardly ever occurred to me probably because I hadnt yet aimed my compass in this directionBut after I had ordained and studied the Dhamma  and especially the life of the Buddha which was the story of his great renunciation leading to his Awakening to the paths fruitions and nibbana and then the lives of the Noble Disciples who having heard the Dhamma from the Buddha went off to practice in various places until they too gained Awakening becoming witnesses to the truth of the Buddha and his teachings  when I had studied to this point I felt a sense of faith and conviction and wanted to train myself to be like themBut the training that would make me be like them How was I to follow itThe Dhamma  in other words the practice that would lead the heart to awaken to the higher levels of Dhamma like the Buddha and his disciples Would it still produce the same sorts of results or would it be fruitless and simply lead to pointless hardship for those who practiced itOr would it still give the full results in line with the welltaught teachingsThis was my primary doubtBut as for believing in the Buddhas Awakening and that of his disciples of this I was fully convinced in my way as an ordinary runofthemill personThe thing that formed a stumbling block to me in the beginning stages was the doubt as to whether or not the path of practice I would take following the Buddha and his disciples would lead to the same point they had reachedWas it now all overgrown with brambles and thornsHad it changed into something other than the Dhamma that leads away from suffering even though the Buddha and his disciples had all followed this very same path to the land of peace and securityThis was my doubt concerning the causes in the practiceAs for the results of the practice I wondered whether the paths fruitions and nibbana still existed as they had in the time of the BuddhaThese doubts which ran deep in my heart I couldnt tell to anyone else because I felt there was no one who could resolve them for me and dispel them from my heartThis is why I had my hopes constantly set on meeting VenAcariya MunEven though I had never met him before I had heard his reputation which had been spreading from Chieng Mai for quite some time that he was a monk of distinctionBy and large the people who would tell me about him wouldnt speak of him in terms of the ordinary levels of noble attainmentsTheyd all speak of his arahantshipThis had me convinced that when I had finished my studies in line with the vow I had made Id have to make the effort to go out to practice and live under his guidance so as to cut away the doubts running deep in my heart at that timeThe vow I had made to myself was that I would complete the third grade of Pali studiesAs for Dhamma studies whether or not I would pass the examinations was of no concern to meAs soon as I had passed the thirdlevel Pali exams Id go out to do nothing but practiceId absolutely refuse to study or take the exams for the higher levelsThis was the vow I had madeSo the aim of my education was the third level of Pali studiesWhether it was my good or bad fortune though I cant say but I failed the Pali exams for two years and passed only on the third yearAs for the three levels of Dhamma studies I ended up passing them all because I was studying and taking the examinations for both subjects togetherWhen I went up to Chieng Mai it so happened that VenAcariya Mun had been invited by VenChao Khun Dhammachedi of Udorn Thani to spend the Rains Retreat in Udorn and so he had left his seclusion and come to stay at Wat Chedi Luang in Chieng Mai at just about the time of my arrivalAs soon as I learned that he was staying there I was overwhelmed with joyThe next morning when I returned from my alms round I learned from one of the other monks that earlier that morning VenAcariya Mun had left for alms on that path and had returned by the very same pathThis made me even more eager to see himEven if I couldnt meet him face to face Id be content just to have a glimpse of him before he left for Udorn ThaniThe next morning before VenAcariya Mun went on his alms round I hurried out early for alms and then returned to my quartersThere I kept watch along the path by which he would return as I had been told by the other monks and before long I saw him comingI hurried to my quarters and peeked out of my hiding to catch a glimpse of him with the hunger that had come from having wanted to see him for such a long timeAnd then I actually saw himThe moment I saw him a feeling of complete faith in him arose within meI hadnt wasted my birth as a human being I thought because I now had seen an arahantEven though no one had told me that he was an arahant my heart became firmly convinced the moment I saw him that that was what he wasAt the same time a feeling of sudden ecstasy hard to describe came over me making my hair stand on end  even though he hadnt yet seen me with his physical eyesNot too many days after that he left Wat Chedi Luang to head for Udorn Thani together with his studentsAs for me I stayed on to study there at Wat Chedi LuangWhen I had passed my Pali exams I returned to Bangkok with the intention of heading out to practice meditation in line with my vow but when I reached Bangkok a senior monk who out of his kindness wanted to help me further my Pali studies told me to stay onI tried to find some way to slip away in keeping with my intentions and my vow because I felt that the conditions of my vow had been met the moment I had passed my Pali examsUnder no terms could I study for or take the next level of Pali examsIts a trait with me to value truthfulnessOnce Ive made a vow I wont break itEven life I dont value as much as a vowSo now I had to try to find some way or another to go out to practiceIt so happened during that period that the senior monk who was my teacher was invited out to the provinces so I got the chance to leave BangkokHad he been there it would have been difficult for me to get away because I was indebted to him in many ways and probably would have felt such deference for him that I would have had difficulty leavingBut as soon as I saw my chance I decided to make a vow that night asking for an omen from the Dhamma that would reinforce my determination in going out this timeAfter I had finished my chants I made my vow the gist of which was that if my going out to meditate in line with my earlier vow would go smoothly and fulfill my aspirations I wanted an unusual vision to appear to me either in my meditation or in a dreamBut if I wouldnt get to go out to practice or if having gone out Id meet with disappointment I asked that the vision show the reason why Id be disappointed and dissatisfiedBut if my going out was to fulfill my aspirations I asked that the vision be extraordinarily strange and amazingWith that I sat in meditation but no visions appeared during the long period I sat meditating so I stopped to restAs soon as I fell asleep though I dreamed that I was floating high in the sky above a large metropolisIt wasnt Bangkok but I dont know what metropolis it wasIt stretched as far as the eye could see and was very impressiveI floated three times around the metropolis and then returned to earthAs soon as I returned to earth I woke upIt was four amI quickly got up with a feeling of fullness and contentment in my heart because while I had been floating around the metropolis I had seen many strange and amazing things that I cant describe to you in detailWhen I woke up I felt happy cheerful and very pleased with my vision at the same time thinking to myself that my hopes were sure to be fulfilled because never before had I seen such an amazing vision  and at the same time it had coincided with my vowSo that night I really marveled at my visionThe next morning after my meal I went to take leave of the senior monk who was in charge of the monastery and he willingly gave permission for me to goFrom there I set out for Nakhorn Ratchasima Province where I spent the rains in Cakkaraad DistrictI started practicing concentration and was amazed at how my mind developed stillness and calm step by stepI could clearly see my heart settle down in peaceAfter that the senior monk who was my Pali teacher asked me to return to Bangkok to continue my studiesHe even had the kindness to come after me and then continued further out into the provincesOn the way back he was going to have me accompany him to BangkokI really felt in a bind so I headed for Udorn Thani in order to find VenAcariya MunThe progress I had been making in concentration practice though disappeared at my home village of Baan TaadThe reason it disappeared was simply because I made a single klodI hadnt even spent a full month at Baan Taad when I began to feel that my mind wasnt settling down in concentration as snugly as it had beforeSometimes I could get it to settle down sometimes notSeeing that things didnt look promising and that I could only lose by staying on I quickly leftIn coming from Nakhorn Ratchasima to Udorn Thani my purpose had been to catch up with VenAcariya Mun who had spent the rains at Wat Noan Nives Udorn ThaniI didnt reach him in time though because he had been invited to Sakon Nakhorn before my arrival so I went on to stay at Wat Thung Sawaang in Nong Khai for a little more than three monthsIn May of that year I left Nong Khai for the town of Sakon Nakhorn and from there went on to the monastery where VenAcariya Mun was staying in Baan Khoak Tong Khoam Township Muang District Sakon Nakhorn ProvinceWhen I reached the monastery I found him doing walking meditation in the late evening duskWhos that he asked so I told him who I wasHe then left his meditation path and went to the meeting hall  he was staying in a room there in the meeting hall  and conversed with me showing a great deal of kindness and compassion for the incredibly ignorant person who had come to seek him outHe gave me a sermon that first evening the gist of which Ill relate to you as far as I can remember itIts a message that remains close to my heart to this dayYouve already studied a good deal he told me at least enough to earn the title of Maha Now Im going to tell you something that I want you take and think overDont go thinking that I underrate the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha but at the present moment no matter how much of the Dhamma youve studied it will serve no purpose in keeping with your status as a scholar other than simply being an obstacle to your meditation because you wont be able to resist dwelling on it and using it to take the measure of things when youre trying to calm your heartSo for the sake of convenience when fostering stillness in your heart I want you to take the Dhamma youve studied and put it away for the time beingWhen the time comes for it to benefit you it will all come streaming in to blend perfectly with your practiceAt the same time it will serve as a standard to which you should make the heart conformBut for the time being I dont want you to concern yourself with the Dhamma youve studied at allWhatever way you make the mind still or use discernment to investigate the khandhas I want you first to restrict yourself to the sphere of the body because all of the Dhamma in the texts points to the body and mind but the mind doesnt yet have any firm evidence and so cant take the Dhamma learned from the texts and put it to good useThe Dhamma will simply become allusions and labels leading you to speculate elsewhere to the point where you become a person with no foundations because the mind is fixated on theory in a manner that isnt the way of the Lord BuddhaSo I want you to take what Ive said and think it overIf you set your mind on the practice without retreating the day will come when these words of mine will impress themselves on your heart Of what I can remember him saying that day this is all Ill ask to tell for nowI felt an immediate sense of faith and conviction in him as soon as I saw him face to face that night both because of my conviction in the Dhamma he was so kind to teach me and because of the assistance he gave in letting me stay under his guidanceI stayed with him with a sense of contentment hard to describe  but also with a stupidity on my own part hard to describe as wellHe himself was very kind helping me with the Dhamma every time I went to see himMy practice when I first went to stay with him was a matter of progress and regress within the heartMy heart hardly ever settled down firmly for a long period of timeThe first rains I spent with him was my ninth rains in as much as I had spent my first seven rains in study and one rains in Nakhorn Ratchasima after starting to practiceDuring that first rains with VenAcariya Mun there was nothing but progress and regress in the area of my concentrationAfter the rains I went up to stay on a mountain for more than two months and then returned to be with him my mind still progressing and regressing in the same wayI couldnt figure out why it kept regressing even though I was intent on practicing to the full extent of my abilitySome nights I was unable to sleep all night long out of fear that the mind would regress and yet it would still manage to regressAnd especially when the mind was beginning to settle down in stillness Id accelerate my efforts even more out of fear that it would regress as it had before  and even then it would regress on meAfter a while it would progress again and then regress againWhen it had progressed it would stay at that level for only three days and then regress right before my eyesThis disturbed me and made me wonder Why was it able to regressWas it because I had let go of my meditation wordPerhaps my mindfulness had lapsed at that pointSo I made a note of this and promised myself that no matter what I would have to keep the meditation word in charge of my mind at all timesRegardless of where I would go and regardless of whether I was in our out of concentration  even when I was sweeping the monastery compound or doing any of my chores  I wouldnt allow my mind to slip away from buddho the word I liked to repeat in my meditationAt this point when the mind would settle down into stillness if it could continue to think of the meditation word buddho in that stillness I wouldnt let go of itIf the mind was going to regress in any way this was where I would have to knowAs soon as I had taken note of this point and had made my promise I started repeating the word buddhoAs I was repeating it the mind was able to settle down quickly much more quickly than it had beforeIt would let go of its meditation word only when it had settled snugly into stillnessAt that moment whether or not I would think buddho the awareness of that stillness was already solidly buddho in and of itselfIt wouldnt be forming any thoughts at allAt that point Id stop my repetitionAs soon as the mind made a move to withdraw  in other words as soon as it rippled slightly  Id immediately start pumping the meditation word back in again as a means of keeping the mind in placeAt the same time Id keep watch to see at what point the mind would regressI abandoned my concern for the progress or regress of the mindNo matter how far the mind might progress or regress I wasnt willing to let go of my meditation wordEven if the mind was going to regress Id let it regress because when I had been determined that it not regress it had still regressed in spite of my determinationNow though I felt no more concern for whether the mind would progress or regressId simply force it to be conscious of buddhoId try to be aware of progress and regress only in terms of the heart that had buddho in chargeThis was where I would knowThis was where I would clearly seeThis was the one spot in which Id place my confidenceI wouldnt have to concern myself with progress or regressAs time passed the mind that had once progressed and regressed didnt regressThis was what made me realize The fact that the mind had kept regressing so often was because of a lapse in its meditation word mindfulness must have slipped away at that moment for sureSo from that point on I kept my meditation word continually in placeNo matter where Id go or where Id stay I wouldnt let mindfulness lapseEven if I was to be on the verge of death I wouldnt let mindfulness slip away from buddhoIf the mind was going to regress this was the only place where Id try to know itI wouldnt concern myself with the matter in any other wayAs a result the mind was able to establish a foundation for itself because of the meditation word buddhoAfter that came my second Rains Retreat with VenAcariya MunBefore the rains began my mind felt still and firm in its concentration with no regressing at allEven then I refused to let go of my meditation wordThis kept up to the point where I was able to sit in meditation without changing to any other position from early night until dawnDuring my second rains with VenAcariya Mun I held to sitting in meditation until dawn as more important than any other method in my practiceAfter that I gradually eased back as I came to see the body as a tool that could wear out if I had no sense of moderation in using itStill I found that accelerating my efforts by means of sitting all night until dawn gave more energy to the heart than any other methodThe period in which I was sitting up all night until dawn was when I gained clear comprehension of the feelings of pain that arise from sitting in meditation for long periods of time because the pain that arose at that time was strange and exceptional in many waysThe discernment that investigated so as to contend with the pain kept at its work without flagging until it was able to understand the affairs of every sort of pain in the body  which was a solid mass of painAt the same time discernment was able to penetrate in to know the feelings of the heartThis did a great deal to strengthen my mindfulness my discernment and my courage in the effort of the practiceAt the same time it made me courageous and confident with regard to the future in that the pains that would appear at the approach of death would be no different from the pains I was experiencing and investigating in the presentThere would be nothing about those pains that would be so different or exceptional as to have me deceived or confused at the time of deathThis was a further realizationThe pain as soon as discernment had fully comprehended it disappeared instantaneously and the mind settled down into total stillnessNow at a point like this if you wanted to you could say that the mind is empty but its empty in concentrationWhen it withdraws from that concentration the emptiness disappearsFrom there the mind resumes its investigations and continues with them until it gains expertise in its concentrationOnce concentration is strong discernment steps up its investigation of the various aspects of the body until it sees them all clearly and is able to remove its attachments concerning the body once and for allAt that point the mind begins to be empty but it doesnt yet display a complete emptinessThere are still images appearing as pictures within it until it gains proficiency from its relentless trainingThe images within the heart then begin to fade day by day until finally they are goneNo mental images appear either inside or outside the heartThis is also called an empty mindThis kind of emptiness is the inherent emptiness of the mind that has reached its own levelIts not the emptiness of concentration or of sitting and practicing concentrationWhen we sit in concentration thats the emptiness of concentrationBut when the mind has let go of the body because of the thorough comprehension that comes when its internal images are all gone and because of the power of its mindfulness and discernment that are fully alert to these things this is called the emptiness of the mind on its own levelWhen this stage is reached the mind is truly emptyEven though the body appears theres simply a sense that the body is thereNo image of the body appears in the mind at allEmptiness of this sort is said to be empty on the level of the mind  and its constantly empty like this at all timesIf this emptiness is nibbana its the nibbana of that particular meditator or of that stage of the mind but its not yet the nibbana of the BuddhaIf someone were to take the emptiness of concentration for nibbana when the mind settles down in concentration it would simply be the nibbana of that particular meditators concentrationWhy is it that these two sorts of emptiness arent the emptiness of the Buddhas nibbanaBecause the mind empty in concentration is unavoidably satisfied with and attached to its concentrationThe mind empty in line with its own level as a mind is unavoidably absorbed in and attached to that sort of emptinessIt has to take that emptiness as its object or preoccupation until it can pass beyond itAnyone who calls this emptiness nibbana can be said to be attached to the nibbana in this emptiness without realizing itWhen this is the case how can this sort of emptiness be nibbanaIf we dont want this level of nibbana we have to spread out feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance for a thorough look until we see them clearly and in full detail  because the emptiness were referring to is the emptiness of feeling in that a feeling of pleasure fills this emptinessThe minds labels brand it as emptyThoughtformations take this emptiness as their preoccupationCognizance helps be aware of it within and isnt simply aware of things outside  and so this emptiness is the emptiness of the minds preoccupationIf we investigate these things and this emptiness clearly as sankharadhammas or fabrications this will open the way by which we are sure some day of passing beyond themWhen we investigate in this way these four khandhas and this emptiness  which obscure the truth  will gradually unravel and reveal themselves bit by bit until they are fully apparentThe mind is then sure to find a way to shake itself freeEven the underlying basis for sankharadhammas thats full of these fabricated things will not be able to withstand mindfulness and discernment because it is interrelated with these thingsMindfulness and discernment of a radical sort will slash their way in  just like a fire that burns without stopping when it meets with fuel  until they have dug up the root of these fabricated thingsOnly then will they stop their advanceOn this level what are the adversaries to the nibbana of the BuddhaThe things to which the mind is attached the sense that My heart is empty My heart is at ease My heart is clean and clear Even though we may see the heart as empty its paired with an unemptinessThe heart may seem to be at ease but it depends on stressThe heart may seem clean and clear but it dwells with defilement  without our being aware of itThus emptiness ease and clarity are the qualities that obscure the heart because they are the signs of becoming and birthWhoever wants to cut off becoming and birth should thus investigate so as to be wise to these things and to let them goDont be possessive of them or they will turn into a fire to burn youIf your discernment digs down into these three lords of becoming as they appear you will come to the central hub of becoming and birth and it will be scattered from the heart the moment discernment reaches the foundation on which it is basedWhen these things are ended through the power of discernment that too is a form of emptinessNo signs of any conventional reality will appear in this emptiness at allThis is an emptiness different from the forms of emptiness we have passed throughWhether this emptiness can be called the emptiness of the Buddha or whose emptiness it is Im afraid I cant say other than that its an emptiness that each meditator can know directly only for him or herself aloneThis emptiness has no time or seasonIts akaliko  timeless  throughout timeThe emptiness of concentration can change in terms of progress and regressThe emptiness on the formless or imageless level which serves as our path can change or be transcendedBut this emptiness exclusively within oneself doesnt change  because there is no self within this emptiness and no sense that this emptiness is oneselfThere is simply the knowledge and vision of things as they are  seeing this emptiness in line with its natural principles as they actually are and seeing all phenomena as they actually are as they pass by and exist in generalEven virtue concentration and discernment  the qualities we use to straighten out the heart  are realized for what they are and let go in line with their actualityNothing at all remains lurking in the nature of this final stage of emptinessI ask that we all reflect on these three kinds of emptiness and try to develop ourselves to attain them  and especially the last form of emptiness which is an emptiness in the principles of nature beyond the range where any other person or any conventional reality can become involved with us ever againOur doubts ranging from the beginning levels of the Dhamma to this ultimate emptiness will find resolution with our own knowledge and vision acting as judgeSo now at the end of this talk  which started out with my telling you of my own ignorance step by step and then strayed off to this final emptiness which is a quality somewhat beyond my powers to explain any further  Ill ask to stop as the proper time seems to have comeMay happiness and contentment be with each and every one of youWhichever theme you focus on be earnest with it keeping mindfulness in constant touch with the work you are doingFor example if youre focusing on the repetition of buddho keep constantly aware of the word buddho buddho as if there were nothing else left in the world for you to become two with this or three with thatThere is only one thing the word buddho blending step by step with your awarenessAs the mind becomes more and more still the buddho you are repeating will more and more blend into one with your awarenessThen the word buddho buddho will fall silent leaving only an awareness thats more conspicuous than beforeThis means that youve reached the mindTo put it in terms of following the tracks of an ox youve reached the ox and can let go of its tracksHere youve reached the inner buddha which is like the ox so now you can let go of the meditation wordThe same holds true if you focus on keeping the breath in mindWhether the breath is heavy or refined simply be aware of it as it normally isDont set up any expectationsDont force the breath to be like this or thatKeep your awareness with the breath because in meditating by taking the breath as your preoccupation youre not after the breathThe breath is simply something for the mind to hold to so that you can reach the real thing just as when you follow the tracks of an ox Youre not after the tracks of the oxYou follow its tracks because you want to reach the oxHere youre keeping track of the breath so as to reach the real thing awarenessIf you were to start out just by holding on to awareness you wouldnt get any results just as you wouldnt be sure of finding the ox if you simply went around looking for itBut if you follow its tracks youre going to find it for sureYour meditation word has to keep moving inThis is called following the tracks of the ox step by step until you reach the ox or what knows namely the mindThe same holds true with focusing on the breathIf its heavy know that its heavyDont get worried or upset about it and dont be afraid that youll die because the breath is heavy or because you feel suffocatedWhen you do heavy work you feel suffocated  dont think that you feel suffocated only when focusing on the breathThere are a lot of other things more suffocating than thisIf you carry a post or lift something heavy you feel suffocated to death all over the body not just in the chest or in the breathThe whole body is ready to burst because of the heaviness and great pain and yet you can take itYou even know that its because of the heavy object and thats the way it has to beWhile you focus on keeping the breath in mind when the breath is coarse its as if you were lifting something heavyIts naturally bound to feel suffocating so dont worry about itEven if its suffocating the important point is to keep track of the breath coming in and outEventually the breath will become more and more refined because mindfulness is focused on the breath and doesnt go anywhere elseWhen the breath goes in be aware of itWhen it goes out be aware of it but theres no need to follow it in and outThat would simply be creating a greater burden for yourself and your attention might slip awaySo focus right on the entry point where the breath goes in and outIn most cases the tip of the nose is the place to focus on the breathKeep watch right thereKeep aware right thereDont waste your time speculating or planning on how the results will appear or else your mind will wander away from the principle of the cause that will give rise to those resultsKeep close watch on the cause  what you are doing  and the breath will become more and more refinedWhen the breath becomes more refined that shows that the mind is refinedEven if the breath becomes so refined that it disappears  at the same time that youre aware that its disappearing  dont be afraidThe breath disappears but your awareness doesnt disappearYoure meditating not for the sake of the breath but for the sake of awareness so stay with that awarenessYou dont have to worry or be afraid that youll faint or dieAs long as the mind is still in charge of the body then even if the breath disappears you wont dieThe mind will dwell with freedom with no agitation no worries no fears at allThis is how you focus on the breathWe have gone forth from the household life and are abstainers from all things that are our own enemies and enemies of the common goodThats why were said to have gone forth It means that we abstainAbstaining here means refraining from the things that work to our detrimentOnce we have gone forth our duty is to abstain from things that are unwise and to develop wisdom  intelligence  as much as we can until it is enough to carry us past our obstacles the entire mass of sufferingAt present we all know that we have gone forthThe world calls us people who have gone forth so be conscious of your status at all times and in your every movement in thought word and deedYou are ordained in the Buddhas religion and have his teachings as your guideHis teachings have both a fence and an open wayThe fence is the Vinaya which prescribes penalties for our errors  major intermediate and minorThis is the fence that blocks the wrong paths so that we wont stray down them and that opens the right path  the Dhamma  so that we can follow it to the goal to which we aspireThe Vinaya is a fence on both sides of the pathIf we go astray it means weve gone wrongIf we go just a little astray weve gone just a little bit wrongIf we go far astray weve gone far wrongIf we go so far astray that we cant get back on the path weve gone absolutely wrongThis is like a person who loses his way If he gets just a little lost he can quickly get back on the pathIf he gets more lost it wastes a lot of his timeIf he gets really lost he has no chance of reaching his goalThus the Vinaya is like a fence to prevent those who have gone forth from going wrongThis fence has various levels  in line with the differing levels of lay people and those who have ordained  for us to observe in line with our moral duties beginning with the five precepts and going up to the eight the ten and the preceptsAs for the Dhamma which is the path to follow as taught by the Buddha it has conviction as its basis  in other words conviction in the path to be followed for good results  and persistence in making the effort to follow the path unflagginglyMindfulness is what guides our efforts as we follow the pathConcentration is firmness of the heart in following the path in addition to being food for the journey  in other words mental peace and ease along the way before we reach the goalAnd discernment is circumspection in following the path step by step from beginning to endThese qualities support and encourage us to stay on the right pathWhen we have these five qualities  conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment  constantly with us theres no need to doubt that the results will appear as our reward clear to the heart in line with our strength and abilitiesIf we develop these five qualities so that they are powerful within our hearts the results that the Buddha proclaimed as lying at the end of the path  release and nibbana  wont be able to elude us because all of these qualities aim at these resultsSo I ask that you as meditators nourish your conviction in the Dhamma and in your own capabilitiesMake your persistence adequate to the taskConcentration will then appear as a result so try to make it adequate and take mindfulness and discernment as your guardiansThe results will then appear to your full satisfactionYou dont have to worry about where the paths fruitions and nibbana lieTry to nourish the causes I have explained here and make them adequateNothing will then be able to prevent the results that will arise from those causesThese five qualities  principles in following the path  are called the five indriya or five balaIndriya means dominant factorBala means strengthAs for the Vinaya its a fence guarding both sides of the path to keep us from straying from the way to the paths fruitions and nibbanaThe Buddha closed off both sides and then opened the way  the five strengths  for us to follow as much as we likeKayaviveka physical seclusion in your dwelling placeThe place where we are staying now is fairly conducive in this respectCittaviveka mental seclusionThose of you aiming for inner seclusion in line with the levels of your concentration have already attained a fair amountThose of you who are just beginning who dont have any mental seclusion in your hearts should try to nourish the five strengths to make them solidInner seclusion will gradually appear step by stepThose of you who have attained an adequate amount of inner seclusion should try to make it more and more refined at the same time developing discernment or circumspection with regard to your seclusionAs for those of you at the higher stages of the practice you should urgently gather up persistence with discernment so as to make it adequate and it will bear fruit as upadhiviveka  absolute seclusion from the defilements  appearing clearly to your heartsPhysical seclusion means finding peace in solitary placesYou dont get embroiled in external matters you dont latch on to work to disturb the body to the point where you turn your temporary dwelling place into a factory viewing physical work as the basis of the religion and as your occupation as a monk  as we see happening everywhere  to the point where you no longer have any interest in the inner effort of the practice that is a monks true dutyMental seclusion refers to the peace of mind endowed with the inner effort of the practice to keep it from running wild with the things that make contactYou rein it in so as to keep it still with watchfulness and restraint at all timesThe nature of this level of mental peace is that even though external things may not be making any disturbance there are still some enemy preoccupations lurking within the mindThis is why this level is termed simply mental seclusion seclusion from the disturbance of external objectsAs for seclusion from the defilements this refers to peace with regard to such external things as sights sounds smells and tastes as well as to peace with regard to internal preoccupations that are the particular enemies of the mindIn other words you are free both from external enemies and from internal enemiesThis is absolute seclusion from the defilements without even the least thing infiltrating the heartThe heart is in this state at all timesEven though various things may come and make contact or the khandhas may do their work in line with their duties these things cant permeate into the heart to cause it any difficultiesThese are the results that come from the basis of physical and mental seclusionThese three qualities  physical seclusion mental seclusion and seclusion with regard to the defilements  are qualities that all of you as meditators should be capable of developing fully within yourselvesThere should be nothing blocking your wayAll I ask is that you dont abandon your effortsBe courageous and enthusiastic in searching out lonely isolated places places where you can shed your foolishness with regard to yourselves once and for allThis is the way through which the Buddha and all his Noble Disciples passed before reaching the land of nibbana  so how could these places turn into the enemies of those of us who are following the Buddhas exampleDont be worried that youll lose your lives in such placesIf that were to be the case the Buddha would have had to change his preliminary instructions to us after our ordination from rukkhamulasenasanam  living in the forest  to something else in keeping with his compassion for all living beings human and divineIf living in lonely solitary places making the effort in line with the Buddhas example were to give results other than those corresponding to the Dhamma he taught he would have had to modify his various teachings to be in keeping with the demands of time and placeThe wings to Awakening  which are like the Buddhas very heart that he gave to us so rightly  would have had to be completely alteredBut these truths are constant and unwaveringThe Buddha never changed themWe as meditators should thus modify our thoughts words and deeds to fit in with this DhammaIt would be highly inappropriate for us to modify the Dhamma to conform with the influence of our hearts with their defilementsIf we were to do such a thing we would become Devadattas in our thoughts words and deeds and our Teacher  the Buddhas right teachings  would be lost to us without our even realizing itSo try to be persistent in line with the teachings given by the BuddhaBe brave in contending with the enemies of the heart  both those that come from within and those that come from without  together with the results they bringAlways take an interest in seeing where suffering and stress come from and how they ariseDont abandon this work or get bored with itTry to know the causes and effects of the things that come into contact or become involved with the heart to see how they give rise to stress until you can ultimately see the causes clearly  and in that same moment you will clearly understand the resultsThe most important points no matter when I teach you  and they are teachings that lie close to my heart  are mindfulness and discernmentThese qualities are very importantIf you lack mindfulness and discernment the results of your practice will be erraticThe progress of your efforts will be interrupted and unevenThe techniques of your intelligence for curing defilement will be lacking and the results  peace and ease  will be sporadicIf mindfulness and discernment are interrupted you should know that all the efforts of your practice have been interrupted in the same instantSo I ask that each of you realize thisEvery time Ive given a talk Ive never omitted the topics of mindfulness and discernmentYou could almost say that I give them the limelight more than any other topic for Ive considered the matter to the best of my ability from the time I first started the practice until today and I have never seen any qualities superior to mindfulness and discernment in being able to unravel things within or without so as to make them clear to the heartFor this reason I teach you these two qualities so that youll know To put them in terms of wood theyre the heartwood or the tap root of the treeIn terms of the Dhamma theyre the root the crucial tools for eliminating all defilements and mental effluents from the blatant to the most extremely refined levels once and for allIf you lack mindfulness you cant even give rise to concentrationIf you lack discernment your concentration might turn into wrong concentration  for the word concentration is a neutral termTheres no assurance as to what sort of concentration it may beIf it lacks discernment as its guardian its sure to turn into concentration that deviates from the principles of the Dhamma without your realizing itThere are many levels of wrong concentration  those that appear blatantly to the world as well as intermediate and subtle levels  but here Ill discuss only those forms of wrong concentration that can occur to us in the area of the practice without our realizing itFor example when we enter concentration the mind may gather and rest for a long or a short time but when we withdraw were still attached to that concentration and not at all interested in developing discernmentWe may feel that the concentration will turn into the paths fruitions or nibbana or else we are addicted to the concentration and want the mind to stay gathered that way for long periods of time or foreverSometimes after the mind gathers into its resting place it then withdraws a bit going out to know the various things that make contact becoming attached and engrossed with its visionsSometimes it may float out of the body to travel to the Brahma worlds heaven hell or the world of the hungry shades without a thought for whats right or wrong as we become engrossed in our visions and abilities taking them as our amazing paths fruitions and nibbana and those of the religion as wellWhen this happens then even if someone skilled and experienced in this area comes to warn us we wont be willing to listen at allAll of these things are termed wrong concentration that we dont realize to be wrongSo what is right concentration like and how should you practice for the sake of rightnessThis is where a few differences lieWhen you sit in concentration and the mind gathers to rest  no matter what the level of concentration  how long it stays there depends on the particular strength of that level of concentrationLet the mind rest in line with its level of concentrationTheres no need to force it to withdrawLet it rest as long as it wants and then it will withdraw on its ownOnce it withdraws try to train yourself to explore with your discernmentWhatever level of discernment corresponds to that level of concentration use it to investigate and contemplate the physical properties and khandhasWhether you investigate these things within or without is not an issueAll that is asked is that you investigate for the sake of knowing cause and effect for the sake of curing or extricating yourself Just this much is whats rightUse your discernment to investigate conditions of nature both within and without or else exclusively within or exclusively withoutContemplate them in terms of any one of the three characteristics until you are experienced and astute until you can find the openings by which you can extricate yourself step by stepWhen you have investigated to the point where you feel tired and the mind wants to rest in its home of concentration let it rest as much as it wantsWhether it rests for a long or a short time is not an issueLet it rest until it withdraws on its ownAs soon as it withdraws continue with your investigation of such phenomena as the body as beforeThis is right concentrationBe aware of the fact that concentration is simply a temporary resting placeWhen you have investigated a great deal in the area of discernment and feel mentally tired rest in concentrationOnce the mind is strong again itll withdrawIf its in shape to investigate then continue investigatingKeep practicing this way constantlyYour concentration will go smoothly and your discernment will always be astuteThings will go evenly both in the area of concentration and in the area of discernment because concentration is beneficial in one way and discernment in anotherIf you let yourself follow only the path of discernment youll go wrong because you wont have concentration as a supportIf you let yourself follow only the path of concentration youll go even more wrong than by simply following the path of discernmentTo summarize These two qualities are like a right arm and a left arm a right leg and a left legWherever a person walks or whatever he does he needs both arms and both legsConcentration and discernment are necessary in just the same wayIf you feel that concentration is better than discernment or discernment better than concentration then you should have only one arm or one leg not two arms and two legs like everyone elseIn other words you dont fit in with the rest of the worldWhoever doesnt fit in with the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha  criticizing discernment and praising concentration or criticizing concentration and praising discernment  is the same sort of personWhats right is that when you are developing concentration you have to do your duties in terms of concentration and really see the value of concentrationWhen you are contemplating with discernment you have to do your duties in terms of discernment and really see the value of discernmentLet each side rest at the right timeDont get them mixed up togetherIts the same as when you walk When your right foot takes a step your left foot has to stopWhen your left foot takes a step your right foot has to stopThey dont both step at the same timeThus both concentration and discernment have their benefitsBut when mindfulness and discernment develop enough strength from being trained together concentration and discernment will then step together  its not the case that theyll always take turns  in the same way that your right arm and left arm work togetherHere weve discussed the relationship between concentration and discernment for those who tend to develop concentration first who are usually in danger of their concentrations going out of bounds without seeing discernment as the other side of the practiceIf its a necessary quality you should use it at the appropriate timesAs for those who tend to have discernment fostering their concentration their minds cant settle down into stillness simply through the power of concentration practice aloneThey need to use discernment to put brakes on the mind  which is restless and running wild with its various preoccupations  by keeping track of the restlessness of the heart so as to see why it is restless and what there is that encourages it to be that wayDiscernment has to go ferreting out the various things the mind is labeling and interpreting until the mind surrenders to its discernment and is able to enter stillnessThis sort of stillness of mind is said to be still through discernmentSome people even when their minds have entered stillness can at the same time use discernment to investigate and form thoughts without these things being an enemy to that stillnessPerhaps you may think If the mind is concentrated how can it form thoughts and then become doubtful about your concentrationThis is called not understanding your own tendenciesThese doubts are normal for those who arent experienced and dont know  since no one has given them any directions that they can hold to as authoritative  so they may become uncertain about their practice when this sort of thing happens to themSo here Id like to take the opportunity to explain The mind that attains stillness through the method of using discernment as its guardian can continue having thought processes occurring on one level of concentration but when we reach a fully refined level no matter which way our concentration is fostered all thoughtformations will ceaseNo labeling of things will be left in that refined concentration no thoughtformations or cognizance of various things will appearTo summarize The intermediate level of concentration for those whose minds gather quickly  namely those who start out with concentration  wont have any thought processes because the moment thoughts forms their minds will begin to withdraw from concentrationThe concentration attained through the guardian power of discernment though can still form thoughts without the minds withdrawing from concentration  and both types of concentration must have mindfulness alert as they gather inwardToday Ive explained the differences between wrong and right concentration  enough so that you as meditators will understand and take this as a guideIve stressed that mindfulness and discernment are very important factorsThose of you who are training mindfulness shouldnt wait to train it only when you are meditatingYou must train it at all timesWherever you go whatever you do be mindfulAlways take your stance in the effort of the practiceOnce there is mindfulness there also has to be selfawareness because selfawareness comes from established mindfulnessIf mindfulness is lacking no selfawareness appearsSo try to develop your basic mindfulness until it is capable and strong enough to be the sort of mindfulness suitable for the effort of the practice within the heartFrom that point it will become supermindfulness because you have continually fostered it and kept it establishedThe same holds true with discernmentTry to contemplate the things that make contact with the mind sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and the thoughts that occur exclusively withinYou have to explore these things ferreting out their causes until you find it habitual to contemplate and thinkWhen this level of discernment gains strength it will advance to a higher level and you will be able to use this higher level of discernment to investigate your doubts about the situation exclusively within the heartYou will be able to see things clearly and cut away your various doubts through the power of discernment the discernment you have trained in this way so that it becomes superdiscernment just like supermindfulnessIve never seen it happen anywhere that anyone who hasnt started out by training discernment in this way has suddenly gained full results through superlative discernmentEven those who are termed khippabhiñña  who have attained Awakening quickly  started out from crude discernment advancing quickly step by step and gained Awakening in the Buddhas presence as we all know from the textsSo when we train our mindfulness and discernment to follow our every movement without any thought for whether were meditating or not but simply keeping this hidden sort of meditation going at all times then no matter what our minds will have to enter stillness and discernment will begin to appearIn particular  for those of us who are monks or who are singlemindedly intent on practicing for the sake of mental peace and release from suffering and stress  mindfulness and discernment are even more necessaryOnce we have trained mindfulness and discernment to become so habitual that were constantly circumspect then when we focus outside well be intelligentWhen we focus inside  on the body feelings mind and phenomena  well become more and more astuteWhen we investigate body feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance well develop techniques for removing defilement without breakMindfulness is especially importantIf you lack mindfulness as a protective barrier at any time discernment will simply turn into labels without your realizing itThus mindfulness is the quality with a solidity that helps discernment become astute in a smooth and even wayThe power of mindfulness acts like the bank of a river keeping discernment from going out of boundsDiscernment that goes out of bounds turns into labelsIf its true discernment it doesnt go out of bounds because it has mindfulness in chargeIf you use discernment to focus within the body things will catch your attention at every stepInconstancy stress and notselfness One or another of these three characteristics is sure to appear because all of them are always there in the nature of the bodyWhen mindfulness and discernment reach this level the mind and its objects will come into the presentYou should know that no Dhamma has ever appeared because of past or future affairsIt appears only because of the presentEven if you contemplate matters of the past of future you have to bring them into the scope of the present if you hope to gain any benefit from themFor example if you see someone die refer it to yourself Ill have to die as well As soon as the word I appears things come running back to you and appear in the presentMatters of past and future if you want them to be useful must always be brought into the presentFor example Yesterday that person diedToday or tomorrow I may die in the same way With the I you immediately come into the presentExternal matters have to be brought inward matters ahead and behind have to be brought into the present if they are to serve any benefitIf you always use mindfulness and discernment to contemplate the conditions of nature  such as the body  all around you then no matter what things wont lie beyond your graspYoull have to understand them clearlyIn investigating phenomena such as the body analyze them into their parts and aspects and use your discernment to contemplate them until they are clearDont let thoughts or allusions drag you away from the phenomenon you are investigating unless you are using thoughts as a standard for your discernment to follow when it doesnt yet have enough strength for the investigationKeep mindfulness firmly in place as a protective fence  and you will come to understand clearly things you never understood before because the conditions of nature are already there in full measureYou dont have to go looking anywhere for inconstancy stress and notselfnessThey are qualities filling your body and mind at all timesThe only problem is that mindfulness and discernment havent been able to ferret them out to make them your own wealthBut if you are set on investigating observantly day and night  thinking not about how many times you do it in a day or night but taking the skill and agility of your discernment as your standard  keeping mindfulness as a steady flow in the present and radiating discernment all around you then whatever makes a move in any direction mindfulness and discernment will follow right after itWhen we have trained mindfulness and discernment to be sufficient to the task like this how will their foes be able to withstand themAfter all we havent made it our purpose to encourage such things as restlessness and distractionWere trying at all times to practice the Dhamma  the means for stopping such things  so as to keep abreast of the movements of the bandits always lying in wait to rob us at any momentWe must thus force the mind to investigate in the way weve mentionedFerret out each part of the body so as to see it clearly from the outside into the inside or take just the inside and bring it out for a lookLook forwards and backwards up and down separating the body into piecesYou can imagine fire burning it into ashes and dust or whatever other ways you can imagine it scattered into pieces depending on what comes easiest to youAll count as ways in which your discernment is making itself ingenious and astuteWhen its sufficiently developed youll be wise to all of these things and theyll be clear to your heart without your having to ask anyone else about them at allThe more you investigate the body until you understand it clearly the more clearly you will understand the affairs of feelings mind and phenomena or feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance because all these things are whetstones for sharpening discernment step by stepIts the same as when we bail water out of a fish pond The more water we bail out the more clearly well see the fishOr as when clearing a forest The more vegetation we cut away the more space well seeThe things Ive just mentioned are the factors that conceal the mind so that we cant clearly see the mental currents that flow out from the heart to its various preoccupationsWhen you use discernment to contemplate in this way the currents of the heart will become plainYoull see the rippling of the mind clearly every moment it occurs  and the heart itself will become plain because mindfulness is strong and discernment quickAs soon as the mind ripples mindfulness and discernment  which are there in the same place  will be able to keep track of it and resolve it in timeBut be aware that in investigating the five khandhas or the four frames of reference we arent trying to take hold of these things as our paths fruitions and nibbanaWere trying to strip them away so as to see exactly what is the nature of the fish  namely the heart containing all sorts of defilementsThe more you investigate You neednt count how many times you do it in a dayFocus instead on how expert and agile you can make your mind at investigatingThe more you investigate  and the more skillful you get at investigating  the more the astuteness of your discernment which is sharp and flashing as it deals with you yourself and with conditions of nature in general will develop until it has no limitYoull eventually have the knowledge and ability to realize that the conditions of nature you have been investigating in stages  beginning with sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations throughout the cosmos and turning inward to your own body feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance  are not defilements cravings or mental effluents in any wayThe heart alone is what has defilements cravings and mental effluents with which it binds itselfNothing else has the power to reach into the heart so as to bind itAside from the heart that is ignorant about itself  searching for shackles for its neck and setting the fires of delusion to burn itself to no purpose  there are no traces of enemies to the heart anywhere at allWe can compare this to a knife which is a tool made to benefit intelligent people but which a foolish person grabs hold of to kill himself and then accuses the knife of being his enemyWhat precedent is there for making such a chargeAll conditions of nature in general are like useful tools but a stupid person grabs hold of them to bind himself and then claims that the conditions of nature throughout the world have put their heads together to abuse himWho can decide such a case for the plaintiff has already killed himselfIf we decide that the instrument of death loses the case to the dead plaintiff what sort of vindication is the plaintiff going to gain to give him any satisfactionThe heart thats deluded about itself and about its own affairs is in the same sort of predicamentThus when discernment begins to penetrate in to know the conditions of nature  beginning with the body  it will also have to penetrate into the causal pointIt will know clearly with its discernment the objects to which the mind tends to send its mental currents and how strong or weak many or few those currents areIt will come to see that the things that it used to see as enemies arent really enemies at allThis is because of the power of discernment that has contemplated things carefully and correctlyAt the same time it will turn around to perceive the awareness inside itself as being its own enemyThis is because of the power of the discernment that sees clearly and comes in letting go stage by stage the things it can no longer hold toThis is why clear understanding through discernment  once it has realized that sights sounds and so forth on into the body feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance are not enemies  must let them go stage by stage until they no longer remain in the heartAnd as for this knowing nature Before we werent able to tell whether it was harmful or beneficial which is why we went about branding things all over the cosmos as being good or bad beautiful or ugly lovable or hateful so amazing as to make us feel like floating or so dreary as to make us miserable and unable to sleep because of the dreariness in short making ourselves pleased displeased and endlessly miserable without our realizing itWhat is the cause that makes the mind like a wheel turning in cycles around itself generating the fires of passion aversion and delusion to burn itself at all timesWhen discernment has contemplated things until they are clear all conditions of nature within and without will be seen to have the same characteristicsNone of them are enemies to anyone at allYou will see  the moment discernment removes all the things concealing it  that the only fault lies with this knowing natureAt this point when the knower moves or ripples  blip youll know immediately that the inner wheel is getting into the actThis is the troublemaker heaping up miseryIts the direct cause of suffering and stressAside from this knowing nature there is no cause of suffering and stress anywhere in the worldWhen we reach this level only this awareness  this entire awareness  is the cause of sufferingWhen this fact becomes this clear to the heart through discernment who would be willing to hold to this knower  this wheel  as his or her selfThis is the subtle discernment the automatic discernment in the principles of nature that was trained by our forcing it in the beginning stagesThe results now appear as an ingenuity and intelligence sufficient to the taskTheres nothing wrong with calling it superdiscernmentIn addition to knowing the revolving mind that is the cause of stress this discernment turns inward to know why that mind is a cause of stress and howIntent on knowing it probes in after the reasons that reveal themselvesBut for the most part when we reach this level if our discernment hasnt really considered things with precision and thoroughness were sure to get stuck on this revolving awareness because its the supreme cause of the cycle  so deceptive and attractive that we as meditators dont realize our attachment to itIn addition to being deluded and attached without our realizing it we may even spread this subtle form of delusion through our misunderstanding to delude many other people as wellSo to let you know This knowing nature in terms of it marvelousness is more marvelous than anything elseIn terms of its radiance its more radiant than anything else which is why we should call it a pit of burning embers secretly lying in wait for usBut no matter what this knowing nature cant withstand the discernment that is its match in subtletyWe are sure to learn the truth from our discernment that this knowing nature is the foremost cause of suffering and stressWhen we know this this nature wont be able to standIt will have to disintegrate immediately just as when people smash a solid object to pieces with an iron barWhen this nature disintegrates after having been destroyed by discernment a nature marvelous far above and beyond any conventional reality will appear in full measureAt the same moment we will see the harm of what is harmful and the benefits of what is beneficialThe awareness of release will appear as dhammo padipo  the brightness of the Dhamma  in full radiance like the sun that when unobscured by clouds lets the world receive the full radiance of its lightThe result is that the awareness of release appears plainly to the heart of the meditator the moment unawareness has disbandedThis is the resultWhat the causes are Ive already explained to you conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernmentThis is the path to follow leading right to this pointIt doesnt lead anywhere elseWhether you live at home in a monastery or in a forest whether youre a woman or a man ordained or not If you have these five qualities always with you youre heading toward this pointIn other words we all have the same full rights in the practice and in the results well receiveSo I ask that all of you as meditators  and you know clearly that you are meditators and abstainers as well  I ask that you practice so as to develop your thoughts words and deeds and that you fully abstain from things that are your enemies until you reach the goal  the release of nibbana  as Ive already explainedNone of these qualities lie beyond your mindfulness discernment and relentless effortThese are the teachings the Buddha gave to us as svakkhatadhamma  the welltaught DhammaIn other words he rightly taught us the path to followHe taught that the wrong path was really wrong and the right path really rightAnd the results  release and nibbana  that come from following the right path were also rightly taughtThe only problem is with those of us following the path Will we really follow it rightly or notIf we follow it rightly in line with what the Buddha taught the results are sure to appear as sammadeva asavehi vimuccati  right release from all defilements and mental effluentsSo for this reason you should make an effort to train your mindfulness and discernment at every moment and not just in any one particular positionDont think that this is making too much of an effortThe more you understand the more ingenious you become the more you can cure defilement the more you gain release from suffering and stress These are the results we all want step by step until we really gain release with nothing leftIn other words we gain release while were conscious and aware in this lifetime while overseeing these five khandhasThis is the most certain Dhamma  because the word svakkhatadhamma the Dhamma rightly taught by the Buddha doesnt mean that its right only after we dieIts also right while we are practicing it and the results that come in line with our efforts appear clearly to the hearts of meditators while they are aliveAs for the methods or techniques you use to train your hearts I ask to leave them up to each persons intelligence and ingenuity in the course of making the effort in the practiceYou have to notice which positions are most helpful in your practiceDont simply sit and keep on sitting or walk and keep on walkingYou have to remember to notice what results and benefits you get from your efforts as well because different people may find themselves more or less suited to the four different positions of sitting standing walking and lying downToday Ive explained the Dhamma to all of you from the beginning to the final point of my ability so I feel that this should be enough for nowI ask that each of you take the Dhamma that Ive explained today and that you have encountered in your practice and make it food for thought or a companion to your practiceThe results you will receive can in no way deviate from todays explanationSo Ill ask to stop hereThe mind constantly coerced or oppressed at all times and the mind absolutely released from that coercion and oppression are two very different things  so different that there is no conventional reality that can be compared to the mind releasedThis sort of mind doesnt lie in the realm of conventional reality in such a way that anything may rightly be compared to it in keeping with the reality of its natureEven though some comparisons can be made theyre simply a manner of speakingThey arent really in line with the truth of that nature as it existsWe have to make comparisons simply because the world has its conventions and analogiesWe see prisoners in jail who are coerced and oppressed who are deprived of their freedom at all times beginning from the day of their imprisonment to the day of their releaseWhat sort of happiness do they haveEven though they may have their laughter in line with the things that may make them laugh its still the laughter of prisonersJust hearing the word prisoner is enough to tell us that happiness isnt what produces their laughterTheir penalty is what produces their laughterIt keeps coercing and oppressing themSo where can we find any happiness and pleasure among themWe can take this and compare it inwardly to the state of affairs between the mind and the defilements that coerce and oppress itThese things control and coerce it with every mental momentEven when the mind isnt forming any thoughts its still controlled and coerced in this way in line with its natureWhen this is the case where can it find any true happinessThe happiness it does have is happiness like the food fed to prisonersAnd what sort of food is thatEven though we may never have been imprisoned we know what sort of food is fed to prisonersIs there anything satisfying about it the food they feed prisonersThe foods  the temptations  with which the defilements feed the mind if we were to speak in the way of the world are simply to keep it from dying in the same way that prisoners are fedThe defilements feed the mind so that it can be put to work in the same way that prisoners are fed so that they can be put to work so that we can get the fruits of their laborThe food for the mind that the defilements bring to sustain us is thus like the food fed to prisonersTheres no difference at allIf we compare them thats the way they areBut if we look from a different angle we can see that prisoners are still better off than we are because they know that they eat their food out of necessityThey dont eat it out of satisfaction with it or its taste or anything because theres nothing at all gratifying about the food they are fedBut we meditators are still content to be attached to the flavor of worldly pleasures so were said to be stuckWhen were attached to visual objects its because we find flavor in themWhen were attached to sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations its simply because we find flavor in themIts not the case that the only flavor is the flavor we taste with the tongueAll forms of contact  with the eye ear nose tongue body and mind  have their flavor and weve been attached to them in such a way that we havent even realized our attachment for aeons and aeonsThe mind is attached bound and feels love for these things without knowing that they are flavors that tie us down that they are all matters of defilement the flavors of defilementSo we are attached to the point where we will never know the harm of these flavors at all if we dont use mindfulness and discernment to investigate them wiselyRegardless of how many aeons may pass we will have to be attached to these flavors engrossed in these flavors without ever coming to our sensesThis is the ingenuity the cleverness of the defilementsHow ingenious and clever are theyIf you want to know then set your heart on the practiceAnd dont forget what Im saying hereSomeday its sure to become clear to your heart as a result of your earnest practiceTheres no escaping itListen carefully to the Buddhas words The flavor of the Dhamma surpasses all other flavors What sort of flavor is the flavor of the Dhamma that it has to surpass all other flavorsThose other flavors are the flavors of the food of prisoners imprisoned in the wheel of death and rebirth through the power of defilementThey arent food or flavors that can keep the heart satisfiedThey arent true flavorsThey arent the flavors of the truthTheyre the flavors of the counterfeits that the defilements whip up into being for us to touch or to eatThey arent the flavors of the true DhammaThe flavor of the Dhamma will begin to appear when the mind is centered in concentrationAs soon as the mind begins to be still pleasure will begin to appear as its flavor depending on the amount of stillness in line with the levels of its tranquillityWhen we say levels of tranquillity dont go thinking that theyre separate steps like those of a ladderIts simply a way of speakingActually theyre all connected from the pleasure of basic concentration progressively up to the levels of refined concentrationThe pleasure that arises will become correspondingly more and more refinedThis counts as one of the flavors of the Dhamma  the Dhamma of concentration the Dhamma of peace  in the levels of the stillness of the mindAs soon as the mind has stillness for its food it lets go of its concerns for the various flavors of sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations step by step because the flavor of this stillness begins to excel themEven this is enough to begin excelling all other flavorsEven more so when the mind begins to investigate things with its discernment analyzing them in terms of the three characteristics or the meditation theme of unattractiveness  because in the beginning we tend to develop the theme of unattractiveness contemplating every part of our own body and the bodies of others inside and out as seems most appropriate and natural for us to investigate because they all share the same conditions for us to see clearly step by step The flavor of the Dhamma will then intensify becoming an ingenious flavorAnd in addition to being an ingenious flavor its a flavor that comes from being able to let goThe nature of the mind is such that once it investigates anything to the point of seeing it clearly it lets goWhen it hasnt let go when it grasps with attachment these are the chains and fetters with which defilement keeps it boundThe defilements confer titles telling us This is goodThats prettyThis is beautiful They never tell us that the body is filthy ugly inconstant stressful and notself  not belonging to us or to anyone elseThese are things the defilements never tell us never mention never suggest in line with the principles of the truthInstead they bring their own principles in to interfere with the Dhamma telling us just the opposite  that this or that is beautiful lasting valuable  denying the truth every step of the way because they are very powerfulFor this reason we need to keep track of their deceits counteracting and removing them by using such qualities as mindfulness and discernmentOur world is entirely stuck in the deceits of defilementWhen discernment has investigated inward in line with the principles of unattractiveness as we have already mentioned and in line with the three characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself probing and analyzing back and forth time and again the truths that the defilements have kept concealed will be revealed in line with these principles of truth  because these principles are truth pure and simpleTheres nothing counterfeit about themWhats counterfeit  our false views  are an affair of defilement not an affair of the DhammaWe will be able truly to see things as they are  without a doubt  once we can remove the counterfeit things that conceal themFor example beauty Where exactly is the body beautifulWhat is there about it that you can claim to be beautifulIf you speak in terms of the principles of the truth how can you even look at the human bodyIts entirely filled with filthiness both within and without which is why we have to keep washing it all the timeEven the clothing and other articles on which the body depends have to be dirty because the main part  the body  is a well of filth within and withoutWhatever it comes into contact with  robes clothing dwelling bedding  has to become dirty as wellWherever human beings live becomes dirty but we dont see the truth mainly because we arent interested in lookingAs meditators we should investigate so as to see this truthDont run away from itThis is the genuine truthThe things that fool us into seeing the body as beautiful are counterfeit and falseSoLook into your bodyWhich part can you claim to be beautiful to contend with the truth of the DhammaLook for itIs there any part that dares claim to be above the Dhamma and more true than the Dhamma  unless its simply more false than the DhammaThe fact that the Dhamma isnt appearing in our heart is because at the moment falseness is more powerful more established and conceals things completelyEven though theres filth throughout the body both within and without were still able to regard it as beautiful and lastingThe issues between truth and falsity lie within our body and mind because the defilements themselves lie within the mind and spread their power out throughout the various parts of the body and then splash out beyond throughout the world of rebirth saying that this is us thats ours everything is us ours beautiful lasting enjoyable  depending on the song with which the defilements the deceivers fool the mind into jumping bouncing and spinning much more than a soccer ballAnd what happiness can we find in jumping along with all the deceits weve mentioned hereIf we havent yet awakened and come to our senses when will we and whereIf the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha hasnt awakened us meditators who in the world will be able to awaken usAs they say svakkhato bhagavata dhammo The Dhamma of the Buddha is rightly taught  rightly taught in a way clear to see with nothing hidden or esotericWhats hidden about itIf we look with our eyes well see in line with what Ive said hereSoLook on in from the skin on inSkinscum and sweatscum Is there anything good about themAnything clean and beautifulIf they were clean how could we call them scumThen look on insideWhat is there inside that can contend with the Dhamma and claim to be pretty and beautifulThe Dhamma tells us that theres nothing pretty or beautiful in there that its all filthySo which part is going to contend with the Dhamma of the Lord BuddhaIf the Dhamma is false if the Buddha didnt teach it rightly then find something to prove it wrongAll of the things that the Dhamma criticizes When you penetrate into them with discernment youll find that thats just how they areTheres no point with which you can argueAll of these things have been true ever since before we investigated them but the defilements have closed our eyes to themEven though we see them we dont see them for what they areEven though filth fills the body the defilements deny it entirely and turn it into something beautiful  and we believe them without looking at the Dhamma thats waving its arms at us ready to help us at all times as if it were calling to us Hold onHold on to the DhammaHurry up and youll escape from dangerHurry and let go of the defilementsTheyre a fire burning youSee what happens when you smash the defilements to bitsFight with them until you have no more breath to breatheThats when the Dhamma will fully reveal itself in every facet for you to see clearlyThis is the way of digging into the things that conceal so as to uncover the truth the genuine DhammaIf we see the truth we begin to see the genuine Dhamma step by stepEven on the level of stillness were already not embroiled with anything because we have the savor of the DhammaThe heart can drink of the Dhamma mental peace and calmThe heart doesnt jump or run isnt vain or proud restless or distracted flying out after various preoccupations because it has found a satisfying food to sustain itWhen we use discernment to investigate  to prepare our food so to speak  to make it even more exquisite than the food of tranquillity turning it into the food of discernment this has a flavor even more exquisite and refined without limit which comes from investigating and analyzing the body the theme of our meditationThe basic principle on which we depend to counteract and remove the defilements lies right here which is why the Buddha focuses his teachings right hereIt wouldnt work to focus anywhere else because this is the primary place where living beings are attachedAttachments outside come second to thisWhen we have investigated so as to see in line with this truth step by step without retreating in our investigation or letting it lapse until we have clearly understood then the point of enough in our investigation together with the point where we let go of our attachments will appear of its own accord through the power of the discernment that has removed all things concealing has dismantled all things counterfeit so as to see the truth clearly in the heartDiscernment on this level will then stop of its own accordAs for the affairs of attachment we neednt say anything because they are simply the results of delusionWherever knowledge penetrates delusion will immediately retreat so how can attachment remainIt will have to retreat without a doubtThe more we investigate in preparing our food  the flavor of the Dhamma  through the power of mindfulness and discernment unraveling things to see them clearly for what they are the more the mind becomes light and airyDisenchanted and dismayedHow long have I been attached this wayWhy have I dared to make things up in such a bullheaded way This is the exclamation with which we reproach ourselves  because things actually havent been what weve made them up to beSo why have we made them up that wayWe then immediately see through the makebelieve that has led to this state of affairs because discernment is what penetrates and makes its choicesHow will it not know whats true and whats notIf we analyze the body to pieces we can clearly see that its a living cemeteryWhen it dies its a dead cemeteryHow can we stand to look at itLook all over the world Is there any place where there are no cemeteriesThere are cemeteries wherever living beings dwellInvestigate on down to the truthIs our discernment for us to make into foodIts for us to cure our bankruptcy so that we can escape from being prisoners held in custody by the defilementsWhy shouldnt we be able to escapeThe Dhamma of the Lord Buddha is perfectly suited to us human beings which is why he taught it to the human worldHe saw this as the central point of existence the most appropriate placeTheres no one more intelligent than the Buddha the foremost Teacher who taught the Dhamma to the most appropriate place our human worldAt the moment what are weWere human beingsOf this were certainIn addition were monks  meditating monks at that so why shouldnt we be able to seize the excellence of the flavor of the Dhamma to taste as our own treasure through our own practiceIf we arent capable who in the world is capableTo whom should we hand over this capabilityAt the moment whose hearts are being squeezed by suffering and stressArent these things squeezing our own heartsSo to whom are we going to hand over this capabilityTo whom are we going to hand over all the duties and responsibilities involved in attaining freedomShould we hand them over to sufferingWe already have suffering in our heartsThe only thing to do is to remove suffering and stress through persistent effortWere fightersWe have to be defiantWe cant let ourselves say retreatSoWhatever the pain however great it may be were ready for itThe pain and suffering that come with the effort wont lead us to bankruptcyTheyre better than the pain and suffering that are already putting a squeeze on us at all times and serve no purpose at allSo dig on down meditatorsThis is one step in the investigationThe Buddha teaches us to visit cemeteries because we dont yet see the cemetery withinWe first have to visit external cemeteries to open the way for bringing the mind into our own internal cemeteryIts full of corpsesAside from the fact that the body itself is a cemetery the corpses of all sorts of animals fill our bellyWhat sorts of things have been stuffed in thereFor how longWhy dont we look at this cemeteryLook so as to see it clearlyUnattractiveness inconstancy stress and notself are all heaped right hereWe dont have to go looking for them anywhere elseWhen we look in terms of changeability  inconstancy  we can see it clearlyThe body keeps changing all the time from the day its born to the day it diesEven feelings keep changing in their way pleasure pain and indifference both in body and mindThey keep spinning around in this wayWhen do they ever stopIf we have any mindfulness and discernment why dont we see these things as they do their work in line with their natural principlesIf we use our mindfulness and discernment we have to see we have to knowThese things cant be kept hiddenThey cant be kept hidden from mindfulness and discernmentWe have to see right through themTheres no doubt about thisStressWhich part of the body gives us any pleasure or easeTheres nothing but stress and pain filling the bodyWeve constantly had to tend and care for the body so that it has been able to survive this far so are we still going to be attracted to this mass of fireNotselfThe Buddha has already proclaimed itIts not the selfDont mess with it As if he were slapping our wrists Dont reach for itDont touchIts dangerous Whenever you say that its you or yours your attachment is like grabbing fire so extricate yourself using discernmentSee these things as being truly inconstant stressful and notselfThe mind then wont dare to reach for them or touch themStep by step it will let go of its burdens  its attachments which are a heavy weightWhen the mind extricates itself from its attachments it becomes lighter and lighter more and more at easeThe savor of the Dhamma will appear step by step even more exquisite than on the level of concentrationWhen the flavor of the Dhamma surpasses the flavor of these various defilements they have to be discarded and trampled underfootThe physical khandha  the body  is importantIt has a really great impact on the mindTo love it is to sufferTo hate it is to sufferTo be angry with it is to sufferThe affairs connected with the body are more prominent than any othersIf the mind has no stillness theres nowhere it can find any reliefTheres nowhere we as monks can retreat to find any pleasureFor this reason we must try to still our minds and make use of the Dhamma to attack our defilementsDont feel any regret for the time it takesDont feel any regret for the cycles of rebirth for the prison for our wardens and torturers the various kinds of defilementThese have been our greatest torturers from time immemorialEven though we may not remember for how long simply hold to the principle of the present as your primary guide and theyll all be scatteredThe past no matter how long is simply a matter of this same mass of sufferingIf we cant shed it these things will have to continue this way foreverDont be interested in any other mattersKeep watch of the truth  which is within you proclaiming itself at all times  by using mindfulness discernment conviction and persistenceDont let up or retreatDont see anything as having greater value than the effort of extricating yourself from these things that coerce and oppress youYoull then be able to make something extraordinary of yourselfWhether or not you give yourself titles make sure at least that you arent burdened or attached right hereThis is where the Buddha says the highest savor is foundUproot the things that involve and entangle you each step along the wayKeep cutting your way in beginning with the physical heap  the body  which is one wall or one thick coveringOnce youve passed the physical heap ransacked this physical heap and known it clearly with understanding without any remaining ties its as if you have amassed a large pile of capital clear to your heartYou can be certain of progressing to release at one point or another in this present lifetime with no need to anticipate it as happening in this year or thatOnce the mind has attained this level you can be sure of yourselfPersistence comes on its ownThe pain and difficulties that come from making the effort are completely erased of their own accord because the flavor of the Dhamma appearing clearly to the heart has a power far overriding the pains that come from the persistent effortThe heart becomes motivated through the principles of its naturePersistence keeps spinning in the person who used to be lazyLaziness is a matter of the defilements resisting and fighting the DhammaWhen we start out making the effort then laziness weakness discouragement pain and difficulty all come thronging in oppressing us so that we cant take a step and we finally fall down with a crashThat shows weve been shotThey dont have to shoot us a second timeOne shot and were down  down on the pillow snoring awayWe keep getting shot by the defilements again and again till were thoroughly mangledOur efforts dont amount to anythingIf this is the way things are then well be sunk in the round of rebirth sunk in the prison of the wheel of rebirth forever with never a day when well gain release never a day when well be freeSo slash away at the defilements using the principles of the Dhamma that the Buddha taught and arent otherwiseYoull then have to gain release from these things that coerce and oppress you without a doubtThe important points are persistence mindfulness discernment and enduranceSoKeep enduringWhats wrong with endurance for the sake of making your wayOther things you can endurePhysical pain to the brink of death No one else can endure it for youYou have to endure it for yourselfHavent you already endured it beforeSo why cant you endure the pains and deprivations that come with the effort of the practiceAfter all you endure them for the sake of the effort to extricate yourself from sufferingSo why cant you endure themMake it strong your heart as a monk your heart as a meditatorOnce youve seen the dangers pointed out by the Dhamma youll see the benefits arising through your effortsIn the beginning you have to grapple a great deal with the body as your meditation themeOnce youve opened your way and seen causes and results as your starting capital then the four mental khandhas  vedana sañña sankhara and viññana  have already gotten into the actThere are feelings in the body as well as in the mind so when youre investigating the body how can these things not rush in to connectTheyre related phenomenaIts not the case that you finish investigating the body before you start investigating vedana sañña sankhara and viññanaDont plan on things being that way because its wrongIn the truth of the practice thats not the way things areOnce your work is focused on any one point it has an impact on everything else but these things become prominent only after the body has lost its meaning and value for us through the DhammaBefore we saw it as having a great deal of meaning and value but once the Dhamma  the truth  has demolished the falsity of this sort of defilement and craving these things lose their meaning and worthThe Dhamma now clearly has a value above and beyond themThis is when vedana sañña sankhara and viññana become prominent because theyve already opened the way from the stage of the physical bodyWhat is there to feelingsFor the most part they converge in on feelings of the mindAs for physical feelings Ive already explained them to you beforeIf you analyze them when youre sick or have been sitting in meditation for a long time youll know themIf you want to know them focus on them today using mindfulness and discernment and youll understand themYoure sure to understand them clearly if you use discernmentDont simply endure themTo contend with pain you have to use discernmentSimply fighting it simply enduring it doesnt count as the pathThe path is mindfulness and discernmentThe greater the pain the more these things spin into workYou cant let mindfulness and discernment leave the point of the painAs for the body each part will be seen clearly as a reality in line with its nature within the mind because in accordance with the principles of nature thats what they already areNo matter how much pain arises in the body its its own separate realityOnly the mind is what labels and interprets itOnce the mind has used discernment to investigate the pain to the point of being abreast of it it will extricate itself from the pain to be its own separate reality on this level so that each is a separate realityWhen each is a separate reality what harm can they do to each otherWhat impact can they have on each otherNone at allThe body is the body the pain is a pain the heart is the heart ie the mind is the mindEach is a separate reality with no impact on the othersEven if the pain doesnt subside it has no impactIt has no impact on the mind at allThis is called seeing the truthAfter youve done this many times youll be able to uproot your attachments to the body and the pain in the body will be passed by as wellThe only issue remaining will be feelings in the mindSañña and sankhara are importantOnce the body the physical heap is passed sañña and sankhara  thoughtformations  become prominent because there are no more problems involving the bodyThe mind isnt willing to investigate the body again just as when weve eaten enough of this sort of food we put it aside and continue eating whatever else still attracts usWhen were completely full we put it all aside no matter what kind of food it is meat dishes or dessertsOur investigation is similar to thisIt tells us on its ownWhen the mind has had enough of anything it lets go and no longer investigates that thingIt then continues with other things in the same way that when weve eaten enough of this sort of food we go on to other sorts until were completely fullThen we put it all asideOur investigation is so that we will have enough and then let goSankhara refers to the thoughtformations in the mind  good thoughts bad thoughts this issue and thatThey keep forming all the timeEach of us falls for his or her own issuesEven if other people dont become involved with us the mind has to paint pictures and form thoughts past and future a big turmoil within the heartWe get infatuated with this preoccupation saddened by that oneMatters that passed months and years ago we warm up and serve to torment the mind to oppress and coerce it because of our delusion because of the fact that we arent up on the tricks and deceits of this sort of defilementThis is why we have to investigate themWhatever issues the mind forms if theyre good they vanish if theyre bad they vanish  so what sense or substance can we gain from themWherever they arise probe on down right thereSañña labels and interpretations They come labeling out of the mindThis is how the mind appears when it reaches a refined levelThis is the way the natural principles of the investigation are of their own accordEven if no one tells us we come to understand on our ownWherever anything makes contact mindfulness and discernment spin around right there until they understand and let goOnce discernment has cut the bridge to the body it has also cut the bridges to external sights sounds smells and tastesThe only things left in the mind are feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizanceThese deal entirely with the mind itselfWe investigate at that point with discernment without becoming intimate with any of these four conditionsFor example feeling Pleasure arises and vanishesPain arises and vanishes there in the heartThe Buddha thus calls them inconstant and notselfInconstant and notselfThey arise and vanishLabels are also inconstant stressful and notselfWhat is there to become attached toTheyre just like the bodyIn other words theyre all a heap of the three characteristicsWhen we have investigated them time and again these four conditions shrink into the mindThis is called giving chase to defilementProbe into that point with discernment until you know and see it clearlyWhen the defilements cant find any place to hide theyll go running into the mindMindfulness and discernment then come spinning into mano the mindThis too the Buddha tells us not to hold ontoListenThe mind too is inconstant stressful and notselfListen to thatHow can the mind not share in the three characteristics when the defilements are in thereHow can we hold to the mind as being us or ours when the entire army of defilement is in thereIf we hold to the mind as being us or ours its the same as holding to defilement as being us or ours so how can we gain releaseVery profound this point of Dhamma here on the level of investigationThe mind too is inconstant stressful and notself because the defilements are in thereSo strike on down with your investigationWhatever gets smashed  even if ultimately the mind itself is demolished along with everything else  at least know it clearly with your discernmentThe defilement that forms the essence of the cycle  which in Pali is termed avijjapaccaya sankhara With unawareness as condition there occur mental formations This is the seed of becoming and birth buried here in this mindWhen its bridges are cut it cant find any way out to go looking for foodThe bridges out the eyes have been cutThe bridges out the ears nose tongue and body have all been cut by discernmentThe defilements cant find any way out to develop love for sights smells tastes or tactile sensations because all their bridges have been cutWere abreast of things as they actually occur so the defilements go running insideIf they try to become attached to the body thats something weve already investigated and known with discernment something weve already let goFeelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance have all been investigated and seen to have the three characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself so where do the defilements lieThey have to be hiding in the Big Cave the mindSo discernment goes slashing inSo now is the mind usIs it oursSlash on downWhatever is going to be destroyed let it be destroyedWe feel no regretsWe want only the truthEven if the mind is going to be smashed and destroyed along with everything else lets at least know with our practiceStrike on downUltimately everything counterfeit gets smashed while the nature of pure truth of supreme truth  the pure mind  doesnt die and isnt destroyedSeeSo now whether you call it inconstant stressful and notself or not at least make the mind pure and it will gain release from all conventional realitiesInconstancy stress and notself lie within the realm of conventionOnce the mind has gained release from these things theres nothing more that can be said  even though we are completely awareSo what is there now to doubtThis is release from the prison from the cycle that imprisons living beings and us in particular  our mind in particular now extricated right hereFreed right hereAll that is needed is for the defilements to be shed entirely from the heart There is nothing else to pose the heart any problemsThis is thus called the timeless heart the timeless Dhamma freed from timeIts a pure nature always fully buddho like thatAt this point how can we not clearly see the harm of defilementWhen such things as mindfulness and discernment have trampled defilement to bits how can we not see its harm with our whole heartHow can we not see through the happiness that the defilements bring to feed us when were ready to die simply to keep us goingThats the sugarcoated happiness concocted by the defilements simply to keep us goingThats the flavor of defilementBut the flavor the Dhamma is like this something else entirely How can we help but knowTo summarize the mind that lies under the power of the cycle with the defilements coercing and oppressing it is not at all different from a convict in prisonWhen it has gained utter release from its prison of defilement theres no comparison for itEven so we praise it as being supreme  a convention which doesnt really correspond to that realityBut even though it doesnt correspond you can be assured that the difference is just like that between the mind imprisoned and the mind released from all coercion completely free and independentTheyre different in just the way that weve saidSo be earnest and intentYouve come here for the purpose of learning and finding things of substance and value for yourselvesInvestigate so as to see clearly in line with the principles of inconstancy stress and notself as I have mentioned because they underlie the way everything is throughout the three levels of the cosmosTheres nothing splendid enough for us to feel regret at leaving itThe only thing splendid is releaseIts a nature truly splendidWe dont have to confer titles on it because its its own natureIt has had enough of everything of every sortThis is what is meant when we say that the flavor of the Dhamma excels all other flavorsWhatever kinds of flavors we may have experienced the flavor of the Dhamma excels them all lets them all go because no other flavor can match itEven this flavor it isnt attached toThis flavor we say is supreme isnt attached to itselfIts simply a principle of truth and thats allSoBe earnest meditatorsDont get discouragedGive your life to the BuddhaEven though we may have never said that weve given our life to defilement thats what weve done for an infinitely long time to the point where we cant count the timesEven in the single lifetime of an individual we cant count the timesTake the realm of the present thats visible to us and work back to infinity Its all come from the avijjapaccaya sankhara embedded here in the heart for countless lifetimesNothing else in the cosmos has caused us to experience becoming and birth and to carry the mass of all sufferings other than this avijjapaccaya sankharaFor this reason when they say the mind of a person who dies is annihilated just where is it annihilatedUse the practice to get a hold on the matterDont speak simply in line with the tricks and deceits of defilement that close off our ears and eyesDefilement says that death is followed by annihilationSeeIts blinded us completelyAs for the defilement that causes people to take birth and die where is it annihilatedIf we want to see through its tricks and deceits why dont we take its arrows to shoot it in returnIt causes living beings to lie buried in the cycle so where is defilement annihilatedAnd what does it coerce if it doesnt coerce the mindIf the mind is annihilated how can defilement coerce itThe mind isnt annihilated which is why defilement has been able to coerce it into birth aging illness and death all along without ceasingSo why do we fall for the deceits of defilement when it says that death is followed by annihilation without having the sense to see the harm of its deceitsThis sneaky defilement has fooled living beings into falling for it and grabbing at suffering for a long infinitely long timeSo investigate down to the truthFind out what is and isnt annihilatedThats when you can be called skilled at the Dhamma skilled at exploring and investigating down to the truthThats how the Buddha proclaimed and taught the DhammaHe taught the Dhamma using the truth he had already practiced by making the causes absolutely complete and attaining results satisfactory to his heart and then taking that Dhamma to teach the worldSo where did he ever say that death is followed by annihilation just whereHe taught nothing but birth aging illness and death birth aging illness and death over and overAll of the Buddhas taught like thisThey never differed because they all knew and saw the same sort of truth in line with the principles of that truthSo how can you make the mind be annihilated when its already utterly trueBirth and death birth and death without ceasing What is the causeThe Buddha has taught us beginning with avijjapaccaya sankhara sankharapaccaya viññana  With unawareness as condition there are formationsWith formations as condition there is cognizance These are the causesTheyre buried in the mind which is why they cause us to take birth without ceasingAs soon as we destroy avijjapaccaya sankhara what happensAvijjayatveva asesaviraganirodha sankhara nirodho  All that is needed is for unawareness to be completely disbanded from the heart then nirodho hoti  everything else is disbanded What do you say to thatEvametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hoti  All that is needed is for unawareness to be utterly disbanded and everything  the entire mass of suffering and stress  is disbanded And that which knows that unawareness is disbanded thats the pure oneHow can that pure one disband or be annihilatedIts an utter truthSo lookListenWe Buddhists take the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha as our refuge you knowWe dont take the defilements as our refugeWere meditators so we have to probe and explore so as to see the truthWhoever may bring the entire cosmos to intimidate or take issue with us we wont bat an eyeOnce weve seen and known the truth with our full hearts how can anyone intimidate usThink for a minute The Buddha was a single solitary personWhy was he able to be the Teacher of all three levels of existenceIf he didnt teach the truth that he had known and seen with his full heart what did he teachHe taught with courageThere has never been anyone who has excelled him in being thoroughly trained and bringing the pure truth to teach the worldHe didnt teach anything counterfeit or guessed atTo speak out of guesswork scratching at fleas Thats the science of unawareness  the science of unawareness that lulls the world into bankruptcyThe principles of the genuine truth dont teach us to be bankrupt which is why we say that those other things are counterfeitThe Dhamma is a truth on which we can stake our life without questionDefilements are false the whole lot of themout of are counterfeitThe Dhamma is true  percent all trueThe Dhamma and defilement pass each other going in opposite directions which is why they are adversariesIn the effort of the practice if we dont fight with the defilements what will we fight withThese are our adversariesIf we dont fight with them what will we fight withAt the moment the defilements are the adversaries of the DhammaTheyre our adversariesIf we dont fight with the defilements that are our adversaries and the Dhammas what will we fight withOnce we know all about the affairs of the defilements what doubts will we have about the DhammaIn particular what doubts will the mind have about the matter of death and rebirth or death and annihilationFind out just where things get annihilated meditatorsWhatever we hear is the voice of those filthy defilementsArent we tired of washing our earsListen to the voice of the foremost Teachers DhammaOur ears will then be clean and our hearts pureSo be earnestShillyshallying around thinking of sleep thinking of our stomachs These are habits long embedded in our heartsTheyre all an affair of defilementSo flip over a new leaf making the heart an affair of the Dhamma in keeping with the fact that were disciples of the Tathagata who have given ourselves to be ordained in his religion and to follow the principles of his DhammaThats when well attain a great treasure of infinite worth to rule our heartsWhen the Dhamma rules the heart how is it different from defilement ruling the heartAs Ive said before the Dhamma ruling the heart is something supreme and magnificent Were fully free with our full heart  not grasping not hungry not searching not hoping to depend on anything  for the Dhamma has filled the heart and thats plenty enoughI can tell a resolute person when I see him  like our VenAcariya MunIt was intimidating just to look at himHow could the defilements not be intimidated by himEven we were intimidated by him and the defilements are smarter than we are so how could they not be intimidatedThey had to be intimidatedThats the way things have to beA teacher who possesses the Dhamma who possesses virtue has to be resolute so as to eliminate evilHe has to be resoluteHe cant not be resoluteThe stronger the evil then the more resolute the stronger his goodness has to beIt cant not be resolute and strongOtherwise itll get knocked outSuppose this place were dirty However dirty it might be we couldnt clean it just by splashing it with a glass of water could weSo how would we make it cleanWed have to use a lot of waterIf this place were filled with a pile of excrement wed have to splash it with a whole bucket  and not just an ordinary bucketA great big oneA single splash and all the excrement would be scatteredThe place would become clean because the water was strongerBeing resolute is thus different from being severe because it means being earnest toward everything of every sort in keeping with reasonTake this and think it overIf you act weakly in training yourself youre not on the pathYou have to be strong in fighting with defilementDont let the strong defilements step all over youIf we dont have any way of fighting defilement  if were weak and irresolute  were good for nothing at allThose who want what is clean and good from the Dhamma What is the Dhamma likeWhat did the Buddha teachWhat sort of defilements are eliminated by what sort of Dhamma so that it deserves to be called the middle wayThe Buddha taught The middle way realized by the Tathagata  producing vision producing realization  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to nibbana This is in the Discourse on Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in MotionThe middle way is what can cause all these forms of knowledge to ariseRealization This is penetrative knowledge thats very subtle and sharpEven discernment is less penetrating and sharp than it isSelfawakeningNibbana This path leads to nibbanaAll of these things without exception come from this middle wayThey dont lie beyond range of this middle way at allWhat does it mean the word middleMiddleness as it is in reality and the middleness we hear about study memorize and speculate about Are they differentVery differentIll give you an exampleSuppose there are two soldiers both of whom have studied the full course of military scienceOne of them has never been in the battle lines while the other has had a lot of experience in the battle lines to point where he has just barely escaped with his lifeWhich of the two can speak more accurately and fluently about the reality of fighting in a warWe have to agree without hesitation that the soldier who has been in battle can speak of every facet in line with the events he has seen and encountered to the extent that he could come out aliveIf he were stupid he would have had to dieHe had to have been ingenious in order to surviveSo the middle way How is it middleWeve been taught that following the middle way means not being too lax not being too extremeSo what way do we follow so that its not too lax or too extreme so that were in line with the principle of middleness aimed at by the genuine DhammaWhen weve sat a little while in meditation we get afraid that well ache that well faint well die our body will be crippled or well go crazy so we tell ourselves Were being too extreme SeeUnderstandIf we think of making a donation we say NoThatd be a wasteWed do better to use it for this or that So what is thisDo you understand whose middleness this isIf were going to follow the way of the Dhamma we say its too extreme but if were going to follow the way of defilement then were ready for anything without a thought for middleness at allSo whose middleness is thisIts just the middleness of the defilements because the defilements have their middleness just like we doWhen people do good want to go to heaven want to attain nibbana theyre afraid that its cravingBut when they want to go to hell in this very life you know they dont worry about whether its craving or notThey dont even think about itWhen they go into a bar Is this cravingThey dont stop to think about itWhen they drink liquor or fool around with the ways to deprivation Is this the middle way or notIs this cravingIs this defilement or notThey dont bother to thinkBut when they think of turning to the area of the Dhamma then it becomes too extremeEverything becomes too extremeWhat is thisDoesnt the thought ever occur to us that these are the opinions of the defilements dragging us alongThe defilements dress things up just fineTheir real middleness is in the middle of the pillow the middle of the sleeping matAs soon as we do a little walking meditation and think buddho dhammo sangho its as if we were being taken to our death as if we were tied to a leash like a monkey squirming and jumping so that well let go of the buddho that will lead us beyond their powerWhether were going to give alms observe the precepts or practice meditation were afraid that were going to faint and dieTheres nothing but defilement putting up obstacles and blocking our wayWe dont realize what the middleness of defilement is like because its been lulling us to sleep all alongJust now I mentioned the two soldiers who had studied military science one of whom had gone into battle while the other one hadntWe can compare this to studying the textsThose who have gone into battle  who have had experience dealing with defilement and fighting with defilement  are the ones who can describe the middle way correctly and accuratelyIf you simply study and memorize Here Im not belittling studyStudy all you canMemorize all you canIm not criticizing memorizationBut if you simply memorize the names of the defilements  even if you memorize their ancestry  it doesnt mean a thing if you arent intent on the practiceIf you dont practice its just like memorizing the names of different criminalsWhat this or that gang of criminals does how it makes its money what it likes to do what their names are We can memorize these thingsNot to mention just their names we can even memorize their ancestry but if we dont get into action and deal with them those criminals whose names we can remember will keep on harming the worldSo simply memorizing names doesnt serve any purposeWe have to get into action and lay down a strategyWhere do those criminals rob and stealWe then take our strategy and put it into practice lying in wait for them this place and that until we can catch themSociety can then live in peaceThis is the area of the practiceThe same holds true with defilements and mental effluentsWe have to practiceOnce we know we put our knowledge into practiceWhat is it like to give almsWeve already given themWhat is it like to observe the preceptsWeve already observed themWhat is it like to meditateWeve already done itThis is called practiceIts not that we simply memorize that giving alms has results like that observing the precepts has results like this meditation has results like that heaven is like this nibbana is like thatIf we simply say these things and memorize them without being interested in the practice we wont get to go there we wont get any of the resultsSo now to focus down on the practice of fighting with defilement The defilements have been the enemies of the Dhamma from time immemorialThe Buddha has already taught that the defilements are the enemies of the DhammaWhere do they lieRight here  in the human heartWhere does the Dhamma lieIn the human heartThis is why human beings have to fight defilementIn fighting the defilements there has to be some suffering and pain as a matter of courseWhatever weapons they use whatever their attack whatever their tactics the Dhamma has to go spinning on inThe ways of sidestepping fighting jabbing attacking the ways of eliminating defilement all have to be in line with the policies of the Dhamma  such as Right Views and Right Attitudes  spinning back and forthGradually the defilements collapse through our practiceThis is what is meant by the middle waySoGo ahead and wantWant to gain release from sufferingWant to gain meritWant to go to heavenWant to go to nibbanaGo ahead and want as much as you like because its all part of the pathIts not the case that all wanting is cravingIf we think that all wanting is craving then if we dont let there be craving its as if we were deadNo wanting no anything Is that what it means not to have defilement or cravingIs that kind of person anything specialIts nothing special at all because its a dead personTheyre all over the placeA person who isnt dead has to want this and that  just be careful that you dont go wanting in the wrong direction thats allIf you want in the wrong direction its craving and defilementIf you want in the right direction its the path so make sure you understand thisThe stronger our desire the more resolute our persistence will beDesire and determination are part of the path the way to gain release from stressWhen our desire to go heaven to attain nibbana to gain release from stress is strong and makes us brave in the fight then our persistence our stamina our fighting spirit are pulled together into a single strength by our desire to attain nibbana and release from stressThey keep spinning away with no concern for day or night the month or the yearThey simply keep at the fight all the timeHow about itAre they resolute nowWhen the desire gets that strong we have to be resolute meditatorsNo matter how many defilements there are make them collapseWe cant retreatWere simply determined to make the defilements collapseIf they dont collapse then were prepared to collapse if were no match for themBut the word lose doesnt exist in the heartIf they kick us out of the ring we climb right back in to fight againIf they kick us out again we climb back in again and keep on fightingAfter this happens many times we can start kicking the defilements out of the ring too you knowAfter were been kicked and hit many times each time is a lessonWherever we lose to defilement whatever tactics the defilements use to beat us we use their tactics to counteract themEventually well be able to stand them offAs the defilements gradually become weaker the matters of the Dhamma  concentration mindfulness discernment persistence  become stronger and strongerThis is where the defilements have to grovel because theyre no matchTheyre no match for the DhammaBefore we were the only ones grovelingWherever we groveled wed get kicked by the defilementsLying down wed cryWed moanSitting wed moanStanding wed feel desireWalking wed feel desire and hungerWherever wed go thered be nothing but love hate and anger filling the heartThered be nothing but defilement stomping all over usBut once these things get struck down by mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence they dont exist no matter where we go  because the defilements are grovelingThey keep on groveling and we keep on probing for them without let upWhenever we find one we kill itWhenever we find one we kill it until the defilements are completely eradicated with nothing left in the heartSo now when we talk about defilement no matter what the kind we can talk without hesitationWhatever tricks and tactics we employed to shed the defilements we can describe without hesitationThe purity of the heart that has no more defilements ruining it as before we can describe without hesitationThis is like the person who has gone into battle and can speak without hesitationIts not the same as when we simply memorizeIf we simply memorize we can speak only in line with the textsWe cant elaborate the least little bitWe dont know howBut a person who has gone into battle knows all the ins and outs  not simply that military science says to do things like this or to follow that routeHe can make his way through every nook and cranny every zig and zag depending on what he needs to do to get to safety or gain victoryA fighter takes whatever means he can getIts the same with us in fighting defilementWhatever approach we should use to win the Buddha provides all the weapons of the Dhamma for us to think up with our own mindfulness and discernmentWe people never run out of rope you knowWhen we really come to the end of our rope then mindfulness and discernment produce ways for us to help ourselves so that we can bash the defilements to bits until no more defilements are leftFrom that point on wherever the defilements bring in their armies in whoevers heart we know them all  because theyve been entirely eliminated from oursThis is the practiceThis is whats called the middle wayWhen the defilements come swashbuckling in the middle way goes swashbuckling outIf they bring in a big army the middle way has to fight them off with a big armyIf theyre hardhitting were hardhittingIf theyre daredevils were daredevilsThis is whats meant by the middle way the appropriate way appropriate for defeating the armies of the enemyIf their army is large while ours is small and our efforts few it just wont workWell have to loseHowever large their army however many their weapons our army has to be larger and our weapons moreOnly then will we winThis is whats called the army of the DhammaHowever large the army of defilement may be mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence have to go spinning in and treat them with a heavy handFinally the defilements fall flat on their backs and we wont have to chant a funeral service for themWeve gained the superlative DhammaWhen the defilements have fallen flat on their backs we arent worried about where well live in the cosmosWhy askWere not interested in whether well be reborn in heaven in the Brahma worlds or in hell after we dieThere is nothing that knows more than the heartNormally the heart is already a knower so now that it knows clearly in line with reason in line with the Dhamma what is there to wonder aboutThis is why there is only one Buddha at a time  because a Buddha arises with difficulty gains release with difficultyHes the first to gain Awakening making his way all by himself past the enemy army of defilement craving and mental effluents to proclaim the Dhamma to the world so that we can study it and put it into practice which is our great good fortuneWeve been born right in the midst of the Buddhas teachings so be earnest in practicing them so as to profit from themThe teachings of the Lord Buddha arent a childs doll or plaything you knowThe Dhamma is sanditthiko  directly visibleThe teachings of the Buddha are the open market of the paths fruitions and nibbanaTheyre never out of date  unless were out of date which is why we let the defilements fool us into thinking that the Dhamma is out of date that people who practice the Dhamma are oldfashioned and out of date that people who enter monasteries are oldfashioned and out of date that the teachings of the religion have no paths or fruitions any more that the paths fruitions and nibbana dont exist that no matter how much you practice youll just wear yourself out in vainThese things are nothing but defilement deceiving us  and we believe everything it says so we keep going bankrupt without even a scrap of good to our namesWhy are we willing to believe it so thoroughlyKilesam saranam gacchami  I go to defilement for refuge Weve never said itAll we say is buddham dhammam sangham saranam gacchami  I go to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha for refuge but when the defilements give us a single blow we fall flat on our backsWhat good does it accomplishWhat does Buddham saranam gacchami meanNothing but Kilesam saranam gacchamiEven though we never say it our beliefs fall in line with defilement without our even thinking about itThis is called Kilesam saranam gacchamiThe grandchildren of defilement we saranam gacchamiThe grandparents of defilement we saranam gacchamiEverything about the defilements we grovel and saranam gacchamiWere all a bunch of kilesam saranam gacchamiThink it overSo be resolute meditatorsDesire to see the truthIts there in the heart of every personThe Buddha didnt lay any exclusive claims to itAll thats needed is that you practiceDont doubt the paths fruitions and nibbanaWhen are the defilements ever out of dateTheyre in our hearts at all timesWhy dont we ever see them being accused of being out of dateEvery kind of defilement is oldfashionedThe defilements are out of style so dont have anything to do with them I dont see us ever give a thought to criticizing themSo how is it that the Dhamma that remedies defilement is out of existenceThe Dhamma is a pair with defilement but defilement simply lulls us to sleep so that we wont use the Dhamma to defeat itIts afraid of losing its power  because defilement is intimidated by the Dhamma which is why it deceives us into not heading towards the DhammaSo remember thisVery well thenIm tired of preaching to meditators who Kilesam saranam gacchamiI dont know where my courage came fromJust think  the fear I used to feel for VenAcariya Mun I didnt feel at allI was boldI wanted to speakI wanted to tell him what I had experiencedThe mind was impetuous and spoke right up without any fearThat was when he got to see my true natureBefore that I had never shown anything at allNo matter what the mind had been like I had never behaved that way but once this awareness arose I went up to see him when there were just the two of us and told him right awayIt was as if he were the master of a dog urging me on to bite the defilementsVenAcariya Mun  who could be more astute than heAs soon as I went up to see him I started right in speaking without any fearOnce the mind knows the truth together with how it has contemplated it can describe it all including the results that appearIt can describe them in full detailWhile I was speaking he listened in silenceAs for me I kept right on goingThis crazy guy doesnt just fool around  thats probably what he was thinkingWhen his madness is on the rise hes really in earnest Thats probably what he said to himselfAs soon as I had finished he burst right out Thats the way its got to be He really got going and I bowed down and listenedWe dont die up to five times in a single lifetime he saidWe die only onceSo keep on striking awayYouve finally caught on to the basic principleYouve finally got it so keep wrestling with it I was like a dog he spurred on  I was so happyComing away from him I was ready to bark and to biteI kept fighting awayThat is I continued sitting all night in meditation and kept telling him the Dhamma I had gainedSitting in meditation all night  I did it more than nine or ten times that Rains Retreat and I wasnt just sitting as normal because I was wrestling with my full strength both because of the marvels I was seeing and because of my frustration over the way my mind had regressed earlierThese two got added together so that the mind had the full strength of frustration and daringAs time passed though VenAcariya Mun finally gave me a warning  a single flash The defilements dont lie in the body he saidThey lie in the heartHe then gave a comparison with a horseWhen a horse is unruly and wont listen to its master the master has to give it really harsh treatmentIf he has to make it starve he should make it starve  really treat it harshly until it cant make a moveOnce it finally stops being rebellious though he can let up on the harsh treatmentWhen its rebelliousness weakens the harsh treatment can be relaxed Thats all he said  and I understood immediatelyIf he had said more than that He knew what sort of person I was He was afraid Id go completely limpSo he gave just a flash of a warning and I understoodThe important point for a meditating monk is to have principles in the heartPrinciples in the heart means the various stages of concentration and levels of discernment all the way to the level of arahantshipThese are called the principles in the heart for meditating monksIf the principles in the heart are good every aspect of the principles in our practice will be good as well because the heart is what gives the ordersThis is why we see the heart as having primary importanceWhen a person with principles in the heart practices its very different from a person without principles in the heartWhen a person with principles in the heart makes compromises in line with events at some times in some places and with some individuals and when he is strict with himself at normal times he does so with reason  which is different from a person who is simply determined without having principles in the heartEven though such a person may be resolute and courageous hes pervaded with error pride and conceitHes not as even as he should be in his ascetic practices which are means of cleansing away the defilements of pride and conceit fermenting inside himThe body is an affair of the world like the world in generalIt has to be involved with the world which requires compromises with certain people in certain places and on certain occasionsBut if when we have to make compromises we cant do so for fear that were sacrificing our strictness or our ascetic practices or if once we compromise we cant return to our strictness its a matter of pride in either case and cant help but have an impact on ourselves and on others both when we should be strict and when we should make compromises in line with eventsWhen a person with principles in the heart sees fitting in line with reason he makes compromises when he should with certain individuals places and events that may happen from time to timeBut when that necessity is past he returns to his original strictness without any difficulty in forcing himselfThis is because reason the Dhamma is already in charge of his heart so he has no difficulties both when making compromises and when following the ascetic practices strictly as he is accustomed toAll of this is something I practiced when living with VenAcariya MunFor example Id vow to follow a particular practice or several practices without telling him  although he would know perfectly well because I couldnt keep it secret from himBut because of my great respect for him Id have to make compromises even though it bothered meAs a rule I wouldnt be willing to make compromises at allThat was a feeling set up like a barrier in the mind because my intentions were really determined like thatI wouldnt let anything pass without my working right through it with this determination of mineThe first year I went to stay with him I heard him talk about the ascetic practices  such as the practice of accepting only the food received on ones alms round  because he himself was very strict in observing themFrom that point on Id vow to take on special ascetic practices during the Rains Retreat without ever slackingId vow to eat only the food I got while on my alms roundIf anyone else would try to put food in my bowl aside from the food I had received on my round I wouldnt accept it and wouldnt be interested in itEver since then Ive kept to this without failId be sure that I for one wouldnt let this vow be brokenOnce the Rains Retreat came Id have to make this vow as a rule in my heart without missing even a single yearThe years we spent the rains at Baan Naa Mon VenAcariya Mun was really observant and astuteOf all the sages of our day and age who could be sharper than heHe knew I had vowed not to accept food that came afterwards but on the occasions he would come to put food in my bowl hed say Maha please let me put a little food in your bowlThis is a gift from one contemplative to another Thats what hed sayThis is a gift from a fellow contemplativePlease accept it That meant he was giving me the food himselfSometimes thered be groups of lay people from Nong Khai Sakon Nakhorn or other places who would come to Baan Naa Mon to present food to VenAcariya Mun and the other monks in the monasteryThis would happen once in a long long while because in those days there were no cars or busesYoud have to travel on foot or by cartThese people would hire oxcarts to come and would spend a night or two  but they wouldnt stay with the monks in the monasteryTheyd stay in the shack in Yom Phaengs rice fieldWhen morning came theyd prepare food and instead of waiting outside the monastery to place the food in our bowls as we returned from our alms round theyd bring it into the monastery to present it to usI wouldnt dare accept their food for fear that my observance would be brokenId walk right past themAs I noticed though VenAcariya Mun would accept their food out of pity for themThere would be a lot of food left over from presenting it to the monks so theyd bring it to the meeting hall  fruit individual servings of food wrapped in banana leaves  but we wouldnt take any of itItd get passed around without making a rippleNo one except sometimes one or two of the monks would take any of itIt must have looked not just a little strange to the lay peopleAs for me I wouldnt dare take any of it for fear that my observance of this ascetic practice would be brokenSeveral days later VenAcariya Mun asked to put food in my bowl saying This is a gift from a fellow contemplativePlease let me put it in your bowl And then he put it in my bowlHe did it himself you knowNormally  who would I let put anything in my bowlId be afraid that my observance would be broken or at the very least wouldnt be completeBut he probably saw that there was pride lurking in my vow to observe this practice so he helped bend it a little to give me a number of things to think about so that I wouldnt be simply a straightarrow typeThis was why hed find various ways to teach me both directly and indirectlyI in particular was very straightarrowI was very set on things in that way which is why I wouldnt let anyone destroy my ascetic practice by putting food in my bowl  except for VenAcariya Mun whom I respected with all my heartWith him Id give in and let him put food in my bowl the times he saw fitI was solidly determined not to let this observance be deficient not even the least little bitThis was something that kept chafing in the heartId have to be complete both in terms of the observance I was following and in terms of my determination but because of my love and respect for him Id accept his gifts even though I didnt feel comfortable about itThis is the difference between a principle in the practice and a principle in the heartI admit that I was right in the earnestness of my practice but I wasnt right in terms of the levels of Dhamma that were higher and more subtle than thatLooking at myself and looking at VenAcariya Mun I could see that we were very differentVenAcariya Mun when looking at something would see it thoroughly in a way that was just right from every angle in the heart  which wasnt like the rest of us who would view things in our stupid way from one side onlyWe didnt use discernment the way he didThat was something wed have to admitHere Ive been talking about practicing the Dhamma with VenAcariya Mun at Baan Naa MonWhen we moved to Baan Nong Phue I vowed again to observe this particular practiceWherever Id go Id stick to my guns as far as this practice was concerned and wouldnt retreatI wouldnt let it be brokenComing back from my alms round Id quickly put my bowl in order taking just a little of whatever Id eat  because during the rains Id never eat my fillId never eat my fill at allId tell myself to take only soandso much around to percentFor example out of percent full Id cut back about to percent which seemed about right because there were a number of us living together as a groupIf I were to go without food altogether it wouldnt be convenient because we always had duties involved with the groupI myself was like one of the senior members of the group in a behindthescenes sort of way though I never let onI was involved in looking after the peace and order within the group in the monasteryI didnt have much seniority  just over ten rains in the monkhood  but it seemed that VenAcariya Mun was kind enough to trust me  also behind the scenes  in helping him look after the monks and novicesWhen the rains would begin all of us in the monastery would vow to observe different ascetic practices and after not too many days this or that person would fall backThis showed how earnest or lackadaisical the members of the group were and made me even more meticulous and determined in my duties and my ascetic practicesWhen Id see my fellow meditators acting like this Id feel disillusioned with them in many waysMy mind would become even more fired up and Id encourage myself to be unrelentingId ask myself With events all around you like this are you going to fall back And the confident answer Id get would be What is there to fall backWho is this if not meIve always been this sort of person from the very beginningWhatever I do I have to take it seriouslyOnce I decide to do something I have to be earnest with itI dont know how to fool aroundI wont fall back unless I die which is something beyond my controlI wont let anyone put food in my bowl under any circumstances Listen to that  under any circumstances That was how I felt at the timeSo the changes in my fellow meditators were like a sermon for me to listen to and take to heartI havent forgotten it even to this dayAs soon as I returned from my alms round Id quickly take whatever I was going to eat put my bowl in order and then quickly prepare whatever I had that Id put in VenAcariya Muns bowl  this or that serving that I had noticed seemed to go well with his health as far as I knew and understoodId set aside whatever should be set aside and prepare whatever should go into his bowlThen Id return to my seat my eyes watchful and my ears ready to hear whatever he might say before wed start eatingAs for my own bowl when I had put it in order Id put it out of the way behind my seat right against the wall next to a postId put the lid on and cover it with a cloth to make doubly sure that no one would mess with it and put any food in itAt that time I wouldnt allow anyone to put food in my bowl at allI made that clear in no uncertain termsBut when VenAcariya Mun put food in my bowl hed have his way of doing itAfter I had prepared the food I would give to him and had returned to my place after we had given our blessings and during the period of silence when we were contemplating our food  thats when hed do it right when we were about to eatI have no idea where he had arranged the food to put in my bowl  but he wouldnt do it repeatedlyHe knew and he sympathized with meOn the occasions when hed put food in my bowl hed say Maha please let me put food in your bowlThese lay people came late  and his hand was already in my bowl  right when I had placed my bowl in front of me and was contemplating my foodI didnt know what to do because of my respect for himSo I had to let him do it in his kindness  but I wouldnt let anyone else do itHed do it only once in a long whileIn one Rains Retreat hed do it only three or four times at mostHe wouldnt do it repeatedly because he was every astuteThe word majjhima  just right Youd have to hand it to him without being able to find anything to faultSo ever since then Ive stuck to my practice all along up to the presentAs for the monks and novices who couldnt get it together they all ended up in failure which has made me think  made me think without ceasing  about my fellow meditators What is it with their hearts that they dont have any firm principles that they keep failing like thisWhat mainstay can they have for the future when the present is already a failure Events like this have kept me thinking in this way without ceasing all the way up to the meditators who are living with me at presentFor this reason the ascetic observances are very important principles in the practiceEating from the bowl There are many people monks among them who dont see the value of eating from the bowlIn addition to not seeing the value of this ascetic practice they may see it as unbecoming or inappropriate both in the monastery and in society at large in that all sorts of food  meat dishes desserts etc get mixed together in the one bowlThey may even think that its ugly or messy  which is an opinion of the defilements trying to efface the truth of the DhammaThere are few who see the value of any of the thirteen ascetic practices even though all thirteen are tools for us monks to wash away defilementIts well known that the defilements and the Dhamma have always worked at crosspurposes from time immemorialThose who give their hearts and lives in homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha will practice in line with what the Buddha taughtThose who give their hearts and lives in homage to the cycle of defilement will practice in line with the opinions of defilementSo to whom are we going to pay homage nowHurry up and decideDont delayOtherwise the defilements will pull you up to the chopping block  dont say I didnt warn youThe Dhamma has already been taught so hurry up and start walkingDont waste your time being afraid that its out of date or you wont be able to make a stepPansukulacivaram  the practice of wearing robes made from castoff cloth This is to counteract our feeling for price ostentation pride and excess  the type of beauty that promotes defilement and steps all over the Dhamma  so that these things dont encumber the hearts of meditators whose duty is to eliminate the defilements in order to promote the Dhamma and nourish the heart to be gracious and fineThe items of consumption we collect from what is thrown away are good for killing the defilements of greed ostentation and excess love for beauty and haughtinessSages have thus praised and followed this practice all along up to the presentWe can see their footprints in using this method to kill defilement as a treat for our hearts and eyes so that we wont die in vain in having followed the homeless lifeThe practice of going for alms This is so that well perform our duties in line with the Buddhas instructions  pindiyalopabhojanam nissaya pabbajja The life gone forth is supported by means of almsfood  instructions we received on the day of our ordinationDont be lazyDont forget yourself because of whatever other gifts of food you may receiveWhoever may present them see them as extraneousTheyre not more necessary than the food we get by going for alms with the strength of our own legs  which is our duty as monks who do their work properlyThis is the really appropriate way to gain food in line with the pindiyalopabhojanam in the instructions we receive during our ordinationListenIts fitting appropriate which is why the Buddha taught us to go for alms something of firstplace importance in our pure work as monksThe Buddha went for alms throughout his careerThe few times he didnt were when he was staying in a place where it wasnt appropriate  as when he was living in the Prileyya Forest and the elephants looked after him because there were no people aroundSo there were only a few times when the Buddha made exceptions to this practicePubbanhe pindapatanca  in the five duties of the Buddha  In the morning he would go for alms for the sake of the beings of the world Listen to thatSayanhe dhammadesanam At four in the afternoon he would give instructions to his lay following kings generals financiers landowners merchants and ordinary people in generalPadose bhikkhuovadam After dark he would exhort the monksThis is the second of his duties as a BuddhaAddharatte devapanhanam After midnight he would answer the questions posed by the various levels of the heavenly beings  from the lowest up to the highest  and give them instructionsThis is the third of his dutiesBhabbabhabbe vilokanam In the last watch of the night he would survey the beings of the world using his superior intuition to see what beings might be caught in the net of his knowledge whom he should go to teach first  whoever might be prepared to receive the teaching and whose lives might be in danger so that he shouldnt wait long before going to teach themThis is the fourth dutyPubbanhe pindapatanca The following morning he would then go out for alms on a regular basisThese are the five duties of the Buddha that he normally wouldnt abandonHed abandon them only on special occasionsFor example going for alms When he was staying in the Prileyya Forest he couldnt go for alms so he put that duty asideBut otherwise he viewed going for alms as a necessary duty which is why we have to teach monks to view going for alms as a right activity as extremely appropriate workFor monks there is no work in searching for their livelihood more appropriate than going for almsNo matter who might have the faith to bring gifts of food no matter how much we should view it as extraneous gains a luxury and not as more necessary than the food gained by going for almsThis is so that we dont forget ourselves and become entangled in that sort of thingThe Buddha teaches monks not to forget themselves not to be lazy because the defilement of laziness is important and to forget ourselves is no mean vice  for we tend to become haughty when there are many people respecting us and especially when they are people of high statusWhen we have a large following we tend to throw out our chest and put on airsEven though we dont have stripes its as if we paint them on to be a royal tiger showing off his rankSince when were they ever a small matter the defilements of monksThis is why the Buddha taught us to stamp out these ugly defilements in the society of Buddhists and monks by not forgetting ourselvesHowever many people come to respect us thats their businessOur business is not to forget our dutiesDont forget that monks business is monks businessTo forget yourself is none of your business as a monkEven lay people who are mindful dont forget themselvesTheyre always even in the way they place themselves in relation to othersWere monks  meditating monks at that  which is even more of a delicate matterIts our business to be mindful of ourselves and to use our discernment to scrutinize events that come to involve us at all times not to be careless and forgetful in any circumstancesThis is how we show our colors as monks who see danger in what is dangerousWe are members of the Sakyan lineage the lineage of the Buddha who was sharper and more intelligent than anyone else in the three levels of the cosmosFor what reason should we make fools of ourselves over the baits of the world which fill the earth and arent anywhere nearly as difficult to find as the DhammaTo forget ourselves to swell up with pride because of extraneous gains or the respect of people at large Is this our proper honor and pride as sons of the SakyanIts simply because we see the superlative Dhamma as something lower than these things that we monks dont think or come to our senses enough to fear their danger in the footsteps of our TeacherSakkaro purisam hanti  Homage kills a man Fish die because they are tempted by baitIf we monks dont die because of things like this what does make us dieConsider this carefullyDid the Buddha give this teaching to stupid fish or to those of us monks who are moving toward the hook at the momentBe aware of the fact that the outside is bait but inside the bait is the hookIf you dont want to meet with disaster be careful not to bite the hookEating from the bowl This is a very important activity but we dont see its importanceOrdinarily we who have ordained in the religion have no vessel for our food more appropriate than our bowlEven monogrammed plates and gold platters arent more appropriate than the bowlOnly the bowl is appropriate for monks when they eatNothing else is better or more fittingWe each have only one bowl and put everything in there togetherThe Buddha has already set us a solid exampleOr is it that when food gets mixed together like that itll spoil our digestion  as most people say and weve already heard many timesIf thats the case then when it all gets mixed in the stomach wont it spoil our digestionHow many stomachs do we have in our bellyHow many vessels are in there for us to put our separate sorts of food inThis one for desserts this one for meat dishes this one for spicy curry this one for hot curry Are there anyAre there different vessels for putting our separate sorts of food in to keep our digestion from spoilingWe simply see that when food is mixed in the bowl itll spoil our digestion but not when its mixed in the stomachThis view  fearing that our digestion will be spoiled  is for the sake of promoting our tongues and stomachs not for promoting the mind and the Dhamma through our various practicesIf there is anything toxic in the food  whether or not its mixed in the bowl  then when its eaten it can spoil our digestion with no relation to whether or not its mixed together because the toxicity lies with the things that are toxic and not with the mixing togetherWhen its eaten its toxicBut if the food isnt toxic then when its mixed it isnt toxic so where will it get any toxicityThe food is beneficial without any harm or toxicity mixed inWhen its placed together in the bowl its still foodWhen its eaten and goes to the stomach its a benefit to the bodySo we as monks and meditators should be observant of the differences between Dhamma and notDhamma which are always effacing each otherFor example Eating food from the bowl spoils your digestionEating outside of the bowl improves your digestion and fattens the defilements  but the Dhamma grovels and cant get up because notDhamma has kept stomping on it in this way without mercy from every side all alongActually when food is mixed in the bowl its an excellent sermonBefore eating we contemplateWhile eating we contemplate the incongruity of food and were bound to get unusual tactics for training the mind from the food that is mixed together  because we dont eat for enjoyment for beautification for pride or for recklessnessWe eat enough to keep the body going to practice the holy life so as to take the defilements and the mental effluents  poisons that are buried deep cluttering the heart  and wash them away by contemplating them aptly using these ascetic practices as our toolsRefusing food that is brought afterwards This too is to prevent us from being greedy and forgetting ourselvesEven when theres a lot of food  more than enough  greed you know has no land of enoughThats goodThis is goodThe more food there is the wider our mouth the longer our tongue the bigger our stomachThese are always overtaking the Dhamma without letupThis is sweetThats aromaticThis is rich  everything keeps on being goodTheres no brake on our wheels  no mindfulness  at allActually the word good here is a title conferred by defilement to erase our contentment with little our fewness of wants as meditators without our realizing itThis is why we tend to be carried away by the lullaby of the defilements word goodAs for whether the Dhamma is good or not thats another matter entirelyIf the food is sweet we knowIf its aromatic we knowIf the mind is attached to the flavor we have to try to knowTo be carefulTo thwart the defilement that wants to get a lot and eat a lotThe Dhamma has us take just enough or just a little in keeping with the Dhamma to eat just enough for the body or just a little without being greedy for food or other items of consumptionWe eat just enough to keep goingWe arent stuffed and lethargic aiming more at our beds than at the persistent effort to abandon defilementWe monks when we eat a lot and have a lot of extraneous gains get fat and strong but the mind forgets itself and doesnt feel like meditatingThis is good for nothing at allWe simply have food fattening the body without any Dhamma to fatten the mindThe mind that used to have Dhamma to some extent gets thinner and more emaciated day by dayIf its never had any Dhamma  such as the Dhamma of concentration  the situation is even worseIt has no goals at allThe ascetic practices thus have to put a brake on our greed for food so that the mind can have a chance to follow the DhammaThe defilements wont have to be fattened the body will be light the mind will be still and light while making its effort  more easily stilled than when the belly is stuffed tight with foodThis is something really embarrassing in meditating monks the way we take our stomachs instead of the Dhamma to show off to the worldLiving in the forest How does it differ from living in villagesIt has to differ which is why the Buddha taught us to live thereAnd living in an ordinary forest vsliving in a lonely forest How does this feel to the person living thereFor a person aiming at the Dhamma theres a big difference between living in a forest and living in a lonely forest including the effort required to make the mind quietIn a lonely forest the mind becomes still easily because we arent complacentWere watchful over ourselvesWherever were mindful and alert thats the effort of practiceDefilement is afraid of people who are mindful and alert who are always watchful over themselvesIts not afraid of complacent peopleThe Buddha thus opened the way using the ascetic practices for us to take victory over defilementThis is the way that will stamp out defilementIts not the case that he opened the way through the ascetic practices for defilement to stomp all over the heartAll the ascetic practices for those who follow them are ways of subduing defilementFor example living under the shade of a tree in appropriate forests and mountains The Buddha and his Noble Disciples all came into being in purity from these things so we as meditators should reflect on thisWe shouldnt forget ourselvesHowever many material gains we may receive we shouldnt forget ourselves because of them for thats not the way of those who follow in the footsteps of the Buddha and his Noble DisciplesNo matter how many people come to respect us thats their businessWe in practicing the Dhamma should beware of that sort of thing because its a concern and a distraction an inconvenience in the practiceWe shouldnt get involved in anything but the contact between the heart and the Dhamma at all timesThats whats appropriate for usIf the mind becomes a world of rebirth itll outstrip the worldliness of the world to the point where it has no limits or boundsThe more people come to respect us  and our defilements as monks and human beings are always ready to welcome this  the more pride we feel the more we forget ourselvesWe swell up more than a river overflowing its banks because this is a matter of defilement not of the DhammaMatters of the Dhamma have to be evenThey require us to be mindful at all times and not to forget ourselvesThis is the path followed by those who have practiced to lift themselves beyond suffering and stressThose of us who want to gain release like them have to practice like them  or like students who have teachersWe shouldnt practice haphazardly claiming to be smart and not listening to anyoneThats the path of practice taking us up on the chopping block with the onions and garlic not the path taking us to the paths fruitions and nibbanaThese are things I have felt ever since I was a young monk and so Ive been able to hold to them as good lessons all alongThere were times when I saw people coming to show respect to my teachers and it gave rise to a strange sort of feeling in my heart  the feeling that Id like to have them respect me in the same way  but at the same time I knew that the mind was base and was giving rise to an obscene desire so I didnt encourage itI kept blocking it and was always conscious of my own fault in feeling that wayWhen I really began to practice I knew even more clearly that that was a wrong notion that to think in that way wasnt right at allIt was like the toad trying to compare himself to the oxMy teachers status was that of a teacherMy status was that of a toad lurking undergroundHow could I try to compare myself with him if I didnt want to burst like the toad in Aesops fableThat fable is a very good lesson for those who practice properly for the sake of releaseThe practice of visiting the cemetery Why visit the cemeteryWe people have to see evidence with our own eyes if were going to come to our sensesVisiting cemeteries is for the sake of seeing human deathCemeteries in the past werent like they are todayUnburied bodies were scattered all over the place  old bodies and new scattered around like logsWhen you saw them youd see clear evidence with your own eyesThe Buddha gave instructions on how to visit a cemeteryGo from the upwind side he said not from the downwind sideDont begin by looking at new corpseLook at the old ones firstKeep contemplating the theme of your meditation and gradually move on until you know that the mind has enough mindfulness and discernment to contemplate a new corpseOnly then should you move on to a new corpse  because a new corpse still has regular featuresIf the person who just died had beautiful features it might cause desire to flare up and youd end up with an outoftheordinary meditation theme which is why you have to be carefulThe Buddha taught stage by stage to visit the cemetery at intervals or in steps and to contemplate it at intervals in keeping with your capabilitiesHe wouldnt have you go storming right in for that wouldnt be fittingHe taught all the stepsDont be in a hurry to contemplate a corpse that hasnt fallen apart or been bitten a corpse that is still new and hasnt swollen or grown foulDont be in a hurry to approach such a corpseAnd be especially careful with a corpse of the opposite sex  thats what he said  until the mind is capable enough in its contemplationThen you can contemplate anythingOnce weve contemplated death outside until we gain clear evidence we then turn inward to contemplate the death in our own body until we catch on to the principle within the mindThen the external cemetery gradually becomes unnecessary because weve caught on to the principle within ourselves and dont need to rely on anything outsideWe contemplate our body to see it as a cemetery just like the external cemetery both while its alive and after it diesWe can compare each aspect with the outside and the mind gradually runs out of problems of its own accordThe practice of not lying down This is simply a way of training ourselves to make a great effortIt doesnt mean that we take notlyingdown as a constant practiceWe may resolve for example not to lie down tonight as our ascetic practiceThis is a practice to be observed on occasion  or you might resolve not to lie down for two or three nights running depending on the resolution you makeThe practice of living in whatever dwelling is assigned to one This is another ascetic practiceTheyre all ways of getting monks to subdue the defilement of forgetting oneselfA monk who observes the ascetic practices well who is solid in his observance of them is one who is solid in his practice truly intent on the Dhamma truly intent on subduing defilementHes not a person ordained to do nothing or who forgets himselfAll thirteen ascetic practices are tools for subduing the defilements of those who follow themTheres nothing about them that anyone can criticize  except for Devadatta and his gangA monk who doesnt observe any of these practices is an empty monk who forgets himself who has nothing but the outside status of a monkHe wraps himself in a yellow robe calls himself venerable  and becomes haughty as a resultEven more so when hes given ecclesiastical rank If the heart is taken with that sort of thing itll have to get excited over its shadow without any need for backup music to get it goingThe mind gets itself going through the power of the clay on its head thinking that it has a crestSince when has this defilement ever been willing to yield to anyonePeople of this sort forget all the affairs of monks and become part of the world  going even further than the worldRank is given for the sake of encouraging good practice and conduct but if the mind becomes haughty rank becomes a way of destroying oneself killing oneself with various assumptionsThe King bestows ranks and names this and that and we assume them to be a crestActually theyre just a bit of clay stuck on our head not a natural crestIf you want a natural crest then follow the practice wellWhat could be finer than to be venerable in line with the principles of natureThe word venerable means excellent so why be enthralled with dolls and clayTo be venerable doesnt mean that just our name is excellentWe have to be excellent in our practice and conduct in line with such principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya as the ascetic practicesIf were solid in the ascetic practices well gradually become excellent people in line with the principles of our practice and ultimately in line with the principles of nature  excellent not just in name but through the nature of a mind made spotless and pureA name can be established any old dayYou can even build it up to the sky if you wantThey establish names just to flatter one another as a matter of customThis is an affair of the worldThey keep conferring titles on one anotherThose who confer the titles have good intentions so we have to repay those good intentions by setting our hearts on the practice in line with the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya and on observing our duties as monks to the fullThis is in keeping with their purpose in conferring titles so as to encourage monks to be goodAt any rate dont take the conferring of titles Dont take the title and use it to destroy yourself with pride and conceitThe highest perfection in line with natural principles with no need to confer titles is to practice wellObserve the precepts wellDont violate or overstep themMake the mind still and calm with meditationWhichever theme you focus on be earnest and mindful with itWhen you investigate investigate right on down so as to give rise to astutenessAnalyze the properties the khandhas and the sense media so as to see them as they are in line with their reality as Ive already explained many timesWhat are the propertiesThe four physical properties earth water wind and fireThese are the primal properties the things that exist originally and get combined until a mind comes in and lays claim to ownership so that theyre called a living being or an individual even though the various parts are just physical properties in line with their natural principlesNo matter who confers titles on them as being a living being or an individual or whatever they dont turn into thatThey remain physical properties as they originally wereWe should come to know this with our own discernment through investigatingThe sense media or connections There are internal sense media and external onesThe internal ones are the eyes ears nose tongue body and mindThe external ones are sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas that make contact with the internal sense media giving rise to cognition and then to all sorts of assumptions most of which go off in the wrong directionsWe should analyze these things so as to see them wellThis is called vipassana which means seeing clearly  knowing clearly and seeing truly not knowing in counterfeit or illusory waysSo we should perform our duties correctly and to the fullOur heart is always hoping to depend on us because it cant get by on its ownIts been oppressed and coerced by greed anger and delusion all along which is why its always calling for our helpSo what can we use to help this heart that is always oppressed and coerced so as to release it from danger if we dont use our practice of concentration discernment conviction and persistence as a means of advancing and uprooting so as to help it escape from the danger of the things that coerce itAt present weve come to strip off the danger in the heartWe must try every way we can to remove itThe main principle in the practice is to have the solidity  the heart  of a warrior ready to die in the battle of washing the world out of the heartIf we dont gain victory were prepared to die offering our life in homage to the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaDont retreat in defeat or youll lose face and the defilements will taunt you for a long time to comeYou wont be able to stand your feelings of inadequacy and embarrassment in the face of the cycle of defilementWhichever world you go to there will be nothing but defilements trailing you and taunting you What are you looking for being born and bearing this mass of suffering you goodfornothing person youWhenever we fight you lose miserably every timeYouve never had the word victory at all Listen to that fighters for the sake of completing the holy lifeDo the taunts of the defilements stingI myself would be stung to the quickEven if I died I wouldnt forgetSo how do we feelAre we spurred on to fight with them by giving our livesOur Buddha was a noble warrior to the last inchHis every movement was bravery in the fight with defilement without retreat to the point where the defilements were annihilated and he became the Teacher of the world to whom we pay homage up to the presentThe footprints of his practice are still fresh in every word every phrase of the welltaught Dhamma which hasnt been corrupted or effacedSo hold to him as a principle in the heart a principle in the practice until you have no breath left to breatheDont let him goThe land of victory when all the defilements fall back in defeat You dont have to ask about itYoull know it on your own through the Dhamma immediately apparent to every person who practices to that pointThe Buddha didnt lay any exclusive claims on it but bestowed it as the wealth of every person who practices in dignity in the midst of this world of inconstancy stress and notselfWhen the khandhas no longer carry on we will attain full anupadisesanibbana with nothing more to worry aboutThe Dhamma is something secure and completeOn the side of its causes its a Dhamma right for remedying and removing defilement of every sortTheres no defilement that lies above this Dhamma at allThe Buddha taught it rightly in every way in every facet for remedying defilement of every sortNothing excels this Dhamma  in particular the Dhamma of the middle way which is summarized as virtue concentration and discernmentThis is the Dhamma of causes the methods with which we should train ourselves and which the Buddha taught us in fullAs for the Dhamma of results it comes in stagesThe mind is solid and doesnt stray or lean in line with its preoccupationsIt has stillness and calm This is the mind centered in concentrationThe mind is courageous and capable astute and aware allaround in terms of the things that become involved with it both within and without This is the mind with discernmentAnd when its even more astute and refined than that to the point of being astute allaround and attaining release then the entire mind is DhammaIn other words the mind is the Dhamma the Dhamma is the mind  oneness  without any adversaries paired with it as beforeMy own impression  and whether Im right or wrong please decide for yourselves  but Im certain that the Dhamma of the doctrine the teaching of the Buddha refers for the most part to causesThe Buddha explained the causes the practices to follow so as to remedy and remove defilement or to develop the various forms of goodnessThe results are happinessThe teachings are simply directions showing the wayAs for the genuine Dhamma appearing from the practice whether or not we give it names its a Dhamma in the principles of natureIts Dhamma that we cant easily reach to touchThis is the Dhamma thats said to exist with the world at all timesAs for the Dhamma of the doctrine taught by the Buddhas this can disappear from time to time as has happened with each of the long line of Buddhas who have gained AwakeningThis in itself shows the inconstancy of the Dhamma of the doctrine for us to see clearly  unlike the Dhamma in the principles of nature which has existed from the very beginning and has no involvement with inconstancy stress or notself in any way that would give rise to that Dhamma or make it endThe tactics given by each of the Buddhas to the world are called the Dhamma of the doctrineThese arent the genuine DhammaTheyre tactics  different offshoots  actions and modes displayed by the genuine Dhamma means for letting go and striving teaching us to let go teaching us to strive using various methods saying that the results will be like this or thatAs for the genuine Dhamma of results in the principles of nature thats something to be known exclusively in the heart of the person who practicesThis Dhamma cant really be described correctly in line with its truthWe can only talk around itAnd particularly with release This cant be correctly described at all because its beyond all conventions and speculationsIt cant be describedEven though we may know it with our full heart we cant describe itLike describing the flavor and fullness that come from eating Even though eating is something in the realm of conventional reality that can be described and though we all have savored the flavor and eaten our fill still we cant describe these things at all in line with their truthThe Dhamma that cant be described Thats the genuine DhammaIt doesnt have the word vanishes or disappears  simply that the world cant reach in to know it and touch itAs for annihilating this Dhamma it cant be annihilatedWhen we practice in line with the tactics given by each of the Buddhas we can touch it and become aware of itThe heart becomes an awareness of the Dhamma a right and fitting vessel for the Dhamma  and there is no vessel more appropriate for receiving each level of the Dhamma than the heartWhen it enters into the Dhamma in full measure the heart becomes one with the DhammaThe heart is the DhammaThe Dhamma is the heartOnenessThere is nothing but oneness not becoming two with anything elseThis Dhamma of oneness Our ability to reach and to know it depends on our individual practiceIt doesnt depend on the time or place or on anyone elseThe important point is simply that our practice be right and appropriateIt will foster the mind in making contact with the Dhamma step by step to the highest stepSo we should be intent and make determination the basis for our practiceDont forget the phrase Buddham saranam gacchami  I go to the Buddha for refuge  as I have already explained it to youDhammam saranam gacchami  I go to the Dhamma for refugeThis I have also explainedSangham saranam gacchami  I go to the Sangha for refugeDont forget the ways in which the Noble Disciples practicedVirtually all of them went through hardships to the brink of death before becoming our Sangham saranam gacchamiIts not the case that they were spoonfed while we practice with hardship and difficulties to the brink of deathThats not the case at allThey went through difficulties just like ours  or far greater than ours  before becoming our Sangham saranam gacchamiThey came from all levels of society some from royal families and noble families leading a very delicate lifeThey had the ranks of kings courtiers and financiers all the way down to ordinary farmers and slavesComing from different classes of society  and some of them having lived in comfort in their homes  when they went forth to practice they had to train and fit their thoughts words and deeds into a single mould the mould of the sons of the SakyanSo why wouldnt they have had troubleWhy wouldnt they have had difficultiesThe way they ate in their homes was one thing when they went forth to become monks they had to ask others for almsInstead of getting to eat this they got thatInstead of getting hot food they got cold foodInstead of getting to eat a lot they got just a little not in keeping with their wantsSo how wasnt this difficultIt had to be difficultBut after they had finished eating the important thing was training the mind to subdue defilementDefilement has been the adversary the foremost opponent of the Dhamma within the heart all alongThere is no adversary stronger smarter or trickier than the defilements that have held power over the hearts of living beings for so longFor this reason we have to produce enough mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence to subdue defilementOtherwise well be deficient in the fightTo be deficient in the fight is no good at allIts sure to make us deficient in the results well obtainSo the production of mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence to be appropriate for subduing defilement of every sort step by step is the path of victory for the meditator who is to gain complete results who will one day be free and independent for sureVirtually all of the Noble Disciples practiced in this way until reaching releaseThey gained release from suffering through struggle before becoming our saranam gacchamiSo dont forgetOur refuges  Sangha saranam gacchami  werent spoonfed peopleThey were people who struggled to the brink of death just like usThink of them and hold to them as examplesDont take the diddlyshit affairs of the world which have no value or standards as the principles in your heart or youll become irresolute and good for nothing unable to find any goodness any release from stress any happiness or prosperity any standards at all to your dying dayWhen this is the case fullness and satisfaction in your work and in the results of your work wont exist in your heartSo be intent on practicingThe Dhamma of the Buddha is always shining newDont forget that its always shining newMajjhima patipada  the middle way  is a shiningnew Dhamma not tarnished shabby or worn out like objects weve used for a long timeMajjhima means right in the middle  the Dhamma that has been appropriate for curing defilements of every sort all alongUltimately it becomes majjhima in the principles of nature because it has cured defilement and brought release within the mindThe mind becomes a majjhima mind always even within itselfSo dont take anyone as your model more than the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaBy and large the mind tends to take lowly things as its model which is why we have to say Dont take anyone as your model other than the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha The meditation masters who have practiced rightly appropriately and well as a good example for us who aim at studying with them They too derived their model from the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaIf we get weak or discouraged we should reflect on the cemeteries of birth and death that will burn us forever Is there anything good about themThe struggle involved in the effort of the practice even though it involves hardship is a means of cutting back on our becoming and birthMore than that it completely eliminates becoming and birth which are a massive heap of stress from the heart so that we can freely pass by and gain releaseThere are none of the various sorts of defilement  even the most subtle  infiltrating or coercing such a heartThis is what it means to be free in every way above the world of rebirth  which is a conventional reality  through the power of our persistent endeavorFor this reason we should take persistence endeavor and effort as our basis for victory or as our basis for the practiceWe are then sure one day of attaining release from suffering and stressNo one has the power to coerce us or decide our scoreWe are the ones wholl decide our score for ourselvesVery well thenThats all Ill discuss for nowThe way of practice that follows the aims of the Buddha and the true Dhamma is to be truly intent on acting rightlyEvery sort of duty that is ours to do should be done intentlyWhen doing a task of any sort even a small one if we lack intentness it wont get finished in a presentable way at all because intentness  which is a matter of mindfulness and principles in the heart that can bring a task to completion  is lacking in ourselves and in our workTo have mindfulness and principles of the heart in ourselves and in our work is in and of itself to be making the effort of the practice regardless of whether the work is internal or externalIf a person lacks intentness as a means of keeping his work in focus then even if he is a craftsman capable of making things solid and beautiful his lack of intentness will reduce the quality and beauty of his workFor this reason intentness and concentration are important factors that shouldnt be overlooked by those who aim at full results in their workWe have gone forth from the household lifeWere meditatorsWe should display intentness in our every duty and be deliberate in our every taskEven when we sweep the monastery compound clean our quarters and the meeting hall set out sitting mats and drinking water in all our movements comings and going even when looking right and glancing left we should be mindful at every momentThis is what it means to be making the effort of the practiceIn developing the habit of mindfulness we have to use our work as our training groundEvery external task of every sort is a dutyWalking meditation and sitting meditation are dutiesIf were mindful in doing our duties it means that our effort in the practice hasnt lapsedTo train ourselves in the habits of those who are intent on the higher levels of Dhamma we must begin  with urgency  by training ourselves to be mindful in every task of every sort from the very beginningFor the sake of the certainty and stability of your future develop mindfulness as a habit from this moment onward until you have it constantly present within you every moment you act and every moment you restWhen the time comes to make the mind still mindfulness will come to stick close by the heart and be established as soon as you make the effort just as you want it toAt the same time your mindfulness will have enough strength to force the mind into stillness at willFor the most part when people are unable to make their minds still as they like its because mindfulness which is the primary factor isnt strong enough and so the mind easily finds the opening to slip out after other preoccupations  like an inquisitive child who has no one to watch over him and who can thus get into danger any time at allThe mind thats always carried away without any mindfulness to look after it is thus always getting disturbed to the point where it can never find any stillness and peaceThe guardians of the mind are mindfulness and discernment which continually watch over it all the time it is thinking about various issues and which continually try to reason with the mind to free it from the issues that come to involve itWhen the mind is constantly hearing the logic of its discernment it will be unable to disobey its discernment by thinking about and becoming attached to any issues any longerTo train mindfulness and discernment to become progressively stronger and not to deteriorate please train them in the method already mentionedDont let yourself be careless in any useful activity of any sort no matter how smallOtherwise the carelessness thats already the lord of the heart will become a chronic disease taking deep root in the heart ruining every aspect of your practiceTry to train yourself in the habit of being dependable and intent in your proper activities within and without at all timesDont let carelessness or negligence incubate in your character at all because people who have trained themselves in the habit of being true to their every duty are sure to be able to succeed in every sort of activity whether inner or outer without any obstacle to thwart themEven when they train their hearts which is the important job within they are sure to succeed with circumspection in such a way that they will find nothing with which they can fault themselves  because outer activities and inner activities both point to the same heart in charge of themIf the heart is habitually careless then when it takes charge of any inner task its bound to ruin the task without leaving even a scrap for itself to take as its refugeSo for a bright future in the tasks that form your livelihood and source of happiness you should train yourself in the habit of being dependable and true in your dutiesPerform each task to the utmost of your abilityThen when you turn inward to perform your inner work for the sake of stillness or for the sake of discernment and discovery you will be able to perform both sorts of work with precision and circumspection because of the habits you have developed in training yourself to be true and circumspect all alongTo follow the practice from the beginning to the highest level depends mainly on your basic habitsThe beginning of the practice and the end both refer to the one heart whose condition of awareness will develop when its modified by the Dhamma both in terms of causes  the striving of the practice  and in terms of the results or happiness just as a child gradually develops from infancy to adulthood when nourished by food and all sorts of other factorsThe beginning of the practice thus refers to the training of the mind in the beginning stages so as to change its habits and sensibilities making them reasonable and right until it is knowledgeable and can maintain itself without any deviations from the reasonability and rightness appropriate to itBut when we come right down to it the beginning and end of the practice are like a piece of fruit We cant say exactly where it begins and where it endsWhen we look at it its simply a piece of fruitThe same sort of thing holds true with the mindWe talk about the beginning or the end of the practice in the sense that the mind has its various preoccupations coarse and refined mixed in with itIn modifying them we have to keep coming up with new techniques changing those preoccupations from their original state to more and more refined levels that should be called where suitable the beginning or the end of the pathThose of you listening should make yourselves reach this sort of understanding of the defilements and evil qualities in the heart that are given such a variety of names that they can go beyond the bounds of what the suppositions of a single mind can keep track of and resolveOtherwise you wont have any techniques for curing yourselves of the condition just mentionedLet me stress once more the principle that guarantees sure results Train yourself in the habit of being solid and true in your work and duties at all timesDont be unsteady uncertain or undependableIf you say youll go goIf you say youll stay stayIf you say youll do something do itOnce youve settled on a time or a task keep to itBe the sort of person who writes with his hand and erases with his handDont be the sort who writes with his hand and erases with his footIn other words once weve made a vow no one else can come in and destroy that vow and yet we ourselves are the ones who destroy it This is what is meant by writing with the hand and erasing with the foot which is something very unseemlyWe have to be true to our plans and always decisiveOnce weve determined that a particular task is worthwhile and right we should give our life to that task and to our determinationThis way well become dependable and selfreliantThe virtues we are maintaining will become dependable virtues and wont turn into virtues floating in the windOur practice of concentration will become dependable concentration on every level and wont turn into concentration floating in the wind ie concentration only in name but without the actuality of concentration in the heartAnd when we develop each level of discernment it will be dependable discernment in keeping with the truthfulness of our character and wont turn into discernment floating in the wind ie discernment only in name but without any ingenuity in freeing ourselvesWhat Ive said so far is so that you will see the drawbacks of being undependable and desultory without any inner truthfulness and so that if you hope for genuine progress in terms of the world and the Dhamma youll look for a way to give these things a wide berthNow Id like to say more about mindfulness and discernment the factors that can make your character more stable and circumspectYou should always be aware that discernment isnt something that you can cook up like foodIt comes from considering things carefullyA person without discernment is unable to complete his tasks with any sort of finesse and unable to protect his valuables  in the sense of the world or of the Dhamma  from dangerFor this reason the important factors in maintaining and practicing the teachings of the religion are mindfulness and discernmentWhenever an event whether good or bad makes contact with the mind mindfulness and discernment should take it up immediatelyThis way you can be alert to good and bad events in time and can prevent the heart from straying after things that will harm itFor the most part whenever an issue arises whether its sudden or not the heart can be swayed or harmed in line with that issue because it lacks the mindfulness and discernment to observe and inspect things carefully beforehandIt then sees everything as worth pursuing and so you let the mind follow along with things without your being aware of itBy the time you realize what has happened time has been wasted and its too late to put a stop to the mind so you let things follow their own course until they all turn to ashes without any way of being remediedDont think that this comes from anything other than a lack of the mindfulness and discernment that can lead out to freedomIf not for this who would be willing to sacrifice his or her own worth  with a value above that of anything else in the world  for the sake of this sort of failureYet its unavoidable and we have to give in  all of us  for when the chips are down its normal that mindfulness will lapse and we wont be able to latch onto anything in timeWell then let things follow their own course in line with the force of events too strong for the mind to withstandThus it is only right that we should prepare ourselves from this moment onward to be ready for the events that lie in wait around us within and without and are ready to strike at any time or placeEven though its still morning dont let yourself delayTo be prepared is to strive to have a firm basis both within and without for your living and dyingWhether you live here or there whether death will happen here or there whether you live in this world or the next or whether youre coming to this world or going to the next you should prepare yourself beginning now in the immediate presentOtherwise when life is up you wont be able to prepare anything in timeIve never seen any Teachers Dhamma that says to prepare yourself tomorrow or next month or next year or in the next life which would simply encourage people to be complacentIve seen the Dhamma say only that you should make yourself a refuge both within and without right now while youre aliveEven though days nights months and years this world and the next are always present in the cosmos theyre not for worthless people who are born and die in vain without doing anything of any benefit to the world or the Dhamma at allIn particular now that we are monks and meditators  which is a peaceful way of life a way of life that the world trusts and respects a way of life that more than any other in the world gives us the opportunity to do good for ourselves and others  we should be fully prepared in our affairs as monks and shouldnt let ourselves be lackingFor our behavior as monks to be gracious in a way pleasing and inspiring to others we must use mindfulness and discernment as our guardians looking after our every movementA person with mindfulness and discernment looking after his behavior is gracious within and without and maintains that graciousness in a way that never loses its appeal at any timeWhen we use mindfulness and discernment to straighten out things within us  namely the mind and its mess of preoccupations  the mind immediately becomes clean clear and a thing of valueRemember the Dhamma you have studied and heard and bring it inward to blend with your practice and to support itKeep your mindfulness and discernment right with the heart and with your every movementWherever the eye looks or the ear listens mindfulness and discernment should follow them thereWhatever the tongue nose and body come into contact with  no matter how good or bad coarse or refined  mindfulness and discernment should keep track of those things and pry intelligently into their causes every time theres a contactEven when ideas occur in the mind itself mindfulness and discernment must keep track and investigate them without break  because those who have gained release from the world of entanglements in the heart have all acted in this wayThey have never acted like logs thrown away on the ground where children can climb up to urinate and defecate on them day and nightIf anyone acts like a log defilements and cravings from the various directions  namely from sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations  will come in through the openings of the eyes ears nose tongue and body to urinate and defecate on the heart that is making itself into a log because it doesnt have any intelligence or circumspection with regard to its inner and outer preoccupationsIt simply lets cravings and defilements urinate and defecate on it day and nightThis isnt at all fitting for those who aim at freedom from the cycle  ie who aim at nibbana  because the nibbana of the Buddha and his disciples is not a lazy nibbana or a logs nibbanaThose who want the Buddhas nibbana in their hearts must try to conform to the tracks left by the practice of the Buddha and his disciplesIn other words they must make an effort to develop mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence to keep abreast of the events occurring within and without at all timesDont act like a log simply going through the motions of walking sitting meditating sitting like a stump in the middle of a field without any sense of circumspection in the heartThis sort of going through the motions isnt any different from the way people in general normally actTo be a disciple of the Tathagata whose fame has spread throughout the three levels of the cosmos you should try to revive the mindfulness and discernment lying dormant in the heart so that they can support your efforts in extracting all the various defilements and cravings coming from the heart that at the moment is like a logGreed anger delusion laziness discontent jealousy possessiveness All of these things are excrement piled on the heartOnce mindfulness and discernment have been trained as we have mentioned they will become stronger day by day more and more accustomed to working in the same way that we get accustomed to other forms of workWhen we bring them to bear on the effort of the practice within the heart they will be able to understand the affairs of the heart in due time without taking longIn order to be principled and methodical in your training keep your awareness constantly with the bodyKeep mindfulness focused there and use discernment to investigate within the sphere of the bodyTo do this is to follow the principles of the frames of reference and the Noble Truths which form the path of all the Noble OnesThere are four frames of reference the body feelings the mind and phenomenaThe body refers to every part of the bodyThis is termed kayanupassana satipatthanaFeelings refers to pleasure pain and indifferenceThis is termed vedananupassana satipatthanaThe mind refers to the mental states that are fashioned by the mind and color itThis is termed cittanupassana satipatthanaPhenomena refers to anything material or mental that is the object or focal point of the minds investigationThis is termed dhammanupassana satipatthanaIn investigating the four frames of reference be sure to come to a right understanding from the outset that body feelings mind and phenomena as frames of reference are a class separate from the mind that possesses them as frames of referenceOtherwise youll get discouraged or upset when they exhibit change as part of their normal nature or as a result of the investigation which is something that may happen in the course of the practiceIn other words these four factors normally undergo change that can give rise to pleasure or displeasureWhen we are investigating them they continue to undergo change which can make the meditator pleased or displeased or sometimes even discouraged and fed up with the investigationI mention this so that youll be forewarned when it happens and will make yourself understand with circumspection that the mind in charge of the frames of reference hasnt changed along with its frame of reference in any wayOnce you have come to a right understanding you can become confident in your investigation of the frames of referenceNo matter which frame of reference  body feelings mind or phenomena  exhibits change or disappears the heart  a phenomenon that doesnt change or die  will be able to investigate to the full extent of its strength and come to a clear comprehension of these four factors step by step without being affected by the pleasures and pains in the body and mind which are the conditions exhibited by the frames of referenceIn investigating the body you can deal either with the internal body or with external bodies depending on the situation and what comes easiest to the heartThe internal body refers to every part of your own bodyExternal bodies refers to the bodies of other people and animalsThe body within the body refers to any one part of the bodyAll of these things will show themselves to be disgusting and dismaying to the person who uses discernment to investigate them and know them as they actually areInside and out both the internal body and external bodies all share in the same characteristicsThey always have to be washed and cleaned  and thus the care of the body is a constant duty for everyone in the worldThe things that are used to care for the body to keep it alive and presentable are thus the bestselling merchandise all over the worldThe investigation of the body so as to see clearly with discernment into its origins needs and behavior is thus a means of cutting off a wellspring of worries and stress in the heart  because even a huge mountain of solid rock reaching to the clouds would never weigh on the heart causing it any stress but the khandhas  such as the physical khandha or body  oppress and weigh on the heart at all times to the point where we can find no chance to put them downThe affairs of stress that are related to the khandhas thus converge on the heart responsible for themFor this reason the mind in charge of the khandhas should gain an allaround understanding of the khandhas both in their good and their bad aspects so as to manage them smoothly and comfortably and not always be abused by themNormally the khandhas take advantage of us all day longEvery move we make is for their sakeIf the mind can find a way out by becoming wise to its khandhas  even while it is still responsible for them  it can then be in a position to contend with them and wont have to take on all their stresses and painsAt the same time the stresses and pains in the khandhas wont set up shop to sell us all their sufferingThus those who investigate the khandhas so as to see their benefits and drawbacks with discernment arent destined to take on pain and nothing but pain from the khandhasThey are sure to find a way to reduce and relieve the tensions and strains in their heartsIn investigating the body you have to investigate it repeatedly time and again  as required for your understanding and not as determined by your laziness  until you really see clearly that the body is nothing but a body and is in no way a being a person ones self or anotherThis is called the contemplation of the body as a frame of referenceAs for feelings the mind and phenomena you should realize that they are all present in this same body but their characteristics are somewhat different which is why they are given different namesMake sure that you understand this point wellOtherwise the four frames of reference and the four Noble Truths will turn into a cause of stress  a source of worries and doubts  while you are practicing because of your confusion about where these phenomena begin and endAs for feelings there are three pleasure pain and indifference  neither pleasure nor painFeelings coming from the body and those coming from the mind have these same three sortsTo investigate them you should ferret them out and examine them in line with their characteristics but dont take the body to be a feelingLet the body be the bodyLet the feeling be a feeling  in the same way as seeing a tiger as a tiger and an elephant as an elephantDont take the tiger to be an elephant or else your evidence wont be in line with the truth and the issue will spread until it can never be resolvedIn other words ferret out and investigate the feeling displaying itself in the present moment so as to see how it arises how it takes a stance and how it disbandsThe bases for the arising of all three kinds of feeling are the body and mind but the feelings themselves arent the body nor are they the mindThey keep on being feelings both in their arising and in their disbandingDont understand them as being anything else or youll be understanding them wronglyThe cause of stress will arise in that moment and you wont be able to find any way to remedy or escape from itYour investigation instead of leading to the discernment that will release you from stress and its cause will turn into a factory producing stress and its cause at that moment without your realizing itThe way feelings behave is to arise take a stance and disbandThats all there is to them every timeAnd theres no being person our self or another to them at allAs soon as we invest them with the ideas of being or person they will appear in terms of beings and persons which are the powers giving rise to the cause of stress in that moment and well immediately be intensifying stressMeditators should thus use their discernment to be circumspect in dealing with feelingsIf you dont take feelings to be yourself while you are investigating them all three sorts of feelings will appear clearly as they truly are in line with the principles of the frames of reference and the Noble TruthsNo matter how these feelings may change for good or bad it will be a means of fostering the discernment of the person investigating them each moment they exhibit movement and changeThe notions of being person our self or another wont have an opening by which to slip into these three sorts of feelings at allThere will be just what appears there feelings as nothing but feelingsNo sense of sorrow discontent discouragement infatuation or pride will be able to arise in any way while these three sorts of feelings are displaying their behavior because we have come to a proper understanding of them  and all the time that we as meditators have a proper understanding of feelings while they are arising we are said to have the contemplation of feelings as a frame of reference in the heartThe mind as a frame of reference is not a level of mind different or apart from the other three frames of reference which is why it is termed a frame of reference just like the body feelings and phenomenaIf we were to make a comparison with timber the mind on this level is like an entire tree complete with branches bark softwood roots and rootlets which is different from the timber put to use to the point where it has become a houseTo contemplate the mind as a frame of reference is thus like taking a tree and cutting it up into timber as you wantTo investigate the mind on this level we should focus on the thoughtformations of the mind as the target or topic of our investigation because these are the important factors that will enable us to know the defilement or radiance of the mindIf we dont know them then even if the mind suffers defilement and stress all day long we wont have any way of knowingIf we want to know the mind we must first understand the thoughtformations that condition the mind in the same way that seasonings give various flavors to foodThe fact that the mind displays such an infinite variety of forms becoming so changed from its original state as to bewilder itself not knowing the reason and how to cure it giving in to events with no sense of good or evil right or wrong is all because of the thoughtformations that condition itFor this reason the mind as a frame of reference is a mind entangled with its preoccupations and conditioned by its thoughtformationsThe investigation of thoughtformations is thus related to the mind because they are things interrelated by their very natureIf we understand thoughtformations we will begin to understand the mind and if we understand the mind we will understand more about thoughtformations  starting with thoughtformations from the blatant to the intermediate and subtle levels and the mind from the blatant to the intermediate and subtle levelsThese levels of thoughtformations and the mind come from the fact that the mind can become involved with blatant intermediate or subtle preoccupationsPeople contemplating the mind as a frame of reference should thus make themselves understand from the very outset that the mind and its conditions or thoughtformations are two different sorts of thingsThey arent one and the sameOtherwise the mind and its thoughtformations will become entangled and this will complicate the investigation as I have already explainedThe point to focus on is the arising and involvement of thoughtformations  what preoccupations they touch on  as well as their disbanding together with the disbanding of their preoccupationsTry to observe and keep track of the movements of these thoughtformations that come out from the mind to focus on preoccupations of the past or future both blatant and subtleAlways be aware that thoughtformations and preoccupations of every sort that are interrelated must arise and disband togetherThey cant be made to behave otherwiseThus the notions of being person self or other shouldnt be brought in to refer to the mind because they will immediately turn into a cause of stressTry to observe until you see this in the course of the investigation and you will see as the Buddha taught that the mind is simply a mind and nothing else  not a being a person self other or whateverWhen we contemplate the mind in this way the heart will not be upset or infatuated with the fashionings and conditions the pleasures and pains of the mindThis is what it means to have the mind as a frame of referencePhenomena as a frame of reference covers anything that serves as a focal point of the heartOn the refined level it refers to the heart itselfExternal phenomena are of many kindsInternal phenomena include every part of the body all three kinds of feelings and the mind on the level of a frame of referenceAll of this is included in the contemplation of phenomena as a frame of referenceThe contemplation of the body feelings and mind together  all four frames of reference at once  is from the standpoint of forest Dhamma the contemplation of phenomena as a frame of referenceIf this is in any way wrong due to my lack of skill in understanding and explaining the matter I ask forgiveness of all my listeners and readers because I always feel at a loss every time I mention the topic of forest Dhamma in any of my talks or writingsFor this reason I ask that my readers when reading about forest Dhamma try to cultivate a fairly open mind toward every passage so that they wont get upset while they are readingWhen in the course of the investigation the four frames of reference are brought together in the contemplation of phenomena so that they become a single level of Dhamma this is a point in the practice more amazing and unexpected than anything that has gone beforeThis is because in the beginning steps of the investigation the body is like a piece of wood in the raw stateFeelings are in a raw stateThe mind is in a raw stateEven phenomena are in a raw state because the investigation itself is like a piece of wood in the raw state so that the things investigated are all in the same stateBut when we plane and polish things with the effort of the practice everything in the area of the practice gradually changes its conditionWhat I have mentioned here concerning the contemplation of phenomena as a frame of reference is a fairly refined level of Dhamma so we cant help but be grateful for the groundwork laid during the raw state of the investigation on the beginning levelsWhen we investigate phenomena in the final stages if feels very different from the beginning stages even though they are the same four frames of referenceWhen we reach the final stages it appears to the mind that all four frames of reference  body feelings mind and phenomena  connect so that they all come under contemplation of phenomena as a frame of referenceThey converge completely so that there is no sense that this is the body thats a feeling this is the mind thats a phenomenonThey all seem to come together on a single level of DhammaIn dealing with the body feelings and mind Ive given a fairly adequate explanation of the methods of investigation for remedying and freeing the mind but now that we come to the topic of phenomena the discussion seems to have dealt entirely with my own experiencesNevertheless I hope that you will approach it with the attitude Ive just mentioned and put it into practice in a way suited to your own temperamentThe results are sure to come out directly in line with what Ive explained to youTo summarize the four frames of reference There is the body which covers the internal body external bodies and the body within the bodyThere are feelings  internal feelings external feelings and feelings within feelingsThere is the mind  the inner mind the outer mind and the mind within the mindThe inner mind refers to mental states that deal with preoccupations exclusively within the mindThe outer mind refers to mental states involved with external preoccupationsThe mind within the mind refers to any single mental current out of the many mental currents that come out of the heartAnd then there are phenomena  inner phenomena outer phenomena and phenomena within phenomenaInner phenomena are the refined states or preoccupations that are objects or focal points of the mind and also the mind itself which is the converging point of all mental objectsOuter phenomena refers to every kind of external condition capable of being an object of the mindPhenomena within phenomena refers to any single condition out of the many conditions that are the focal points of the mindThus the terms body within the body feelings within feelings the mind within the mind and phenomena within phenomena refer to any single part or instance of these thingsFor example any one hair out of the many hairs on the head any one tooth out of the many teeth we have These are termed the body within the bodyA person investigating any one part of the body in general is said to be contemplating the body within the bodyThe same holds true for feelings mind and phenomena but I wont go into detail on this point for fear that we wont have enough timeLets save it for a later dateThe four frames of reference from the point of view of forest Dhamma are present in full measure in our own bodies and mindsThis doesnt mean though that their external aspects are irrelevantThis is a point you will see clearly when you work at the frames of reference until you can connect them entirely on the level of contemplation of phenomenaThe mind wont feel compelled to search for anything external to help in its practiceSimply investigating exclusively in the area of the body and mind using the four frames of reference complete in the body and mind will be enough to cure it of its problemsOn the beginning level though everything internal and external is relevantBut as you reach the stage of letting go step by step those various conditions will lose their relevanceEven the body feelings mind and phenomena which are the necessary terms of the frames of reference have to be let goThey shouldnt be held to or borne as a burden on the heartThey must all be let go when your investigation fully reaches the point of dhamma anatta Phenomena are notselfThen later you can turn around to contemplate and connect them again as a pastime for the mind in the present once the mind has gone beyond and yet is still in charge of the khandhasMeditators if they are firm and unflinching in the practice of the frames of reference are sure to see a variety of extraordinary and amazing things arising at intervals in their mindsWhen the time comes to reap the results on the level of Dhamma corresponding to the causes that have been properly developed the results will have to appear stage by stage as the attainment of streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantshipThere is no need to doubt thisSo know that whether we contemplate the four frames of reference or the four Noble Truths they are one and the same path for the sake of release from suffering and stressEven though there may be some differences they differ only in nameIn terms of their basic principles they are one and the sameThose who work at the four frames of reference and those who work at the four Noble Truths are performing the same branch of work because stress its cause its disbanding and the path to its disbanding are the same level of truth as the body feelings mind and phenomena  in the same way as when different people do different jobs in a single factory the profits from their labor all go to the same factoryTo summarize the final results that come from working at the frames of reference and the Noble Truths step by step In the beginning the body feelings mind and phenomena are in a raw stateStress its cause its disbanding and the path to its disbanding are in a raw state because the practice is in a raw state of planing and polishing back and forth without any feel for the heaviness or lightness depth or shallowness breadth or narrowness of the Dhamma and without any sense of right or wrong good or bad in the practice because its something we have never done beforeNo one from our greatgrandparents down to our parents and other relatives has ever told us that the frames of reference and Noble Truths are like this or that that they should be put into practice this or that way so as to give results of this or that sort  for they themselves had no way of knowingWhats worse they have taken these excellent frames of reference and Noble Truths and thrown them away underground underwater and into the fire time and againWe are simply their children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren How can we boast that were wise and allknowing in these mattersWe simply have to admit our own ignoranceEven though its true that the frames of reference and Noble Truths have been excellent Dhamma from the very beginning when they reach us they have to start as Dhamma in the raw state because we ourselves are people in the raw stateEven our practice is practice in the raw stateBut as we practice persistently without retreating and as our understanding into the Dhamma and the practice gradually appears bit by bit day by day and slowly begins to take shape our conviction in the teachings of the Buddha grows continually stronger and more deeply rootedThe things that used to be mysterious gradually come to be revealed for what they truly areFor example the four frames of reference and four Noble Truths even though they were always right with us used to be as if buried out of sight without our being aware of themWe listened to monks giving sermons and imagined things to be far away beyond the range of our ears and eyesWe never thought at all to refer these teachings inwardly to ourselves the converging points of the DhammaWhen the monks finished their sermons the results could be summarized as this We dont have the capability of reaching the Dhamma that has been taught because its infinitely deep and exceedingly subtleThe Dhamma explained and we the listeners lie on opposite sides of the world The thought never occurred to us that all of us  teachers and listeners alike  are in the same world of the frames of reference and the four Noble Truths and that the matters explained were entirely our own affairs without the slightest deviationThese sorts of misunderstandings can happen to all of usBut when the truth  such as the frames of reference  starts revealing itself in the course of our practice these teachings turn step by step into a map for the mindWe see the body feelings mind and phenomena as if they were a piece of paper covered with symbols and signs showing us the way to proceed so as to gain release from suffering and stressThe frames of reference and Noble Truths within and without become symbols and signs showing the way for the mind to proceed on all sides as if they were saying Hurry up and follow these arrows showing the way to safetyThe enemy is in a frenzy searching for you right nearby and is waiting in ambush for you everywhereDont be lulled into thinking that any of these places are safeOnly if you hurry through this jungle will you reach safety Our persistence in the practice then grows stronger together with the mindfulness and discernment we have been training by using the frames of reference and Noble Truths as our whetstone and pathThe body feelings mind and phenomena that we used to investigate erratically and unevenly now become Dhamma on a common level and can all be investigated so as to be brought together and subsumed under the level of contemplation of pure phenomenaWhen the mind takes the contemplation of phenomena as its frame of reference until it is skilled and thoroughly sure of itself the contemplation of phenomena turns to deal exclusively with the affairs of the mindAt this stage you could say that the Dhamma becomes the mind or the mind becomes DhammaOnce the mind has entered purely into the contemplation of phenomena then external conditions  sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas together with the senses of sight hearing smell taste feeling and ideation which used to be like a solid mountain of rock obstructing the mind so that it could find no way out  fade away and vanish from the imaginationThe body feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance that were like clouds obscuring the heart are now dispersed bit by bit from their shapes  the suppositions of conventional reality  by the winds of mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence until they fade away to the point where almost nothing is leftWhat is left is simply a vapor arising from the heart This is a level of phenomena that hasnt yet been destroyed but cant display itself openly because strong mindfulness and discernment have it surrounded and are constantly probing after it to destroy it at all timesFinally this level of phenomena  the mind of unawareness  is utterly destroyed by mindfulness and discernment using the truth of dhamma anatta  phenomena are notself  and the teaching that all phenomena are unworthy of attachmentThe notions of being person self or others when they no longer have any conventional suppositions in which to find shelter must now float away of their own accordThe moment that mindfulness and discernment have completed their duties toward the frames of reference a nature that is extraordinary and amazing appears in all its fullnessAll problems are resolved without any chance of continuation because cause and effect between the khandhas and the mind have come to a full and lasting truceEven though they still live together they no longer quarrel the way they used toEach is free in line with its truthThe word yathabhutañanadassana  knowledge and vision of things as they are  in the understanding of forest Dhamma means living with no mistrust between the khandhas and mind the world and the Dhamma the inside and the outThe heart and all things everywhere are no longer enemies as they used to be and the heart can now put all things to their proper usesI ask that all of you as monks and meditators listen to this so that it goes straight to the heart and make an effort until your practice goes straight to the heart as wellAll of this dhamma will appear as a treasure of infinite worth in the hearts of those who are intent and nothing will ever be able to separate them from itThe effort made for an honorable victory like that of the Buddha  a victory unmatched by anything else in the world  is the effort to take victory over oneself as the Pali saysatta have jitam seyyo It is better to take victory over oneselfThis seems to be enough explanation for the time being so now at the end of this talk I ask that the power of the Triple Gem safeguard and protect each and every one of you so that you meet with ease in body and mind and so that you progress in virtue concentration and discernment until you can overcome all obstacles to the realm of security and peace that is nibbanaHere in this monastery we practice not in line with peoples wishes and opinions but in line for the most part with the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya the principles of the religionWe do this for the sake of the public at large who rely on the religion as a guiding principle in what is good and right and who rely on the good and right behavior of monks and novices the religious leaders for Buddhists at largeFor this reason Im not interested in treating anyone out of a sense of deference over and above the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya that are the basis of the religionIf our minds start to bend under the influence of the views and opinions of any one person or of the majority  who have no limits or standards  then monasteries and the religion will come to have no limits or standardsMonasteries that bend under the influence of the world without any sense of reason as an underlying support will have no order or standards and will become monasteries without any of the substance of the religion remaining in them at allThose who look for things of value to revere and respect  in other words intelligent people  wont be able to find anything good of any substance that will have a hold on their hearts because there will be nothing but worthless and counterfeit things filling the monasteries filling the monks the novices the nuns filling everything everywhereIn homes as well as in monasteries in the area of the world as well as the Dhamma everything will get mixed into being one with what is counterfeit and lacking in any value or worthFor this reason we have to keep things in their separate placesThe religion and the world even though they may dwell together are not the same thingA monastery  whether its located in a village outside of a village or in a forest  is not the same as a villageThe people who come to stay there are not the same as ordinary peopleThe monastery has to be a monasteryThe monks have to be monks with their own independent Dhamma and Vinaya that dont come under or depend on any particular individualThis is an important principle that can have a hold on the hearts of intelligent people who are searching for principles of truth to revere and respect or to be their inspirationI view things from this angle more than from any otherEven the Buddha our Teacher viewed things from this angle as well as we can see from the time he was talking with VenNagitaWhen a crowd of people shouting and making a big racket came to see the Buddha he said Nagita who is that coming our way making a commotion like fishmongers squabbling over fishWe dont aspire to this sort of thing which is a destruction of the religionThe religion is something to guard and preserve so that the world will find peace and calm  like clear clean water wellguarded and preserved so that people in general can use it to drink and bathe at their convenienceThe religion is like clear clean water in this way which is why we dont want anyone to disturb it to make it muddy and turbid This is what the Buddha said to VenNagitaHe then told VenNagita to send the crowd back telling them that their manner and the time of day  it was night  were not appropriate for visiting monks who live in quiet and solitudePolite manners are things that intelligent people choose to use and there are plenty of other times to comeThis is a time when the monks want quiet so they shouldnt be disturbed in a way that wastes their time and causes them difficulties without serving any kind of purpose at allThis is an example set by our TeacherHe wasnt the sort of person to mingle and associate with lay people at all times without any reasonable limits or rules the way things currently are  as if the religion were a distillery and we monks and novices were distributing liquor so that the public could be drunk without ever sobering up for a dayActually the religion is medicine for curing drunkennessMonks and novices are supposed to be doctors for curing their own drunkenness and that of the worldTheyre not supposed to sell liquor and intoxicants to the point where they have no sense of shameWhenever people set foot in the monastery we say that they come in good faith  and so we make allowances and compromises until we forget ourselves forget the Dhamma and Vinaya and forget the good standards of monasteries and monks to the point where we destroy ourselves the monastery and the religion bit by bit day by day and everything turns into mudHomedwellers and monasterydwellers cant find any principles to hold toMonks are full of excrement  ie the worthless things in the monasteries and in the monks and novices themselvesFor this reason each of us who has ordained in the religion should reflect a great deal on these mattersDont see anything as having greater value than the Dhamma and Vinaya which are the major principles for uniting the hearts of Buddhists in confidence conviction and peaceIf the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya are lacking or deficient the benefits received by Buddhists will have to be deficient in turn until there is nothing to which their hearts can holdEven though the teachings of the religion fill the texts and copies of the Canon fill every monastery still the important essence that should be put into practice so that people can be inspired to take this essence into their hearts and put it into practice themselves for the sake of what is beneficial and auspicious doesnt exist  even though the religion still existsThis is something we can clearly see at presentThe important factors that can make the religion prosper and can serve as witnesses to the people who become involved with it for the sake of all things meritorious and auspicious are the monks and novicesIf the monks and novices are intent on behaving in line with the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya as taught by the Buddha they are the ones who will preserve the good pattern of the religion and of the paths fruitions and nibbana without a doubtPeople will be able to take them as their standard  because there are still plenty of intelligent people left in the worldAs for stupid people even though they may overflow the world they have no sure standardsIf they feel pleased they praise youThat praise simply comes out of their stupidity and serves no purposeIf they feel displeased they criticize youThat criticism serves no purpose either for them or for youIf intelligent people praise you though that can be taken to heart and benefits both parties them as well as youIf they praise the Sangha they praise it in line with the principles of the truth and of their intelligenceAt the same time those members of the Sangha who hold to reason can make themselves a field of merit for them as well so that they too can benefitEven if they criticize us they have their reasons that should be taken as food for thoughtThus we who practice should make ourselves well aware of this pointWherever you go dont forget that you are a practitioner of the religion a representative of our Teacher in following the religion and proclaiming it through your practiceThis doesnt mean that you have to teach the public to understand the DhammaEven the practices you follow rightly are a visible example that can make them feel conviction in the religion from what they seeEven more so when you can explain the Dhamma correctly in line with the principles of the practice following the teachings of the Buddha This is all the more the right and proper proclamation of the religion for good people to hold to in their heartsThe religion will come to flourish more and more in the hearts of BuddhistsWherever you go wherever you stay dont forget the basic principles  virtue concentration and discernment  which are the basic principles of our work as contemplativeThese are the essential principles of each monks workThis is where we become sons of the Sakyan of the victorious Buddha disciples of the Tathagata and not when we simply shave our heads and don the yellow robeThats something anyone can do and isnt importantWhats important is behaving in line with our dutiesVirtueWe should be careful to maintain our precepts so that they arent broken or stainedWe should be careful using mindfulness and discernment in our every activityWhatever else may get broken dont let your precepts get broken for they are the invaluable treasure of your status as a monk something on which you can truly stake your lifeConcentrationIf it hasnt yet arisen try to train the heart and bring it under control coming down hard on its unruliness caused by the power of defilement so that you can have it in hand in your efforts with the practiceUse mindfulness and discernment to block its recklessness so that it can settle down in peace and quietThis is our samadhi treasure as monksDiscernment is intelligence and ingenuityDiscernment is of use in all places at all timesBoth in your internal and in your external activities always make use of your discernmentEspecially in your internal activities when youre investigating the various kinds of defilements and mental effluents discernment becomes especially importantDiscernment and mindfulness shouldnt be separatedThey have to perform their duties togetherMindfulness is what keeps watch over the work discernment is doingWhenever mindfulness lapses that work wont accomplish its full aimsFor this reason mindfulness is a necessary quality that must always be kept fastened on your workThese things are our work as contemplativesRemember them and always take them to heartDont be apathetic or youll become a shameless monk callous to the fact that the world is bowing down to you at all timesNow that the Rains Retreat is over well each go our separate ways in line with duty and necessity and the laws of inconstancy stress and notselfThese are things we cant prevent because they are big matters the way of natureEven I myself Im not sure how much longer Ill be able to stay with you all because I lie under the law of inconstancy tooSo while we are still living together I want you to be intent on training yourselves with your full hearts in keeping with the fact that youve come to study to train yourselves and to practiceThe word discernment which I mentioned a moment ago means to investigate and unravel the various factors that become involved with us within and withoutThe body Usually its the body of the opposite sexAs the Dhamma says there is no sight thats a greater enemy to the state of a contemplative than the sight of the opposite sexThe same holds true for the voice the smell the taste and the touch of the opposite sexThese are the foremost dangers that face contemplatives so we have to show greater care and restraint toward these things than toward anything elseMindfulness and discernment have to unravel these important points more than they have to deal with any other workThe bodyWe should analyze it with our discernment so as to see it clearlyThe words the body of a woman or the body of a man are simply names given in line with conventionActually its not a woman or a manIts simply an ordinary body just like ours covered all over with skinIf we look inside theres flesh tendons and bonesIt like us is all full of filthy and repulsive thingsTheres no part thats basically any different from our own bodyTheres simply the label in our mind that says woman or man This word woman or man is engraved deeply within the heart by the hearts own suppositions even though its not a truth and is simply a suppositionThe same with the voice Its just an ordinary sound and yet we label it the voice of the opposite sex and so it stabs deep into the heart  especially for those of us who are ordained  and goes clear through to the point where we forget ourselvesThe heart gets cut at the stem even though we continue to liveThe stem of the heart is torn rotten and putrid and yet we dont dieInstead we listen with pleasure to the song of our hearts being cut at the stem without ever wearying of it or having enoughThe smell Its an ordinary smell just like ours because its the smell of a personEven if we bring perfumes and scents from the realms of the devas and Brahmas to rub down that body the smell is the smell of those things not the smell of a woman or man not the least little bitSo analyze this and make careful distinctionsThe taste is simply the touchThe touch of that body is no different from one part of our own body touching another partEach of the parts is just earth water wind and fire just like oursWe cant see that theres any differenceSo we have to investigate clearly like this and then make comparisons comparing the sight sound smell taste and touch of the woman or man with our own sight sound smell taste and touchTheres no difference in terms of the principles of nature and of the truth aside from the minds conferring titles in line with its thoughtsFor this reason we must use discernment to unravel thingsDont let suppositions of any kind that will be your enemies infiltrate or destroy your heartShake them off using discernment which is a truth coming down to the truth that these things are just sights just sounds just smells just tastes just tactile sensations all of which pass by and disappear like other thingsThis is without a doubt the right way to contemplate that can gradually uproot our attachments and misconceptions concerning these mattersWhatever object you may investigate in the world its full of inconstancy stress and lackofselfTheres nothing lasting to be foundAll things depend on one thing or another and then fall apartWhatever the object If it exists in the world it has to fall apartIf it doesnt fall apart we willIf it doesnt break up well break upIf it doesnt leave well leave  because this world is full of leaving and separation through the principles of natureSo investigate in this way with discernment to see clearly before these things leave us or we leave them and then let them go in line with their truthWhen we can do this the mind will be at its easeHere weve been talking about discernment on the level of investigating sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensationsWhether within or without on the blatant or the subtle level this is how all of these things are investigatedConcentration Ive already explained to some extentConcentration refers to the stability and solidity of the heart beginning with its small moments of stillness and peace all the way up to the refined and stable levels of stillness and peaceIf the mind isnt trained isnt improved isnt forced with various tactics backed up by mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence it wont be able to attain peace till its dying dayIt will die in vainIt will die restless and confused straying off to different preoccupationsIt wont have any mindfulness or selfawarenessIt will die without any principles or standards to hold toIt will die just as a kite whose string is cut when its up in the air floats wherever the wind blowsEven while its still living it lives without any principles or standards because of its absentmindedness and heedlessness its lack of any sense of reason for it to followIt lives simply driftingIf we live simply drifting without any good principles to hold to then when we go well have to go simply driftingWhat purpose will it serveWhat goodness and certainty can we have for our destinationSo as long as were alive and aware as we currently are we should build certainty for ourselves in our hearts by being strong and unflinching in matters that are of solid worthThen we can be certain of ourselves both as we live and when we dieWe wont be upset or affected by life or death by being separated from other beings or our own bodies  something we all have to meet with because these are things lying within us allIts not the case that discernment arises automatically on the heels of concentration when the mind has been centeredIt has to be exercised and trained to think explore and investigateOnly then will discernment arise with concentration as its supportConcentration on its own cant turn into discernmentIt has to remain as concentrationIf we dont use discernment to investigate concentration simply makes the mind refreshed and calm content with its preoccupation in tranquillity not hungering to think here or there not confused or straying  because once the mind is still its calm and refreshed with the Dhamma in line with the level of its stillnessWe then take the mind that has been refreshed by tranquillity and use it with discernment to investigate and unravel various things none of which in this world lie over and beyond inconstancy stress and notselfAll things are filled with these same conditions so use discernment to contemplate  from whatever angle most suits your temperament  by investigating these things with interest with the desire really to know and see them as they truly areDont simply investigate without any intention or mindfulness in controlIn particular the theme of unattractiveness This is a good a very good cure for the mind obsessed with lust and passionHowever strong the lust thats how strongly you should investigate unattractiveness until you can see your own body and that of others throughout the world as a cemetery of fresh corpsesLust wont have a chance to flare up when discernment has penetrated to the knowledge that the body is filled with repulsivenessWho would feel lust for repulsivenessWho would feel lust for things with no beautyFor things that are disgustingThis is one form of the medicine of unattractiveness one of the prime medicines for curing the disease of lust and cravingOnce youve made a really full investigation make the mind grow still in a restricted rangeOnce the mind has investigated unattractiveness many many times to the point where it becomes proficient adept at contemplating external bodies as well as the internal body able to visualize things in whatever way you want then the mind will converge to the level of unattractiveness within itself and see the harm of the pictures of unattractiveness it paints as being one form of illusionIt will then let go of both sides both the side of unattractiveness and the side of attractivenessBoth attractiveness and unattractiveness are labels coupled with the affairs of lustOnce we have investigated and fully understood both sides the word attractive will dissolve and no longer have meaningThe word unattractive will dissolve and no longer have meaningThat which gives the meaning of attractive and unattractive is the mind or in other words saññaWe are now wise to sañña as being what labels thingsWe see the harm of this labeling and so it will no longer be able to go out interpreting in such a way as to make the mind grasp and be attached againWhen this is the case the mind lets go of both attractiveness and unattractiveness  or of beauty and ugliness  by seeing that they are simply dolls for training the mind and discernment as long as the mind is still attached to them and the discernment for investigating to uproot them is not yet proficient enoughWhen the mind is proficient and realizes the causes and effects of both sides  both attractiveness and unattractiveness  it can at the same time turn around to know its own labeling that goes out to dress this thing up as attractive and that as unattractiveWhen it knows this labeling clearly the labeling disbandsThe mind can see its harm in that this labeling is the culpritThe unattractive object isnt the culpritThe attractive object isnt the culpritInstead the labeling that says attractive and unattractive is the culprit deceiving us and making us become attachedThis is where things start coming inwardOur investigation comes inward like this and lets go step by stepWhen the mind has reached this stage then whether we focus on attractiveness or unattractiveness it will appear in the mind without our having to create an external image to exercise with just as when we travel and have passed progressively along a roadThe image appears in the mindThe moment it appears there we immediately know that sañña can label only as far as this and cant go labeling outsideEven though the image appears in mind we know clearly that the phenomenon that appears there as attractive or unattractive comes from sañña in the same wayWe know the image that appears in the mind as well as the sañña labeling it also as an image in the mindFinally the images in the mind vanishThe sañña  the labels the interpretations  disbandWe know that the labels that used to fool us into seeing things as attractive and unattractive and all sorts of other ways without limit  that used to fool us into falling for both of these sides  have disbandedThere is nothing further to deceive the heartThis is how unattractiveness is investigated in line with the principles of the practice  but you wont find this anywhere in the textsYoull find it only if you search for the truth in the principles of nature that exist with the body and mind  the location of the four Noble Truths and the four frames of reference  coming down finally to the text of the heartThats where youll find the things Ive explained hereThis is the bodyWe can know clearly that every part of the body is simply a physical phenomenonAnd what is there in these physical phenomenaAll the parts  hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones marrow spleen heart liver membranes kidneys lungs intestines stomach gorge feces  are just physical phenomena things separate from the mindIf we consider them as unattractive theyve been unattractive all along even before we considered themAnd who is it that gives them meaning saying that this is attractive or that is unattractiveWhen did these things ever give themselves meaningsWhen did they ever say they were attractive or unattractiveThey dont label or say anything at allWhatever their truth is thats how its always been in line with its nature from the very beginning  and they dont know their meaningWhat knows their meaning is saññaThe one that falls for their meaning is also sañña which comes out of this deluded mindOnce we are wise to this labelling all these things disappearEach has its separate realityThis is what it means to be wise to these thingsFeelings are the feelings of pleasure pain and indifference that arise from the bodyThe body is a phenomenon that has existed since before these feelings arosePains arise remain and then vanishThe body is the bodyThe pain is a painEach is a separate realityInvestigate and analyze them so as to see them for what they are  just a feeling just a body  without regarding them as a being a person us or anyone else ours or anyone elsesThe feeling isnt us ours or anyone elsesIts simply something that appears for a moment and disappears for a while in line with its natureThats what the truth isSañña means labelingWhatever it labels  things near far past present or future  whatever it labels it vanishes immediatelyIt keeps vanishing  arising and vanishing arising and vanishing  so how can we regard it as a self a being a personHere were referring to discernment on the refined level penetrating down in line with the truth that is clear to our heart without our having to ask anyone elseSankhara means thoughtformation forming good thoughts bad thoughts neutral thoughtsWhatever it forms is simply a matter of arising and vanishing arising and vanishingWe cant get any sense out of these thoughtformations at all if saññas dont take up where they leave off and turn them into issuesAs for saññas we already know them clearly so what is there to form thoughts pick up where they leave off and grasp at them turning them into long issuesAll there is is just the arising and vanishing in the mindThis is thoughtformationIts one reality which the Buddha calls the sankhara khandhaKhandha means heap or aggregateRupa khandha means the physical heapVedana khandha means the heap of feelingsSañña khandha means the heap of labels the aggregate of labelsSankhara khandha means the heap of thoughtformations the aggregate of thoughtformationsViññana khandha means the aggregate or heap of cognizance that which takes note the moment external things make contact as when visual images make contact with the eye and cognizance occursAs soon as the object passes this cognizance vanishesNo matter what thing it takes note of its always ready to vanish with that thingWhat sense or substance can we get out of these five khandhasHow can we assume them to be us or oursThis is what the issues of the five khandhas are likeTheyve occurred this way appeared this way arisen and vanished this way one after another continually from the day of our birth to the present momentWe cant find any meaning or substance in them at all unless the mind labels and interprets them grasping onto them as being itself or belonging to itself and then carrying their weight  which is heavier than an entire mountain  within itself without any rewardIts only reward is suffering and stress because its own delusion has caused these things to reward itWhen the mind has investigated and seen these things clearly with sharp discernment then the body is true in its body way in line with the principles of nature that are made clear with discernmentFeelings of pain pleasure and indifference in the body are known clearly in line with their truthFeelings in the mind  the pleasure pain and indifference arising in the mind  are the factor the mind continues to be interested in investigatingEven though we may not yet be abreast of these things they have to be alerting the mind to investigate them at all times because on this level we arent yet able to keep abreast of feelings in the mind  in other words the pleasure pain and indifference exclusively in the mind that arent related to feelings in the bodyCognizance is simply a separate realityWe see this clearly as it truly isThe mind has no more doubts that would cause it to latch onto these things as its self because each is a separate realityEven though they dwell together theyre like a piece of fruit or an egg placed in a bowlThe bowl has to be a bowlThe egg placed there is an eggThey arent one and the sameThe mind is the mind which lies in the bowl of the body feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance but its not the body feelings labels thoughtformations or cognizanceIts simply the mind pure and simple inside thereWhen we clearly make the distinction between the mind and the khandhas thats how it isNow that the mind clearly understands the body feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance with nothing more to doubt all that remains is the fidgeting and rippling exclusively within the mindThis rippling is a subtle form of sankhara that ripples within the mind a subtle form of pleasure a subtle form of stress a subtle form of sañña appearing in the mindThats all there isThe mind will investigate and analyze these things at all times with automatic mindfulness and discernmentThe mind on this level is very refinedIt has let go of all thingsThe five khandhas no longer remain but it hasnt yet let go of itself its awarenessThis awareness though is still coated with unawarenessThis is called unawareness convergingIt converges in the mind and cant find any way outThe paths of unawareness are out the eyes ears nose tongue and body leading to sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensationsOnce mindfulness and discernment have been able to cut these paths step by step unawareness has no way outIt doesnt have any following so it just goes blip blip blip within itself taking just the mind as the support onto which it latches because it cant find any way outIt displays itself as a subtle feeling of pleasure a subtle feeling of stress a radiance thats extremely amazing as long as discernment isnt yet allaround and cant yet destroy itThe mind keeps contemplating right thereNo matter how radiant or magnificent it may be any conventional reality  no matter how refined  has to display a symptom of one sort or another that will arouse the minds suspicions enough to make it look for a way to remedy the situationThus the pleasure and stress that are refined phenomena appearing exclusively within the mind together with the brightness and marvelousness have unawareness as their ringleader but because we have never encountered them before were deluded into holding onto them when we first investigate into this point and are lulled sound asleep by unawareness so that we grasp onto the radiance  to the pleasure to the marvelousness or to the magnificence arising from the unawareness embedded in the mind  as being our selfAnd so we assume the mind complete with unawareness to be our self without our realizing what we are doingBut not for long  because of the power of supermindfulness and superdiscernment qualities that by now are uncomplacentThey keep scrutinizing investigating and analyzing back and forth in line with their nature on this levelThe time will have to come when they know for sure by noticing the subtle pleasure that behaves just slightly in an irregular mannerEven though stress displays itself just barely in line with this level of the mind its enough to make us suspicious Eh  why does the mind have symptoms like thisIts not constant The magnificence displaying itself in the mind the marvelousness displaying itself in the mind display irregularities just barely but enough for mindfulness and discernment to catch sight of themOnce they catch sight of these things they get suspicious and take them as the point to be investigated at that momentSo now the mind  this sort of awareness  becomes the target of their investigationThey focus down on this point to find out What is thisWeve investigated everything of every sort to the point where weve been able to uproot it all stage by stage but this knowing nature so bright so amazing What exactly is itMindfulness and discernment keep focusing on down and investigatingThis point thus becomes the target of a fullscale investigation the battlefield of automatic mindfulness and discernment at that momentBefore long they are able to destroy the mind of unawareness that is so superlative so amazing and magnificent from the viewpoint of unawareness smashing and scattering it completely so that nothing not even an atom is left remaining in the heartWhen the nature on which we ignorantly conferred such titles as superlative and amazing is dissolved away something on which we dont have to confer the titles of superlative or notsuperlative appears in full measureThat nature is purityAnd this purity When we compare it with the mind of unawareness that we once held to be superlative and supreme the mind of unawareness is like a pile of cow dung while the nature that had been concealed by unawareness once it is revealed is like pure goldPure gold and squishy cow dung Which has greater valueEven a baby sucking his thumb can answer so we neednt waste our time and expose our stupidity by making comparisonsThis is the investigation of the mindThis level when we have reached it is where things are severed completely from becoming and birth in the mind severed completely from all unawareness and cravingAvijjapaccaya sankhara  With unawareness as condition there occur thoughtformations  is completely severed and becomes avijjayatveva asesaviraganirodha sankharanirodho sankharanirodha viññananirodho  Simply with the disbanding of unawareness with no remaining passion thoughtformations disbandWith the disbanding of thoughtformations cognizance disbands all the way to this is the disbanding of this entire mass of stressWhen unawareness has disbanded the formations that are the cause of stress disband and keep disbanding just as the Buddha said while the formations that continue as part of the khandhas become formations pure and simple and arent a cause of stressThe cognizance that appears in the heart is cognizance pure and simple and not cognizance as a cause of stressViññanapaccaya namarupam namarupampaccaya salayatanam salyatanapaccaya phasso  whatever is a physical or mental phenomenon a sense medium or a sensory contact is simply its own simple natureIt cant provoke the mind that has finished its task to the point of evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hoti  This is the disbanding of this entire mass of stress The words evametassa kevalassa  all things mentioned here  have absolutely disbandedThis is called disbanding in full measureWhen we disband defilement craving and unawareness when we disband the world of rebirth where do we disband it if not in the mind which is the essence of the world of rebirth the essence of unawareness the essence of birth aging illness and deathThe seeds of birth aging illness and death  namely passion and craving with unawareness as their ringleader  lie only here in the mindWhen they are completely scattered from the mind there is simply nirodho hoti  This is the disbandingThis then is the work of the practice in line with the principles of the Buddhas teachingsFrom the time of the Buddha down to the present these principles have remained constantThere are no deficiencies or excesses in the principles of the Dhamma taught by the Buddha that would make it unable to keep up with the tricks and deceits of the various forms of defilementThis is why its called the middle way the Dhamma always appropriate for curing every sort of defilement to the point where defilement no longer remainsThis is how you should understand the power of the middle wayHold to this path in your practice because release from suffering and stress is something with a value transcending all three levels of existenceAnd what do we see in any of the three levels of existence that is more fantastic than the release of the heart from all suffering and stressWhen we see this clearly with our reason our efforts in the practice will be able to advanceWell be ready to die in the battleIf it means death then go ahead and die  die in the battle for victory over the defilements that have smothered the heart for so longThere is no teaching no tool at all that can attack the defilements and strike them down like the middle way taught by the Lord BuddhaFor this reason we can be secure and confident in the words Buddham saranam gacchami  I go for refuge in the Buddha  in that he practiced so that both the causes and the results  everything of every sort  were perfect and complete before taking the Dhamma to teach the worldSvakkhato bhagavata dhammo  The Dhamma of the Blessed One is well taught He taught it well in every facet from having comprehended and seen the truth of every thing of every sortSangham saranam gacchami  I go for refuge in the Sangha The Noble Disciples who practiced in line with the principles of the Buddhas Dhamma  without slacking or weakening enabling themselves to expel defilement from their hearts making their hearts superlative and becoming our refuge  did so without going outside the principles of this middle waySo I ask that you listen to this and take it to heartDont set your heart on the deceitful and counterfeit issues filling the world of rebirthSet your heart on the truth of the Dhamma the truth of the practiceYou will see the truth continually appearing in your heart in the midst of all the counterfeit things in the heart and throughout the worldDont harbor any doubts for that would be to linger over the defilements that know no endIn practicing the Dhamma aim at the qualities of the heart  virtue concentration and discernment  more than at material thingsAs for material things if we have just enough to get by thats plenty enoughWherever you go We are born from human beingsWe monks come from peoplePeople have homes we monks need places to stay  enough to provide ordinary shelter  but they should be just enough to get byDont make them fancyDont go competing with the world outsideThat would simply foster your own defilements and make you known throughout the world in a way that the defilements would ridiculeMake yourself known instead for your virtue concentration and discernment your conviction and persistenceMake yourself known for having striven to cure yourself or extricate yourself to gain release from defilement and the mass of stress in the cycle of rebirthThis is what it means genuinely and directly to enhance your statureDont abandon your effortsMake it to the other shore of this turning churning cycle in this lifetime  which is much surer than any other lifetime any other time or placeAnd dont forget wherever you go Dont get involved in construction workEverywhere we go these days theres construction work and monks involved in itIts enough to make you sickAs soon as they meet each other Hows it going with your meeting hall Hows it going with your schoolAre you finished yetHow much has it cost Whenever theres a project whatever the project they go harassing lay people gathering up funds so that the lay people have to spend money and get embroiled too without any respiteLet the lay people have enough money so that they can stash some of it awayThey practically kill themselves just to scrape together a little cash but instead of being able to use it to provide for their stomachs for their families their children and other essentials and for making merit at their leisure they end up having to hand it all over to help the monks who harass them by fundraising to the point where theyre left emptyhandedThis is the religion of harassing the world which the Buddha never practiced and never taught us to practiceSo I want you all to understand thisThe Buddha never acted this wayThis is the religion of material objects the religion of money not the religion of Dhamma following the example of the BuddhaLook around us Monks dwellings as large as Doi InthanonHow many stories do they haveThey stretch up to the skyHow luxurious are theyHow much do they make you sick to your heartEven my own dwelling I cant help feeling embarrassed by it even though I stay there against my will and have to put up with the embarrassmentThey sent the money to build it without letting me know in advanceIm ashamed of the fact that while I have asked for alms all my life my dwelling even a palace in heaven is no match for it while the people who give alms live in shacks no bigger than your fistWhats appropriate whats fitting for monks who are habitually conscious of danger is to live wherever you can squeeze yourself in to sit and lie downBut as for your effort in the practice I ask that you be solid and stable diligent and perseveringDont waste your time by letting any job become an obstacle because exterior work for the most part is work that destroys your work at mental development for the sake of killing and destroying defilementThis is the major task in body and mind for monks who aim at release and feel no desire to come back to be reborn and die to carry the mass of major and minor sufferings in levels of becoming and birth any moreTheres no danger greater than the danger of defilement smothering the heart able to force and coerce the heart into suffering everything to which the Dhamma doesnt aspireTheres no suffering greater than the suffering of a person oppressed by defilementIf we dont fight with defilement while were ordained will we be able to fight with it after we dieThe vagaries of life and the body are things we can put up with but dont put up with the oppression of defilement any longer for that wouldnt be at all fitting for monks who are disciples of the TathagataWhether things may be just enough to get by or however much they may be lacking be sure to look to the Tathagata as your refuge at all timesDont let things that are unnecessary for monks become luxurious beyond all reason  such as building things to the point of competing with the world outside and being crazy for hollow rank and fame without being interested in building the Dhamma to revive the heart from its stuporThe people of the world live in flimsy little shacks that are ready to collapse at a sneezeWhatever they get they deny their own stomachs and their families so that they can make merit and give donations to monksBut monks live in manystoried mansions  fancier and more luxurious than those of heavenly beings  as if they had never lived in tiny shacks with their parents before becoming ordainedAnd who knows what they have decorating their mansions in competition with the world outsideIt makes you more embarrassed than a young bride when her motherinlaw sneezes and passes wind so loud she practically faintsWe forget that our heads are shaved Why dont we ever think about what that meansArent we becoming too shamelessThis isnt in line with the principles of the religion that teach those who are ordained to cure their defilements by seeing the dangers in worldly comfortsThese sorts of things clutter up the religion and the hearts of us monks so I ask that you not think of getting involved in themBe conscious always of the fact that they arent the principles of the Dhamma for curing defilement in a way the heart can see clearlyInstead theyre means for making monks forget themselves and become involved in the business of defilement which is none of their business as monks at allThe primary principle of the Dhamma for monks is rukkhamulasenasanam nissaya pabbajja tatha te yavajivam ussaho karaniyo  Once you have ordained in the religion of the Buddha you are to live under the shade of trees in forests and mountains in caves under overhanging cliffs in the open by haystacks which are all places suitable for killing defilement for wiping out the defilements in your heartsTry to act in this way all of your life Everything else  such as the things termed extraneous gains  are unnecessary comfortsThe work the Buddha would have us do is the contemplation of kesa loma nakha danta taco taco danta nakha loma kesa hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin skin teeth nails hair of the body hair of the head and from there on to the parts of the body  beginning with hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones marrow spleen heart liver membranes kidneys lungs intestines stomach gorge and feces  which exist in each of usTry to unravel these things with your discernment so as to see them as they truly areWhen you have completed this work with the full mindfulness and discernment of heroes then release from suffering  that tremendous treasure  will be yours Listen to thatIsnt it far removed from the way we like to take our pleasure with the scraps and leftovers that the Buddha taught us to relinquish in every word every phrase every book of the DhammaWe ourselves are the adversaries of the teachings of the religionWe luxuriate in everything the Dhamma criticizesLay people are no match for usWhenever they get anything good they use it to make merit and give to monksWhatever they eat and use is just so as to get byAll they ask for is good things to give to monks in line with their nature as meritseekers while we monks have become luxuryseekersOur dwellings are fine the things we use are fine and on top of that some of us have radios TV sets cars If you compare this with the basic rules of the Dhamma and Vinaya it makes you more heartsick than you can sayHow is it that we have the stomach to kill the Buddha redhanded this way with our shameless and unthinking ostentation as monksIt really makes you embarrassedSo I ask that each of you reflect a great deal on these mattersIf youve ordained really for the sake of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  and not for the sake of being adversaries of the Buddhas teachings  I ask that you reflect on the Dhamma and the path followed by the Buddha more than on any other matterNo time excels the time of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha that they have set as an example for us to followThis is a very important principleI ask that you all follow the principles of the time of the BuddhaThe results which are refreshing and satisfying are sure to appear in line with the principles of the welltaught Dhamma the Dhamma that leads out from sufferingTheres no way to doubt thisThese things Ive practiced to a fair extent myselfI used to be a junior monk too you knowWhen I went to study and train with my teachers  and especially VenAcariya Mun  I really listenedI listened to him speakHe would speak half in earnest half in jest in the ordinary way of teachers talking with their students but I would never listen in jestI always listened in earnest and took things to heartI had the greatest imaginable love and fear and respect for himId hold to every facet of what hed say that I could put into practiceWhat Ive been able to teach my students is due to the power of what he taught meFor this reason even though in this monastery we may conduct ourselves somewhat differently from other monasteries in general Im confident in line with the principles of reason and of the Dhamma and Vinaya so that Im not worried about the matterI dont think that what we do is wrong because I have the example of the Buddhas teaching and of my teachers  everything of every sort that follows the original patterns  which is why Ive led my fellow meditators to practice this way all alongWhether this is right or wrong we have to decide in line with the principles of reasonDeference to people is an affair of the world an affair of individuals and not an affair of the Dhamma and Vinaya which are fixed principles for the practiceSpeaking in line with the Dhamma for the sake of understanding and right practice Thats the genuine DhammaFor this reason an unwillingness to speak the truth for fear of stepping on someones toes is not a trait for those who aim at the Dhamma togetherThis seems enough for now so Ill ask to stop hereThis state of mind with its unawareness is a magnificent mind bold and daring  not only radiant but also bold and daring as well and reckless because of its daring in thinking that its smartIts not reckless in the ordinary wayIts reckless in line with its nature as a state of mind of this sortThis is called the nine forms of mana or conceitThe nine forms of conceit lie right hereThe Buddha explains this in the five higher fetters passion for form passion for formlessness conceit restlessness and unawarenessConceit means to assume  to assume that the state of mind blended into one with unawareness is ones self that its me or mine and then taking it to make comparisons How is it with those people or these peopleAre their minds on a par with mineHigher than mineLower than mine This is why there are nine forms of conceitIn other words three times three is nineFor example our mind is lower than theirs and we assume it to be lower than theirs higher than theirs or on a parOur mind is on a par with theirs and we assume it to be lower than theirs higher than theirs or on a parOur mind is higher than theirs and we assume it to be lower than theirs higher than theirs or on a parThe refined level of defilement takes this state of mind out to make the comparison  because its in the phase where it has fangsIts fangs are growing sharpThe fangs of unawareness Theyre called conceit or selfassumptionOnce this state is dissolved what is there to assumeWhat is there to be radiantTo be defiledTo be bold and daringTo be afraidThere isnt anything once that nature dissolves through the power of investigationThese things you know are phenomena that create problems in line with their levelTheir level is subtle so they manage to create subtle problemsBlatant defilements create blatant problemsSubtle defilements create subtle problemsWhen the defilements are gone theres nothing to create any problemsThere are no more problems in any way no more conditions for conventional reality to make further connectionsAll that remains is absolute purity which is why there are no more problemsAbsolute purity is a condition for whatWhat problems does it createThe Buddha says that we run out of problemsThis is where they run outHowever many levels of becoming and birth there may be in the mind it has known them step by step until it reaches the converging point leaving just the seeds of these things that get planted here and there as birthSo we burn them up with tapas the fire of our effort until they are completely eradicatedSo now are there any levels of becoming and birth to make further connectionsWhom do we have to askEven if the buddha were sitting right in front of us we wouldnt ask him because the truth is the same for us as it is for himTheres nothing different enough for us to askThis is why the Dhamma is said to be sanditthiko We know it and see it ourselfPaccattam veditabbo viññuhi Those who know it know it for themselves aloneThis means that only those who know it from the practice can know itIt cant be made available to anyone elseThis is what the Buddha calls vusitam brahmacariyam Its the end of the jobThe earthshattering job is done  earthshattering because becoming and birth build themselves up with earth water wind and fire or because any level of becoming and birth is a matter of convention which is now overturnedThis is why we say its earthshatteringSo what is there to move in and take up residence in the mindNow we can watch defilementOnce we have completely killed defilement in this mind then how can defilement be kept hidden from us when it displays itself in anyone elses mind or actionsThis mind cant help but know it every timeAs they say defilement ordinarily rules us completely without our knowing it but how can the Buddha and the arahants have any trouble seeingThey see in the flash of an eye and theyre already disgustedThose who know know to the point where theyre disgusted What do you say to thatAs for us were the blind living with the blindWe dont know our own affairs or those of anyone elseNeither side knows but each side thinks that it knows assumes that it knows assumes that its right  and so both sides argue and bite each other like dogs because their inner eyes dont seeThey dont have the eye of discernment like the Buddha and the Noble DisciplesThis is the way it is with defilement It has to assume itself and exalt itselfThe more vile it is the more it assumes itself to be goodThis is the way defilement isIt has never submitted to the truth of the Dhamma from time immemorialFor this reason we practice to stamp out these thingsDont let them linger in the heartStamp them out till theyre completely scattered and smashed and then you can be at your ease the mind completely open and yet a reservoir for the quality of purity without an inkling of convention passing inIf we were to make a comparison with conventional reality its an outer space mind but thats just a manner of speakingPeople who practice in earnestness trying to develop and improve the qualities in their hearts step by step beginning with virtue the stages of concentration and the levels of discernment are  to make a comparison  like the people who build a rocket or a satellite to travel in outer spaceThey have to put their vehicle into good shapeOtherwise it wont get off the ground  because the things that can act as obstacles to their vehicle are manyThe object thats going to travel in space has to be developed in order to be completely suited to its environment in every wayBefore they can get it safely past its obstacles they need to have made ample calculationsEven then there are times when mishaps occurBut once the vehicle has been thoroughly developed it can travel easily in outer space without any mishaps of any sortThis is an analogy for the minds of those who practice who have developed their inner qualities and put them in to shapeThe heart is what will step out beyond the realm of conventional realities that exert a gravitational pull on it into the outer space beyond convention to vimutti or releaseThe things that act as obstacles preventing it from stepping out are the various kinds of defilementFor this reason we have to make a very great effortThe defilements have various levels of crudeness and subtlety so in developing the heart so as to pass through the crudeness and subtlety of the various levels of conventional reality  and of the defilements in particular  we must try to make it just rightWe must use whatever qualities are needed to get the mind past the crudeness of conventional realities or defilement stage by stage by means of our practice by means of our efforts to improve and develop itOur persistence has to be strongOur efforts our endeavors in all ways have to be strongMindfulness and discernment are the important factors that will take the heart beyond the various obstacles thwarting it step by stepAll of the techniques and strategies taught by the Buddha in the area of meditation are means for developing the heart so that it will be suited to transcending the realm of conventional reality and reaching outer space nibbanaWhat is it like the outer space of the DhammaThey no longer doubt about whether the outer space of the world exists or notThe things that lie within conventional reality are known to existOuter space beyond our atmosphere is another level of conventional realityOuter space What is it likeDoes it existHow does our world in the atmosphere differ from the things outside the world of our atmosphere called outer spaceBoth of these levels existThe mind that lies in the realm of conventional reality  surrounded and controlled  is like the various objects in the world trapped by the pull of gravity at all timesThe mind is trapped by the pull of defilement in just the same wayIt cant escape which is why it must develop its strength to escape from the world of this gravitational pullThis gravitational pull is something the Buddha has already explainedIn brief there is craving for sensuality craving for becoming and craving for no becomingThe details  the branches and offshoots  are more than can be numberedThey fill this world of conventional realitiesThey are all factors that make the mind attached and entangled  loving hating and resenting different things different beings different peopleAll these factors can be adversaries to the heart and come from the preoccupations of the heart itself that labels things and misinterprets themFor this reason the principles of the Dhamma that the Buddha taught in the area of meditation for developing and modifying the heart are very appropriate for helping us as meditators to escape from all the things in our hearts that exert a pull on us or weigh us downThese things are hard to remove hard to remedy hard to sever which is why we need a Teacher to guide usIf we had no Teacher the living beings in the three realms of the cosmos  no matter how many thousands or millions of forms and levels there are  would all be as if deaf and blindNot one of them would be able to escape from this darkness and blindnessThis is why we should have a heartfelt sense of the awesomeness of the arising of a Buddha who leads living beings to escape from this gravitational pull from this oppressiveness safely and in large numbers  to the point where no one else can compare  beginning with each Buddhas foremost disciples and on to the end of his dispensation when his teachings no longer exist in the hearts of living beings which is the final point in his work of ferrying living beings from all sorts of blindness darkness suffering and stressOur present Buddha performed these duties with the full mindfulness and discernment of his great mercy and compassion beginning with the day of his AwakeningIts as if he took a large ship and cast anchor in the middle of the ocean in order to gather the living beings of various kinds and strengths adrift in the water on the verge of death and bring them on board stage by stageThose who take an interest in the Dhamma are like beings who struggle to get on board the Buddhas ship that has cast anchor in the middle of the seaThey keep climbing on board climbing on board until the day when the beings of the world have no more belief in the teachings of the religionThats when the ship will no longer have any functionThose who are still left in the sea will have to stay there adrift with no more way of escapeThey are the ones who are to become food for the fishes and turtlesThose who have come on board though are the various stages of those who have been able to escape as mentioned in the four types of individuals beginning with the ugghatitaññu vipacitaññu and neyyaThese are the ones who have come on boardHow high or low they are able to go depends on their individual capabilitiesThere are those who escape completely  those free of defilement there are those on the verge of escape  the nonreturners those in the middle  the oncereturners and then the streamwinners and finally ordinary good peopleHere were referring to the Buddhas ship in its general senseHe uses it to salvage living beings beginning from the day of his Awakening until the point when the teachings of the religion have no more meaning in the worlds sensibilitiesThats the final pointThose who remain are the diseased who can find no medicine or physician to treat their illnesses and are simply awaiting their day to dieSo now we are swimming and struggling toward the Buddhas large ship by making the effort of the practiceIn particular now that we have ordained in the Buddhas religion and have developed a feel for his teaching this makes us even more moved even more convinced of all the truths that he taught rightly about good and evil right and wrong hell heaven the Brahma worlds and nibbana all of which are realities that actually existWe have followed the principles of the Buddhas Dhamma and in particular the practice of meditationTry to build up your strength and ability without flagging so as to resist and remove all the things that coerce or exert a gravitational pull on the heartDont let yourself become accustomed to their pullThey pull you to disaster not to anything elseTheyre not forces that will pull you to what is auspiciousTheyll pull you to whats inauspicious step by step depending on how much you believe give in and are overcome by their pullSuffering will then appear in proportion to how much you unconsciously agree give in and are overcome by their pullEven though there are the teachings of the religion to pull you back the mind tends to take the lower path more than the path of the religion which is why it is set adriftBut were not the type to be set adriftWere the type who are swimming to release using the full power of our intelligence and abilitiesWherever you are whatever you do always be on the alert with mindfulnessDont regard the effort of the practice as tiring as something wearisome difficult to do difficult to get right difficult to contend withStruggle and effort These are the path for those who are to gain release from all stress and danger not the path of those headed downward to the depths of hell blind and in the dark by day and by night their minds consumed by all things lowly and vileThe Noble Ones in the time of the Buddha practiced in earnestWith the words I go to the Buddha for refuge or I go to the Sangha for refuge we should reflect on their Dhamma investigating and unraveling it so as to see the profundity and subtlety of their practiceAt the same time we should take their realizations into our hearts as good examples to follow so that we can conduct ourselves in the footsteps of their practices and realizationsI go to the Buddha for refuge We all know how difficult it was for him to become the BuddhaWe should engrave it in our heartsOur Teacher was the first pioneer in our age to the good destination for the sake of all living beingsThings were never made easy for himFrom the day of his renunciation to the day of his Awakening it was as if he were in hell  theres no need to compare it to being in prison  because he had been very delicately brought up in his royal homeWhen he renounced the household life he faced great difficulties in terms of the four necessitiesIn addition there were many many defilements in his heart related to his treasury and to the nation filled with his royal subjectsIt weighed heavily on his heart at all times that he had to leave these things behindHe found no comfort or peace at all except when he was sound asleepAs for us we dont have a following dont have subjects have never been kingsWe became ordained far more easily than the BuddhaAnd when we make the effort of the practice we have his teachings correct in their every aspect as our guideOur practice isnt really difficult like that of the Buddha who had to struggle on his own with no one to guide himOn this point were very differentWe have a much lighter burden in the effort of the practice than the Buddha who was of royal birthFood wherever we go is full to overflowing thanks to the faith of those who are already convinced of the Buddhas teachings and are not lacking in interest and faith for those who practice rightlyFor this reason monks  wherever they go  are not lacking in the four necessities of life which is very different from the case of the BuddhaAll of the Noble Disciples who followed in the Buddhas footsteps were second to him in terms of the difficulties they facedThey had a much easier time as regards the four necessities of life because people by and large had already begun to have faith and conviction in the teachingsBut even so the disciples didnt take pleasure in the four necessities more than in the Dhamma in making the singleminded effort to gain release from suffering and stressThis is something very pleasing something very worthy to be taken as an exampleThey gave their hearts their lives  every part of themselves  in homage to the Buddha and Dhamma to the point where they all became homage to the Sangha within themselvesIn doing so they all encountered difficulties every one of themBecause the Dhamma is something superior and superlative whoever meets it has to develop and prosper through its power day by day step by step to a state of superlative excellenceAs for the defilements there is no type of defilement that can take anyone to peace security or excellence of any kindThe defilements know thisThey know that the Dhamma far excels them so they disguise themselves thoroughly to keep us from knowing their tricks and deceitsIn everything we do they have to lie behind the scenes showing only their tactics and strategies which are nothing but means of fooling living beings into falling for them and staying attached to themThis is very ingenious on their partFor this reason those who make the effort of the practice are constantly bending under their gravitational pullWhether we are doing sitting meditation walking meditation  whatever our posture  we keep bending and leaning under their pullThey pull us toward laziness and lethargyThey pull us toward discouragement and weaknessThey pull us into believing that our mindfulness and discernment are too meager for the teachings of the religionThey pull us into believing that our capacities are too meager to deserve the Dhamma to deserve the paths fruitions and nibbana or to deserve the Buddhas teachingsAll of these things are the tactics of the pull of defilement to draw us solely into failure away from the DhammaIf we dont practice the Dhamma so as to get above these things we wont have any sense at all that they are all deceits of defilementWhen we have practiced so as to get beyond them step by step though they wont be able to remain hiddenNo matter how sharp and ingenious the various kinds of defilement may be they dont lie beyond the power of mindfulness and discernmentThis is why the Buddha saw causes and effects benefits and harm in a way that went straight to his heart because of his intelligence that transcended defilementFor this reason when he taught the Dhamma to the world he did so with full compassion so that living beings could truly escape from danger from the depths of the world so full of sufferingHe wanted the beings of the world to see the marvelousness the awesomeness of the Dhamma that had had such an impact within his heart so that they too would actually see as he didThis is why his proclamation of the Dhamma was done in full measure for it was based on his benevolenceHe didnt proclaim it with empty pronouncements or as empty ceremonyThat sort of thing didnt exist in the BuddhaInstead he was truly filled with benevolence for the living beings of the worldHis activities as Buddha  the five duties of the Buddha we are always hearing about  he never abandoned except for the few times he occasionally set them aside in line with eventsBut even though he set them aside it wasnt because he had set his benevolence asideHe set them aside in keeping with events and circumstancesFor example when he spent the rains alone in the Prileyya Forest he had no following and none of the monks entered the forest to receive instruction from him which meant that this activity was set asideOther than that though he performed his duties to the full because of his benevolence with nothing lacking in any wayThis is a matter of his having seen things clearly in his heart the harm of all things dangerous and the benefits of all things beneficialThe Buddha had touched and known them in every way which is why he had nothing to doubtHis teaching of the Dhamma regarding harms and benefits was thus done in full measureHe analyzed harm into all its branchesHe analyzed benefits into all their branches and completely revealed the differing degrees of benefits they gaveThe beings of the world who had lived drearily with suffering and stress for untold aeons and were capable of learning of the excellence of the Dhamma from the Buddha How could they remain complacentOnce they had heard the teachings of the religion truly resonating in their very own ears and hearts  because of the truth the honesty the genuine compassion of the Buddha  they had to wake upThe beings of the world had to wake upThey had to accept the truthThat truth is of two kindsThe truth on the side of harm is one kind of truth It really is stressful and the origin of stress really creates stress to burn the hearts of living beingsAs for the path it really creates ease and happiness for living beingsThose who listened to these truths listened with all their heartsThis being the case the strength of will they developed their conviction and their clear vision of both harm and benefits all gathered to become a strength permeating the one heart of each personSo why shouldnt these things reveal their full strength and manifest themselves as persistence effort earnestness and determination in every activity for the sake of gaining release from all dangers and adversity by means of the DhammaThis is why the disciples who heard the Dhamma from the Buddha from the mouth of the foremost Teacher felt inspired and convincedMany of them even came to see the Dhamma and gain release from suffering and stress step by step to the point of absolute release right there in the Buddhas presenceAs weve seen the texts say When the Buddha was explaining the Dhamma for the sake of those who could be taught his followers  such as the monks  attained the Dhamma to ultimate release nibbana in no small numbersThis is what happens when truth meets with truthThey fit together easily with no difficulty at allThose who listened did so by really seeing the benefits and harm really convinced by the reasons of the Dhamma taught by the Buddha which is why they gained clear results right then and thereThe Dhamma  both the harm and benefits that the Buddha explained in his day and age and that existed in the hearts of his listeners in that day and age In what way is it different from the truths existing in our hearts at presentTheyre all the same nature of truth the same Noble TruthsThey dont lie beyond the four Noble Truths either in the Buddhas time or in the presentThe Buddhas instructions were the truth of the path teaching people to have virtue concentration and discernment so that they could truly understand the affairs of stress straight to the heart and remove the cause of stress which is a thorn or a spear stabbing the heart of living beings creating suffering and stress that go straight to the heart as wellThe truth of stress exists in our bodies and mindsThe truth of the origin of stress reveals itself blatantly in our hearts in our every activityWhat can reveal itself only intermittently or not at all is the path  even though we are listening to it right nowWhat is the pathMindfulness and discernmentRight View and Right Attitude These things refer to the levels of discernmentIf we add Right Mindfulness then when we have these three qualities nourishing the heart Right Concentration will arise because of our right activitiesRight Activity for those who are to extricate themselves from stress refers primarily to the work of removing defilement  for example the work of sitting and walking meditation the work of guarding the heart with mindfulness using mindfulness and discernment continually to investigate and contemplate the different kinds of good and bad things making contact with us at all timesThis is called building the path within the heartWhen we bring the path out to contend with our adversary  the origin of stress  what facet is the adversary displayingThe facet of loveWhat does it loveWhat exactly is the object it lovesHere we focus mindfulness and discernment in on unraveling the object thats lovedWhat is the object in actualityUnravel it so as to see it through and through being really intent in line with the principles of mindfulness and discernmentReflect back and forth again and again so as to see it clearlyThe object thats loved or lovable will fade away of its own accord because of our discernmentMindfulness and discernment wash away all the artifice all that is counterfeit in that socalled love step by step until it is all goneThis is the discernment we build up in the heart to wash away all the artifices all the filth with which the defilements plaster things inside and outOutside they plaster these things on sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensationsInside they plaster them on labels  sañña  that go out our eyes They plaster things beginning with our eyes ears nose tongue and body stage by stageTheres nothing but the plaster of defilementWhen we meet with these things seeing them or hearing them sañña  labels and interpretations  and sankhara  thoughtformations  appear in the mindThese continue plastering layer on layerFor this reason we must use discernment to investigateWhatever is plastered outside wash that plastering awayThen turn around to wash away the plastering insideWhen we have seen these things clearly with discernment how can discernment help but turn to find the important culprit the deceiver insideIt has to turn insideIn using mindfulness and discernment this is how we must use themWhen we investigate this is how we investigate  and we do it earnestlyThis is Right Activity in the area of the practiceRight Speech As Ive said before we speak in line with the ten topics of effacementWe dont bring matters of the world politics commerce matters of women and men matters of defilement and craving to converse among ourselves so as to become distracted and conceited piling on more defilement and stress in line with the things we discussWith the topics of effacement  thats what the Buddha called them  we speak of things that will strengthen our will to make persistent effort making us convinced and inspired with the DhammaAt the same time these topics are warnings against heedlessness and means of washing away the various kinds of defilement when we hear them from one anotherThis is Right Speech in the area of the practiceRight Livelihood Feed your heart with DhammaDont bring in poison  greed anger delusion or lust  to feed the heart for these things will be toxic burning the heart and making it far more troubled than any poisonous substances couldTry to guard your heart well with mindfulness and discernmentThe savor of the Dhamma beginning with concentration as its basis will appear as peace and calm within the heart in proportion to the levels of concentrationThen use discernment to unravel the various things that the mind labels and interprets so as to see them clearly step by stepThis is called Right Livelihood  guarding the heart rightly feeding it correctly with the nourishment of the Dhamma and not with the various kinds of defilement craving and mental effluents that are like poisons burning the heartReduce matters to these terms meditatorsThis is called Right Livelihood in the practice of meditationRight Effort as Ive said before means persistence in abandoning all forms of evilThis covers everything weve said so farThe Buddha defines this as persistence in four areas or of four sorts but since Ive already explained this many times Ill pass over it hereRight Mindfulness What does the Buddha have us keep in mindAll the things that will remove defilementFor example he has us keep the four frames of reference in mind being mindful as we investigate the body being mindful as we investigate feelings being mindful as we investigate the mind being mindful as we investigate phenomena that involve the mind arise in the mind arise and then vanish vanish and then arise matters of past and future appearing in the present all the timeWe keep investigating in this wayIf we investigate so as to make the mind progress in tranquillity meditation Right Mindfulness means using mindfulness to supervise our mental repetitionFrom there it turns into Right Concentration within the heartThis is called building the Dhamma building tools for clearing our way loosening the things that bind and constrict the heart so that we can make easy progress so that we arent obstructed and blocked by the force of the things I have mentionedOnly the religion or only the Dhamma can remove and scatter all the things that have bound us for countless aeons clearing them away so that we can make easy progressWhen the mind is centered in concentration then confusion and turmoil are far awayThe mind is still and dwells in comfort and easeWhen the mind develops discernment from investigating and contemplating the things that obstruct it it makes easy progressThe sharper its discernment the wider the path it can clear for itselfIts going is smoothEasyIt advances by seeing and knowing the truth without being deluded or deceiving itselfGenuine discernment doesnt deceive itself but instead makes smooth progressIt unravels all the things that obstruct it  our various attachments and misconstruings  so as to see them thoroughly as if it were slashing away the obstacles in its path so that it can progress step by step as Ive already explained to youThe most important basis for its investigation is the bodyBodies outside or the body inside investigate them carefully and thoroughly for theyre all Noble TruthsTheyre all the path both inside and outInvestigate and unravel them so as to see them clearly  and while youre investigating them dont concern yourself with any other work more than with the work of investigationUse discernment to investigate in order really to know really to see these things as they are and uproot the counterfeit labels and assumptions that say that theyre pretty and beautiful lovely and attractiveInvestigate so as to penetrate to the truth that there is nothing at all beautiful or attractive about themTheyre thoroughly filthy and repulsive your body and the bodies of others all without exceptionTheyre all filled with filthy and repulsive thingsIf you look in line with the principles of the truth thats how they areDiscernment investigates peering inward so as to see clear through  from the skin outside on into the inside which is putrid with all kinds of filth  for the sake of seeing clearly exactly what is pretty what is beautiful what is lovely and attractiveTheres nothing of the sort in any bodyThere are only the lying defilements that have planted these notions thereWhen we have really investigated on in we see that these notions are all falseThe genuine truth is that these bodies arent pretty or beautifulTheyre nothing but repulsiveWhen they fall apart what are theyWhen they fall apart earth is earth  because earth is what it already was when it was still in the bodyThe properties of water wind and fire were already water wind and fire when they were in the bodyWhen the body falls apart where do these things ever become gods and Brahmas heaven and nibbanaThey have to be earth water wind and fire in line with their natureThis is how discernment investigates and analyzes so as to see clearlyThis is how we use clearseeing discernment to clear away the things obstructing and distorting our visionNow theres no more such thing as being constricted or blockedOur discernment if we use it has to be discernment all the day longWherever discernment penetrates it sees clearly clears away its doubts and lets go step by step until it lets go once and for all from having known thoroughlyOnce it has investigated blatant things so as to know them clearly where will the mind then goOnce it has investigated blatant things and known them clearly its as if it has completely uprooted the blatant defilements that have planted thorns in different objects such as our own bodySo now where will the defilements goWill they fly awayThey can only shrink inward to find a hiding place when they are chased inside and attacked by mindfulness and discernmentFeelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance These are simply individual conditions by their nature but they are under the control of defilementDefilement is the basis from which they spring so it has to regard itself as being in chargeIt uses labels to make them defilementIt forms thoughtformations so as to make them defilementIt cognizes and takes note so as to make these things defilementHowever many feelings arise it makes them all defilementDefilement cant make things into DhammaIt has to be defilement all the day longThis is how it builds itself in its various branchesSoInvestigate on inSlash on inFeelings of pleasure and pain They exist both in the body and in the mindFeeling isnt defilementIf we look in line with the principles of nature its simply a realityThe assumption that Im pained or Im pleased  delusion with pain delusion with pleasure delusion with feelings of indifference in the body and mind These things are defilementThe assumptions and delusions are defilementWhen we really investigate inward the various feelings arent defilement these four mental phenomena arent defilementOnce weve spotted our assumptions and construings they retreat inwardThe feelings that still exist in the body and mind even though they arent yet thoroughly understood are still greatly lightenedWe begin to gain an inkling of their ways step by stepWere not deluded to the point of complete blindness as we were before we investigatedWhichever aspects of feeling are blatant and associated with the body we know clearlyWe can let go of bodily feelingsWe can understand themAs for feelings remaining in the mind for the most part theyre refined feelings of pleasureWe know and let go of them in the same way when the path gains powerThese feelings of pleasure are like fish in a trap No matter what theres no way they can escape getting cookedThey cant swim down into large ponds and lakes as they used toThey can only sit waiting for their dying dayThe same holds true for the refined feeling of pleasure  which is a conventional reality  within the heartIt can only wait for the day it will be disbanded as a convention when the ultimate ease which is not a convention comes to rule the heart through the complete penetration of mindfulness and discernmentSo investigate on in until you understand reaching the point of letting go with no more concernsWhat is sañña labelingLabeling this labeling that making assumptions about this and that These are all affairs of defilement using saññaWhen cognizance takes note it too is turned into defilementSo we investigate these things using discernment in the same way as when we investigate feelingsWe then understandWhen we understand these things become simply cognizance taking note simply sañña labeling without labeling so as to be defilement without taking note so as to be defilementDefilement then retreats further and further inwardUltimately these five issues  namely the physical khandha our body the vedana khandha feelings in the body the sañña khandha the sankhara khandha and the viññana khandha  are all clearly known in the heart with no more doubtsThe defilements gather inward converge inwardThey cant go out roaming because theyll get slashed to bits by mindfulness and discernmentSo they have to withdraw inward to find a hiding placeThis in actuality is what the investigation is like and not otherwiseIn our investigation as meditators when discernment reaches any particular level well know for ourselves step by stepBoth defilement and discernment Well know both sides at the same timeWhen discernment is very strong defilement grows weakerMindfulness and discernment become even more courageous and unflinchingThe words laziness and lethargy which are affairs of defilement disappearWe keep moving in with persistence day and nightThis is the way it is when the path gains strengthAs meditators you should take note of this and practice so as to know it and see it so as to make it your own treasure arising in your heartYour doubts will then be ended in every wayWe now take this atomic mindfulness and discernment and shoot it into the central point of conventional reality the point that causes living beings to founder in the wheel of the cycle so that they cant find their way out dont know the way out dont know the ways of birth dont know who has been born as what where they have died what burdens of suffering and stress they have carriedMindfulness and discernment go crashing down into that point until it is scattered to piecesAnd so now how can we not know what it is that has caused us to take birth and dieThere is only defilement that is the important seed causing us to take birth and die causing us to suffer pain and stressThe true Dhamma hasnt caused us to sufferIt has brought us nothing but pleasure and ease in line with its levels in line with the levels of what is noble and goodThe things that give rise to major and minor sufferings are all affairs of defilementWe can see this clearlyWe can know this clearlyEspecially when defilement has been completely scattered from the heart its as if the earth and sky collapseHow can this not send a tremor through the three levels of the cosmos because this thing is what has wandered throughout the three levels of the cosmosWhen it has been made to collapse within the heart what is the heart like nowHow does the outer space of the Dhamma differ from the outer space of the worldNow we know clearlyThe outer space of this purified mind Is it annihilationThe outer space of the world isnt annihilationIf it were annihilation they wouldnt call it outer spaceIts a nature that exists in line with the principles of its nature as outer spaceThe outer space of the mind released from all forms of gravitational pull ie conventional reality What is it likeEven though weve never known it before when we come to know it we wont have any doubtsEven though weve never seen it before when we come to see it we wont have any doubtsEven though weve never experienced it before when we come to experience it we wont have any doubtsWe wont have to search for witnesses to confirm it the way we do with conventions in generalIts sanditthiko  immediately apparent  and only this fits perfectly with our heart and that outer space mindThis is what we referred to at the beginning when we talked about the outer space of the world and the outer space of the mindThe outer space of the mind  the mind of nibbana  is like thatJust where is it annihilatedWho experiences the outer space of the mindIf it were annihilation who could experience itAs for where it will or wont be reborn we already know that theres no way for it to be rebornWe know this clearlyWeve removed every defilement or conventional reality that would lead to rebirthConventional reality is the same thing as defilementAll things  no matter how subtle  that have been dangers to the heart for such a long time have been completely destroyedAll that remains is the pure outer space of the mind the mind that is pureYou can call it outer space you can call it anything at all because the world has its conventions so we have to make differentiations to use in line with the conventions of the world so as not to conflictWhen we reach the level of the outer space mind how does it feel for the mind to have been coerced oppressed and subject to the pull of all things base and vile full of stress and great sufferings for aeons and aeonsWe dont have to reflect on how many lifetimes its beenWe can take the principle of the present as our evidenceNow the mind is releasedWeve seen how much suffering there has been and now weve abandoned it once and for allWeve absolutely destroyed its seeds beginning with avijjapaccaya sankhara  With unawareness as condition there occur mental formations All that remains is avijjayatveva asesaviraganirodha sankharanirodho  Simply with the disbanding of unawareness with no remaining passion thoughtformations disband Thats the outer space of the mindThe mind released from all gravitational forces Even though its still alive and directing the khandhas theres nothing to bar its thoughts its vision its knowledgeTheres nothing to obstruct it nothing to make it worried or relieved nothing to make it brave nothing to make it afraidIt is simply its own nature by itself always independent in that wayFor this reason knowledge of all truths has to be completely open to this unobstructed and unoppressed mindIt can know and seeIf we speak of matters related to the body and khandhas we can speak in every way without faltering because theres nothing to hinder usOnly the defilements are what kept us from seeing what we saw and from describing the things we should have been able to describe because we didnt know we didnt seeWhat we knew was bits and piecesWe didnt know the full truth of these various thingsWhen this was the case how could we know clearlyHow could we speak clearlyAll we knew was bits and pieces so when we spoke it had to be bits and pieces as wellBut once weve shed these things everything is wide openThe mind is free vast and empty without limits without boundsTheres nothing to enclose or obscure itWhen we know we really know the truthWhen we see we really see the truthWhen we speak we can speak the truthYou can call the mind brave or notbrave as you like because we speak in line with what we experience what we know and see so why cant we speakWe can know we can see so why cant we speak for these things exist as they have from the beginningWhen the Buddha proclaimed the Dhamma to the world he took the things that existed and that he saw in line with what he had known  everything of every sort  and proclaimed them to the worldThink of how broad it was the knowledge of the Buddha how subtle and profound  because nothing was concealed or mysterious to himEverything was completely opened to himThis is why hes called lokavidu  one who knows the world clearly  through the vastness of his mind that had nothing to enclose or conceal it at allAloko udapadi Brightness arose His mind was bright toward the truth both by day and by nightThis is how the Buddha knewThe Noble Disciples all knew in the same way except that his range and theirs differed in breadthBut as for knowing the truth it was the same for them allHere weve described both the benefits and the harm of the things involved with the mind  in other words both the Dhamma and the defilements  for you as meditators to listen to and contemplate in earnestnessSoLets try to develop our minds so as to shoot out beyond this world of conventional realities to see what its likeThen we wont have to ask where the Buddha is how many Buddhas there have been whether the Noble Disciples really exist or how many they are  because the one truth that we know and see clearly in our hearts resonates to all the Buddhas all the Noble Disciples and all the Dhamma that existsWe wont have any doubts because the nature that knows and exists within us contains them all all the Buddhas the community of Noble Disciples and all the Dhamma that existsIts a nature just right in its every aspect with nothing for us to doubtThis is the place  if we speak in terms of place  where we run out of doubts about everything of every sortWe oversee the khandhas which are simply conventions of the world just as all the Noble Disciples do while they are still livingAs for the mind it has gained release and remains released in that wayAs we have said even though it remains in the midst of the world of conventions this nature is its own nature and those other things are their own affairsEach is a separate reality that doesnt mingle join or have an effect on the othersWhen we say release from the world this is what we meanAll of the Dhammas I have mentioned here When do they existAnd when dont they existThe Dhamma exists at all times and in all placesIts akaliko timelessSo I ask that you penetrate into the Dhamma of these four Noble TruthsYoull be right on target with the results of the Buddha and the Noble Disciples and theres no doubt but that youll be right on target with the results of the Buddhas and the Noble Disciples workTheir workplace is in these four Noble Truths and the results that come from the work are the paths fruitions and nibbanaThey arise right hereTheyre located right hereWhen we have practiced and reached them fully and completely there will be nothing for us to questionThis is why there wont be any reason to doubt the time of the Buddha as compared to our own time as to whether the Dhamma of the Buddha was different because the defilements are now different from what they were thenThe defilements then and now are all of the same sortThe Dhamma is all of the same sortIf we cure defilement in the same way were bound to gain release in the same wayThere is no other way to gain release no matter what the day and ageThere is only this one way following the way of the path beginning with virtue concentration and discernment to eliminate defilement the cause of stress  in particular craving for sensuality craving for becoming and craving for no becoming  completely from the heartAs for nirodha the cessation of stress When defilement is disbanded from where will any more suffering or stress ariseWhen defilement and stress are disbanded for good thats the outer space of the mindAs for the Noble Truths theyre activities or our workplaceThe result that comes from these four Noble Truths is something else entirelyAs Ive always been telling you What is it that knows that stress and the cause of stress disbandWhen the path has performed its duties to the full and has completely wiped out the cause of stress then nirodha  the cessation of stress  appears in full measure after which it disbands as well because it too is a conventional realityAs for the one who knows that the cause of stress has disbanded by being eradicated through the path so as to give rise to the cessation of stress The one who knows this is the pure one  the outer space of the mind  and thats the end of the matterSo investigate carefullyListen carefully when you listen to the Dhamma while putting it to useWhen we work we cant let go of our toolsFor instance if were working with an ax the ax has to be at handIf were working with a knife the knife has to be at handIf were working with a chisel the chisel has to be at handBut when weve finished our work we let go of our chisel we let go of our various toolsSo here the virtue concentration and discernment that are called the path are our tools in the work of eliminating defilementWe have to keep them right at hand while we are workingWhen we have eliminated defilement until its completely defeated and nothing is left these tools are phenomena that let go of themselves of their own accord without our having to force themAs Ive always been saying the teachings on inconstancy stress and notself are our pathWe cant let go of themWe have to investigate things with mindfulness and discernment so as to see them clearly in line with the principles of inconstancy stress and notselfOnce were ready and weve run the full course we let go of these principles in line with the truthWe dont call anything notselfEach thing is a separate reality with no quarrelingThis is the Dhamma It has many stages many levels so those who listen have to make distinctions because in this talk Ive discussed many stages on many levels back and forth so as to make things plain for those listeningTo summarize The marketplace of the paths fruitions and nibbana is located in the Noble TruthsIt isnt located anywhere elseSo whatever else make sure that you attain themAccelerate your efforts to the full extent of your abilityUse all the mindfulness and discernment you have to contemplate and investigate things in order to see them clearlySee what its like to set them spinning as a wheel of Dhamma which the Buddha has described as supermindfulness and superdiscernmentWhen we start out practicing how can they immediately become supermindfulness and superdiscernmentWhen children are born they dont immediately become adultsThey have to be nourished and guarded and cared forThink of how much it takes how much it costs for each child to become an adult as we all haveMindfulness and discernment need to be nourished and guarded in just the same wayWhen we nourish and guard them unceasingly unflaggingly they grow bold and capable until they become supermindfulness and superdiscernmentThen they attack the defilements  no matter what the sort  until the defilements are slashed to pieces with nothing left so that we attain purity  release and nibbana  within our own heart which will then have the highest valueWhether or not anyone else confers titles on it we ourselves dont confer titlesWeve reached sufficiency so what is there to gain by conferring titlesAll thats left is the gentleness and tenderness of purity blended into one with benevolenceThe entire mind is filled with benevolenceThe Buddha taught the beings of the world through his benevolenceHis mind was completely gentle toward every living being in the three levels of the cosmosHe didnt exalt or demean any of them at allSabbe satta  May all living beings who are fellows in suffering birth aging illness and death  avera hontu  be free from enmity all the way to sukhi attanam pariharantu  may they maintain themselves with ease That was his benevolenceHe gave equality to all living beingsHe didnt lean because his mind didnt have anything to leanIt didnt have any defilements infiltrating it that could make it leanThe things leaning this way and that are all affairs of defilementWhen theres pure Dhamma the mind keeps its balance with pure fairness so theres no leaningIts a principle of nature that stays as it isSo I ask that you all take this and earnestly put it into practiceGain release so as to see it clearly in your heartHow do they compare this heart as its currently coerced and oppressed and the heart when it has attained release from coercion and oppressionHow do they differ in valueCome to see this clearly in your own heartYou wont see it anywhere elseSanditthiko Its immediately apparent within the person who practicesSo thenThis seems to be enough explanation for nowThe search for inner wealth is much the same as the search for outer wealthIn searching for outer wealth intelligent people have no problems They can find it easilyBut stupid people have lots of difficultiesLook around and youll see that poor people are many while rich people are fewThis shows that stupid people are many while intelligent people are few which is why there are more poor people than rich peopleIn the search for inner wealth  virtue and goodness  the same holds true It depends more on ingenuity than on any other factorIf were stupid then even if we sit right at the hem of the Buddhas robe or the robe of one of his Noble Disciples the only result well get will be our own stupidityTo gain ingenuity or virtue from the Buddha or his Noble Disciples is very difficult for a stupid person because inner wealth depends on ingenuity and intelligenceIf we have no ingenuity we wont be able to find any inner wealth to provide happiness and ease for the heartExternal wealth is something were all familiar withMoney material goods living things and things without life All of these things are counted as wealthThey are said to belong to whoever has rights over themThe same holds true with the virtue and goodness we call meritIf unintelligent people search for merit and try to develop virtue and goodness like the people around them the results will depend on their ingenuity and stupidityIf they have little ingenuity theyll gain little meritAs for those of us who have ordained in the Buddhas religion our aim is to develop ourselves so as to gain release from suffering and stress just like a person who aims singlemindedly at being a millionairePeople in the world have basically three sorts of attitudesThe first sort Some people are born in the midst of poverty and deprivation because their parents are ignorant with no wealth at their disposalThey make their living by beggingWhen they wake up in the morning they go begging from house to house street to street sometimes getting enough to eat sometimes notTheir children fall into the same kamma currentThats the kind of potential theyve developed so they have to be born to impoverished parents of that sortThey just dont have it in them to think of being millionaires like those in the world of the wealthyThe parents to whom they are born act as a mould so they are lazy and ignorant like their parentsThey live in suffering with their parents and go out begging with them sometimes eating their fill sometimes notBut this is still better than other sorts of peopleSome parents are not only poor but also earn their living by thievery and robberyWhatever they get to feed their children they tell their children what it is and where it came fromThe children get this sort of education from their parents and grow up nourished by impure things  things gained through dishonesty thievery and robbery  so when they grow up they dont have to think of looking for work or for any education at the age when they should be looking for learning because theyve already received their education from their parents education in stealing cheating thievery and robbery laziness and crookednessThis is because their parents have acted as blackboards covered with writing their actions and the manners of their every movementEvery child born to them receives training in how to act to speak and to thinkEverything is thus an education from the parents because the writing and teachings are all there on the blackboard of the parentsLaziness dishonesty deceit thievery Every branch of evil is there in the writing on the blackboardThe children learn to read to draw to write all from their parents and fill themselves with the sort of knowledge that has the world up in flamesAs they begin to grow up they take over their parents duties by pilfering this and that until they gradually become hoodlums creating trouble for society at largeThis is one of the major fires burning away at society without stopThe reasons that people can be so destructive on a large scale like this can come either from their parents from their own innate character or from associating with evil dishonest peopleThis is the sort of attitude found in people of one sortThe second sort of people have the attitude that even though they wont be millionaires they will still have enough to eat and to use like people in general and that they will be good citizens like the rest of society so that they can maintain a decent reputationPeople of this sort are relatively hardworking and rarely lazyThey have enough possessions to get by on a level with the general run of good citizensWhen they have children the children take their parents as examples as writing on the blackboard from which they learn their work their behavior and all their mannersOnce they gain this knowledge from their parents they put it to use and become good citizens themselves with enough wealth to get by without hardships able to keep up with the world so that they dont lose face or cause their families any shameThey can relate to the rest of society with confidence and without being a disgrace to their relatives or to society in generalThey behave in line with their ideals until they become good citizens with enough wealth to keep themselves out of povertyThese are the attitudes of the second sort of peopleThe third sort of people have attitudes that differ from those of the first two sorts in that theyre determined no matter what to possess more wealth than anyone else in the worldThey are headed in this direction from the very beginning because they have earned the opportunity to be born in families rich in virtue and material wealthThey learn ingenuity and industriousness from their parents because their parents work hard at commerce and devote themselves fully to all their business activitiesWhatever the parents do the children will have to seeWhatever the parents say with regard to their work inside or outside the home near or far the children  who are students by nature  will have to listen and take it to heart because the children are not only students but also their parents closest and most trusted helpersThe parents cant overlook themEventually they become the supervisors of the parents workers inside and outside the home and in all the businesses set up by their parentsIn all of the activities for which the parents are responsible the children will have to be students and workers at the same time keeping an eye and an ear out to observe and contemplate what is going on around themAll activities whether in the area of the world such as commerce or in the area of the Dhamma  such as maintaining the precepts chanting and meditating  are things the children will have to study and pick up from their parentsThus parents shouldnt be complacent in their good and bad activities acting as they like and thinking that the children wont be able to pick things up from themThis sort of attitude is not at all fitting because the way people treat and mistreat the religion and the nations institutions comes from what they learn as childrenDont think that it comes from anywhere else for no one has ever put old people in schoolWe should thus realize that children begin learning the principles of nature step by step from the day they are born until their parents send them for formal schoolingThe principles of nature are everywhere so that anyone who is interested  child or adult  can study them at any time unlike formal studies and book learning which come into being at some times and change or disappear at othersFor this reason parents are the most influential mould for their children in the way they look after them give them love and affection and provide their education both in the principles of nature and in the basic subjects that the children should pick up from themThis is because all children come ready to learn from the adults and the other children around themWhether they will be good children or bad depends on the knowledge they pick up from around themWhen this is stored up in their hearts it will exert pressure on their behavior making it good or bad as we see all around usThis comes mainly from what they learn of the principles of nature which are rarely taught in school but which people pick up more quickly than anything that schoolteachers teachThus parents and teachers should give special attention to every child for whom they are responsibleEven when parents put their children to work helping with the buying and selling at home the children are learning the livelihood of buying and selling from their parents  picking up along the way their parents strong and weak pointsWe can see this from the way children pick up the parents religionHowever good or bad right or wrong the religion may be  even if its worshipping spirits  the children are bound to pick up their parents beliefs and practicesIf the parents cherish moral virtue the children will follow their example cherishing moral virtue and following the practices of their parentsThis third sort of person is thus very industrious and hardworking and so reaps better and more outstanding results than the other two sortsWhen we classify people in this way we can see that people of the first sort are the laziest and most ignorantAt the same time they make themselves disreputable and objects of the scorn of good people in generalPeople of the second sort are fairly hardworking and fairly welloff while those of the third sort are determined to be wealthier than the rest of the world and at the same time are very hardworking because since they have set their sights high they cant just sit around doing nothingThey are very persevering and very persistent in their work going all out to find ways to earn wealth devoting themselves to their efforts and to being ingenious circumspect and uncomplacent in all their activitiesPeople of this sort even if they dont become millionaires are important and deserve to be set up as good examples for the people of the nation at largeWe monks fall into the same three sortsThe first sort includes those who are ordained only in name only as a ceremony who dont aim for the Dhamma for reasonability or for whats good or rightThey aim simply at living an easy life because they dont have to work hard like lay peopleOnce ordained they become very lazy and very wellknown for quarreling with their fellow monksInstead of gaining merit from being ordained as most people might think they end up filling themselves and those around them with suffering and evilThe second sort of monk aims at what is reasonableIf he can manage to gain release from suffering thats what he wantsHe believes that there is merit and so he wants itHe believes that there is evil so he wants really to understand good and evilHe is fairly hardworking and intelligentHe follows the teachings of the Dhamma and Vinaya well and so doesnt offend his fellow monksHe is interested in studying and diligently practicing the threefold training of virtue concentration and discernmentHe takes instruction easily has faith in the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya is intent on his duties and believes in what is reasonableThe third sort of monk becomes ordained out of a true sense of faith and convictionEven if he may not have had much of an education from any teachers in the beginning once he has become ordained and gains instruction from his teachers or from the texts that give a variety of reasons showing how to act so as to head toward evil and how to strive so as to head toward the good he immediately takes it as a lesson for training himselfThe more he studies from his teachers the stronger his faith and conviction grow to the point where he develops a firm singleminded determination to gain release from suffering and stressWhether sitting standing walking or lying down he doesnt flag in his determinationHe is always firmly intent on gaining release from suffering and stressHes very persistent and hardworkingWhatever he does he does with his full heart aiming at reason aiming at the DhammaThis third sort of monk is the uncomplacent sortHe observes the precepts for the sake of real purity and observes them with great careHe is uncomplacent both in training his mind in concentration and in giving rise to discernmentHe is intent on training the basic mindfulness and discernment he already has as an ordinary runofthemill person so that they become more and more capable step by step making them the sort of mindfulness and discernment that can keep abreast of his every action until they become supermindfulness and superdiscernment capable of shedding all defilements and mental effluents from the heartHe thus becomes one of the amazing people of the religion earning the homage and respect of people at largeIn the area of the world there are three sorts of people and in the area of the Dhamma there are three sorts of monksWhich of the three are we going to choose to beWhen we come right down to it each of these three types refers to each of us because we can make ourselves into any of them making them appear within us  because these three types are simply for the purpose of comparisonWhen we refer them to ourselves we can be any of the threeWe can be the type who makes himself vile and lazy with no interest in the practice of the Dhamma with no value at all or we can make ourselves into the second or third sortIt all depends on how our likes and desires will affect our attitudes in our thoughts words and deedsWhichever type we want to be we should adapt our thoughts words and deeds to fit the typeThe affairs of that sort of person will then become our own affairs because none of these sorts lies beyond usWe can change our behavior to fit in with any of the threeIf we are going to be the third sort of person then no matter what we are sure to release ourselves from suffering and stress someday in the future or in this very lifetimeSo be uncomplacent in all your activities mindful of your efforts and actions and discerning with regard to your affairs at all timesDont let the activities of your thoughts words and deeds go straying down the wrong pathTry to train your mindfulness and discernment to stay involved with your activities at all timesTo safeguard these sorts of things isnt as difficult as safeguarding external wealth because inner wealth stays with us which makes it possible to safeguard itAs a monk you have only one dutyWhen sitting be aware that youre sittingWhatever issue you think about know that youre thinkingDont assume that any issue comes from anywhere other than from a lapse of mindfulness in your own heart which makes wrong issues  from minor ones to major ones  start spreading to your own detrimentAll of this comes from your own lack of watchfulness and restraintIt doesnt come from anything elseIf you want to gain release from suffering and stress in this lifetime then see the dangers of your own errors your complacency and your lack of mindfulnessSee them as your enemiesIf in your eyes the currents of the mind that spin to give rise to the cravings and mental effluents termed the origin of stress are something good then youre sure to go underBe quick to shed these things immediatelyDont let them lie fermenting in your heartThose who see danger in the round of rebirth must see the danger as lying in the accumulation of defilementYour duties in the practice are like the fence and walls of a house that protect you stage by stage from dangerIn performing your duties that constitute the effort of the practice you have to keep your mindfulness with those duties and not let it lapseNourish your mindfulness and discernment so that they are always circumspect in all your affairsDont let them flow away on the habitual urges of the heartYou can then be sure that the affairs of the mind will not in any way lie beyond the power of your effort and controlSo I ask that each of you be mindful  and dont let your mindfulness conjecture ahead or behind with thoughts of the past or futureAlways keep it aware of your activities and you will be able to go beyond this mass of suffering and stressEven if your mind hasnt yet attained stillness it will begin to be still through the power of mindfulnessThere is no need to doubt this for the mind cant lie beyond the power of mindfulness and discernment coupled with persistent effortOf the famous meditation masters of our present era VenAcariya Mun is the one I admire and respect the mostIn my opinion he is the most outstanding teacher of our day and ageLiving and studying with him I never saw him act in any way at odds with the Dhamma and VinayaHis behavior was in such harmony with the Dhamma and Vinaya that it was never a cause for doubt among those who studied with himFrom my experience in living with him Id say that he was right in line with the path of those who practice rightly straightly methodically and noblyHe never strayed from this path at allWhen he would tell us about the beginning stages of his practice hed talk about how he had tried to develop mindfulnessHe liked to live aloneIf others were living with him they would get in the way of his meditationIf he could get away on his own hed find that mindfulness and discernment were coupled with his efforts at all timesHe would stay with his efforts both day and nightIt was as if his hand was never free from its workMindfulness converged with his mind so that they were never willing to leave their endeavorsHe had resolved never to return to this world of continual death and rebirthNo matter what he would have to gain release from suffering and stress in this lifetime and never ask to be reborn againEven being born into this present lifetime had him disgusted enough but when he also saw the birth aging illness and death of human beings and living beings in general day and night together with the blatant sufferings caused by the oppression and cruelties of the strong over the weak it made him feel even greater dismay which is why he asked not to be reborn ever againThe way he asked not to be reborn was to take the effort of the practice as the witness within his heartWherever he lived he asked to live with the effort of the practiceHe didnt want anything else that would delay his release from sufferingThis is what he would tell us when the opportunity aroseWhatever knowledge or understanding he had gained in the various places he had lived he wouldnt keep from usWhen he lived there his mind was like that when he lived here his mind was like thisHe even told us about the time his mind realized the land of its hopesThe way each persons mind progresses is purely an individual matterIts not something we can imitate from one anotherEven the various realizations we have and the means of expression we use in teaching ourselves our fellow meditators and people in general have to be a matter of our own individual wealth in line with our habits and capabilities just as a millionaire with lots of wealth uses his own millionaires wealth while a poor person with little wealth makes use of his own wealthEach person no matter how rich or poor makes use of the wealth he or she has been able to accumulateIn the area of habits and capabilities how much we may possess depends entirely on ourselvesThese arent things we can borrow from one anotherWe have to depend on the capabilities we develop from withinThis is why our habits manners and conversation our knowledge and intelligence our shallowness and depth differ from person to person in line with our capabilitiesEven though I studied with VenAcariya Mun for a long time I cant guarantee that I could take his Dhamma as my own and teach it to othersAll I can say is that I depend on however much my own knowledge and capabilities may be in line with my own strengths which is just right for me and doesnt overstep the bounds of what is fitting for meAs for VenAcariya Mun he was very astute at teachingFor example he wouldnt talk about the major pointsHed talk only about how to get thereAs soon as hed get to the major points hed detour around them and reappear further on aheadThis is the way it would be every timeHe was never willing to open up about the major pointsAt first I didnt understand what his intentions were in acting this way and it was only later that I understoodWhether Im right or wrong I have to ask your forgiveness for he was very astute in keeping with the fact that he had taught so many studentsThere were two reasons why he wouldnt open up about the major pointsOne is that those who werent really intent on the Dhamma would take his teachings as a shield claiming them to be their own as a way of advertising themselves and making a livingThe other reason is that the Dhamma that was a principle of nature he had known and might describe was not something that could be conjectured about in advanceOnce those who were strongly intent on the Dhamma reached those points in their investigation if they had heard him describe those points beforehand would be sure to have subtle assumptions or presuppositions infiltrating their minds at that moment and so they would assume that they understood that level of Dhamma when actually those assumptions would be a cause for selfdelusion without their even realizing itAs far as these two considerations are concerned I must admit that Im very foolish because of my good intentions toward those who come intent on studying with meIm not the least bit secretiveIve revealed everything all along without holding anything back not even the things that should be held backIve been open to the full extent of my ability which has turned into a kind of foolishness without my being aware of itThis has caused those who are really intent on studying with me to misunderstand latching onto these things as assumptions that turn into their enemies concealing the true Dhamma all because I may lack some circumspection with regard to this second considerationVenAcariya Mun was very astute both in external and in internal mattersOn the external level he wouldnt be willing to disclose things too readilySometimes after listening to him youd have to take two or three days to figure out what he meantThis at least was the way things were for meWhether or not this was the way they were for my fellow students I never had the chance to find outBut as for me Id use all my strength to ponder anything he might say that seemed to suggest an approach to the practice and sometimes after three days of pondering the riddle of his words I still couldnt make heads or tails of itId have to go and tell him What you said the other day Ive been pondering it for three days and still cant understand what you meantI dont know where to grab hold of it so that I can put it to use or how much meaning your words hadHed smile a bit and say OhSo theres someone actually pondering what I saySo Id answer Im pondering but pondering out of stupidity not with any intelligenceHed then respond a little by saying We all have to start out by being stupidNo one has ever brought intelligence or wealth along at birthOnly after we set our mind on learning and pondering things persistently can we become intelligent and astute to the point where we can gain wealth and status and can have other people depend on usThe same holds true with the DhammaNo one has ever been a millionaire in the Dhamma or an arahant at birthThats all he would sayHe wouldnt disclose what the right way would be to interpret the teaching that had preoccupied me for two or three days runningIt was only later that I realized why he wouldnt disclose thisIf he had disclosed it he would have been encouraging my stupidityIf we get used simply to having things handed to us readymade from other people without producing anything with our own intelligence then when the time comes where were in a tight spot and cant depend on anything readymade from other people were sure to go under if we cant think of a way to help ourselvesThis is probably what he was thinking which is why he wouldnt solve this sort of problem when Id ask himStudying with him wasnt simply a matter of studying teachings about the DhammaYou had to adapt and accustom yourself to the practices he followed until they were firmly impressed in your own thoughts words and deedsLiving with him a long time was the way to observe his habits practices virtues and understanding bit by bit day by day until they were solid within youThere was a lot of safety in living with himBy and large people who studied with him have received a great deal of trust and respect because he himself was all DhammaThose who lived with him were bound to pick up that Dhamma in line with their abilitiesAt the same time staying with him made you accustomed to being watchful and restrainedIf you left him and were intent on the Dhamma youd be able to take care of yourself using the various approaches you had gained from himWhen youd stay with him it was as if the paths fruitions and nibbana were right within reachEverything you did was solid and got results step by stepBut when you left him it wouldnt be that way at allIt would turn into the other side of the world If the mind didnt yet have a firm basis thats the way it would usually beBut if the mind had a firm basis  in other words if it had concentration and discernment looking after it  then you could benefit from living anywhereIf any doubts arose that you couldnt handle yourself youd have to go running back to him for adviceOnce hed suggest a solution the problem would usually disappear in an instant as if he had cut it away for youFor me at least thats the way it would beSometimes I would have left him for only five or six days when a problem started bothering me and I couldnt stand to wait another two or three daysIf I couldnt solve this sort of problem the moment it arose then the next morning Id have to head right back to him because some of these problems could be very criticalOnce they arose and I couldnt solve them myself Id have to hurry back to him for adviceBut other problems arent especially criticalEven when they arise you can waitProblems of this sort are like diseasesWhen some diseases arise theres no need to hurry for a doctorBut with other diseases if we cant get the doctor to come we have to go to the doctor ourselvesOtherwise our life will be in dangerWhen these critical sorts of problems arise if we cant handle them ourselves we have to hurry to find a teacherWe cant just leave them alone hoping that theyll go away on their ownThe results that can come from these problems that we dont take to our teachers to solve At the very least we can become disoriented deluded or unbalanced at worst we can go crazyWhen they say that a persons meditation crashes it usually comes from this sort of problem that he or she doesnt know how to solve  isnt willing to solve  and simply lets fester until one of these two sorts of results appearI myself have had these sorts of problems with my mind which is why Im telling you about them so that you can know how to deal with themThe day VenAcariya Mun died I was filled with a strong sense of despair from the feeling that I had lost a mainstay for my heart because at the time there was still a lot of unsettled business in my heart and it was the sort of knowledge that wasnt willing to submit easily to anyones approaches if they werent right on target  the way VenAcariya Mun had been and that had given results  with the spots where I was stuck and that I was ponderingAt the same time it was a period in which I was accelerating my efforts at full speedSo when VenAcariya Mun died I couldnt stand staying with my fellow studentsMy only thought was that I wanted to live aloneSo I tried to find a place where I could stay by myselfI was determined that I would stay alone until every sort of problem in my heart had been completely resolvedOnly then would I stay with others and accept students as the occasion aroseAfter VenAcariya Muns death I went to bow down at his feet and then sat there reflecting with dismay for almost two hours my tears flowing into a pool at his feetAt the same time I was pondering in my heart the Dhamma and the teachings he had been so kind to give me during the eight years I had lived with himLiving together for such a long time as this even a husband and wife or parents and children who love one another deeply are bound to have some problems or resentments from time to timeBut between VenAcariya Mun and the students who had come to depend on his sheltering influence for such a long time there had never been any issues at allThe longer I had stayed with him the more I had felt an unlimited love and respect for himAnd now he had left me and all my wellintentioned fellow studentsAnicca vata sankhara Formations  how inconstant they areHis body lay still looking noble and more precious than my life which I would have readily given up for his sake out of my love for himMy body was also still as I sat there but my mind was in agitation from a sense of despair and my loss of his sheltering influenceBoth bodies were subject to the same principle of the Dhamma  inconstancy  and followed the teaching that says uppajjitva nirujjhanti Having been born they are bound to dieTheres no other way it could beBut as for VenAcariya Mun he had taken a path different from that of conventional reality in line with the teaching tesam vupasamo sukho In their stilling is easeHe had died in this lifetime lying still for just this brief span of time so that his students could reflect with resignation on the Dhamma but from now on he would never be reborn to be a source for his students tears againHis mind had now separated from becoming and birth in the same way that a rock split into two pieces can never be truly rejoinedSo I sat there reflecting with despairThe problems in my heart that I had once unburdened with him With whom would I unburden them nowThere was no longer anyone who could unburden and erase my problems the way he hadI was left to fend for myselfIt was as if he had been a doctor who had cured my illnesses countless times and who was the one person with whom I had entrusted my life  and now the doctor who had given me life was goneId have to become a beast of the forest for I had no more medicine to treat my inner diseasesWhile I was sitting there reminiscing sadly about him with love respect and despair I came to a number of realizationsHow had he taught me while he was still aliveThose were the points Id have to take as my teachersWhat was the point he had stressed repeatedlyDont ever stray from your foundation namely what knows within the heartWhenever the mind comes to any unusual knowledge or realizations that could become detrimental if you arent able to investigate your way past that sort of knowledge then turn the mind back within itself and no matter what no damage will be done That was what he had taught so I took hold of that point and continued to apply it in my own practice to the full extent of my abilityTo be a senior monk comes from being a junior monk as we see all around us and will all experienceWe all meet with difficulties whether were junior or seniorThis is the path we all must takeWe must follow the path of difficulty that is the path toward progress both in the area of the world and in the area of the DhammaNo one has ever become a millionaire by being lazy or by lying around doing nothingTo be a millionaire has to come from being persevering which in turn has to take the path of difficulty  difficulty for the sake of our proper aimsThis is the path wealthy and astute people always followEven in the area of the Dhamma we should realize that difficulty is the path of sages on every level beginning with the Buddha himselfThe Dhamma affirms this Dukkhassanantaram sukham  people gain ease by following the path of difficultyAs for the path to suffering sukhassanantaram dukkham  people gain difficulties by following the path of easeWhoever is diligent and doesnt regard difficulty as an obstacle whoever explores without ceasing the conditions of nature all around him will become that third sort of person the sort who doesnt ask to be reborn in this world the sort who tesam vupasamo sukho  eradicates the seeds for the rebirth of any sort of formation experiencing an ease undisturbed by worldly baits an ease that is genuinely satisfyingSoI ask that all of you as meditators keep these three sorts of people in mind and choose for yourselves which of the three is the most outstanding within you right now  because we can all make ourselves outstanding with no need to fear that it will kill usThe effort to gain release from suffering and stress in the Lord Buddhas footsteps isnt an executioner waiting to behead the person who strives in the right directionBe brave in freeing yourself from your bonds and entanglementsThe stress and difficulties that come as a shadow of the khandhas are things that everyone has to bear as a burdenWe cant lie to one another about thisEach person has to suffer from worries and stress because of his or her own khandhasKnow that the entire world has to suffer in the same way you do with the khandhas you are overseeing right nowDont let yourself be content to cycle through birth aging illness and deathBe uncomplacent at all timesYou shouldnt have any doubts about birth because the Buddha has already told us that birth and death are outandout sufferingDont let yourself wonder if they are flowers or sweets or any sort of food you can eat to your satisfactionActually they are nothing but poisonThey are things that have deceived us all in our stupidity to be born and to die in heaps in this world of suffering and stressIf we die in a state of humanity theres some hope for us because of the openings for rebirth we have made for ourselves through the power of our good deedsBut there are not just a few people out there who are foolish and deluded and who thus have no way of knowing what sorts of openings for rebirth their kamma will lead them toSo for this reason see the danger in repeated birth and death that can give no guarantees as to the state in which youll take birth and dieIf its a human state as we see and are at present you can breathe easily to some extent but theres always the fear that youll slip away to be reborn as a common animal for people to kill or beat until youre all battered and bruisedNow thats really something to worry aboutIf you die you die if you survive you live and breathe in fear and trembling dreading death with every momentHow many animals are dragged into the slaughterhouses every dayThis is something we dont have to explain in detailIts simply one example I mention to remind you of the sufferings of the living beings of the worldAnd where is there any shelter that can give a sure sense of security to the heart of each person overseeing his or her heap of lifeAs meditators we should calculate the profits and losses the benefits and drawbacks that come from the khandhas in each hour period of day and nightThe discontent we feel from being constantly worried Isnt it caused by the khandhasWhat makes us burdened and worriedWe sit stand walk and lie down for the sake of the khandhasWe eat for the sake of the khandhasOur every movement is simply for the sake of the khandhasIf we dont do these things the khandhas will have to break apart under the stress of sufferingAll we can do is relieve things a little bitWhen they can no longer take it the khandhas will break apartEven though the earth rocks and mountains may be heavy they stay to themselvesTheyve never weighed us down or oppressed us with difficultiesOnly these five khandhas have burdened and oppressed us with difficulties with their every movementRight from the day the khandhas begin to form we have to be troubled with scurrying around for their sakeThey wield tremendous power making the entire world bend under their sway until the day they fall apartWe could say that we are slaves to the khandhas from the day were born to the day we dieIn short what it all comes down to is that the source of all worries the source of all issues lies in the khandhasThey are the supreme commanders making us see things in line with their wantsThis being the case how can anything wonderful come from themEven the khandhas we will take on as a burden in our next birth will be the same sort of takingbirthanddying khandhas lording it over us and making us suffer all over againSo investigate these things until you can see them clearly with discernmentOf all the countless lifetimes you may have been through over the aeons take this present lifetime before you as your evidence in reviewing them allThose who arent complacent will come to know that khandhas in the past and khandhas that will appear in the future all have the same characteristics as the khandhas that exist with us in the presentAll I ask is that you force your mind to stay in the frame of the three characteristics which are present throughout the body and mind at all timesNo matter how wild and resistant the mind may be it cant withstand the strength of mindfulness and discernment backed up by persistent effortAs long as mindfulness and discernment arent yet agile you have to force them but as soon as they gain enough strength to stand on their own theyll be like a fire and its light that always appear togetherOnce mindfulness and discernment have been trained to be authoritative then wherever you are youre mindful and discerningIts not the case that you will always have to force themTheyre like a child When its first born it doesnt have the strength and intelligence to care for itself so its parents have to take on the duty of caring for it in every way until it matures and becomes able to survive on its ownThe parents who used to look after it are then no longer burdened with that dutyThe same holds true with mindfulness and discernmentThey gain strength step by step from being trained without ceasing without letting them slideThey develop day by day until they become supermindfulness and superdiscernment at the stage where they perform their duties automaticallyThen every sort of thing that used to be an enemy of the heart will be slain by supermindfulness and superdiscernment until nothing remainsAll that remains is a heart entirely buddho Dhammo will become a marvel at that very same moment through the power of supermindfulness and superdiscernmentSo I ask that all of you as meditators make the effortSee the burden of birth aging illness and death that lies ahead of you as being at least equal to the burden of birth aging illness and death present in living beings and formations all around youIt may even be more  who knows how much moreFor this reason you should make sure that you gain release from it in this lifetime in a way clear to your own heartThen wherever you live youll be at your ease  with no need to bother with any more problems of birth or death anywhere at all  simply aware of this heart that is pureI ask that you all contemplate this and strive with bravery in the threefold training of virtue concentration and discernmentThe goal you set for yourself in that third sort of person will one day be youTheres no need to doubt thisThats enough for now so Ill ask to stop hereWhen we investigate we have to investigate over and over time and time again many many times until we understand and are fully sureThe mind will then let go of its own accordTheres no way we can try to force it to let go as long as we havent investigated enoughIts like eating If we havent reached the point where were full were not fullTheres no way we can try to make ourselves full with just one or two spoonfulsWe have to keep on eating and then when were full we stop of our own accordWeve had enoughThe same holds true with investigatingWhen we reach the stage where we fully know we let go of our own accord all our attachments to the body feelings labels thoughtformations cognizance step by step until we finally penetrate with our discernment into the mind itself  the genuine revolving wheel the revolving mind  until it is smashed to pieces with nothing leftThats the point  thats the point where we end our problems in fighting with defilementThats where they end  and our desire to go to nibbana ends right there as wellThe desire to go to nibbana is part of the pathIts not a cravingThe desire to gain release from suffering and stress is part of the pathIts not a cravingDesire has two sorts desire in the area of the world and desire in the area of the DhammaDesire in the area of the world is cravingDesire in the area of the Dhamma is part of the pathThe desire to gain release from suffering to go to nibbana strengthens the Dhamma within usEffort is the pathPersistence is the pathEndurance is the pathPerseverance in every way for the sake of release is the pathOnce we have fully come into our own the desire will disappear  and at that point who would ask after nibbanaOnce the revolving wheel the revolving mind has been smashed once and for all there is no one among any of those who have smashed that revolving mind from their hearts who wants to go to nibbana or who asks where nibbana liesThe word nibbana is simply a name thats allOnce we have known and seen once we have attained the genuine article within ourselves what is there to questionThis is what it means to develop the mindWeve developed it from the basic stages to the ultimate stage of developmentSoNow no matter where we live we are sufficient unto ourselvesThe mind has built a full sufficiency for itself so it can be at its ease anywhere at allIf the body is ill  aching feverish hungry or thirsty  we are aware of it simply as an affair of the body that lies under the laws of inconstancy stress and lack of selfIts bound to keep shifting and changing in line with its nature at all times  but were not deluded by itThe khandhas are khandhasThe pure mind is a pure mind by its nature with no need to force it to know or to be deludedOnce its fully true from every angle everything is trueWe dont praise or criticize anything at all because each thing is its own separate reality  so why is there any reason to clashIf one side is true and the other isnt thats when things clash and fight all the time  because one side is genuine and the other side falseBut when each has its own separate reality theres no problemContemplate the mind so as to reach this stage the stage where each thing has its own separate realityYathabhutañanadassana the knowledge and vision of things as they areThe mind knows and sees things as they are within and without through and through and then stays put with purityIf you were to say that it stays put it stays put with purityWhatever it thinks it simply thinksAll the khandhas are khandhas pure and simple without a single defilement to order their thinking labeling and interpreting any moreThere are simply the khandhas pure and simple  the khandhas without defilements or in other words the khandhas of an arahant of one who is free from defilement like the Lord Buddha and all his Noble DisciplesThe body is simply a bodyFeelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance are each simply passing conditions that we use until their time is upWhen they no longer have the strength to keep going we let them go in line with their realityBut as for the utterly true nature of our purity there is no problem at allThose who have reached full release from conventional realities of every sort you know dont assume themselves to be more special or worse than anyone elseFor this reason they dont demean even the tiniest of creaturesThey regard them all as friends in suffering birth aging illness and death because the Dhamma is something tender and gentleAny mind in which it is found is completely gentle and can sympathize with every grain of sand with living beings of every sortTheres nothing rigid or unyielding about itOnly the defilements are rigid and unyieldingProudConceitedHaughty and vainOnce theres Dhamma there are none of these thingsTheres only the unvarying gentleness and tenderness of mercy and benevolence for the world at all times The translatorThe VenAcariya Maha Boowa accepted an invitation to go to England in June together with two other Bhikkhus VenPaññavaddho and VenAbhiceto originally from the UKand Canada respectivelyAll three had the good fortune to be able to stay at the Dhammapadipa Vihara in Haverstock Hill which was run by the English Sangha TrustIt was there that Acariya Maha Boowa gave the talks recorded in this book the only exception to this being the discussion on th June in the morning at Cambridge when the Bhikkhus went to receive food at MrBenedic Wints houseThe talks given by Acariya Maha Boowa were tape recorded but the questions and answers were mostly taken down in shorthand by MRSermsri KasemsriIt is mainly due to her efforts not only in taking down the questions and answers but also in subsequently transcribing all the talks and her shorthand notes and typing out the manuscript that the Thai book was produced from which this translation was madeTranslation from Thai into English does not normally present any special problemsBut in the case of this book the origin of it was the spoken word and in addition the subject matter is Dhamma which involves many concepts and technicalities for which English has a rather poor vocabulary and often a lack of the necessary fundamental conceptsThe teachings of Buddhism may in fact be compared to a technical subject such as chemistry or electronics in that many technical terms and phrases are necessary and also special concepts and ways of thinking are needed in order to understand and appreciate the reasoning and truth of BuddhismWhen it comes to a question of whether to translate a technical word has a wellknown and accurate equivalent in English then the English word is usedBut if there is no wellknown or accurate equivalent or if the use of an English word leads to more confusion or misunderstanding than the original Pali word then the Pali word is usedI must apologise to those people who are not familiar with Pali terms and who find difficulty in reading a book such as this which has many Pali terms but I feel sure that it is far better for readers to not understand rather than to misunderstandIn any case following on this introduction is a short list of those Pali words which occur frequently in the book together with a brief assessment of their meaning so that the reader who is not familiar with those words can have a ready referenceThere is also a more complete glossary at the end of the bookI should like to thank all those who have helped to produce this book including MRSermsri Kasemsri for her work on the original book in Thai MrMichael Shameklis for his help in translation of the first thirty or so pages Tan Suchard for helping to correct many many translation mistakes and to Tan Chris for typing out the manuscriptWe all believe in the teachings of the Buddha which unites the hearts and minds of all BuddhistsWe therefore should not be afraid of having no friendsWe should think first of all that our friends do not yet understand us and so they drift away and no longer associate with usOur way of practice in the way of wholesomeness still remains howeverOne should see this  and that there are still good people in the worldGood people eventually meet and become friends with other good people and these good people will be our friendsIf there are no good people in the world and if there is nobody interested in associating with us then we should associate with the Dhamma  with Buddho Dhammo and Sangho in our hearts which is better than friends who are not interested in goodness at allBuddho Dhammo and Sangho are friends which are truly excellentOrdinarily those good friends of yours will come back to youYou should therefore rest assured that if your heart is satisfied that you are going in a wholesome direction then that is enoughYou should not be concerned with or worry about others more than yourselfYou should be responsible for yourself in the present and in the future for there is nobody but yourself who can raise you up to a higher levelPlease understand that Buddhism does not teach people to draw away from each otherBuddhism and Christianity both teach people to be good so that they will be happy and go to heavenIf we compare the city of London to heaven we could tell people that there are many ways to enter the cityWhen they have chosen a way and made use of it all of them will reach LondonWhatever religion one has one should practice it accordinglyThey will meet in heavenBuddhism however besides having a way to reach heaven also has the way to reach NibbanaIf one understands and practices according to the teachings and wants to reach Nibbana there are ways for going beyondNibbana means the complete absence of DukkhaThe Buddha and his arahant disciples being completely free from all defilements have all attained to NibbanaOne therefore should not be worried about anyone who follows themYou should explain this to your mother so that she will not worry about you for what Buddhism teaches will be for the stability and prosperity of societyIt encourages people to be good so tell your mother not to worry that Buddhism is not hell and that it does not bring disaster or ruin to those who practice its teachingsOther people interfering with us is a normal obstacle but people cannot vie with oneself in the hindrances one makes for oneselfThis is probably the case with everyoneWhen one wants to do something which is good which is useful a state of mind is liable to arise as a hindrance thus preventing it and one then wastes a lot of timeBeyond that it can lead one to do evil things which are also harmful and generally speaking lead to harmWhen you get a feeling that there is something rubbing against your stomach you should understand that this is only a state of mind manifesting itself that it is not anything real or anything that is useful to the CittaYou should then make the Citta be aware of the rising  fallingDo not let the mind dwell on the sensation of rubbingThat sensation will subside and pass away by itselfTan Acharn Maha Boowa said that he would give a short explanation of the Dhamma each dayThe following is his first Dhamma explanationBuddhism is derived from practice because the Buddha himself practiced until he himself knew and saw and was able to do it for himself and only then did he begin to teach othersBuddhists therefore understand the importance of practicing and training themselves according to the teachingsLearning for the purpose of gaining knowledge and understanding but without putting it into regular practice will not bring results as it ought toOne should therefore study and practice moral precepts until it becomes higher morality study all the different levels of wisdom until one reaches the level of higher wisdom and study freedomOne must then practice until one truly reaches freedom until one has truly escapedPractice is therefore the most important part of BuddhismWhen one who has practiced has reached any particular state of development he will know this for himselfFor example if he practices the development of mindfulness of breathing he will know what the state of his breath is and he will know to what extent the Citta is quiet still and peacefulBut he must have mindfulness and he must not let the Citta wander outsideFor someone who is beginning to practice the most important thing is the Citta and mindfulnessThe Citta will improve if mindfulness is there to control it and it will then be peaceful cheerful bright and happiness will come by itselfBut if the Citta is not controlled by mindfulness and if it is allowed free rein so that any and all thoughts can insert themselves the Citta will not be peaceful and happiness will not ariseTherefore the most important rule is to not let the imagination give rise to emotionally charged thoughtsTrain the Citta to be truly peaceful and happiness will then follow in the wake of the calm which gradually developsA high degree of calm means a high degree of happiness  until it reaches an extraordinary happiness which comes from the more subtle levels of concentrationFor myself I feel that today is a fortunate occasion in that I have been able to meet you English BuddhistsIm sorry that I cant speak to you in English and must depend on VenPaññavaddho to help translateOn this auspicious occasion let us all sit in meditation together each practicing according to his abilitySome of you can perhaps sit for a long time and some of you may tire quicklyLet each of you decide for how long you can sit before you get bodily discomfort and pain arising so that you gradually withdraw from SamadhiYou should however try to put up with the pain and discomfort for a while because you really want happiness of heartYou have already experienced and know enough about other kinds of happiness and you have no doubts about them enough not to be attracted to themWhen I was able to sit in meditation for twelve or thirteen hours and it became painful I contemplated the place where the pain was and asked What is it thats painfulOne fingerOne boneIf they are painful why are they not painful after one is deadWhy is it that they are painfulIf the Citta is where the pain is then if one does not have a body does that mean that the Citta dies too or not and so on until I reached the truthBut if one is going to contemplate painful feeling one must be brave enough to find the truthOnes desire to know the truth must be stronger than the pain and deathMindfulness and wisdom must be continually traversing throughout oneself like a wheel which is turning then one can knowWhen one searches for the basis of truth and one meets truth one understands clearly one truly knows and understands all the time and the heart is freed from attachmentIf one does not know truly the heart is still attachedThe more one wants to be rid of Dukkha the more the Dukkha and the origin of Dukkha will increase in ones heartInstead of getting rid of the origin of Dukkha one succeeds only in increasing it more than everThe Venerable Acharn then invited those present to sit in meditation and he himself sat in meditation for a time before returning to his quarters leaving the lay people there each to sit in meditation as long as they likedThe Venerable Acharn began by asking the following question Is there anything useful in particular that you would like to discuss todayThere may be many things When those in the room remained silent the Venerable Acharn began as followsSitting in meditation while listening to an explanation of Dhamma will greatly help to calm the CittaI shall therefore begin with an explanation of the Dhamma and while you are listening please feel free to make use of whatever method of meditation you have practiced beforeWhen the Citta is calm you will naturally receive the taste of Dhamma each according to his own level of practiceThe Buddhist religion which we profess today is the Dhamma to which the Buddha had attainedHis name was the Samana Gotama and he searched for and practiced many ways which he saw would bring him to the attainment of the Saccadhamma which was what he wantedThe word Dhamma means the teaching of a Buddha which is a new Dhamma and a new era that follows upon the Enlightenment of each buddha and the teaching which he gives to the worldTruly speaking the real Dhamma is always in the world right from the beginningBut this real original Dhamma is never touched by that which is conventional or mundane even though it is always in contact with the heartBut although these forms of Dhamma are always present in the world it is we who lack the ability to see themWhat sort of thing is DhammaThere is Dhamma as cause and Dhamma as result and because of this people are led to think in all sorts of ways until they have almost nothing to do with Dhamma or religionThe word Sasana means teaching  the teaching which arose as the result of those practices done by the Buddha in searching for knowledge and truth until he found itBecause he searched in the right way and because he attained results which satisfied his heart he proclaimed this teaching to the world of those who were suited to receive the Sasana Dhamma  this being the training and teaching of BuddhismTeaching Dhamma to a world full of blindness so that it would come to know the truth was very difficult for the Teacher  it was no light taskBefore he proclaimed his teaching to the world men already had various thoughts and ideas the majority of which were contradictory to the DhammaTeaching was therefore very difficult and being one of the Great teachers of the World was to be one who takes a great burden on himselfFew are the men therefore who wish to become a Buddha because ordinary men unlike a Buddha do not want any difficulties or burdens in teaching the worldThere is no one who can teach as correctly or as accurately as the Buddha taught his Teaching to the people of the world so he was given the name of The Highest Teacher in the World There is none comparable to the Buddha because he is superior to all human beingsHis teaching is fully complete in both cause and effectNothing is missing from the teachings which he taught to all beingsWith regards to Dhamma he explained wholesome and unwholesome and neither wholesome nor unwholesome DhammaThese Dhammas are Svakkhata Dhamma  Dhammas which are wellexplainedThe essence of this Dhamma is in the Eightfold Path which is the Middle WayIf we were to compare the Middle Way to food its taste would be delicious for it would not be too salty too tasteless or too spicyIf we were to compare it to clothes it would be well cut and tailored to fit the person wearing itIt would not be like inexpensive clothes which are massproducedDhamma teaching is therefore the Middle Way which is appropriate in both its causes and its effects from the beginning to the endIt is not only Dhamma that is the Middle Way but the things that one depends on in the worldIf one tried to do everything in the Middle Way it would be something worth seeing worth admiring worth living in and making use ofThose men and women monks and novices who practice the Dhamma of the Middle Way would be lovely and would be persons worthy of respectBoth the world and the Dhamma would be cool and quiet and it would be a good world to live inThere would be no complaining that the world is in trouble we are in trouble he is in trouble as is heard at presentEverything is burning with trouble and we practically have no world left to live inThis is because people do not take into consideration the principles of Dhamma which are correct and goodA world divorced from Dhamma that is goodness is therefore a world which is contrary to Dhamma people are contrary to Dhamma and this contrariness to Dhamma has the power to produce endless worry and confusionIf we refuse to see faults and if we refuse to stop this opposition to Dhamma this world will continue to experience DukkhaMagga means the path which the Buddha declared using the principles of the Middle WayIt is therefore the only path which always leads straight and steadfastly to VimuttiIt is never outdated never having to be altered or changed in any way to keep up with changing situations and changing timesEven if everything should go on changing until they turn and turn about the Dhamma of the Middle Way will still be the Dhamma which is always consistentIf we liken it to a medicine it would be a medicine which doctors have already experimented with and proven the worth of and which is being used to cure diseaseAll Dhammas have already been completely tried and proven by the Buddha and there is no reason for doubting or being sceptical about them for the proving of these Dhammas resulted in the enlightenment of the BuddhaFurthermore all of the Buddhas disciples also attained the field of Vimutti by means of these Dhammas in the same wayWe have come together today to train our minds to be calm and coolThe normal state of the mind is such that it has no Middle WayIt continually tends to go to extremes of thinking and imagining and its moods which are connected with work and duty are in confusionOr in other words what the heart is used to and likes leads it away from what it should be doingWe must therefore make use of the Dhamma principles of the Buddha as a means to train the Citta to be calm  and however much or little one does this it will not be without resultWhoever makes use of any method of meditation as for example paying attention to ones breath or the repetition of Buddho Dhammo or Sangho should have mindfulness to control the CittaThe Citta should not be allowed to wander for if it does one will not get results and the Citta will not get calmIn the Dhamma it says Natthi santi param sukham which means there is no happiness greater than peace and this shows that the heart must be peaceful or calm to attain happiness so we should try to make the heart calmThe Citta which is not calm will tend to be agitated continually and even when it is asleep it dreams of all sorts of thingsIf ones Citta thinks a lot it will create fantastic dreams and talking in ones sleep for if ones sleep is not deep dreaming will occur whereas a deep sleep is a sleep without dreamsSo one trains to make the Citta calm down but whether the Citta becomes calm and to what degree will depend on the ability of each personIf the Citta is very calm there will be a great deal of happiness and this is the first step of the trainingThe value of the mind will then be apparent to the owner so that he can admire it at that time while it is peaceful because there is nothing of greater value than a quiet mindI would ask you to make your minds steadily overcome the difficulties and laziness which are things that usually overcome us the whole timeWe believe that we cannot overcome them because we have seen their power but if we think we are able to fight them and if we really do fight them then the time will arrive when we do overcome themWe still hear of victories in regard to such things as sports and such like but with regard to Kilesas we only hear of giving in to themPerhaps this is because we fall on our faces before the Kilesas and let them walk all over our backsThis religion shook the world because it was tested and proven by those whose hearts are pureThe Enlightenment of the Buddha shook his heart that is it shook the Kilesas in his heart just as if this world itself were shakenEven though we have never seen or experienced any results from this religion we will surprise ourselves when the Citta becomes calm because this initial training will greatly move the heart when the Citta and Dhamma come together in unreserved completeness of the Citta and of DhammaThe word religion is not a trifling matterIt exists with everyone of us and is not just a thing of this person or that person and it does not just belong to the BuddhaHe taught us so that we would be good people and have worth appropriate to a human beingHe taught that the virtue and value which comes from the religion is ones own wealth right up to the Path Fruition and NibbanaThis lies within the reach of each Buddhist who resolves to practice and he can be one who possesses and savors the results of it endlesslyThere is no finish or end as there is with other forms of wealth which are impermanent unsatisfactory and notself and which someone has grabbedTherefore Buddhism belongs to each of us and not only to this or that ethnic group class or casteThis is enough for todayI would now like to ask VenPaññavaddho to explain what he can rememberWhy when we train the Citta do we fix the Citta on only this or that objectIn fixing the Citta on the breath one should know the breath as it goes in and out at the nose all the time but this is not a breathing exerciseThis is like using bait to catch a fish  what one wants to catch is the fishOr if we make a simile of the Citta of someone who has not yet been trained his Citta will be scattered in various places like a fish net which has been cast into the water and spreads out wide until one can no longer see what it looks likeIf we are going to know the Citta we will have to take hold of the leader that is the string on the net which one uses to draw it togetherWhen we pull on the leader the rest of the net comes together until we can see it and hold it in our handsThe Citta is where we ourselves areWe are the owners of the Citta but we cannot force it to become whatever we want it to beWe assume that form memory feeling thoughts and consciousness are the Citta but in reality these aggregates can all be separated from each other and we can begin to see this when we practiceThen we will be able to promote the Citta so that it improves or deterioratesWhen we have practiced we will gradually see that the Citta is the Lord of Birth and Death If we make merit practice generosity guard our moral precepts and practice meditation we promote the Citta so that it improves  it becomes brighter and is raised to a higher levelBut if we follow our desires and are not afraid of demerit and unwholesomeness the Citta will do whatever it likesNot being controlled the Citta will deteriorate and meet with nothing but DukkhaEven in the present when we are downhearted and we do not know what to do we let go and are then besieged by Dukkha even though we are aware of it and because people do not know how to change Dukkha into happiness the world experiences Dukkha which is just what it does not wantThe Citta which has been trained which is freed from defilements and which is pure must still depend on the aggregates while they are aliveBut the duty and work of one whose Citta is pure will only be for the good of the worldThis pure Citta is called arahant or arahat The person who is an arahant has a Citta which is entirely pure in all respectsHis Citta is completely free from anything which will cause it to be born again and it will encounter happiness which is entirely satisfying while there is still lifeWhen he dies it has absolute bliss and it has no Dukkha nor any involvement with the mundane relative worldThus there is a saying of the Buddha which states Nibbanam Paramam Suññam which means Nibbana is entirely empty  of all DukkhaBut it does not mean that when one has attained Nibbana there is nothing left as the world understands emptiness to meanBut one also does not exist in the way that the world existsIn other words the happiness of Nibbana is happiness specific to Nibbana without any of the mundane conventionsIf the Citta still wears the form of the aggregates when the defilements have been completely eradicated it means that it has attained to freedomFreedom and the mundane world are very different from each otherIt is difficult to compare the world of Sammuti which has mundane conventions with what has not  which is VimuttiBuddhism has the purpose of teaching us to make our Citta pure so that we can experience the sublime happiness of VimuttiBy entering Samadhi the Citta can become completely quietThe heart is then naturally happy and becomes strong so that in reading thinking or doing other various jobs the Citta will be clear and relaxed and when thinking it will be able to see through things more clearly than usualTherefore training the Citta by way of either Samadhi or wisdom in accordance with the principles of Buddhism is a good way to help one in ones work for it does no harm to ones work which is contrary to what people generally understand even though those who think like this are only nominally believers and know nothing about BuddhismTherefore in working with perseverance so as to get results one must use hard work and determination but these must be used differently in different casesIf one wants to attain calm one must use determination to aim for a single spot in other words one must quell mental distractionBut if one is going to contemplate so as to know the Dhamma truths one must use hard work determination in observing and develop understanding in the Dhamma from various viewpointsIf on the other hand one is aiming for the arising of wisdom one must use hard work and determination in the investigation of causes and their effects in various waysThe Buddha taught us about the six consciousnesses so that we would not cling to things which we see and know and so that we would know that they just arise and fall away and that there is no permanent essence in themWhen we can supervise them we will be able to see the seventh Viññana more clearlyThere is only one form of this consciousness and it is Eka Viññana To make an analogy it is like the trunk of a tree and this is the part that matters when we want to make use of a treeThe other six consciousnesses are then like the branches and twigs which we cannot make much use ofWe should therefore keep this in mind and take an interest in contemplating the one Citta which will take birthOne should also try to look after the Citta and make it clean and raise it as high as one can in accordance with ones own level which one has gained from doing practiceAn explanation such as this is theoretical knowledge and it might lead to endless argument if one has not practicedBut going on talking about and discussing it will not bring benefitIf one practices and comes to see the truth of Dhamma for oneself reading listening and discussing leads to understandingBut if that person has not practiced accordingly it will just go in the direction of argumentBecause the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha has levels which are gross middle or subtle and it is better to speak about those things which will be valuableWhat can be obtained from reading and what can be obtained from practice are quite different from each other because remembering what one has read is quite different from the truth that has been experienced from practiceEven when other people speak of the results from their practice it is difficult for one to understand them until one has practiced and experienced more with ones heartThen ones doubts will clear up of themselvesAnything which enters and associates with us  whichever type of character we may have from amongst those which people have  is connected with and concerns us from then onIf we practice and try to eliminate the Kilesas then eliminate them we can for there were and are arahants who were once very angry menWe are common people who only know and understand this but we do not yet have the ability to eliminate the root of angerWe must train the Citta to know how bad a fault hate is then it will go by itselfIf we try to get rid of it by just wanting it to go we will not succeedWe must depend on practice and then we will see results coming steadily which is called the right kind of meditation and suitable for the removal of that kind of KilesaPlease understand that the Kilesas are not afraid of only remembering their namesEven though we remember everything about them in great detail they still remain Kilesas which govern the hearts of beings in the worldThey do not think about removing themselves to another place unless one practices meditation and develops mindfulness and wisdom so as to be bold and strong enough to be able to drive them outThen the time comes when they will break and scatter from the heart without any doubt like the Buddha and all his disciples who eliminated the Kilesas by means of practiceThe methods they used have been taught to the world down to the present dayI will explain sitting meditationWhy did the Buddha sit cross legged in meditationIf one looks at it only superficially sitting in that position is not very important and one can sit in any position that one wantsBut if one is going to sit for hours then one should sit crosslegged because the pressure due to the weight of the body will be evenly distributedWhen it becomes painful the pain will be spread out and it will not be excessively painful in any one spotIf one sits for a very long time then it may become very painful because sitting in meditation is extremely important work for those who are determined to get real results and they may sit for a long time even for many hoursIf they become too worried or anxious about their bodies then the Citta will be weakThis will be dependent on the Dukkha of the bodyIt is important to make the Citta ones goalLet the Citta do the work that is set for it and have mindfulness in control of the Citta while meditating so that it does not wander outside thinking about this or thatThe Citta which is always controlled by mindfulness will remain with oneselfIt will be calm and will be clearly awareThe more one has mindfulness with the Citta however good it may be the clearer the Citta will beOne must therefore not allow the Citta to wander or to be distractedConcerning the Path of the arahant and Fruition and speaking of mindfulness and wisdom as well if one makes use only of mindfulness and does not make use of wisdom one will not get results that are desirableIf one is going to be able to eliminate the Kilesas entirely one must make complete use of mindfulness and wisdom  which are like toolsIn making use of tools one must know what to use with what the way to use them and howThere can be a lot of mindfulness it is true but people are deficient in doing what is their duty because they do not use wisdom as they ought toThe end result of this is that the full state that should arise does notBeing deficient in what is ones duty is not a good thing so the result one gets is not completeTherefore one who learns about the Middle Way should always take into consideration what is sufficient  which is appropriate to the name of Dhamma  which is the Middle Way that one has learnedWhen light falls on the surface of an object the top of that object is illuminated while its underside is in shadow and darkWisdom is like the light which can truly penetrate but what it penetrates is the Kilesas which cover the heart so that there is not any shadow in the heart where Kilesas can hide or conceal themselvesThis means that wisdom is powerful and able to investigate circumspectly throughout the darkness of all the Kilesas with ease and confidence until the Citta has reached ultimate VimuttiQ Does this mean that we should carefully examine the five IndriyaIf wisdom is strong it will penetrate throughout like a light which shines completely through an object from top to bottom so that there is no shadow which is Avijja left at allIs that correctThe word brightness refers here to the state of Vatta Citta which is different from Vivatta CittaIn other words Pabhassara is clarity and brightness but is not yet the state of purityThe brightness which comes from practice is due to the Kilesas gathering together in just one spotWhen the brightness which is the most subtle of the Kilesas has been passed by by the cleansing process of supermindfulness and superwisdom then the Citta is pureKilesas are coarse medium and subtle and the knowing which is formed out of these Kilesas is not the real Citta but only the characteristics of the CittaWe must use wisdom to follow and remove these Kilesas at all three levels and when we have done this until the Citta does not change is not sad or downhearted and has none of the characteristics of the Citta which is covered by the Kilesas at all this Citta will know that there are no causes left for rebirth in the futureThe Citta is then pure and need not take birth againThe Citta which has the germ of goodness and badness within it can be compared to a seed which can grow and which has the germ of life or the potential for development in itThis kind of Citta will therefore be born die and be born again and again according to the causes which it has itself made  good and bad variouslyAs for the Citta which is pure it is constant and the germ of rebirth is no longer presentRegardless of whether one believes that after death there is nothing more or that after death there is still something if the Citta has the germs of goodness and badness present in it it will be born again endlessly but if the Citta is pure and has no such germs it will not be bornThis is the way of it but the permanence of the pure Citta is not the same as the world understands permanence to mean so there is nobody who can understand the permanence of the pure Citta correctly except the arahants aloneThe Buddha practiced until he saw truly for himselfHe did not make any wild guesses or just think about it as we doTherefore the Buddhas Dhamma is absolutely correct and we can have absolute confidence in itIf we cannot yet attain to the level of the pure Citta then we should persist in doing what is good so that in whatever way this Citta is born it may be a good wayThis will lead to development and is far better than clinging to doubt and uncertainty which obstructs our way so that we live in vain without gaining anything useful for it only sets up a barrier so that we are swept away or pushed down into the mass of the round of DukkhaThe Citta is like all other things  trees children etc it needs nourishment so that it will grow and developThe Citta however has to depend on its owner for the way it is nourished so it will develop accordinglyI am very pleased to be able to come here and answer your questions but I am afraid that my stay here will be rather short as I cannot remain very long due to the many duties which I have waiting for me in ThailandThailand is about  Buddhist and I have much to do in the way of meeting the people and my followersIt was necessary for me to prepare my work about three or four months in advance before I could actually come to England and it is necessary that I return home quickly because of the many people waiting thereI am very pleased to have been received by our English brothers and sisters and I would like to come to England once again but Aniccam Dukkham and Anatta make it impossible for us to be sure that we will have the opportunity of doing soI hope that the Dhamma we have discussed here today will enable you to get the important essence which will help you in your future practiceVenPaññavaddho has been in Thailand for twelve years and he speaks and understands Thai fluentlyDuring that time I have tried to learn English from him but I never really succeeded in learning it so I am unable to speak to you in English during my stay hereI must have VenPaññavaddho translate for meUsually if one knows that something is bad and dangerous to oneself in the future one will not do it but if one thinks that it is good or if one does not consider the fault of it and one goes on doing it because one gives way to the emotion of anger one will not be able to get rid of angerIn fact this will only increase ones anger and make it stronger so that it will constantly harass oneself and bring trouble and harm to othersYou must examine yourself thus What is it that I like or dislikeThat which the other party does to me makes me angry and I restrain myself and do not display any abnormal behaviorI investigate so as to correct myself by thinking of the way they feel so as to find out if I have done anything that would make them angryI cannot recall anything that I may have done so if they are in the wrong I am not in the wrong they make a show of anger but I do not their heart is troubled within them and other people will see for themselves that they are bad but I do nothing bad Because you do not show any reaction by answering them back you increasingly become an admirable personBut nobody admires a person who gets angry saying that he is good because he is clever at getting angryWhen one gets angry with someone who is going to admire this and say that one is good because one can get angry and because one has got angry with this personAnger is not a good thing and people everywhere in the world are afraid of it and tired of itEven animals recognize anger and quickly try to avoid it and hide from itThey are afraid of anger which is a poison more harmful than fireAnger should therefore not be encouraged  in fact one should look for a way to quench it until there is none leftIf one feels anger for anyone and one dislikes them and if one sees the fault as being in oneself seeing that it makes one uneasy in ones heart one will get rid of that feeling entirelyTherefore to go straight to the point one must before all else examine ones own faults or the faults which will arise or have arisen in oneself then get rid of that feeling entirelyWhen one begins to practice this form of Dhamma at first one does not understand oneself one only has feelings about external things and one has likes and dislikesOne begins to observe other people and one sees how angry people display the characteristics of anger and one does not like itSo then one tries not to produce such characteristics towards other peopleActing in this way one begins to understand ones own CittaWhen one does this often ones awareness will arise more quickly and awareness of oneself and ones Citta will also arise more quickly so that as soon as one is the recipient of someone elses display of anger in whatever way it may come about one knows oneself and one can quell ones emotionsIn this way one can get rid of ones defilements little by little and reduce the Dukkha and anxiety in ones own heartBeing dissatisfied with anything is nothing but Dukkha which accords with the Dhamma that the Lord taught but we generally oppose Dhamma  being that which is right good and proper  so we generally find Dukkha all the time without feeling any dread of it and not being in dread of it leads us to encounter Dukkha again and againIn addition those who are concerned with reasoning about the basic meanings of Dhamma should always be wary of thisOne must look on that work as being the object of ones attentionFor example one method is to take the raising and lowering of ones feet as this object while walking in which case one must do just this because this is the work that one has set the Citta to doIf one uses any other method one will have the corresponding object upon which to fix ones attentionWhen contemplating Dhamma one should go on until one comes to the end of that aspect of Dhamma that one is contemplating and one should have mindfulness associated with it in every bodily action and positionThe various forms of practicing this Dhamma do not in fact conflict with each otherBut a person who practices is likely to be prejudiced and to see his own methods as being right and other peoples methods as having no value so then quarrels start or they boastfully say Whose is the better wayIt is better to do it our way Another person who takes it up and uses that method may find it unsuitable to him and it can be wrong and unsatisfactoryWhen one takes up and for some time practices a method using which other people have practiced and gained good results it can happen that one gets no good results for oneselfTherefore the practice of the Dhamma depends upon the individual characteristics of each person for one person will like it this way and another will like it that wayFor the latter part of your question in which the burden of the Citta is increased such that as soon as a sound is heard the Citta must Know know and then return and set up the practice as before if there is something which breaks into the practice often your Citta will be too slow and it will never be able to keep doing the work which it should be doingWhen one is at the stage of a beginner in doing practice the Citta still has not much strength and to increase the burden of the Citta greatly is not goodIt is like getting a child to do work which must be gradually explained in each of its aspectsIf one explains how to do too much of it all at once the work is too difficult then laziness will arise and the child will probably dawdle over the workThe Citta is like thisThis work of the Citta is firstly for the attainment of calm and secondly for getting rid of the defilements internallyBut when one is contemplating so as to attain understanding and skill in the parts of the body mindfulness  that which controls the contemplation  is essential just as much as it is when doing Samadhi practice to attain calmMindfulness must be present to supervise the work all the timeThe Citta will then have courage and ability and it will have mindfulness and wisdom to get rid of the defilements  and this is what makes up MaggaWhen one has reached this stage all laziness will have disappeared one will be able to do Citta Bhavana so that one forgets time and sits for long periods and then one attains results which are of high valueWhen one has sat for a long time one then walks while contemplating so as to change the postureOne uses supermindfulness and superwisdom to go on curing doubts and problems until there are no more defilements left to cureOne will then understand by oneself that the Citta and Dhamma have penetrated each otherThus the way of practice can help to arouse knowledge and understanding of the Citta this wayThe Citta is a very important thing in a personFor one has already been born and the Citta is the entity which has caused one to be born as a person good or bad and high or lowWhen the Citta is the chief cause of this one must rely upon those things which influence the Citta for ones future stateIf it develops well one can rise up until one reaches the stage of Sugato  one who has great happinessBut if the heart accumulates bad things even without knowing that they are bad the results which one gets will be bad all the timeIf one practices Dhamma well there will arise a sense of wellbeing in ones heartPeople generally do not know the reason why we receive Dukkha nor when we will be free from it because we are not aware that we have done bad things nor when we did themWe just see the results of them which arise as Dukkha at the present momentBut in this case we ought to try and choose the work for the Citta to doIf it is evil and Akusala we should avoid it completelyIf we are used to doing such things we should try and find a way to abstain from them and we should promote what has value and is good even though it may be difficult to doThus we gradually train ourselves going on like this until we become used to it meanwhile using wisdom to drive us onBut lazy people and those who do not like what is good are no use at all because they have no wisdom to drive them onIf the people love what is good wisdom compels them to do good until the Citta is used to itThen results of calm peace of heart and happiness will comeIt may also happen that something strange and wonderful of a different kind arises spontaneously in the CittaWe are not normally acquainted with such wonderful things but they will arise from the practice of what is good  the important thing being the practice of Citta BhavanaAs for the above good person he has only virtueHe is not distracted and he is not at cross purposes with Dhamma with anybody nor with anything as far as and including his own heartBut because his heart does not have any power of control to make the heart body and speech go in the right direction  the direction in which it should go which leads to those results that bring happiness  he must purify and cure his Citta and try to get it to work using the methods of meditation practice which causes the bad things within him to disintegrateThose things which are dignified and noble will then develop and increase in the heart which is appropriate to the value of the Citta  which by way of nature has a very high valueIf one trains ones Citta one will agree with ones own Citta before anyone else and if one practices and follows the way that the Lord Buddha taught one will be a clever personBut if one practices and follows the way of someone who does not truly know it is like the blind and foolish leading the blind  they cannot walk the right way to reach the goal the end of the road which is desiredIf one is not prepared to let oneself be led by someone who knows the way then the more one acts in this way the more stupid one becomes the more one lacks cleverness and one will not see those results which one desiresCleverness must depend on mindfulness and wisdom in looking for reasonsPeople in this world do not become good on their own without doing anything they must rely upon learning and they must have trainingTraining raises the Citta higher and if one does not have training ones Citta cannot go higher and the defilements will pull the Citta down until it cannot escapeBut the Citta which has trained well can get rid of the Kilesas and this has the highest valueThe Sangha nowadays who practice in the way described above may be taken as a refuge this being a kind of byproduct because the Sangha who practice properly are within the circle of the SANGHA This is the way the Lord said one could tell whether the Sangha exists which one can take to be a refuge or notA basic principle which I can give you which is common to all ways is as follows Do not let your Citta go out externally When the Citta is outside there are things which fascinate the Citta so one must then train oneself to concentrate anew and do this time after timeOne does not know whether those things come from ones own heart  or from where they comeBut if they are lovable things and beautiful one then loves themIf they are loathsome things and what is more important fearsome things one will be afraidTherefore in order to guard against fear one must look after the Citta and keep it inside and arouse calm internally and peace of heartThe extent of our interest in Buddhism is because of our interest in ourselves in those who are associated with us in our surrounding environment and because it shows how we should act towards ourselves and towards those people and thingsAs for the Sasana it is neutral for if we remain silent and disinterested it remains unclaimed wealth because the Lord Buddha bestowed the Sasana impartially on human beings and on Buddhists which includes us hereThe Sasana can become the wealth of people at each and every level depending on the interest taken the taking up and doing of the practice disciplining the body and using these as food for the heart in the way which accords with the teaching of the LordThe results of this will be a calm and cool heart the extent of which will accord with our standing and level of developmentSo the Sasana cannot be separated from ourselves for it is like a path which goes to various locationsFor us the path is the thing that is necessary for whichever point we intend to go to we must study and learn how this path leads us on and what is its destination for if it does not go to the right way it will waste a lot of timeThe way of Buddhism is the way of calmIt is Niyyanika Dhamma  leading on those who practice so that they can get free from Dukkha in accordance with the level of their Dhamma basis and Citta basisWhen people who are living in a state of confusion who are discontented who do not know what to do and who do not know how to get rid of those things which are unsatisfactory have taken the Sasana as their guide their behavior and practice becomes correct and dignifiedTherefore the Sasana is necessary for us who want what is correct and dignifiedThe problems which concern ourselves and the Sasana are our own problemsIn other words we are bound to be born to meet with Dukkha and hardship and to dieOur problem is having been born how should we act so as to be troublefree and contented without accumulating Dukkha and trouble for ourselves  or making trouble for others and for society generallyBecause our knowledge of how things work is not sufficient for thisDeath is a thing that nobody wants because of the fear that one will be completely destroyed and that one will get Dukkha and hardship which may come to one after one is deadIf one is still alive one knows the meaning of being destroyed so people in the world do not want to dieBut if it was known that after death one would experience ease and contentment everyone would want to die now because there are things that we hope to get having greater value than what exists here waiting for us if we get rid of the container  which is this body  and this life may be a barrier to the wealth which one will get when one is deadBut if people are still not sure whether after death they will come to destruction or to happiness and contentment they do not want to dieThe principles of Dhamma stand unshakably on their ownThey are certain and can be accepted on faithThe speech of the Lord Buddha is correct and accurately spoken and comes from his purity of heartEvery aspect of Dhamma the Lord Buddha knew for himself before he gave it as a teaching to other peopleHe had practiced and attained the fruits of it which satisfied his heart and he taught with purity of heart filled with Metta for all beingsTherefore the Dhamma is a Dhamma which gives hope to those who practice it willinglyWhen we have practiced it wholeheartedly hope will become clearly apparent to ourselvesOne who practices Dhamma  that is practicing in his own heart rightly following the principles of Dhamma can see the results appear in himself with certaintyHaving come up against the principles of Dhamma which one has put into practice ones former knowledge which was uneven and inconsistent is all overthrown  or so it seems to the heartHowever long ones life will be one will then never be afraid or timid because one knows how one has practiced and how it gave results step by stepWhen this life ends wherever one is born again whether one receives Dukkha or Sukha in whatever way it is already clear to oneself and there is no room for doubtTherefore one who practices following the way of the Lord Buddha can cut off all fear and doubt and there remains only the entire truth and a life of happiness and contentment without troubleTherefore one should learn about ones own problems so as to bring them to an end and the Sasana will help to arouse hope for oneselfBuddhism teaches us to avoid things which are dangerous and it teaches that the Citta should have its own basis and then it will not waver or be afraid nor doubtful about death and how it will go afterwardsNor will it be interested in thinking about anything outside oneself  which would be like grasping at shadowsIf you are going to a place and you are not sure that you are going to find everything convenient there you will probably prepare yourself and take all sorts of things that you might need so that you will have everythingThen you may be certain that everything will be convenient and that you will lack nothingWhen you are sure that you will find food there and you have also taken food along with you you do not feel any apprehensionVirtue is comparable to food for food is food of the body and virtue is food of the CittaThe practice of Dhamma will be food of the Citta which you carry along with you and the heart will be at ease so that whenever you die there will not be DukkhaOne knows that the body wants food and whatever type of food is lacking it eatsThe Citta wants virtue and Dhamma and if it lacks this food the factors of confusion arise and the heart is uneasy and troubledOne should therefore know where one is deficient and hurry to correct it and accumulate virtue from now onTan Acharn explained Dhamma furtherMerit is happinessKusala is skill in finding things which bring happiness to oneselfYou who have come here to search for what is good which is food for the heart such as the practice of Samadhi meditation if your hearts constantly do virtuous things your Citta will have skill courage good natures and certainty about the futureThis is like someone going on a journey who has arranged everything that will be necessary for his use on the wayWe are going on a journey coming from which state of existence we do not know but we are human  which means we are people living now whether men or womenPeople are more clever than animals in this world and we find that we have been born as human beingsSince birth we have had Dukkha and Sukha difficulty and confusion and we have gradually come to know thisWe have learned about the events of our own past and one day in the future we are bound to dieAfter death how will it beIf we act so as to develop our Cittas to attain complete clarity this problem can answer itself and we will have certainty ease of heart and a feeling of confidence in ourselvesThe Lord Buddha saw clearly into Dhamma and he also saw clearly into the method by which he had trained himselfTherefore it was never in vain that Buddhists turned to him and he was ready to help the world to enable it to get free from various dangers with methods which were full of MettaSummarising this in both religions the Founders taught people to be good with Metta in the same wayThey are different in their degrees of subtlety following the abilities of the founders of each religionIt is important to depend on mindfulness to know and attend to the work which one has set ones Citta to do and to avoid anticipating the result which one will get while one is doing the practiceWhen mindfulness and the work are going along together the result will come of itself steadily from the practice of meditationTo what extent can we practice itThe Lord Buddha intended that we should have untold wealth but the extent to which we ourselves can have it depends upon the ability of each personWhen you have mindfulness always with you and working all the time then you can sit in Samadhi in whatever way you likeBut it is important that mindfulness keeps your attention on just that work that you are doingIn Buddhism the Lord revealed Dhamma in three categoriesThese areIn the time of the Lord Buddha the Lord did not teach the Savakas a great dealUnlike nowadays when they teach to pass exams of grade grade and PeriyanInstead they learned so as to practice and those who knew the TiPitaka were many and they got no diploma to boost their vanity but only knowledge and understanding which they learned so as to be able to go further and further in the futureThe Lord Buddha taught every one of the Savakas to contemplate hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth and skin which are things that we have in our bodies but by ourselves we are incapable of realising that these things arise and cease continually and change in accordance with the truth of what they areThe Lord taught the Savakas to do this so that they should know the truth which these parts themselves displayWhen these things reveal themselves as having a nature which is unpleasant then discontent arisesNevertheless people grasp hold of them and consider them to be their treasure so that now they must decorate them take care of them and look after them more and moreThis teaching of the Lords is given so that we should not feel worried and anxious when these things start to show abnormal functions and to go wrongKesa Loma Nakha Danta and Taco have inherent within them the characteristics of continual change quite regardless of the status of ones birth social level or skin colorThose who learn them will get to know them truly because they are attached to our bodiesBirth old age change and uncertainty are Dukkha and hardships as well as Dukkha in the hearts of peopleTherefore the Lord Buddha taught every one of the Savaka Sangha these five Kammatthana and then sent them off to practice in the forest so as to learn Kesa Loma Nakha Danta and Taco contemplating them one by one in the forward order and then returning going through them in the reverse orderThe Savaka Sangha went to practice in the hills caves and gorges wherever it was convenient and peaceful for those who worked taking up these five or other Kammatthanas as the basis for striving until clear knowledge arose of both the body and the CittaPariyatti was what they learned from the Lord Buddha as mentioned previously so as to get rid of stupidity and dullness in regard to those things which we have in our own bodiesPatipatti is the practice of sitting in Samadhi walking Cankama and investigating the above five things which are like a grindstone for sharpening wisdom to make it become keen and strong until it comes to know the truth of various things skill and cleverness develop in the heart and even Samadhi develops making the heart calm and coolThese are the results that comePativedha Dhamma is clear knowledge penetrating into all the Dhamma truths until it reaches Vimutti  complete freedomAll three of these Dhammas are necessary in association with each other and they cannot be separated out from the beginning to the end of the pathWhoever intends to get results from Dhamma should therefore practice accordingly without being deficient in any of them and the results will then be clearly evident and always satisfying in every ageThe things which the Lord taught from the time of the Buddha right up to the present time have not changedThose who learn and practice should understand that this is the teaching which gives us the knowledge of how to practice in regard to the body and Citta at such times as dislike desire anger and delusion arise because they are sure to arise countless times in our lives making us feel that this is Dukkha and dangerousThis is because we are not circumspect not being guarded in thoughts and the imaginings of the heart so we must learn to know that such and such actions give rise to ill effects or to what is valuable as the case may beThe practice of the way of Buddhism is therefore the practice on ourselves so as to go the way of the development of a calm and cool heart giving increasing benefits to oneself which is appropriate for the religion that teaches people to be clever in guarding themselves so as to get free from dangerAs for Viññana the consciousness which comes from the impact of sensation through the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind it arises in association with these things and then dies away and ceasesThis is what is called Viññana in the five Khandhas and is different from the formerBut Patisandhi Viññana is the Citta which goes to take birth each time in any one of various possible places and characteristic formsBecause this Citta has seeds attached to it  in other words Kamma which has been done and which can send it off to be born in various different statesIn Buddhism it is explained that beings are born in various different circumstances and states because of Patisandhi Viññana or in other words this Citta has the nature of Anicca Dukkha and AnattaThen Kamma is the force which drives it onBut when this Citta has been washed clean so that it is made pure free from Kilesas and Kamma which would otherwise attach themselves to it this Citta which is pure knows of itself that it will not go to be born again and that it is free and that it is finally and absolutely beyond the rule of Anicca Dukkha and AnattaAs long as the Citta or Patisandhi Viññana is still not pure in every way it must live under the rule of Anicca Dukkha and AnattaBut this Citta is very subtle and how can it be AnattaIt may be illustrated by the following simile which gives a comparison with emptinessSuppose that a man was told to go and look in a room and say whether it was empty or not and in this room there is nothing at allHe goes in and says The room is empty But the person who sent him in says How can it be empty when you are standing there in the middle of it He then becomes aware of himself and leaves the room after which the room is truly emptyThe Citta which gets rid of Attanuditthi entirely has nothing mundane or relative left at all therefore it is said to be an empty Citta or a Citta which is pure throughoutBecause Atta and Anatta are not there in the Citta the Citta is absolutely free from both conditions of Atta and AnattaAs to your question what is this DukkhaPlease examine carefully at such times as you have Dukkha what this Dukkha is and who can you go and ask about it if you have this Dukkha and do not know it yourselfBecause these things exist in everybody without exceptionIf one knows then one practices the way that the Lord Buddha taughtThis practice is the way to come to know Dukkha with certainty that there is no other wayBefore one comes to know that the Citta is Samsara wisdom will probably have to contemplate external things until it knows them clearly and lets go of themThen it comes and sees danger in the true ringleader of Samsara  which is the CittaWhen one sees that the Citta is Samsara it is called seeing in the reverse manner in other words returning back inwards to get to know oneself and ending all doubts at the same timeOne must contemplate both internally and externallyExternally there are the surrounding objects of nature these being basically earth water air and fireInternally means within ones Citta and one should know what it is that one must get rid ofThis is like a drinking glass that falls and breaks  one must look and see it as it isIf one imagines that it is someones fault in that they made it fall and break one will be troubled and upsetBut if one sees that it went its own way according to its nature one frees ones heart entirely and then there is no need to be upset for it broke in accordance with its natureIt is important for the Citta to turn round and catch up with it and see it in the right wayThen at last one knows the one who creates imagination  this being the Sankhara  the one who creates storiesThe stories then cease forthwith and they no longer follow on from one another building a series of thoughts branching out wider and widerDiscussing Dhamma today in its essence has been more and more interesting both for those who ask for the one who answers and for those who listenBut there should also be something about practiceWhat is practiceIt is that which brings results to oneself letting one know and see fullyIf those who practice tell each other of the results which they have attained and report to the teacher this will correct any faults or give clarity and confidence to themBecause each person who practices gains results according to the basic nature of his Citta and his Dhamma which differ from person to personSo the teacher has to give explanations continuously to encourage those who practice so that they can strengthen their resolve because he knows the results which he attained for himself and those which the pupil has attained by practicing in the same way to be the sameAlso because the teacher who knows clearly has already gone the whole way and he is able to talk the pupil into penetrating through and letting go of everything until he can also penetrate through and gain freedomBuddhism is not Mogharaja but it is genuine and true and capable of giving release from DukkhaBut people to a great extent change Buddhism into a tool for arguing with each otherI would like to explain this to you so that you would understand all the reasoning  but I have no way to do so because my command of English is no use and I have to speak depending on the translatorConcerning Vimutti the Lord Buddha revealed this fully  because the Lord knew it truly and the Savaka arahants also knew it in the same wayThey never disputed amongst themselves about it and they all equally revealed it in the same way but other people crowd together doubting everythingNone of the arahants have any doubt at all for they have seen that Nibbanam Paramam SukhamNibbana Paramam Suññam which all of us have learned to know as emptiness in the way that people in the world generally understand it meaning that everything has disappearedIt is like this glass tumbler here if anyone takes it or it breaks we are then empty of this glass and this is the way the conventional world sees itBut emptiness in the manner of Vimutti as was known by the Lord Buddha and the Savaka arahants is of a different kindThe happiness which comes from Emptiness the ordinary person has never seenSo we are bound to be doubtful and to deny it in spite of the fact that the Lord Buddha always taught true thingsFor our hearts which are still not pure cannot yet accept it and have not reached understanding of it and the Citta which is still false is not yet likely to accept true things as its objective supportIt is like excellent food well prepared that drops on the ground  we do not like to eat it thenThe Dhamma of the Lord Buddha is pure but if the Citta of a person is dirty they cannot accept each other in a good wayBut whenever the Citta and the Dhamma are both pure they can blend well togetherTherefore none of the arahants have the slightest doubt in regard to the Vimutti that the Lord Buddha constantly taughtToday I will give some explanation of Dhamma before answering questionsI will not talk for long as I am afraid the translator will not be able to rememberThe word Sasana if its meaning is shown by analogy with things in this world is like clean pure water and the Citta is like an object which is in continual useIt will probably come into frequent contact with dirty things and so it should be continually cleaned and washed otherwise one should not go on using it anymoreThe Citta works the whole time always thinking speaking and actingTherefore the Citta is important to people and to other beings who think and imagine all the time without thinking whether what is good or bad is dangerous to themselves or to others who are in any way associated with themThe Buddhist religion is like water which washes and cleanses the Citta keeping it always cleanIf this Citta is likened to clothes one can say that they are fit to be worn or if it likened to household utensils they are suitable for use and are not unpleasantBut if they are not washed and cleaned constantly they become unfit for useThe Citta which is not good is like thisThe Citta which is regularly washed and trained is likely to be clear clean calm cool and developed in ways appropriate to Dhamma and there is nothing in the world which can accept the Dhamma as well as the Citta which is a vessel for receiving DhammaThe Lord Buddha practiced until his heart was pure so the Dhamma is clean and the heart of the Lord is clean and free from blemish taint or intoxication with the world so regardless of status or caste he taught all equally and Buddhism is therefore not a danger to anyoneLike clean water people of every status and caste can use it and nobody dislikes itBuddhism comes from the Lord who was genuinely pure and the Lord Buddha was thus the first hand to be cleanThe hands of the Savakas of the Lord Buddha are also clean so the first hand and the second hand are clean and because the Savaka Sangha had all attained purity and arahantship the Dhamma which was propagated and taught in those days was clean and gave results to those who listened with full attentionFrom then on it began to get more and more tainted and the taints were connected with those who were associated with the religionReligion thus became a basis for criticism such that other religions that people did not like were seen as being enemies to their own religionThen there arose a liking for this religion and a loathing for that one which was not the intention of the religion nor of the founderThe founder of every true religion does not want people to spoil its harmony nor to break it up and oppose the religious teachingThey taught that people should blend well together and not split up and break harmony for this is a hindrance to the religionBut because the heart has the world within it this world hidden inside has the power to make people go according to what is hidden there and the religion is therefore a danger to those who dislike it and a boon to those who like itAmongst those who believe in different religions there arose conflict and disagreement and they looked down on reviled and despised each others religionReligion thus became a tool for the two sides to quarrel over with dirty hearts which drove them onBut the religions remained good because they taught people to be good people as accords with their knowledge ability and good intentionsIn the same way as we learned various branches of knowledge at school not all of which came from one teacher for one taught us this and another taught us that and it is just about impossible that they should all have taught exactly the same thingsThe Lord Buddha taught so that people would attain the level of arahantAn arahant is one who has reached the level of Visuddhi Guna  he is a pure person and a pure CittaWhatever basic level of development a person has he can teach to that level but depending also on his inherent ability to teachThe person who learns can also receive the teaching to an extent depending on his inherent ability to learnTherefore the extent to which we will be able to follow and practice the way of the religion will also depend on our own ability because to go further than the ability of the teacher and the ability of the pupil who practices it is almost impossibleIf anyone brings up any of the essential points of Dhamma from the subject of todays talk I will be very glad to explain it in accordance with mindfulness and wisdom in a practical wayAll of us in ourselves variously have hope in our hearts for we are not people who have given up hope but it does not yet show itself so that we may know it in ourselvesSome hopes have already been fulfilled some have not and some have only been partly fulfilledThe principles of Dhamma in Buddhism bring people fulfillment of their hopes in a way that is complete and satisfactoryThere is no need to talk of people who have given up hope because they have not decided to become good people so they are likely to remain hopelessTherefore we should act and behave in such a way that will always give us hopeHope makes us good people who practice generosity morality and Bhavana and based on this whether today tomorrow this life or in future lives we will not be people who have no refuge and no support for we have the Dhamma which continues to be with usNormally the heart has good evil and neutral things in it and it can deteriorate or developThe wisest people therefore try to train the Citta so that they become good people and when it gets difficult they will try to be victorious over all bad things so as to take hold of Dhamma as their refuge and as the basic principle of their heartsThey will then get the hopes of their hearts in full measure in the futureAny of you who have questions may ask them now either about Dhamma which has been explained today  or any other day if you wishThe hearts of people cannot disappear for they can develop they can deteriorate or they can be made pure and when the Citta has become pure happiness which is not of the type found in this world will be found by the one who practices and he will find in himself what kind of happiness it is and to what extent alsoIf you can be confident in yourself that the method of fighting against Dukkha by investigating it is the best and highest way you should analyze Dukkha into external and internalBut practicing and striving in this way is truly very painful  as though all ones bones are breaking apart or hot as though one is on fire all overOne wants to know the extent of ones ability but one must fight before one knows how far ones Citta is able to goOne still does not know for sure what Dukkha Vedana really is whether it is Dukkha the cause of Dukkha the cessation of Dukkha or the path leading to the cessation of Dukkha so mindfulness and wisdom must be used to search and think it out and if one can search it out to completion it can quench Dukkha like burning gunpowder which flares up and in a moment it all goes out  and the Citta remainsTherefore take up Dukkha Vedana and examine which Dukkha this is at the moment when the body breaks up and ceasesIn truth Dukkha arises and ceases continuously but that the Citta should die never happens in fact the Citta becomes more and more clear and drops into a state of calm beyond ones expectationsBut those who are afraid of death will get more and more of deathTherefore one should take up this Citta Bhavana and practice itBut it is a much more difficult thing to do than the ordinary methods of the type in which one sleeps at times and wakes up at times which does not give results such as one ought to getThose who want the highest results should not feel repelled by this method which can fight the tricks and deceits of the Kilesas better than other methodsThe training is difficult in the beginning for to start with one has never done it before one has never seen what results come from doing it and one must depend on mindfulness to force one to do it going against ones inclinations by using reason to show the need for itBut once the results of this begin to appear in ones Citta interest the will to do it and the effort will all steadily followThen the more that results appear whether great or small the more and more strange and unusual and the effort then comes of itselfThose factors of Dhamma which are the means of attaining successful results  being the four Iddhipada including Chanda Viriya Citta and Vimamsa  will steadily become stronger until they enable one who practices to attain his intended goal without any obstacle being able to stop himTraining in Samadhi is the same as the aboveTo begin with one must use mindfulness constantly to supervise and force the Citta to do itAs he goes on doing it the one who practices will be successful and get various results for himself and he will gain skill and abilityWhen he practices Samadhi and strives and gets rid of the Kilesas until he eventually becomes free from them all he still goes on doing Samadhi but he no longer strives for freedom from the Kilesas anymore because they have already goneWhen he lies down to rest and sleep he stops but when he gets up he uses mindfulness and wisdom in all sorts of activities including the practice of Samadhi meditation which he continues to do for he does not throw away the work that he has done in the same way as someone who knows about books and is able to read and write a lotHe goes on doing this so that it shall be of increasing value in various ways and he does not stop just because he is able to read and writeThe practicing of Samadhi meditation by those who have got rid of the Kilesas is like this they must go on doing it for the purpose of Vihara Dhamma  living comfortably in this world where the Dhatu and Khandhas liveThe Lord Buddha and the Savakas in the TiPitaka all said that they had to force themselves to put forward effort very often before they gained EnlightenmentFrom then up to the time when they each entered Parinibbana the Buddha and the Savakas still entered Samadhi and Nirodha Samapatti which was a way for the Citta to dwell comfortably at ease amongst the Khandhas which is called Vihara Dhamma  Dhamma as a dwelling place  until the time when the Citta departs from the body which cannot last any longer and enters Nibbana which is the ultimate happiness free from trouble of any kind at allWhen the Lord Buddha was about to enter Parinibbana he entered SamadhiHe entered the first Jhana and went up stage by stage to the state of Saññavedayitanirodha Samapatti and then he returned step by step back to the first JhanaThen he entered the first Jhana and went up to the fourth Jhana and then attained Parinibbana between the rupa Jhanas and the Arupa JhanasBecause the Lord Buddha was able to do and experience the highest levels like this all the Savakas persevered in following his example until they succeeded in becoming arahants after the Lord BuddhaThe Lord Buddha sought and found Dhamma until he became enlightened and he upheld this as the Dhamma method which he continually taught to his followers until the day he entered NibbanaAll of us therefore have taken to heart with faith thatcontinually in our status as Buddhists and we do not hold anyone else as our refuge in a heartfelt way as we do the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha which are the most excellent and supremeWhen the Khandas and Citta had still not separated they entered Samadhi Samapatti in whatever way suited their characters and their skills until they reached the end of their timeJhana is the realm which gives the heart a rest whereas Vipassana is the examination of the things of nature so as to know clearly what is the truth of them and to let go ones attachment for them one after another until one comes to the end of the things that one should let go ofThen one reaches purity and freedom from themAs to the question whether Vipassana will lead to Jhana or not this is the concern of stupid people who speculate in their habitual ways of thought and then do not begin to do anything in connection with them Ones basic or fundamental knowing  this is the Citta and it will go on to create becoming and birth going to be born wherever it may be depending on how those things which are infused into the CittaGoing by general principles mindfulness and wisdom are Dhamma which can arise and cease in the same way as other things everywhereTherefore to say that they are one and the same as the heart is not proper but on the other hand they are factors of the path  or tools for curing the Kilesas so as to attain purity of heartAs for sitting together with anyone or not this will probably depend on circumstancesBut the important thing is that one should sit according to ones own temperament and whether this will be for a long time or not will be up to oneselfThe word Anatta is a factor of the TiLakkhana and someone who aims for purity freedom and Nibbana should contemplate Aniccam Dukkham Anatta until they see and understand these TiLakkhana clearlyThen it may be said that the Citta has well gone free Because Nibbana is not Anatta for how can one force it to be Anatta which is one of the TiLakkhana which are the path for getting to NibbanaWhen the Citta is calm it also wants to sleep which is strangeIn other words when the Citta is calm it is contented and when it is not calm it is not contentedWhen thinking far and wide it is not contented and does not want to sleep but as soon as the Citta begins to get calmer and calmer it wants to sleep which means that it will get increasing happinessA short while ago I was sitting developing calm and also felt that I would like to sleep but I did not let it go as far as sleep because sleep puts both the Citta and the body into a state of restWhile one is listening to a Dhamma talk and one becomes absorbed in listening to the Dhamma and the Citta is attending to the words of the Dhamma talk which is its only object of attention the Citta gradually becomes more and more calm and then it tends to become drowsy and can go into a dreamy dozeSome people blame themselves saying How is thiswhen I am alone or talking with my friends I dont feel sleepy but why is it that when I listen to a Dhamma talk I want to sleep and lie down and I sit nodding out of controlFrom where does this Mara comeWhat is this about MaraThe Citta has never had happiness and contentment and as soon as it gets the stream of Dhamma lulling it into happiness calm and contentment it just wants to go to sleepThen from where does Mara comeIn truth the owner is Mara who disturbs the owner himself all day and all night without getting peace and contentment until the Citta cannot sleep because it is not calmOne does not know the reason for this and as soon as one listens to Dhamma when the teacher gives a Dhamma talk the Citta grows calm and thus wants to sleepOne then says that it is MaraTruly it is not Mara for everybody as soon as they become contented want to sleepThis means that the result of the stage in which the Citta is sufficiently contented is that it wants to sleep and this is the first stage in which one has received trainingIf the Citta has a foundation of calm then it has work to do while listening to a Dhamma talk  and the work will depend on the foundation or basic level of the Citta then it will not be drowsyIf it has been doing Samadhi then it will be engrossed in SamadhiBut if it is at the level of wisdom it will become engrossed while the teacher is giving the Dhamma talkOnes heart will tend to follow and become enraptured by the object of attention of DhammaIt is as though the Teacher helps to clear the way so that one can follow in his footsteps step by stepThis indicates that one has got to the stage of Vipassana  which is contemplation  and the Citta is engrossed in following because of which there is no drowsinessThis shows how drowsiness occurs when one begins to do practiceIn other words the Citta does not want to drop into a state of calm but as soon as it begins to get calm the calm makes it want to lie down and sleep  because this is contentmentIn evaluating or proving a religion and most especially Buddhism  which is the teaching of the Buddha  the evaluation should be done with ones own heartIn what way did the Lord teachTake up the Lords method and go and practice it or take up the method which the Lord taught and enter into the practice for the sake of ones own heart  in other words practice to develop ones heartIf ones heart follows the way that the Lord taught what sort of results will one getOne will come to know for oneself gradually and this will be the proof of the Buddhist teaching of Dhamma in ones own heart showing to one what things are good and true and what are falseOne will come to know this gradually by grasping the principles of the teaching as that which points out the evidence so as to know the truth and falsehood which is in ones own heart  and they are not to be found anywhere else but only in ones own heartGenerally one does not know that they are false things and one cannot know from where or from what the falsehood comesWhen one does not know this one thinks that one is good and clever  more clever than any teaching more clever than Buddhism more clever than the Buddha more clever than any teacher who founded a religion to teach to the worldThis is the assumed opinion of self even while one is being extremely stupid and in fact it is ones being extremely stupid that makes one think how one is supremely cleverWhen one has taken up the principles of Buddhism and put them into practice to test and see how much and how far they are true and where they are false then one will be able to know how it is with the principles of Dhamma which the Lord taughtTo begin with one is not able to do this so one starts by taking it in brief or taking up a short or easy method such as the Lords teaching of BhavanaHow does one fix ones attention so that it may be called BhavanaIn the principles which are taught in the Lords Religion there are various different methods to suit the abilities of those who practice so that they may attain a calm and peaceful heart  which is the result that comes from practiceFor example fixing ones attention on ones breath going in and outIn doing this one should continually feel the breath as it enters and leaves not letting ones attention slip and wander away and not letting go of the Citta sending it away to other thingsJust develop understanding and knowing of the breath  this is one method of knowing about the truth and falsehood of ones own heartWhen ones heart becomes calm one will see the falsehood of ones heart and at the same time one will also see the truth that is in itIn addition one will both see how wrong and faulty is the restless distracted wandering of the heart which causes one to be agitated and to suffer and also the merit and virtue of a calm cool heart which is ones happiness while the heart is calmThis is called inwardly seeing both the wrong and the right at the same timeOne who has determined to practice truly is bound to see in this way because the principles of Buddhism are the guarantee that the causes are correct and accurate and that the results are satisfying the Lord Buddha having been the first to experience themHere is one method and only one method among all the methods to try out concerning the Citta so as so see results coming steadily from the practiceThus to have mindfulness and clear self awareness to be aware of oneself all the timeThis is a way to be careful and watchful of the Citta only letting it know what is within the field which one has established so that it has a limited boundary to its knowingOne does not allow it to know in a scattered and aimless way without any limit or boundary just as it feels inclined which is the way that nearly everybody in the world actsFor knowledge and understanding of this sort is not the type of knowledge and understanding which goes towards that level which gives rise to happiness and contentment enabling causes and results to be seenOne must therefore have a limited field in doing the practice for the development of the Citta by holding to the principles of Dhamma which are the principles of Buddhism and the way for the Citta to goOr they are the way so that the Citta will walk along those paths which are taught in Buddhism  which is the way that leads in the right direction and not otherwiseIf the Citta is to be set up and held by the use of one or another of the Parikamma words ones attention must be kept on that Parikamma wordIf it slips away to think of all sorts of things one should try to understand what has happened or one should search for devices or methods of training it in various ways such as rapidly repeating the Parikamma wordBut whatever device or method enables ones heart to gain the result of a calm cool heart and to arouse various skillful devices in ones heart may be considered as a right method of training oneselfIf the Citta becomes more or less calm then concern disturbance time and place do not get in and make connection with itThere is just knowing and dwelling alone and this is happinessWhether one sits for a long time or not there is nothing which comes to cause disturbances for in whatever place one sits and for however long nothing comes into relationship with the Citta as long as the Citta does not go out and get entangled with things and as long as it has Dhamma as the object of attentionThere is a state of calm by dwelling alone and there is selfknowing right there at that timeThis is called knowing in the ways of meditation  or knowing in the ways of guarding the CittaThere is a boundary to knowing and seeing and this is the method of progressing to begin withHowever long one goes on doing the practice one should not abandon or give up the method which one has been in the habit of using and practicing but hold on to it as a foundationThus for example if one has been using Anapanasati one takes the breath as the foundation to start withBut the skill of the Citta which has done this constantly for a long time and attained calm often will know things at a speed which is very different from normal and after just one moment it will have passed onPassed on to subtlety disappeared and gone utterly quiet and one will not know where the breath has goneThis indicates the skill of the Citta like when one writes if one writes the word you someone who is learning to write must think of the first letter then the second and so on until it is finished but after having learned for a long time the letters the sounds the vowels and consonants all arise togetherSkill of the Citta whether in Samadhi or in Pañña is similar to this  and the Lord called it JhanaThe four Jhanas  first Jhana second Jhana third Jhana fourth Jhana are the Rupa Jhanas and beyond this are the four Arupa Jhanas altogether making the  attainments  plus Saññavedayitta Nirodha which is the quelling of Sañña and VedanaBut these Samapattis are Dhammas that are special or connected with the characteristic abilities of those who are inclined to go this way and they will occur spontaneouslyBut these are not Dhammas that are necessary to the Path or the Fruition in which there is the getting rid of Kilesas and reaching the levels and states of purity of heart leading to arahantshipBut however this may be if anyone is skilled in Jhana it is similar to that person who is skilled in writing and that is allThus the first Jhana the second Jhana and so on  he can immediately reach all of them because of the speed of the CittaBut the characteristics of a Citta such as this which changes its state steadily does not go up like we go up stairs step by step for however able we are at going up stairs we do not jump several steps at a time but go up one by oneBut the skill of this Citta is such that one moment it can reach its intended goal with extreme rapidityThere is nothing that is faster than the heart and this heart is the fastest for the more it becomes skilled in these functions the faster it becomes beyond the imagination of anyone who has not seen the power of the Citta of one who is used to knowing and seeing various things in the path of the practice of DhammaSamadhi is similar for such a personJust sitting once the heart has become accustomed to being calmed by his own skill there is no need for him to find a Parikamma word to fix his attention to compel and tie down the Citta and to make it enter a state of calm for just limiting the Citta by means of mindfulness it immediately becomes fully calmedWithin just half a second it becomes calm and reaches a state of tranquillity nothing hinders it and it drops to the level of SamadhiThis is what is meant by one who has skill in SamadhiAs soon as he fixes his attention for just one moment it goes entirely through like we can write the word you and immediately read it without any need to grope and think and search for the vowels and consonants spending a lot of time as we had to in the beginningIn speaking of the levels of Samadhi when one is skilled it is as described aboveBut please do not believe that you are skilled or not skilled for this is anticipation which goes out from yourself and then returns to deceive you wasting a lot of time and preventing you from seeing the results in the way that you ought toWhether one is skilled or not let it be that one trains oneself in that Dhamma and discipline which one has been in the habit of usingThis is an important principle which one also uses in learning to write for one writes a single letter over and over again until one is skilled at doing itThere is no need to anticipate the way to write all the other letters for in due time skill at them will grow of itself as one goes on practicingThe method of training the heart is like this for skill will arise and grow in oneselfPAAPañña is wisdom of the CittaThinking and putting things together and contemplating using reason based on Dhamma in various ways was called Pañña by Lord BuddhaIn other words carefully examining contemplating investigating the elements the Khandhas the changes of nature both externally and internally going on all the time everywhere always for if anybody has mindfulness and wisdom to fix his attention anywhere the whole of it will be DhammaAll these things are like grindstones for sharpening wisdom continually and all the time in every position and posture one will see all these natural things displaying their characteristics and letting one know them by way of wisdom all the time and therefore Dhamma is to be found everywhereIt is not to be found just in oneself nor just when one sits doing meditation or walking Cankama for it is there at all times if one will make it be there and keep it there in all situationsIn regard to ones skill in Samadhi or in mindfulness and wisdom these will be the same as has already been explained aboveBut one cannot explain much because it becomes too involvedIn regard to ones skill in Samadhi or in mindfulness and wisdom these will be the same as has already been explained aboveBut one cannot explain much because it becomes too involvedIn regard to wisdom this is vast and very strangeIf one is to do what is truly appropriate one should just explain to those who have a need to listen to that particular aspect of wisdom and this is the most suitable way to do itApart from this one may explain enough to be a step or a pathway so that those who are beginning to train themselves in investigation may follow it as in the explanation which has just been givenThe Citta can be trained and the characteristics of the Citta are things which can go on altering and changing step by stepFrom being refined they can fall down and become gross again depending on oneself who is the owner of them and the way in which one directs them to goThus for example we have trained ourselves in the moral precepts and we are at present training in meditation for Samadhi and this is the training of the Citta which raises it up to a higher levelIf one considers the processes of the Citta then thinking of everything from the point of view of reason and morality is a way to make one act so that one rises higher  but there will also be things which one will have to get rid of from oneselfIn other words there are both those things that one sees to be bad which should be got rid of and also those things that one sees to be right which one should practice and develop more and moreThis may be called the practice or the training of the Citta to attain the level of knowing and seeing in which there are causes and results going up steadily higherIf the Citta deteriorates knowledge and understanding change and become lower and lower steadilyBut if the Citta reaches purity entire and complete neither deterioration nor development take place because the conditions that bring about deterioration and development have then disappeared from the heartThere remains only complete purity  the heart is Dhamma and Dhamma is the heartThe heart and Dhamma are one and the sameFrom then on there is no more changing and altering and then one has come to the end of the practice of Brahmacariya for attaining the higher levels of Dhamma and has completed the task of getting rid of the Kilesas of every sortWhen he has finished both the task of getting rid of and that of developing what else is there to get rid ofThere is nothing else here because everything has been got rid of alreadyAnd there is nothing more he can do to develop higher than this because he has reached the highest alreadyAs to deteriorating there is no basis for this to happen because this is Akuppa Dhamma  unshakable Dhamma  and there is no way for the Citta to deteriorateThe work which ought to be done which is that of getting rid of and developing has already been done to completionThis kind of Citta has nothing mundane entering and hiding in it  no time no place no past or future related to the present such as for example now it is like this in the future what will it be like  this sort of thing does not come in this CittaThis life is like this next life will be like that  does not occur in it  because the past and future have come together into existing in the present and have become pure in the one heartPast and future which used to be associated with the heart therefore have no meaning at all because the heart is devoid of any meaning such as would lead it into all sorts of delusionsIf one called this the ultimate Citta and the ultimate limit of the path along which the Citta goes it would not be wrongAll that has been said here has been said by way of the principles of practice which are the results that come from the practice of the DhammaThese principles follow the religion of the Buddha which is the right way to go unchanging in which all Buddhists can be confidentThere is no room to think with doubt that this Dhamma of the Lord Buddha has anything in it which may cause the world to be disruptedNor can it lead us to disappointment or to loss of faith for where could this be so in all the DhammakkhandhasNowhereTherefore there are no problems for those who practice accordinglyThe only question that remains is How to act and practice so as to progress in accordance with the principles of the Dhamma of the Lord BuddhaThis is called the Svakkhata Dhamma and it is also Niyyanika Dhamma  leading those who practice rightly and well to get free steadily from obstacles which are obstructions within the heart until they penetrate through and reach Vimutti ultimate freedom and then there is nothing left remaining in the heartThis is the ultimate and final result that comes from the practice of the Dhamma of BuddhismWhen one has reached this level the heart and the religion are one and the sameThe Sasana and the heart cannot then blame or find fault with each otherThe heart is then genuine the Sasana is also genuine each is respectively genuine and trueIt is thus that the Lord Buddha said Whoever sees the Dhamma sees the Tathagata meaning this DhammaHere the Tathagata is not the bodily form of the BuddhaAlthough this bodily form is one aspect of the Tathagata and means that bodily form of the Lord Buddha which is of the same nature as the bodies which we all haveIn other words the body is the bodily form of the supreme Buddha and someone having seen the Lord having saluted paid homage and Puja to the Lord who delights the eyes and the heart could say that he had seen the Tathagata with his eyes  and this may be considered as seeing one kind of TathagataAnother way is when someone recollects the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha with faith and belief then it may be said that they have reached Dhamma or reached the Lord BuddhaYet another way is when someone attains to the level of Sotapanna Sakadagami or Anagami going on stage by stage then this may be called seeing the Tathagata step by step until they reach the final consummationThe true Tathagata is purity of Dhamma and purity of heart so that Dhamma and the heart are one and the same and one can find no way to separate them and analyze them apartWherever the heart is there the Dhamma is and wherever the Dhamma is there the Tathagata isThen it can be said Who sees the Dhamma sees the Tathagata Seeing in the way of practice is like this  in other words to experience Dhamma at the level of Purity by way of the heart following the Lord Buddha is called seeing Dhamma or seeing the Tathagata consummatelyThen one has no doubts whether the Parinibbana of the Lord Buddha was years ago or many aeons ago because all this is relative convention which is the same as the conventions of the world everywhereThus the texts have recorded where and when the Lord was at different times and places to act as a signpost waiting there to indicate the time and place of the Lord variously for Buddhists who pay homage and have faith in the Lord by doing obeisance and Puja on the anniversariesBut as far as the true Tathagata which is complete purity of heart is concerned there is no time and place associated with this at all and for one who is entirely pure wherever he may be it is the same as if he was before the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha the whole time  Akaliko  eternallyTherefore please practice these Buddhist teachings so that they develop in your hearts which means to say that you will not be without the Lord as the Teacher wherever you go and this is the same as being before the Master the Dhamma and the Sangha at all times until you reach Vimutti  freedom within your CittaThen you will know for sure who the Master really is without having any doubtsThis explanation of Dhamma is I think sufficient so I will end hereIn listening to a Dhamma talk in the manner of those who practice generally one is not more interested in remembering what is said than in looking at the Citta and the Dhamma which the teacher is explaining at that time in order that one may get value while listeningFor instance the Citta may gain calm or some ways of wisdom may then arise and get rid of some kinds of KilesasNow I will answer questionsThe teaching of the Lord Buddha is said to be composed of Dhamma Khandhas which is not much because the Lord Buddha summarised making it suitable to the strength of beings in the worldWhen one is doing practice knowledge branches out more and more so that among those who are doing practice when they speak to each other they can gain a lot more knowledgeBut if one has not yet gained results from practice however it is explained it is not likely to be of much useThe Lord Buddha had experienced more than the others and when the Savakas went to speak to him and ask him about knowledge saying that they had come across this and had had experiences of that kind the Lord knew all about it already and could answer immediatelyBecause the things which happen to each person are different and someone who has already had such experiences will understand them and can therefore guide them on the way along which he has already goneJhana means to concentrate intently  repeat Buddho Buddho Buddho and it will become JhanaJhana is a natural principle but Jhana is not essential for developing wisdom because in contemplating form there is Vitakka  which is disentangling those things which one sees and if this is done in a natural way the one who practices can have Jhana depending on his own characteristics though it may not go in the way that it is usually explainedThe word Jhana interests us Buddhists a great deal even though we have hardly had any genuine results of Jhana  but we tend to talk extravagantly about it enough to be annoyingThere is no need to memorize everything while one is listening but one should compose the heart and let it be knowing within oneself and one should not send it elsewhere at that timeThe Citta will then receive knowledge in continually following the Dhamma which is being explainedThen the results of calm and peace will ariseOr it will arouse various ways and means which come to one while one is listeningThis is what is meant by making gains from listening in the way of practice in the same way as those in the past who practiced in this mannerAfter this the VanAcharn led a short meditation practice for five minutes after which the meeting closedI will begin by explaining Dhamma as I have done beforeAfterwards those who have questions from various viewpoints that they want to ask will be able to do soListening to Dhamma such as I told it to you yesterday the question was asked by somebody about being able to remember and not being able to remember and of what value it is if one cannot rememberListening to Dhamma in the way of those who practice they understand what is being explained while they are listeningBut now the Teacher speaks a different language and you who listen may not yet be able to understand while the teacher is explainingBut if your Citta stays just in front  in other words the determination to listen at this time has been made  this together with the flow of Dhamma which is being explained goes inward and touches one within the CittaThis will make the heart aware of the impact of the sound and it will at least become calm and coolThis is so because the sound is an emotionally based object which can cause the Citta to be a present CittaAs for those who listen and understand the language all the time while explanations are being given they have something which they can know clearly while listeningThen the Citta becomes engrossed in that aspect of Dhamma which the Teacher is explainingBecause in explaining this Dhamma he must speak about or say things which are there in us also for these things are to be found everywhere in the worldIn other words the things which the teacher of Dhamma talks about and which Buddhism teaches concern those things that are inherently in beings and Sankharas everywhereThese things one should also be able to know as well as to understand about those things which are within oneselfIn the system of religion which the Lord taught at that time he gave instruction about this also and we who listen can gradually gain understanding of the truths in the Dhamma that he taughtWhile listening and when ones Citta is paying close attention to the Dhamma which is being taught ones heart will gradually become calm and cool and while listening one does not think of going to all sorts of places nor of any objects of attachmentThen ones heart can drop into a state of calm undisturbed and contented so that one forgets the time and other things until one forgets ones tiredness and stiffness and everything elseIf ones Citta has a strong inclinations to go the way of investigation which the Lord called Vipassana or Pañña the story is different for while Dhamma is being explained the Citta will keep moving and following continuously like walking behind and following in the footsteps of the Teacher who is going aheadEach time he raises a foot one steps in the footprint after him step by stepIn other words the Teacher clears the way so that one may know and understand while listeningWhen one knows understands and contemplates following the Teacher it makes one become engrossed and absorbed in the Kilesas and Asavas while one is listeningIt is for just this reason that in the time of the Lord Buddha when the Savakas listened to the Lord revealing Dhamma many attained Magga Phala and NibbanaSometimes the Citta advances up to a certain point and then when it listens again in the future the Citta goes higher  and so on each time it goes up step by step until it reaches the highest point of Dhamma which they call penetrating the highest Dhamma by understanding just while listeningNot being interested in trying to remember is of value while one is listening to Dhamma in that one gets a calm and cool heart one steadily gets a clear understanding one gets happiness and contentment and one gains various skillful methodsThese are the results which are gained while listening which cannot be gained from trying to remember such as reciting Dhamma in various Suttas over and over again so as to memorize themBut if anything or any part of Dhamma gets left behind in ones memory one can oneself remember itListening to Dhamma as done by those who practice is therefore held in high regard amongst themI would like to tell you some things about Tan Acharn Mun who was a Teacher in this line of Kammatthana so that all of you may know a little about himIn what things was he most active or interested in connection with all the followers who went to be trained by himHe was more interested in pointing out the training in Dhamma to the Bhikkhus and Samaneras who went to learn with him than anything elseHe would carefully watch the manners behavior and conduct in practice of the Bhikkhus and Samaneras for fear that they would go wrong and deviate from the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya  this is the second thingBut the first was the training and teaching to get the Bhikkhus and Samaneras to understand the present Dhamma which is the focal point of the higher knowing and understanding right up to the highest Path and FruitionWhen he gave a talk on Dhamma if there were only Bhikkhus and Samaneras present he would go on sometimes for two hours before finishing sometimes three or four hours and occasionally for six hoursBut it was also strange how all those who were there sitting listening were quiet not making a sound  almost as if there were no Bhikkhus and Samaneras there at allOne heard just the sound of the Dhamma that he taught step by step without breaking the sequence or missing out any steps until he finishedHowever many Bhikkhus and Samaneras were present it was as though there were none there because each of them was listening with interest and concentrated attentionEvery one of them was in a state of calm the aim of the Citta being to attain the truth and Dhamma so as to have a calm and cool heartIf the Citta steps in towards the realm of wisdom which means being able to think and contemplate following the Acariya the Citta then adjusts and adapts to his Dhamma all the timeAt both levels we can say that it makes one absorbed in the following ways In the first stage  CalmOne becomes absorbed in the way of calm and in the Dhamma which lulls the Citta into a calm contented stateThe second stage  wisdomOne becomes engrossed in the Dhamma which steadily causes the Citta to gain the wayThus ones interest in the Dhamma is such that no interest remains in being tired or stiff while one is listening and while the Teacher is giving a talk just about practice from the story of Samadhi and wisdom right through to the endThe story of Sila was not necessary because it was covered by the behavior and practice of each one who was presentHe did not talk of many things but only about the principles of Samadhi Wisdom and VimuttiOn those days when there was a meeting and he gave a talk he was sure to go right through until he reached the subject of the path fruition and Nibbana in the one talk and he never got stuck or diverted in any part of itThis was due to his character because he had great knowledge and ability in the field of practice and he had circumspection and great skill in the way of practiceWhen ones heart has been continuously trained in the ways of Dhamma it will have a basis to hold on to and the heart which has a basis to hold on to is because of that likely to live happily and to be normally happy as well as being happy in doing ones duties and earning a livingOne then lives happily and one dies happily because one has a basis to hold on to within one and those who have such a basis are not likely to be troubled and anxiousDhamma is the basis to hold on to for the heart and objects in the world are the basis to hold on to or the dependent conditions of the body  such as for example buildings clothing and various types of foods which are the sustenance and the refuges that the body depends on and lives withThat we have the necessity of depending on these things is because we have been born and born from these things and we must depend on these things as the means of curing ills and maintaining the body continually until the end of lifeAs for the heart it has Dhamma as its help as the thing it depends on as its guardian and as its nourishment  for it is said that Dhamma is the food of the heart  or it is the Arammana of the heartBut in regard to the word Arammana there are both good and evil ArammanaIf the Arammana is not good it is poison to the heart and inflames the Citta causing it to be troubled and anxiousIf the Arammana is good it makes the Citta cool and happy and then it becomes buried in that Citta which is what they call Upanissaya or Vasana Parami which means the continuous building up of what is good and right However much this has been developed it will be buried down in the Citta of that person until it becomes increasing Nissaya VasanaWhen the heart changes and moves off to another place another life another realm it must depend on the virtue that one has done and the amount of it that one has accumulated in ones heartThis is what turns the Citta making it go in a good direction to have Sugati that which is hoped for and this is where one lives and experiencesThe body has a graveyardWherever one goes to live and set up home there must be a graveyard for the body in that place for regardless of whether one lives in the country in the town in the forest the hills a cave or on the bare ground there is also a graveyard with every one of themBecause this form of nature is something that has been born so it is bound to die and wherever it dies that place is a graveyardThis is the way of the bodyAs for the Citta it has no graveyard because the heart does not dieRight here is a great and important principle so please take note of this and remember it well for this is an unchanging principle of truth in regard to ourselvesIf someone has rightly thought about and properly investigated the story of the Citta and tried to practice in himself all the virtues of Dhamma which are in the teachings and if he has hopes of living anywhere going anywhere or being born in any place he will not be disappointed in his expectations or in the intended goal which he sets himselfAnd the hopes which he sets his heart on will be fulfilledThis is like all of us who have come here to learn todayIn other words we come here to learn Dhamma so that it will go into the heart and be a basis to hold on to and so that the heart will depend on this Dhamma as its ruling principleBecause this heart is something that does not die it is not destined for the graveyard unlike the physical elements and the Khandhas  which are the bodyThe body breaks up and disappears but the heart does not break up and when it goes from this body it goes into another body and leaving that one it goes on to anotherGoing higher lower up and down because of those things which are within the Citta that the Lord called Vipaka which arise from Kamma  ie the actions that the Citta itself doesThe Citta is the one who thinks and imagines things both good and evil and the Citta is the one who compels them to go out in the direction of speech or body so causing them to become actions of speech or bodyThose actions which are done in the heart are called Mano Kamma those done by way of speech are called Vaci Kamma and those done by way of body are called Kaya Kamma The word kamma means the doing of action which can take place in our bodies speech or heartsThis is important for when Kamma which is the good or evil that dwells there opens the way for the result Sukha or Dukkha  which is the result of good or evil Kamma  is liable to arise of such a kind one cannot prevent itManokamma is action done by way of the mind speech or body each of which can be good or evil or neutral and these actions are what the Lord called Kamma and according to the principles of Buddhism they are also called Kamma The movements of the Citta of the body and speech were considered by the Lord to be actions which are called Kamma When there are actions and movements as a consequence of actions Vipaka  the results  must steadily go on being derived from them and it is only that they variously arise a little bit more quickly or slowly for some kinds can arise as results quickly and some slowlyLike results of things that we can see in the world some kinds arise in a short time some arise immediately and some take a long time before they appear but in the end they are all results just the sameThis is what the Lord called Vipaka which one has within ones heartThe heart is the one that made it that did it some the heart can remember and some it cannotBut ultimately it will forget because it is making it all the time in every realm and every life in every day and night in every month and yearWho can succeed in memorizing and retaining all this firmly in mind since the time he was borne in this worldLet alone days or months ago for even just today one cannot remember some of the things that one has thought aboutBut thinking imagining and doing of good or evil by way of ones body and speech take place without depending upon being able to rememberThey just depend upon the action of doing them and good or evil results are bound to become apparent from those actions all the timeThis is an important principle and therefore the Lord taught that one should always do some good and now is the opportunity when we can develop something of value or cure whatever we see to be defective in every nook and crannyThis is not beyond our abilityOnce one has gone beyond this life there is uncertainty both in doing actions and in partaking of the results because in the realm of ghosts or Devas it seems that there are no factories such as we human beings haveTo be satisfied with being lazy in doing good in this world and then to go and be energetic in the next world  the world of ghosts or of Devas  this is a wrong way of understandingAll the men of great wisdom have thus taught that the one who came to teach us is not stupidHis name is the Lord Buddha and he is the supreme teacher the teacher of all the three realms the one who truly understands and clearly sees every part and section of the Dhamma which he himself taught with certainty  being the truthThere is no false changeable Dhamma hidden within this teaching and it is thus that the Lord called it Svakkhata Dhamma which means The Dhamma that the Lord Buddha has taught well The word well means perfectly and completely in all waysNiyyanika Dhamma is the Dhamma which enables those who practice properly in accord with Dhamma to get free from Dukkha progressivelyThere is no way for doubt at all for it is Dhamma that is unchanging and certainWho can speak rightly and precisely every time like the Lord BuddhaOne feels that there has not been anyone else in our world of peopleTo make a comparison ordinary people everywhere if they speak words will speak at least which are likely to be false and only speak trueIf they speak for a long time the false words will probably increase and they may all become falseBut the words of the Lord Buddha are not false because his heart is not falseThe heart of the Lord is a pure heart and it knows truly and understands truly which is derived from practicing truly and then the Lord gives any teaching it comes out of his heart which is both good and true  then from where could anything be foundSo it is a supreme teaching and he is the World Teacher which all of us hold as the unchanging principle or as that in which we can have implicit faith so that we can say The Lord Buddha and the religion of Dhamma of the Lord are not enemies or opponents of any of us The Lord Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha are those that are supreme and have Dhamma  excellence above the worldThe teaching of the Lord which was the establishment of Buddhism was given for the group that followed himIt was not given for the Lord Buddha for the Dhamma for any of the Savaka Sangha all of whom had passed beyond Dukkha alreadyBut it was given just for usThe Lord was not lacking anything which might make him desire for results from us as payment for it was only because of his Metta that he gave the teaching to his followers so that they could take it as the direction for them to goWe have only to practice following the teaching of the LordBut then we see that it is difficult to do and we are unable to struggle and follow the way the Lord wentHow then shall we live in this world and in what way so as to have happiness both bodily and mentally which is appropriate to human beings who are clever in searching for happiness for themselvesThis is a question that we should consider and ask ourselves at such times as laziness and carelessness arise so as to cure these things which are Mara waiting to block the way forwardWe can do this by methods which we like using Dhamma and our skill and cleverness so as to have a way to go on in order to gain happiness and the fulfillment of our hopes so as to be not entirely barred and blocked in every existence every life every day and all the time like it is here where it is full of Dukkha in our hearts until we cannot find a way and method of getting rid of itThis is to be expected where there are so many people in the present world that there is almost no earth left for living onBut there are still those who are clever and sharpwitted who find a means of swimming on a bit and they are not all entirely dull and obtuse  this state being a sorrowful thing to those who are the wisest of menHow should we examine and contemplateWhen we are waiting to wash our hands at once we still cannot do itThe teaching was taught by the Lord both rightly and precisely in all things and ways but to practice and follow it accordingly we see to be difficultThen where will we go to find comfortWe have been living in this world a long time and from what do we derive comfortWe should question ourselves in this way and maybe we will start ourselves thinkingIf it is to be in accordance with our desires wanting comfort wanting ease and relaxation we ought to be people with ease and relaxation since long ago and we should not be shouldering a mass of Dukkha like people everywhere in the worldBut this does not accord with the image formed in our minds which symbolises what the heart wants  unless the Kilesas have been deceiving all people and all beings for a long time and they still have not seen the banefulness of their deception at all  on the contrary they agree wholeheartedly with their soothing suggestions lulling them to sleep in their skillful waysThe world teacher in the wheel of samsara is the Kilesas themselvesOnce they get to teach people they stick to them and more and more people come until the Kilesas cannot handle them allBecause beings in the world very much like their trick methods of teaching and they are never bored or satiated by them even though they lead to Dukkha and punishment due to being deceived since long agoThe world teacher of freedom from the wheel is the Lord Buddha the first Venerable One the first to know and the first to train and teach and there is nobody who is his equalBut the Kilesas do not like this and continually obstruct Dhamma and so those beings who like the Kilesas will generally be bored with Dhamma and the Dhamma is therefore not likely to reach their hearts even if they listen and practice for a long timeIn the event that happens here and there please look at yourselves and you will be able to see this well enough without difficultyWhatever way we go we must analyzeIf we are to be pupils who have a teacher  our Supreme Teacher to teach us then we must try to do good so as to wash away all things which are evil and badFighting them is bound to be hard and difficult to some extent which is only normalWe must constantly think like this  which is better than having the Kilesas of laziness and slothfulness coming to be our teacher and to drag us into ways that are base and low causing us to suffer Dukkha and torture without end or reason when we may be able to get free from DukkhaNow is our opportunity and we ought to have organised and got ready for we are now complete in everythingOur bodies are in good health and we know that we are human beings who have found BuddhismThis is also an opportunity for us to develop virtue so that it goes down into the heart and so that we may reach the goal that we wantThere is just the heart and Dhamma which will be able to give us the fulfillment of our hopesWe must try to get things which are good and right into the balance sheet of the heart  which does not dieApart from that we cannot find anything that is certain because the whole world of mundane conventions is impermanent which includes our own bodies and whatever we rely upon we wait but for it to be destroyed and disappear time after timeWe see this in every place all the time  it happens everywhere and this the Lord called Aniccam Dukkham Anatta which surrounds us both externally and internallyIn this we cannot have any confidence apart from the development of virtue which is the training of oneself just to have an even steady virtue with this DhammaThis is an important principle to bring our fixed aim to steady fulfillmentSuch a heart wants to go onward all the time it does not want to remain in a mass of Dukkha and torture and it wants to live happilyIf we talk about levels and standards in other words the heavens and Brahma worlds then the heart is the one that wants to go there and does not want to go down to the hells at allIn fact Dukkha is something that it does not want to experience in life or feel its touch at allBut then why does the world find it and feel its touch all the timeIt is because of the deluding tricks of the Kilesas which are in command and more clever and sharp than all beingsThey are the teachers that teach beings and drag them all down and submerge them even though they do not want to be submergedWhat is it that is the teacher of the round of Samsara  that is the cleverest in the world nowadaysJust the Kilesas Tanha and Asava apart from these there is none in the three realms of relativity where all beings dwellAnd there is none which can extract and get rid of this nature apart from that Dhamma which is called the Svakkhata Dhamma of the Lord BuddhaWhoever wants to go free beyond Dukkha and tries to scramble up practicing according to the Dhamma of the Lord will have a way and will be able to pass beyond itWhoever is energetic in complaining about Dukkha can complain as he pleases but if we do not want to let the Kilesa laugh and mock us again and again we should constantly try to understand ourselvesBecause when we arrive at the time that we are cornered with no way out and we are truly up against it  and a time such as that gets right into oneself  what will we doWe must raise the proposition and question ourselves well beforehandWhen it is cold those things that make us warm we see at that time as being important and when it is hot what are those things which make us coolWhatever they are we will consider them to be important at that timeWhen Dukkha comes to us what are those things which bring us SukhaThe other half of the pair which is linked to it is virtue and this is the means by which Dukkha can be diminished and got rid of  and it can get rid of Dukkha in a positive certain manner without any shadow of doubt because never have any of the Kilesas been able to overpower the Dhamma since time immemorialSummarising Wherever there is virtue there is Sukha and a warm hearted natureThe following is a close simile to illustrate the meaning  It is like a man who falls into some water and there is nothing to grasp or hold on to at that timeEven if he has always been afraid of ghosts and death since he was born yet if a dead body were to float up to him while he was drowning and searching for some refuge for something to hold on to with great anxiety he would immediately grasp hold of that corpse as it floated by so as to save his lifeAt the same time he would forget his fear of ghosts which he had always had because his life is much more important than his fearThis is a simile to illustrate the life and Citta of someone at the time when being trapped and cornered with no way out truly gets into themThe last moment at the end of life is sure to be like this and the Citta is bound to think of various things such as thinking of virtue or thinking of evil that one recallsWhen one has no virtue adhering to oneself sufficient to give one some warmth of heart one thinks of evil that one remembers as the only alternativeThen anxiety and sorrow arise and pile up within the Citta causing the anxiety and trouble gathering round to increase further and further so that it becomes overwhelmingIf one has done virtuous things as soon as one thinks about this virtue the Citta immediately grasps at it and goes quite calmThis is much more so with those who have practiced virtue constantly  they need not be in doubt for that virtue is a companion a friend and one that one can trust ones life to more truly than anything in the worldWe Buddhists should always understand about ourselvesWhich means that the heart is the one thing that matters and it is to be explained from two points of view these being Firstly What is the teacher of the round of Samsara and secondly What is the teacher of freedom from the round of Samsara and both of these have just been explainedPlease do not forget thisI shall now finish so that it may be translated to youAsking this question makes me think that the questioners basis of Dhamma is uncertainThose who practice must have gone through this for if they have practiced Samadhi and if the Citta has gone deep down they must knowIf they go to sleep and when they wake up nobody knows and if there is just the sound of sleepiness and lying down all the time how shall we know about the CittaIn doing Samadhi as soon as the Citta is about to go down if we do not let it go down and force it to work we will never be able to build up a firmness of the Citta which accords with the teaching of Samadhi for the attainment of calmThe word Samadhi does not mean sleeping and knowing nothingOne must know within oneself in particular and not know anything else apart from oneselfHave you ever practiced SamadhiFor the Citta which has gained calm with any given object of attention whatever method was used to do this may also be used to learn about Atta or Anatta accordingly but to begin with one should hold on to Atta Later on one gradually withdraws the attachment to Atta until one can completely get rid of it because the Citta is naturally complete and its own selfBut it is not Self having the nature of Atta as mentioned above which is a mundane convention for it is free and therefore is differentTherefore there is a general delusion throughout the world in regard to what people have got in themselves and they are the same everywhereIf we ourselves practice the Citta will know itselfIf the Citta is skilled mindfulness and wisdom are bound to become more and more subtle and then you will be able to know for yourself without having to ask anyone elseThere is nothing that can go beyond the power of mindfulness and wisdom  and because all the Kilesas are afraid of the Dhamma which is mindfulness and wisdom there are no Kilesas of any sort which can go higher than the Dhamma which is mindfulness and wisdom if one trains oneself to become proficient in themThose who practice generally know that Citta differ for there is nothing more subtle than the Citta and one cannot measure itIf the Citta has mindfulness and wisdom then one can follow itThis must depend on the mindfulness and wisdom which people have developed and whether it is much or little accordinglyIt is said that at the time when the Lord Buddha was about to enter Parinibbana he entered Jhana Samapatti and went up from the first Jhana until he reached SaññavedayitanirodhaThe Venerable Anuruddha Thera who was very skilled in the ways of the Citta set his Citta to follow the Lord Buddha in whichever Jhana the Citta of the Lord Buddha enteredIn other words he went up through the four Rupa Jhanas and then through the four Arupa Jhanas until he reached SaññavedayitanirodhaHe rested there for a moment and then he withdrew back through the Arupa Jhanas and the Rupa Jhanas until he reached the state of Citta of ordinary purityThen he entered the first Jhana and went through to the fourth Jhana and then the Lord entered Parinibbana between the Rupa Jhanas and the Arupa JhanasFrom then on it was beyond the ability of anybody to follow and know because he had gone beyond and was free from every kind of mundane conventionWhile the Lord was entering the various Jhanas the Venerable Anuruddha Thera sent the flow of his Citta to follow the Lord without letting up and he knew following the state of the Citta of the Lord Buddha from step to stepWhen the other Savakas asked him Has the Lord entered Parinibbana yet he answered Not yet and he told them each time the Lord entered and left each Jhana and he was able to tell them what happened step by step until the moment when the Lord entered ParinibbanaWhy was he able to know from moment to moment the progress of the Lord Buddhas Citta while he was entering and leaving each Jhana for this is very different from us who also have minds that receive and know various things up to a certain levelThe knowledge and ability of the Citta that has been fully trained is as different from the ordinary Citta as the sky is from the earthFor the Citta which is filled with a heavy burden as if there were a cesspit loading and weighing it down all the time can in no way be compared with the Citta which has become fully purifiedClever people are therefore likely to believe in those who have knowledge and ability above their own capacity and to accept them as teachersLike the followers of the Buddha who believed in the Lord as being the world teacher and as their refugeThis differs from stupid people who deludedly think that they are clever until their cleverness leads them to breakdowns destruction and ruin and even then it is unlikely that they will feel themselves to be in fact what they areThere is a lot of this kind of cleverness in the world of human beings  and it seems to be increasing at a rate beyond ones imagination  until one fears that there will be no world for us to live onMeditation is the process of learning about or looking into the body and examining the mind and reading the story of the heart for the Citta writes about various things the whole time but having written we never read itEven if we never know that we have thought things that are good or evil on a particular day or time it is the character of the Citta to like thinking and imagining in various ways and this will show itself when we practice meditation because the Citta struggles and moves about a lot and cannot remain still and contentedThe Citta of ordinary people are generally speaking like this everywhere and it is more difficult to break and stop than anything elseTherefore because the Citta is normally a subtle thing it must rely on mindfulness and wisdom to supervise and look after itThe more we examine what is wrong and right evil and good in ourselves the more we are likely to find that there is no limit and that the things that are faulty are manyTherefore the principles of Buddhism teach us to contemplate and look at what is good and what is faulty in us and sometimes it shows things that are unpleasant and sometimes pleasantThe teachings of Buddhism are the best tools for doing this and so generally they teach more about the heart than anything elseFor the only tools that are able to match up to the ways of the heart are the principles of Dhamma and it depends on us whether we will be able to equip ourselves suitably with these tools or notMaking things of all kinds requires the use of tools and if the craftsman is well skilled these things will be beautiful and usefulThis is equally so with ones body speech and mind for the body is like a growing tree which may be either softwood or hardwood but the thing that matters is that the craftsman takes it and changes it into something useful such as a table or chair depending on what is wantedWhen it is finished it will have become beautiful ornamental or useful according to the type of wood and the ability of the craftsmanSimilarly when the body speech and mind have been altered and corrected in accordance with the principles of Dhamma by putting forward the utmost effort with full commitment they will become ones treasure having more value than all other thingsThis is because people are not the same as animals and their value whether high or low depends on virtue as their wealth and not on their flesh and hideThe world considers that the value of animals is in their flesh and hide and other parts of the body and therefore when they die nobody is distressedBut this is not the case with people for they must also have good and seemly behavior to give assurance of their valueGood behavior of body speech and mind is the value that raises up human beings and this value and beauty does not alter with time which differs from the physical body that goes the way of nature and changes all the timeIf one has value and virtue as an ornament to decorate oneself this remains and does not deteriorate even when the body gradually deterioratesIt is particularly important when training in meditation that one should try to restrain ones Citta and stop imagining all sorts of things so that one may get some calm and peace and then one will begin to see an increase in the value of ones heartWhen doing meditation try to let the Citta keep its imagining within the work that one wants to promote such as Buddho Buddho which is work that will cause the Citta to become calmWhen one tries to do this with interest and with mindfulness to control the Citta it will be able to attain a state of calm without being troubled by emotionally disturbing objectsThe heart which is void of disturbing things will be happy calm and peaceful and this will be experienced within the heart at that timeCalm and happiness of heart without any emotionally disturbing things is a happiness that is a most longed for refuge and the Citta which is established with only a single knowing was called Ekaggatacitta by the LordEkaggatacitta is to know one It is a happiness of heart that has nothing equal to itFor even though the Lord Buddha who established the profound Dhamma entered Parinibbana years ago the whole excellence of it is still this refuge in which all Buddhists have faith and pay homage to without ceasingWhen the end of the Buddha era of this Lord Buddha is reached there will still be another Buddha who will come anew attain Enlightenment and teach the world and this will happen again and again endlesslyWhen the heart becomes calm and breaks free from emotionally disturbing things one will immediately know the wonder of the heart even though one has never known it before because this is a most strange and wonderful thing in the life of someone who has never known calm of heartWhen the Citta is calm it is not liable to have any thoughts and imaginations giving rise to emotionally disturbing things to trouble oneself and cause confusion and distraction but it remains in a state of Eka Citta Eka Dhamma and it just stays in this state until it rises up and withdraws from itAfter this it thinks and imagines various emotionally disturbing things according to its normal habits of thinking and imaginingIf the Citta can go down into a state of calm even just once it will arouse the enthusiasm in someone who practices in an amazing way and he will hardly be able to forget it for even a dayIn fact it will make him try to practice meditation more and moreTherefore someone who has already seen results from practice is likely to put forward strong effort without slackingLet us respectfully put aside the knowledge that we have learned from the Buddhist texts for the time being for I would like to explain enough from this viewpoint of practice to point out the wayBecause by learning about Dhamma one must come to know Dhamma and by practicing Dhamma one must come to know the results for the Dhamma has never been a secret thing since the Lord Buddhas Enlightenment up to the present time and the Dhamma which was taught so that we know it now still remains true and is not in the least deficientThe practice which accords with Buddhism is still there to give results which are neither more nor less than was taught in the past  except that the person who practices may not be capable in the way that those who practiced in ancient times were in which case the results will not be the same for the causes are insufficient and the results will be weakCauses without effects do not exist so what or who should one blameTherefore one should correct ones reasoning for right now who is it that is obstructing Dhamma and not walking the way that the Lord taught apart from oneselfAt the time of the Buddha Dhamma was true Dhamma and they learned Dhamma so as to experience Dhamma and truly practice it and they did not hold back and turn Dhamma into the worldI would like to tell you that I myself am not entirely good in all waysIn coming here to visit you in London there is both good and bad that I have brought with me and if it turns out to be a mistake I hope that I will have the forgiveness of all of you who are listeningI will now give you an example of turning Dhamma into the world To begin with I studied the texts and managed to pass the exams and attain the grade of Dhamma Tri and I was very pleased at this  and it aroused a group of KilesasLater on I attained to Dhamma To and Eka and then I became big and puffed up and the Kilesas increased and a big mass of them arose so that I could not get away from themWithin me I was full of nothing but Kilesas and I thought I was cleverLater on I became Maha Parien and I thought I was even more cleverBut in truth I was only clever at remembering the names of the Kilesas Tanha and Asavas and many othersI knew only the names but this never struck me for if it had I could have got some of the Kilesas however few free from my heartThere was just the thought that I was clever to attain this grade and that gradeIf one does not look one does not know when Dhamma turns into the worldAs soon as I turned and became interested in practice and the Citta aimed at the meanings of Dhamma the swollen pride gradually diminished and being a Dhamma scholar of this grade and Parien of that grade began to lose their meaning until I felt ashamed of them and I did not want to breathe the title Maha at allThen this again became another type of Kilesa for I understood that this was right thoughtPrevious to this I liked to have my name and the title Maha well to the fore but now I wanted Maha to be in the backgroundThe Kilesas then are Dhamma that is false  that has changed into the world When I had practiced more Dhamma these Kilesas gradually broke up and disappeared from the heartIn telling you this I dont intend to insinuate anything against anyone for I am just telling you about myself and how I used to be and this is what I call Dhamma turning into the world If one does not understand Dhamma one will never be able to cure the Kilesas which can hide themselves in subtle and strange waysThe word Samadhi which so far I had only known by name then became apparent to the heartWhen I studied the texts as related above I memorized by repetition until I became skilled at it both by mouth and in the heart but I came to know the truth of some of these things when I practiced as hard as I couldBut here I do not mean that I knew these things until the Kilesas arose as big as a mountain  while self was the size of a mouse or an elephant the essential meaning is the sameI am just telling you the story of the Kilesas which are found in the Citta and the owner must be one who knows them for himself and gets rid of them by himselfSamadhi is firm stability of the heart and it became steadily more firm and stableThen I knew both the name and the nature of Samadhi and I knew it with my own heartWhen I examined the elements and Khandhas I saw that the body is made up of the four Dhatus both internally and externally and all of them are within the scope of the TiLakkhana  Aniccam Dukkham and AnattaConcerning Pañña I had already got the name of it and I had seen the heart do work using wisdom as hard as it was able to continuously without letting up  which is the way of those who practiceMindfulness and wisdom are Dhammas which one knows for oneselfThen there are no doubts left about what is called MaggaPhala for Magga is the mindfulness and wisdom which steadily makes the Kilesas break away and leave the heart and makes one see in the heart that Dukkha Samudaya Nirodha and Magga have been truths right from the beginningWhen mindfulness and wisdom can read the truth rightly until it has been accepted by the heart doubt comes to an end and one who has no doubt can live peacefully without being disturbed by anything ever againThis is the end of the storyDhamma then is Dhamma the world is the world each of them is true and each of them exists independently by itself and the disturbance between the Citta and all things no longer takes placeThe phrase Tesam Vupasamo Sukho does not mean that having died because the Sankharas have ceased is the only SukhaBut that the quelling of those Sankharas that are the basis of Samudaya that can cause the Kilesas to arise is then also Sukha even though one is not yet deadToday we have explained Dhamma as Dhamma and Dhamma which becomes changed into the way of the world If one can practice as they did in the time of the Buddha then one will get results as they did in the time of the BuddhaBut it is a sorry thing that Dhamma is the truth yet we generally like to play with it and the thing that shows up until it becomes bothersome is the argument which is generally put in the words Magga Phala and Nibbana can no longer be attained in this age anymore and that Whoever practices well and however much has no hope of penetrating It is as if there were somebody who monopolised Magga Phala and Nibbana just for himself as though he were omniscient even though he is so full of Kilesas that nobody is bold enough to competeThen Buddhism is liable to be just a nameAs for the truth of Dhamma in the circle of those who understand that they have faith in Buddhism they have been robbed by the Kilesas and plundered taken and eaten so that there is almost nothing left in the heart body and speech at allIf they continue to oppose Dhamma by understanding as they do now in the future I am afraid it will be a religion of text books and there will just be the names leftWho does not love their wife and childrenAnd it is normal to cherish wealth possessions and servants but the Lord gave up all this because he saw that his way was betterThe Lord Buddha and the Savakas in no small numbers fought and made up their minds to turn towards the way of this Dhamma and to practice and fight with the world within the realm of the heart until they won and gained freedomAs for us we have been defeated by the Kilesas in every becoming and birthDo we never think that we would like to defeat themOr are we so afraid to get free from Dukkha that we do not like opposing themTo compare the two what is worse and more cruel than the Kilesas and what is better at leading people to what is most excellent than DhammaWhich will one take as bestGood and bad we know them already from the above comparisonAs for the Kilesas they dwell in our hearts and they are already thereIf they were excellent we should have been excellent long ago so there is no need to choose  it is a waste of timeBut if one examines Dukkha and it truly becomes so strong that one cannot stand it when it is incredibly strong then one must give way a littleBut the important point here is that the Citta is not willing to give way entirely and withdrawOne needs to understand this for if the Citta sticks at it it can quell the DukkhaBecause the Citta examines and divides up the Dukkha to find out whether it is Dukkha of the body or of the CittaIf the Citta is skilled in wisdom one will probably be fully cognizant and able to extract feelingThen something wonderful such as one has never before experienced will happen at this time  and one will never forget itWe must still wait until we are ready and able to dispose of everything and not imitate the ways of others when we are not yet readyBut we should also not think only about whether other people are going to be sorry for we ought to consider the disadvantages that are inherently there for ourselvesThen we will not be careless due to other people being the sole causeThe truth is that the Lord Buddha and the arahants had already got rid of attachments in the Khandhas but they still relied on the Khandhas everyday until NibbanaThere is no indication that they broke away from the Khandhas and went to stay anywhere elseI am a person living in the world the world is angry so I can be angry the world laughs so I can laughWe are not brick Bhikkhus or cement BhikkhusHere in London the weather is cold and it is getting colderWhen I have gone I will think of my brothers and sisters in London but I am not sure whether I shall be able to come again nor whenBut some of my brothers and sisters in London may be able to go and visit me in ThailandMy brothers and sisters in Thailand are anxious for Tan Acharn and I am anxious for themThis is because being associated with each other in Buddhism one is bound to be concerned for each other always in regard to Sukha and Dukkha which is found in people throughout the world which is something that I can help to reduce or remove with whatever strength I haveComment This morning at the time for giving Pindapata food to the Bhikkhus at Dhammapadipa Vihara Colonel Mom Rajawong Pongtit Diskul Assistant Military Attache to the Thai Embassy in London and MrBrian Dyas and MrsSue Tucker of the Hampshire Buddhist Society gave Pindapata food to the BhikkhusLater they asked VenAcariya Maha Boowa if he would answer questions as followsThere is a story of a Kammatthana Bhikkhu who was newly ordained and was afraid of ghostsHis teacher took him to stay in a cremation ground and told him to sit here and the teacher said he would go and sit over there some distance awayHis teacher also told him to sit and close his eyes and meditate until he came to call him and then he should gently come out of meditationThe teacher then went to sit a little way off stayed for a short while and then got up and returned to the WatAs for the newly ordained Bhikkhu he sat with his back to where the Teacher sat and did his meditation practice without any thought of fear because he thought that the Teacher was sitting watching out for the ghostsAfter a long time a little apprehensive thought about ghosts aroseThen he slowly got up and walked to find the place where the Teacher said he would be sittingWhen he got there and did not see the Teacher fear arose and he ran to the WatThe Teacher then said to him I have not yet called you so why have you come here Then he spoke sternly to him This shows that when you thought the teacher was there with you you were not afraid but as soon as you did not see the Teacher where you thought he was fear of ghosts arose stronger and stronger until you had to run to the Wat without waiting for me to come and get you This indeed is the nature of the Citta that deceives oneself without there being any need for a ghost to come and deceive one at allTherefore in saying that Indian Devas get into her and make her afraid it is most likely to be her own Citta that creates its own deceptionPeople who practice Dhamma also do this for they speak about Dhamma and in particular about the field of practice and when they speak about meditation they are likely to become more and more engrossed until they forget timeThe hours pass and they never notice it when they talk together about Dhamma and practice and however many are present it is a fascinating storyThe Teacher trains and teaches them about the attainment of Samadhi the Samapattis mindfulness and wisdomThey talk about getting rid of  getting rid of the Kilesas of various kinds by means of the power of mindfulness wisdom faith and effort step by step and this makes them even more engrossed in following what he saysEven if the owner has not yet been able to experience Dhamma in any of the ways that his Teacher has it still makes him cheerful and joyful in the Dhamma which the Teacher has practiced known and seen and come to tell them in a manner that is fascinating so that they never feel that they have had too much of itThe Lord said that The flavor of Dhamma is superior to all other flavors of all flavors none tastes better than DhammaIf the taste of Dhamma were not so supremely excellent the Three Worlds would be unlikely to have paid homage to and worshipped the Dhamma and then the Dhamma would not have been considered as supreme it would not be suitable as a refuge as something to hold on to as something certain nor as something in which all good and honest people can have implicit faithThe extent to which all Buddhists pay homage to and have faith in the Dhamma is because the Dhamma is a thing of excellence as befits the renown and prestige of Dhamma that spreads out from each of the Buddhas and the Savaka Sangha of each of the World Teachers respectively until it came down to usThat it came down to us was entirely due to those who after having partaken of the taste of Dhamma with their hearts then brought out this Dhamma which they had known seen and experienced and taught it to the world right up to the present timeThey did not guess or suppose that the taste of Dhamma was superior to all other tastes for they knew the taste of Dhamma as well as seeing absolutely clearly into all aspects of DhammaThen they brought out that knowledge that revelation and proclaimed and taught the World in accordance with the fundamental truths which they had known and seen by taking their own knowing and seeing as evidence in proclaiming Dhamma and teaching the WorldWhen we say Dhammam Saranam Gacchami how much depth or profundity has itIt is not a superficial Dhamma which one can know and see on the surface and teach the world in a superficial wayFor the Lord knew the truth and taught the truth of Dhamma to the world at all levelsTherefore those who listen should listen with interest and practice with sincerityThe result which they get from Dhamma will be Dhamma that reaches the heart stage by stage going right up until the various kinds of Kilesas are removedIn fact they can all be removed entirely to the satisfaction of ones heart so that one knows this clearly in ones own heart as it says in the Dhamma teaching Sanditthiko  knowing for oneself and seeing for oneselfEven if the Lord Buddha was sitting in front of one one would not then waste time asking any questions because the truth is the same truth and the same experienceBut in the practice of Dhamma amongst all those who are the highest sages they are very careful because Dhamma is not like the world If Dhamma were like the world it would not be called Dhamma because it would be the same thing as saying the world and just this one word would be enough and it would be all mixed in with the way of the worldBut there is this word because Dhamma and the world are not the same and even though they are both in the world together they are not one and the same thingIt is only that they are here interfused with each other but not the same thing for they just dwell together like all of us here are just dwelling together at present  Bhikkhus and laypeople dwelling together but not one and the same men and women dwelling together but not one and the same children and adults dwelling together but not one and the sameThus although they are living together they are separate individuals each one merely living thereIt is like this with Dhamma and the worldThe highest Sages practiced until they knew by experience clearly in their own hearts and they then led the religion steadily and consistently without acting in gross or unseemly ways in the eyes and ears of those who had faith in BuddhismThis refers to the Lord Buddha and the Savaka arahants who brought Buddhism to us for us to see and admire in the most beautiful and seemly wayThey did not bring it in a manner that would surprise and disturb the listenerHere I will tell you an illustrative story for you who are practicing DhammaFor it may be with some of you that this Dhamma overflows and when there is occasion you let it out or show it off without any shame or feeling of being open to criticismThis happens because of a desire to become famous or distinguished  which is nothing but the work of the Kilesas pushing it outTherefore I will tell you this story of the wise men who followed the way of the Buddha  a moral lessonThe Venerable Assaji had penetrated and become an arahant with all the five Pañcavaggi who were the first five Savakas of the Lord BuddhaThe VenAññakondañña was the first and VenUpatissa who became the VenSariputta the highest of the Savakas placed symbolically on the right hand side of the Lord Buddha had at this time not yet become one of the Savakas and he was ordained in the institution of wandering religious mendicants and practicing according to the customs of such people at that timeWhen he saw VenAssaji who was very beautiful and seemly in all his actions and manners  walking forward withdrawing backwards looking to the right and left with a very composed deportment which instilled great respect and confidence he followed stealthily behind himAs soon as they were out of the village he went up and asked him where he lived and about his Uppajjhaya and AcariyaHe replied only briefly to the question about what Dhamma the Teacher or his Acariya taught saying I have no very great knowledge so I will just speak of it in brief for you to hearYe Dhamma Hetupabhava etc  All Dhammas arise from a cause when they die away the cause must die away first The Lord Buddha taught like thisThat is allThen Sariputta the Paribbajaka penetrated through and immediately became SotapannaAs for Assaji who was the teacher he did not then say of himself that he was one of the arahants in fact he did not say anything at allBut VenSariputta may have been able to know his attainment in Dhamma when he heard the Dhamma in brief which VenAssaji taught him because in the stage of Sotapatti Magga and Sotapatti Phala it is possible to penetrate deeply and to know the truth of someone who has a level of attainment higher than oneselfTherefore VenAssaji was able to teach him a wonderful kind of Dhamma which he had never heard before so that he penetrated DhammaBut it seemed from the texts that VenSariputta never heard VenAssaji say that he was an arahant because VenAssaji did not make any outward show of being an arahantThis is the first example to illustrate what was previously saidThe second story concerns MrKamanit who met the Lord Buddha in the house of a potterWhen the Lord asked him where he was going he said he was going to see the BuddhaThe Lord asked Where are you going so as to see the Buddhaand he replied I am going a long way for the Lord is sure to be at Savatthi But the Lord did not say that he was the Lord BuddhaHow profound was the subtlety of the wisest sage in not telling him for the Lord knew all the ways of cause and effect and that to tell him would have led to some form of lossWhen he had weighed up the situation he saw that it was of greater value not to tell so he left without saying anything about his being the Lord Buddha even though MrKamanit was still searching for the LordAs soon as the dawn came he left the Lord Buddha and shortly met VenSariputta and VenMoggallana who were walking along the road towards him going to see the Lord Buddha in the pottery and they questioned MrKamanit who said that he was going to see the BuddhaBoth of the Savakas asked him whether when he came through that place he had met anyone thereHe said that he met a Samana in the pottery and he was one whose behavior and manners made one respect and trust him very muchHe was zealously practicing all last night and he taught Dhamma in a melodious beautiful voice and what he said went to the heart and was very impressiveBut I am still not satisfied and want to go and meet the Lord Buddha so I have come from thereVenSariputta and VenMoggallana did not say anything to let him know that the person he had met was the Lord BuddhaWhy did they say nothingBecause this is the way of the sages for if anyone was to say anything it was for the Lord Buddha to say it firstFor whatever the need was to let MrKamanit stay for some time and then go on and meet Sariputta and Moggallana on the road they only spoke together when his back was turned saying EhThat fellow has no idea that he has already met the Buddha but the Lord did not say anything to him and in short because of that we cannot say anything also This is how the Sages immediately understand each other and their knowledge and understanding does not lead to disagreement unlike people who have all the Kilesas who only want to sell themselves and incite the Kilesas making them increasingly pile up in the Citta instead of making the effort to get rid of themIn the practice of Dhamma in the sphere of Buddhism this sort of thing tends to happen all the timeTherefore I have anxious thoughts though in truth I should be more anxious for myself than for othersBut I cannot help being anxious for all our companions including Upasakas and Upasikas and all others who have Saddha in a gradually widening circleSuppose in a particular case something happens that is improper and disturbing in a way for one who wants to be a learned sage following the path of the Lord Buddha it is likely to cause deterioration and harm to himself and to BuddhismThose who practice Dhamma should therefore always be selfcontrolled and careful to maintain virtue because Dhamma is different from the worldIn the practice of Dhamma even though someone truly aims for Magga Phala and Nibbana until he is able to penetrate to the desired goal of Arahatta Phala such a person would not say that he knew that he had attained EnlightenmentWhyBecause how could the words I have attained Enlightenment be of any use as a means of helping the listenerOne cannot see how but they could be a basis for vainly boosting ones own state in accordance with what the world praises  that is about allThe Lord therefore did not do this but he used the method of giving advice over and over again by teaching the way of causes and the way of results which it was appropriate to teach in a manner that was more or less strong or gentle accordinglyHe therefore taught according to the level of attainment of whoever came to be trained and depending on the time place and people and their status and state he taught and trained them in ways that were suitableHe taught according to the ways of cause and effect but he did not say that he was accomplished in Dhamma up to such and such a level for this would be an unseemly thing to doThe Lord was not addicted to speaking because it is not in harmony or appropriate to the status of a sageIn the time of the Buddha the Bhikkhus had great confidence in each other and they were very careful about thisEven in the present time if there is someone who has truly followed the way of the Lord Buddha one should understand that he will not deviate from this trackThis is however not so with those present day Sages of whom there are a large number and one can count the one who is speaking as one of them also that are always overflowing and waiting to go overboard If this is the case it shows that the excess which is spilling over the edge of the Citta is not DhammaIf there is true knowing and seeing let it just resound within ones own heart  do not let it go out externally where it can create disturbanceA sharp blade should be kept in its sheath where it will be safeTo throw it about the place whatever word or blade or weapon it is is dangerous both to oneself and othersIf one puts it away properly it is not dangerous in fact one can get nothing but value from itWhen someone advertises boastfully saying I have attained Sotapanna Sakadagami Anagami or arahant there is no reason why anyone who hears this should be glad in fact it may change their faith in him making it gradually diminish and they then see the Kilesas of that person quite clearly and they just feel wearied and fed up and that there is nothing else worth respecting in that personTherefore all those who practice if they are people who aim truly for Dhamma must aim for reason rather than announcing Dhamma of this kind outwardly which is not the way of the Lord Buddha  but the way of a rotten fish which announces itself so that flies swarm aroundAnnouncing and selling rotten fish to the flies is the way of rotten fishWhen we hear or smell them they irritate our ears and nose and the irritation seeps into the heartWhy is it so irritating as this for if the Dhamma is a true Dhamma when these things go into the Citta they make one feel irritated and wearied of it allVarious people variously aim for gain and Dhamma of the higher levelsBut when any of them announced things of such a kind that one cannot find any reason in them it means that they are repressed in their hearts  or they have a hunger in their heartsSo when they say these things they are not good to hearBut even though the person himself may not be aware of his state if other people admonish and warn him he should listenIf he is also a person who has been aiming for gain and Dhamma he should become aware of himself and be more restrained and careful of himself in the futureDo not turn yourself into a rotten fish within Buddhism for this Dhamma is sweet smelling and it has led people to respect and pay homage to it throughout the world for a long timeToday I will just explain this far to begin withVenPañña will translate for youIf I speak a lot he will forget much of what I have said alreadyA story of the present time Professor OuayI wonder if you have heard this oneIt has been repeated so much that it has now become something of a legendThere is a Bhikkhu of the present time and not very long ago while VenAcariya Mun was alive who went together with some Bhikkhus to practice and train themselves in the way of Kammatthana Dhamma to a hill but there is no need to say in which province they went to do their meditationWhile doing their meditation at about midnight this Bhikkhu thought that he had penetrated Dhamma and become arahant but what he was investigating in his meditation is not knownHis hand felt in his handbag and he brought out his snuff pipe which he blew as a whistle  PeepThe other two Bhikkhus who were with him on this hill quickly ran to find him for they did not know what danger he was inThey never thought that if he had penetrated Dhamma he would blow a whistle so they thought there was some dangerThe two Bhikkhus said nothing  they probably did not have the heart toThis thing about reaching arahantship may be alright but what was more important than that was OhoHaving attained arahantship you blow a whistle what level is this This was their doubt but they did not say anything because having thought about it in various ways they returned tired of itLater on one night and once again about midnight the two Bhikkhus heard the whistle blow againThey thought Hes probably attained to nobody knows what level now But they could not not go and see him because the three of them were living together in case of real danger coming to them so it was their duty to help each otherSo the two of them came back to look for the Bhikkhu who blew the whistle and they asked himYou blew the whistle again this time so what further level have you attainedHave you reached the level of madness for whether arahant or whatever else its a real nuisance This time he announced The other night I thought wrongly I had attained so I blew the whistle to call you and tell you for I was very gladBut then tonight I examined and found that I had not attained so I had to blow the whistle so as to let you know that in truth I had not attained The two Bhikkhus saw the funny side of it and felt sorry about the madness of this whistling arahant They told other Bhikkhus until it became a wellknown storyThere is another story about this Bhikkhu for one day he was sitting in meditation and saw a disc of light like the sun as big as a coconut falling down in front of himHis Citta had attained Samadhi and saw light and it went out following itThe light moved away so he got up from where he was sitting and followed it without knowing what he was doingThe light went up a tree and he went up following it alsoThe light then floated up into the sky and disappearedThen his awareness returned and he realised that he was up a tree and he wept until other Bhikkhus came running to see and to help him to get downThen they asked him all about it and they heard that Samadhi had led him to float up into this treeMore than two years ago a Samanera told me a story when I was staying in a certain WatThis Samanera came up to see me at the same time as another Bhikkhu and he told about knowing various thingsI listened right through until he had finished and then I said  Samanera you must be careful you will grasp at shadows or go up a tree following a light I did not know what this Samanera had been like in the past but later on someone told me that this Samanera had already led some Bhikkhus to follow a lightThe light led him into the forest and the Samanera ran after it and called the Bhikkhus to come and help to catch this light and he got those Bhikkhus who did not know about this to follow him and search for this lightThere was a lot of noise and commotion until a Bhikkhu who was there and knew about him came to see and stopped it and dispersed themTruly speaking this type of Citta is not found in many people in fact only about five percent are like thisIf they are under the right teacher people of this sort are good and they have adventurous naturesI have also been of this kind but I did not send the Citta out externally for I knew what it was up to  light shooting up as though flying up into the sky so strong it seemed that if one should die at that time there would have been nothing left to cremateI knew about it then and withdrew the Citta to its original baseAs soon as the Citta saw this it immediately died awayThe owner must go through many mad things like this then he will know about various things concerning those who practice enough for his needs and he can correct people without going off the path or flying up into the sky  even without wingsAt one time I was sitting doing meditation in a shelter in a village in a place where there was a very fierce Pob which could even possess a BhikkhuI was doing meditation in the forest atoclock in the morning and saw a person coming whom the villagers had said was the Pob His eyes were shifty and restless and he came in to where I was resting and then walked off to another villageWhile doing meditation I did not know where I was and as soon as the ghost came and met me while I was sitting in Samadhi meditation I ducked and then my body fell down with a thumpWhen I became aware of myself I was very amused for I knew that the Citta had done this to me but I did not tell anyone about itWhatever one sees and feels one must examine with wisdom to find out for sure what it is and one must find the way to cure itIf anything comes ones way and one assumes that it is absolutely real and true one will deludedly go wrongOne must know for oneself and examine oneself constantlyIf one does not know one cannot teach othersThe characteristics of some Cittas are very strange and if they do not have a teacher they will be lostBut if they do have a teacher to give them careful advice such people can quickly make valuable gains which they can use to advantageBut they must train in mindfulness and wisdom so as to know what the Citta is up to then it will not be able to get lost and will be of widespread value  more than one would imagineThe Citta and the objects of the Citta are quite bizarre and it is difficult to describe what truly happensBut in the case of those who have similar characteristics who also practice Dhamma and who have had similar experiences they can speak together and understand each otherThis is like people who learn a technical subject and can speak together about it whereas others cannot understandThis story is an allegory for people who practice DhammaIn other words if one reads a lot then one will begin to go from Atta to Anatta to not grasping or believing anything until one has no principles to take hold ofOne must hold on and use Atta while one is practicing Dhamma in successively higher levels in the same way as one takes hold of a ladder and goes up step by stepHaving passed any one step one does not hold on to that rung and try to carry it with oneThus one goes up until one reaches the room at the top where one wants to goThen one leaves the ladder behind without trying to hold on to itSo one goes into the room and rests and relaxes happilyThis is the way with Anicca Dukkha and Anatta for finally one discards them but one cannot discard them before this because one must depend on them to go up step by step discarding each previous step until one is able to discard the lot holding nothingJust now we were speaking about those who do harm to Buddhism either intentionally or unintentionallyThings which are wrong always were wrong but they are things which have already happened in the past arising from things which are true or deceptive genuine or artificial and internal or externalTruly speaking they arise only in the heart for there is a great deal of deceptiveness in each of our hearts including the one who is telling you this at present who has been like this and known about himself because of his training in mindful awareness  or because of having studied constantly the state of his CittaThus he was able to know which things are deceptive and which are trueGenerally speaking there are only deceptive things constructed so that we deludedly go after them without being in the least aware that they are superdeceptionsFor in fact we think that they are entirely true so we believe in them and go after them without putting up any counterreaction at all as a means of resisting or proving this kind of thinkingFor example a person sits in meditation and in the first three seconds he feels that it is trueHe fixes his attention on Buddho Buddho and he feels that it is the true Buddho for four or five seconds until he reaches one minute and then all the false things start to flow from the Citta more and more giving birth to children grandchildren and great grandchildren branching and spreading out and all of it is deceptionMeanwhile the word Buddho has disappeared where to one does not know and all that is left is the story of emotionally charged objects and situations with which he has been used to thinking and imagining and deceiving himselfThis is the means by which he is dragged away without being aware of it and after that assenting to go along fascinated at once going off engrossed with these false thingsBuddho then disappears and Anapanasati is silent  even though he is still breathing  but it is silent as regards paying attention silent as regards the way of fixing his attention with determination and with mindfulness  all this has disappeared into silenceAs soon as he is able to recollect himself he says I have done meditation for long enough but I did not see any result arise whatsoever why was that It is right that thoughts of this sort should arise but then he goes wrong againIn other words thoughts such as this are as if to say that he sees the fault in himself but he does not think I did not practice meditation for this sort of result but for some other kind of result of what sort I dont know For this would call his attention to the fact that he should have mindfulnessBut he returns to his previous state of delusion  again saying I have sat for a long time and I think I will rest for a short while and after I get up I will really have a go at it But he does not sleep for a short while nor just a little for as soon as he goes to sleep he sleeps deeply until the sun has risen and when he wakes Oh goodness The next day he does it again and so it goes on deceitfully continuallyThe next day it starts off with three seconds at the beginning and four seconds the day after and so on getting worse steadilyThis is the way of those who are superdeceptiveApart from this he also harms himself saying Here I have been practicing meditation for a long time and I do not see that I have gained anything in thoughts or virtue and why should I go on doing this meditationIt is most likely that I am a person with unfortunate tendencies of character with little merit and little virtue which are not appropriate to the way and the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha for if I go on doing this it will not lead to anything of value and it will be nothing but a waste of timeIt is better to stop entirely and this without ever thinking whether stopping like this is truly better or whether stopping meditation is truly a good thingFor if it was truly good people all over this world who never do any meditation ought to be good people since long agoAgain one can return and think How can stopping be better than doing meditationFor having done this meditation and not yet seen any results if I stop in what way will it truly be betterFrom what did the lack of results come Just from myself It cheats me continually for what is false externally and false within the Citta finds it good to stay thereWhatever things are false those which are false within oneself are the important onesFor deceiving oneself is a very important thing which one should examine and investigateAll of you have been cheated and deceived enough alreadyThe owners heart deceiving the ownerWhat has been said above briefly is enough to be able to know how much one has been deceived by what is debasedOne should know that the first three or four seconds of practice are good but that the next three or four are not and then one should establish mindfulness and enter the practice again and go on establishing and reentering the practice again and again continuallyThen the time will come when it knows at once when the Citta displays anything which is going in the wrong directionOne will begin to know what is going against ones intended purpose and when one begins to know one will begin to establish mindfulness and to set the Citta to do the practice anewKnowing one enters into the practice again and again and then later on one knows continuouslyOne comes to know what is unreliable and one knows that the lack of those results of the Citta that one wants is because of thisAs soon as one determines to practice truly and properly the false side of oneself is likely to do the same thingIn other words the Kilesas wait to try and get in during those times when one is off guard and unmindfulIf one has set ones determination ones posture and ones direction firmly they give wayBut give way here should not be understood to mean that they give way and lie down like we doThey give way waiting and watching and as soon as and whenever they can get at you they immediately do so pouncing on you quicker than a cat after a rat and then they disappear silentThey wait to hit and beat and smash in whenever one is offguardIf one is not offguard they do nothing but when one is overconfident that one is not offguard that is when they are sure to be encouraged and one is cheated continually  probably in every instanceThis Acharn who is telling you this at present has also been like thisTherefore it is important to search for a method and a suitable place for reforming the owner and helping him to practice diligently in many directions and ways as I have written in the Biography of Tan Acharn Mun or in The Practice of Kammatthana in the manner of the VenAcariya Mun or in the book called Forest DhammaBut Bhikkhus are not the same as lay people for wherever they go it is convenient and comfortableThe place where they practice is convenient and comfortable because they have only one dutyLike when they go into the forest and hills and frightening places because there are such places and there truly are various types of fierce animals such as tigers and bears and snakesWhen one goes to stay in such places ones feelings changeFor example being lazy in regard to maintaining effort gradually diminishesOne has little laziness and as soon as one goes into a critical situation all laziness vanishesI do not know where it goes but one is left with no way out and nowhere to escape toThen mindfulness comes of itself at once and when one determines to practice with effort why does one break into a sweatOne sweats because of the fear of death and at such a time mindfulness is goodSometimes it even happens that a tiger roars repeatedly right by the path one uses for walking Cankama This has in fact happened to me and it does not come just to have a talkIt has happened to me many times how many I dont know but that tiger roaring there was no small cat  it was a big striped tigerAt that moment it seems as if all ones hair stands on end  and why is it that one shivers even though it is not coldBut the Citta is not allowed to withdraw and it goes round and round descending to hereWhether one lives or dies at this time one submits oneself to the Lord BuddhaNow there is just the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha to guard and preserve ones heart and if ones time has truly come ones Citta is not careless and unguarded and one has submitted ones Citta to the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha in all ways and whenever one goes one is prepared to goWhile I live may I have mindfulness and may I not be caught at a disadvantageWhatever comes to take me and eat me so be it but I will not abandon the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha The Citta submits completely and as soon as the Citta has submitted to the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha all longing ceasesThe longing or cherishing of life is no longer thereAffection and possessiveness for the body have all gone and there remains only the Citta which is singleminded in the way and in DhammaFear disappears entirely at that time and there is no trace of it left at allThe Citta has concentrated together and plumbed straight down to the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha in the heart completely and it seems then as if nothing can ever come to disturb one againWhen the Citta has plumbed straight down it becomes full of strength and all fear disappears and after that no matter whether the tiger roars or comes right up in front of one one feels able to go up to it and stroke it unconcernedly with Metta and sympathy and a feeling that one has a close friendship with it because both of us are the same in having birth old age pain and deathIn feeling this one has not even the slightest thought that the tiger is dangerous and that it may harm one if one were to go and stroke itWhen this sort of thing happens there is just a feeling of intimacy and gentleness with Metta for it and therefore all fear disappearsThere are many ways and methods for training and disciplining the CittaBut once one has found a good basis and something which one can use to recollect and reflect upon one may in the future bring up this basis and put it into practiceThen wherever one goes to live in whatever sort of place when one is at ones wits end and cornered that which one has done and gained results from will immediately come to oneIn confronting danger or confronting a situation each and every time if one is a warrior one is bound to gain an important lesson from itUnless that is one hesitates on the verge and cannot make up ones mindThen one can go mad because the Citta is uncertain will not commit itself or accept anything and it vacillatesBut if the Citta truly accepts the situation there is nothing which can overpower the Citta which has become attached to Dhamma so that the two are as one and there will also be a certainty at this time that nothing is able to do any harm to one whether it be an animal a tiger or anything else or any other danger in the worldOne does not fear anything at all of any sort from which one has ever been in danger and which one has ever fearedThus the Citta and Dhamma when they fuse together as one have power over everything else in the worldFor this reason Dhamma is superior to all the three worldsI feel that the power of the Citta is greater than everything in this worldThis is the way to train and harass ones deceit  which is linked with the Great Deceit that has always been there in ones CittaIf one lives in normal surroundings and does not go to any place where one is cornered with no way out it will invade and overpower one and destroy everythingBut when one goes into a situation where one is cornered with no way out one equally puts pressure on it  although generally speaking the deceit is the one that applies the pressure and one does nothing to put pressure on itBut if one does put pressure on it even only once one will talk about it endlessly for years without stopping  not stopping until one dies but then it presses and squeezes one out smooth and one never says anythingIsnt this person showing off his cleverness too muchBut in truth it is like thisIn other words when the Dhamma enters and reaches the heart because of the abovementioned harassment one can then talk as though ones mouth is full of words because of this experience which went to ones heart at that timeIn that one trained oneself to the utmost and willingly submitted ones life to the way and Dhamma with complete commitment in various circumstances the result is truly satisfyingAs to winning  what is itIt displays a wonder which is also satisfyingHow can one ever forget until the day one diesThat is enough explanation for today so now we may have some discussionIf the Citta has still not seen anything from itself in a time of necessity it still has not seen the importance of itself and so it will always take refuge in other peopleIn the Dhamma that the Lord taught the saying Attahi attano Natho  Self is the refuge of self is still not accepted in the heartBut whenever something happens that thing is completed in a satisfactory way one will then believe the Dhamma saying  Attahi attano natho  in a way that truly impresses the heartThe Citta that has known and seen the truth at a time when it was at an impasse with no way out such as when one has a fever and painful feeling overpowers one or when one sits for a long time or when one meets with some incident or other which is a strong or violent thing maybe threatening ones life if one is a true warrior the Citta goes round all over oneself without thinking of any hope from anything externalThat is when the Citta will come to see the importance of oneself each and every timeThis is a most wonderful thing and if one gets past those incidents one will probably have no anxiety in regard to life and deathConcerning painful feeling in whatever way or in whatever circumstances it arises or happens the anxiety as to whether one will be able to fight against it or not where one will be born again after one dies or the fear that one will be at a disadvantage or that one has wasted ones life for when painful feeling overwhelms the Citta until it reaches a point where it has no mindfulness to help ones heart  then how will it be nothing of this sort will then be in the Citta at allIn other words when it reaches a time of necessity like this the Citta and mindfulness immediately go in and find each other so as to get into the front line of battle One can talk of it like this in truth because it has fought before and won before and when one has almost reached the time to die mindfulness and wisdom will quickly find each otherWhen something of this sort happens mindfulness and wisdom join forces and they are not likely to flee or to withdraw but will immediately spin round and go in to fight this that is happeningIn such a case whether one lives or dies one is not willing to be a slave but rather because of ones faith in Dhamma and faith in oneself one will want to know the truth of this that appears to be happening in the CittaFaith in Dhamma right hereWhere else should one have faith in DhammaThe text books say it correctly but if the truth which is the Dhamma in ones heart is not found there is nothing to confirm them and to act as their witness so as to give one confidenceBut as soon as the heart meets up with some incident and it gets to know and see it quite clearly and distinctly then it shows no disagreement in comparison with the Dhamma which they reveal in the text booksNone of the sages when they were in times of real necessity liked to stay where there were many people and much disturbanceThey liked to find a place which suited them and which accorded appropriately with the way they practiced and succeeded in gaining results of the kind that come in isolated or lonely places  isolated both in body and heartPeople like us do not act like thatAs soon as we begin to get ill you know how it is Oh where are all my childrenWhere are all my grandchildrenThis child is not looking after me and my grandchildren are not paying any attention to me where have they all gone to where have all my relations and friends disappeared toWhats thisIts not good for them all to go and lose all interest in meWho dislikes meNobody has any sympathy for me  suffering of life and death and nobody even turns and looks at me The Citta gets increasingly troubled and they cannot search for some basis to grasp hold of so as to reduce and diminish it by themselvesMy husband before when we lived together was good but when I am truly about to die I havent seen his face here at allMy husband is bad my children are bad my grandchildren are bad they are all badBecause it is bad within her heart the filth which is there is brought out and thrown about externally making everything filthyFor the filthy water in her heart is the fear of deathOur inadequacy is what goes about throwing filth at other people and venting discontentThis is what is meant by having nothing as a basic principle in the heart Then we do not think about Attahi Attano Natho for our refuge is entirely based in other peopleHaving been born we took refuge in other people a long time agoWhen a person is born he must to start with take refuge in other people such as mother father nursemaid one person after another until one comes to teachers professors and so onThen afterwards one still wants to go on taking refuge in other people until one reaches the day of ones death without ever having the least thought of taking refuge in oneselfTherefore it is a difficult thing and it remains difficult to the day of ones death and one can neither set up or establish any principle or basis within ones heart at allThe Lord Buddha taught that one should take refuge in oneself  Attahi Attano Natho As for taking refuge in other people one is already doing that as much as is necessary to have got the resulting value from others or enough anyway to give oneself strength so that one will be able to take refuge in oneself in the futureThis is an important principle that Buddhists should constantly keep in mindVarious activities are taught by mother and father by teachers and professors by the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and one should get the method from the knowledge and understanding which one has studied and learned and put it into practice as someone who is endowed with effort and energy so as to be able to help oneselfWhen one has seen the importance of oneself other things seem unimportant and one lets go of them allThat is the way of the Citta of somebody that has been trained for when it is having a truly bad time it will shake off everything whether relatives friends or anyone else and it will not want them to come and be a nuisance at allOne only has this duty to do and no other to let the Citta whirl round and down into it because one has no longing or yearning for anything in this worldEarth water air fire  one has examined these and seen quite clearly that everything in this world is composed of earth water air and fire and even though they are combined together things are still only combinations of earth water air and fireWe all give them names such as the body oneself ones possessions this or that and so on endlessly but things of this nature do not exist  and when they reach the time to die they also do not exist for they are going to do nothing but break upThe mindfulness and wisdom which one has developed by training separates out the elements and Khandhas with complete clarityEverything of all kinds are examined completely in the light of truthThen the Citta is true the elements are true feeling memory thought and consciousness or whatever else are trueEverything of all kinds are true and there is no disturbance and one can pass by contentedly this being Sugato  going wellThere is nothing in ones surroundings which is a disturbance or troublesome one does not create Dukkha and difficulty for oneself or others and one has supreme happiness and contentmentWhen one dies there is no need to chant Kusala Dhamma Akusala Dhamma nor to invite Bhikkhus to the funeral thereby disturbing everyoneThis is what I say and Venerable Boowa of Wat Pa Ban Tard speaks like this with certaintyMake up your minds I have been constantly telling them this giving talks in this way and teaching relatives and lay peopleI have developed myself and trained myself and I have been ordained many Vassa already and I am still developing just Kusala Dhamma trying to develop KusalaWhoever wants Kusala Dhamma should develop it themselvesAfter one has died those who are still living go about collecting Bhikkhus to give merit and Kusala DhammaThey chase after the Bhikkhus who have gone into the forests and wild places and it is all a disturbing nuisance and I dont want it to be like thatIn gaining Kusala  the skill which is put into ones Citta  Kusala meaning skill here  one must search for it and get enoughThe method which will bring happiness and contentment to oneself one should try and do from now onAfter one is dead for them to go and invite Bhikkhus to come and chant Kusala Dhamma which just becomes a nuisance to the Bhikkhus is no goodIt is contrary to the purpose of Buddhism which teaches people to be clever to look for what is good and to make it part of themselves while they are still alive so that when one has reached ones time one is Sugato and one goes on in the way of one who is cured of worryWhen one has reached the end point and the time comes to die  or at least when Grandfather Boowa dies  please do not invite Bhikkhus to come and dont make trouble for themFor if Grandfather Boowa has been doing Kusala Dhamma since the day of starting practice until now and if he is still stupid he is beyond help so let him alone die and it will only be Grandfather Boowa who sinksBut do not let other people come and be stupid alsoIn this I am speaking bluntly for this is the way I talk to my followers and it is the truth alsoI am never concerned about anything and when the time comes to get rid of this lot then I will get rid of it with pleasure and die easily and entirely free from anxietyThe whole world embraces the elements and Khandhas and when the time comes to die and to abandon them Oh sadness sorrow and grief everywhere they do not want to accept deathWhen the body is dead they want it to live and when the time for death has come they do not want to goIt is all troublesome so do not let it be like thisThe Lord Buddha thus let us know the truth When the time has come to go then goBut when the time has not come to go then live If there is any orange juice and sweet drinks bring them over if it is still not the time I will drink them allBut when one is about to die dont come and be a nuisance for then one will drop it  it is much too heavy  Bhara have Pañcakkhandha  and having dropped it going along in the true natural way and having passed on contentedly one comes to the ultimate fulfillment of one who practices The Lord Buddha was like that and so were the Savakas and we have followed the footprints of the Lord Buddha  how else could it beWithout doubt it must be this wayThereThats enough I have given two talks alreadyFrom tomorrow I shall no longer be here for I will return to Thailand I will think of all my brothers and sisters hereThat I came this time and determined to come and meet and help people here is because of thinking only of the heart and this is why Tan Acharn came to EnglandI did not come for any worldly purposes at all for whether staying in my Wat or any other Wat or going to any place in Thailand I never think of going for worldly purposes and I never have it in mind to go for goods or money or wealth but I go for the Cittas of people so that they may gain something of valueIn coming to England I also have a feeling of fulness in my heart in the same wayIntentions are more important than anything elseIf ones intentions are good everything else of all kinds are also good but if ones intentions are not good everything is spoilt and goes wrong accordinglyTherefore in coming to visit my brothers and sisters in London I came with heart and when I go I shall think of your heart If our fortunes should cross in due course we may come here again or some of you here may go over thereIn other words you may go to visit us out there or we may come from there to visit you hereThis world is round and the hearts of beings in this world are whirling about in the round of Samsara with all the defilement which lead them round to birth and round to death endlesslyTherefore please all of you try to make your Citta become free from the round of SamsaraThen it will be absolutely contented and there will be no need to go round and roundThis is enough explanation of Dhamma for today so I will stopThose of you who have anything in your hearts that you want to ask may do so nowTomorrow there will be no time in the morning for we will eat early and then must goThe training and practice of Dhamma so as to know Dukkha as it truly consists in using meditation and wisdom to examine how to train the Citta to draw out the Kilesas until one finds the taste of happiness in the CittaThis is bound to help one find true and genuine happiness and to get a basic principle to hold firmly in the heart no matter what the circumstances areThis is a partial index of numerically arranged topics that appear in the suttas available here at Access to InsightThe growing interest in womens spirituality has led to a renewed focus upon the Therigatha the Verses of the Elder Nuns as the oldest existing testament to the feminine experience of BuddhismDespite this recent attention to the Therigatha however it seems that all but a few scholarly commentators have overlooked a short chapter in the Samyutta Nikaya that serves as an important supplement to the larger workThis is the Bhikkhunisamyutta Chapter of the Sagathavaggasamyutta the Connected Discourses with Verses Volume I of the Samyutta NikayaThe Bhikkhunisamyutta is a compilation of ten short suttas in mixed prose and verse with a total of thirtyseven versesThough several of these verses have parallels in the Therigatha a significant number dont and often the variations in roughly parallel versions are themselves of intrinsic interestAt least one nun in the Bhikkhunisamyutta Vajira does not appear in the Therigatha while the case of another nun Sela is problematicA comparison between the two collections also brings to light some noteworthy differences in the ascription of authorship in one case  that of the three Cala sisters  a threeway shuffling of ascriptions occursSuch differences can be readily understood once we realize that the texts were originally transmitted orally for several centuries and thus were contingent on less durable factors than paper and inkSince the Samyutta Nikaya and the Therigatha were evidently transmitted by different lines of reciters it was only too easy for verses to break off from their original narrative setting and merge with a different background story connecting them to a different authorThe antiquity of this collection is attested to by the fact that it has a counterpart in the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit Samyuktagama which probably belonged to the Sarvastivada schoolAnesakis The Four Buddhist Agamas in Chinese gives a breakdown of the Chinese equivalent of the Bhikkhunisamyutta and though the order of suttas is different the ten titles are almost identical except that the Pali Sela Sutta is there entitled ViriThis is strong evidence that the entire chapter had taken shape before the Pali and Sarvastivada schools went their separate waysAll the ten suttas are constructed according to the same pattern a direct confrontation between Mara the Evil One the Lord of Sensuality and an individual nunThis structure perhaps accounts for the placement of the Bhikkhunisamyutta immediately after the Marasamyutta in which the Evil One is shown trying to distract the Buddha and the monksIn each sutta of our collection a nun goes off by herself to pass the day in solitary meditationThen Mara approaches her with a challenge  a provocative question or a taunt  intending to make her fall away from concentrationWhat Mara has failed to realize is that each of these nuns is an arahant and has seen so deeply into the truth of the Dhamma that she is utterly inaccessible to his wilesFar from being flustered by Maras challenge the nun promptly guesses the identity of her adversary and overturns his challenge with a sharp replyOnce Mara realizes that his number has been called he has no choice but to vanish on the spot sad and disappointedIn a dialogue that brings together the Lord of Sensuality with a solitary nun one might expect each of Maras overtures to be aimed at sexual seductionThis however is so only in several suttasThe actual themes of the discourses vary and expose us to a broad range of perspectives on the attitudes and insights of the renunciant lifeThe contrast between the allurement and misery of sensual pleasures is the theme of  andIn  Mara does not himself attempt to seduce the nun but only urges her to enjoy sense pleasures before her time runs out in  he assumes the guise of a handsome youth who lavishes his seductive charms on the beautiful Vijaya and in  he almost threatens to rape the nun Uppalavanna who had actually been raped soon after her ordination by an infatuated youthIn all three cases the nuns sharply rebuke Mara with verses that reveal their utter indifference to his solicitationsIn  Mara approaches Kisagotami the heroine of the wellknown parable of the mustard seed trying to arouse her maternal instincts to beget another sonHis challenge thus touches on sensuality only indirectlyHis primary appeal is aimed at awakening the feminine desire for childrenMaras dialogue with Soma voices the ancient Indian prejudice that women are endowed with mere twofingered wisdom and thus cannot attain Nibbana a goal reserved for malesSomas rejoinder is a forceful reminder that enlightenment does not depend on gender but on the minds capacity for concentration and wisdom qualities accessible to any human being who earnestly seeks to penetrate the truthIn  and we meet the three Cala sisters the younger sisters of the Venerable SariputtaFrom these three nuns Mara tries to elicit respectively an affirmation of birth of rebirth in the heavenly realms and of heretical viewsIn each case the nun replies with appropriate verses exposing the dangers in birth in the entire triple world and in the systems of the nonBuddhist thinkersThe last two suttas are philosophical masterpieces compressing into a few tight stanzas insights of enormous depth and wide implicationsFull appreciation of their richness and power would require extensive acquaintance with the whole corpus of early Buddhist texts particularly the Samyutta Nikaya chapters on dependent origination and the five aggregatesIn  Mara challenges Sela with a question on the origins of personal existenceShe replies with a masterly poem that condenses the whole teaching of dependent origination into three fourline stanzas adorned with an illuminating simileIn  he poses a similar problem to Vajira who answers with a stunning exposition of the teaching of nonself illustrating the composite nature of personal identity with the simile of the chariotThis simile was popularized by the famous Milindapañha but Vajiras simpler version has an incisive edge that is blunted by the bombastic tone of the later workThough set against a mythological background in an ancient world whose customs and norms seem so remote from our own these poems of the nuns of old still speak to us today through their sheer simplicity and uncompromising honestyThey need no ornamentation or artifice to convey their message but startle us with the clarity of unadorned truthEmerging from the depths of indubitable personal realization crackling with insight they point unwaveringly toward the rugged path of renunciation and wisdom that leads to the end of sufferingThe present translation is based primarily upon

Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe arahant ideal and the bodhisattva ideal are often considered the respective guiding ideals of Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna BuddhismThis assumption is not entirely correct for the Theravāda tradition has absorbed the bodhisattva ideal into its framework and thus recognizes the validity of both arahantship and Buddhahood as objects of aspirationIt would therefore be more accurate to say that the arahant ideal and the bodhisattva ideal are the respective guiding ideals of Early Buddhism and Mahāyāna BuddhismBy Early Buddhism I do not mean the same thing as Theravāda Buddhism that exists in the countries of southern AsiaI mean the type of Buddhism embodied in the archaic Nikāyas of Theravāda Buddhism and in the corresponding texts of other schools of Indian Buddhism that did not survive the general destruction of Buddhism in IndiaIt is important to recognize that these ideals in the forms that they have come down to us originate from different bodies of literature stemming from different periods in the historical development of BuddhismIf we dont take this fact into account and simply compare these two ideals as described in Buddhist canonical texts we might assume that the two were originally expounded by the historical Buddha himself and we might then suppose that the Buddha  living and teaching in the Ganges plain in the th century B offered his followers a choice between them as if to say This is the arahant ideal which has such and such features and that is the bodhisattva ideal which has such and such featuresChoose whichever one you like The Mahāyāna sūtras such as the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra and the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra give the impression that the Buddha did teach both idealsSuch sūtras however certainly are not archaicTo the contrary they are relatively late attempts to schematize the different types of Buddhist practice that had evolved over a period of roughly four hundred years after the Buddhas parinirvāṇaThe most archaic Buddhist texts  the Pali Nikāyas and their counterparts from other early schools  depict the ideal for the Buddhist disciple as the arahantThe Mahāyāna sūtras composed a few centuries later in a Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit depict the ideal for the Mahāyāna follower as the bodhisattvaNow some people argue that because the arahant is the ideal of Early Buddhism while the bodhisattva is the ideal of later Mahāyāna Buddhism the Mahāyāna must be a more advanced or highly developed type of Buddhism a more ultimate teaching compared to the simpler more basic teaching of the NikāyasThat is indeed an attitude common among Mahāyānists which I will call Mahāyāna elitism An opposing attitude common among conservative advocates of the Nikāyas rejects all later developments in the history of Buddhist thought as deviation and distortion a fall away from the pristine purity of the ancient teachingI call this attitude Nikāya purism Taking the arahant ideal alone as valid Nikāya purists reject the bodhisattva ideal sometimes forcefully and even aggressivelyI have been seeking a point of view that can do justice to both perspectives that of the Nikāyas and the early Mahāyāna sūtras a point of view that can accommodate their respective strengths without falling into a soft and easy syncretism without blotting out conceptual dissonances between them without abandoning faithfulness to the historical records  yet one which also recognizes that these records are by no means crystal clear and are unlikely to be free of biasThis task has by no means been easyIt is much simpler to adopt either a standpoint of Nikāya purism or one of Mahāyāna elitism and hold to it without flinchingThe problem with these two standpoints however is that both are obliged to neglect facts that are discomforting to their respective points of viewAlthough I am ordained as a Theravāda Buddhist monk in this paper I am not going to be defending the opinions of any particular school of Buddhism or trying to uphold a sectarian point of viewFor six years I have lived in Chinese Mahāyāna monasteries and my understanding of Buddhism has been particularly enriched by my contact with the teachings of the Chinese scholarmonk Master Yinshun and his most senior living pupil Master Renjun the founder of Bodhi Monastery in New JerseyMy first purpose is to draw out from the texts what the texts say explicitly and also what they imply about these two competing ideals of the Buddhist lifeAt the end when I draw my conclusions I will clearly state them as such and they will be entirely my ownSometimes I will not draw conclusions but instead raise questions pointing to problems in the history of Buddhism that I am acutely aware of but unfortunately cannot resolveIt is quite possible that what I consider a nuanced and balanced point of view will draw fire from partisan advocates on both sides of the divideHowever from the standpoint of my present understanding I have no choice but to take this riskI want to start by making what I think is an extremely important but seldom made observation namely that both types of texts  the Nikāyas and gamas on the one hand and the Mahāyāna sūtras on the other  are in a sense looking to the Buddha himself as the idealThat is it is not the case that Early Buddhism overlooks the Buddha and instead takes his disciples as the ideal while Mahāyāna Buddhism comes to the rescue and recovers what the Hīnayānists had missed namely the inspirational impetus imparted by the Buddha himselfRather I want to maintain that followers of both forms of Buddhism  and the authoritative texts from which both forms of Buddhism develop  are looking upon the Buddha as the exemplary figure that a true follower of the Dharma should emulateThe two differ primarily in so far as they view the Buddha from two different perspectivesIll use an analogy to illustrate this and then provide a fuller explanationThe Buddha Hall here at our monastery has two entrances situated on either side of the Buddha imageIf one looks at the image after entering the hall by the west entrance the Buddha appears in one way the angle highlights certain characteristics of the faceIf one looks at the image after entering the hall by the east entrance the Buddha appears in a different way the angle highlights other characteristics of the faceI see this as a fitting simile for the way the two traditions view the Buddha and his enlightenmentI see both the early suttas of the Nikāyas and gamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras to be giving us different perspectives on the Buddha and his enlightenment and thus as offering different understandings of what it means to be a true follower of the BuddhaTo briefly characterize these perspectives I would say that the Nikāyas and gamas give us a historicalrealistic perspective on the Buddha while the Mahāyāna sūtras give us a cosmicmetaphysical perspective By using these terms Im not intending to use the Nikāyas to trump the Mahāyāna sūtras  though naturally I hold they are more likely to be closer to the Buddhas own verbal teachingsRather Im just trying to characterize the standpoints that they use to look at the Buddha and interpret his significance for the worldThese two perspectives then define what the Buddha accomplished through his enlightenmentWhen we take the historicalrealistic perspective the Buddha became an arahantHowever though being an arahant he was what we might call an arahant with differences he was moreover not simply an arahant with a few incidental differences but an arahant whose differences eventually elevated him to a distinct level the Bhagavā a world teacher one who towered above all the other arahantsThese differences opened the door so to speak to the cosmicmetaphysical perspective on the Buddha as a way to understand what accounted for these differencesOnce this door was opened up the Buddha was viewed as the one who brought to consummation the long bodhisattva career extending over countless eons in which he sacrificed himself in various ways many times for the good of others this is the cosmic aspect of that perspectiveAgain he was viewed as the one who arrived at ultimate truth the Tathāgata who has come from Suchness and gone to Suchness and yet who abides nowhere this is the metaphysical aspect of that perspectiveThis cosmicmetaphysical perspective then became characteristic of the MahāyānaAs I indicated above there is a sense in which both the Nikāyas and the Mahāyāna sūtras alike take it as their project to demonstrate what is required of one who wants to follow in the footsteps of the Master But they take up this project from these two different standpointsI will explain first the standpoint of the Nikāyas and then the standpoint of the Mahāyāna sūtrasThe Nikāyas begin with our common human condition and depict the Buddha as starting from within this same human conditionThat is for the Nikāyas the Buddha starts off as a human being sharing fully in our humanityHe takes birth among us as a man subject to the limitations of human lifeAs he grows up he is confronted with inevitable old age sickness and death which reveal to him the deep misery that perpetually lies hidden behind youth health and life mocking our brightest joysLike many other thoughtful Indians of his time he seeks a way to liberation from lifes afflictions  and as he tells it he seeks liberation primarily for himself not with some grand thought in mind of saving the worldHe goes forth becomes an ascetic and engages in a relentless struggle for deliveranceFinally he finds the correct path and attains the bliss of nirvāṇaAfter his attainment he considers whether he should make the path available to others and his first impulse is to remain silentNote that he almost follows the route of a paccekabuddhaIt is only when the deity Brahmā Sahampati entreats him that he takes up the task of teaching this path to othersHis major achievement is to have attained nirvāṇa the state free from all bondage and sufferingThis is the great goal the final end of all spiritual striving the peace beyond all the anxiety and unrest of the ordinary human conditionBy teaching the path he makes this goal available to others and those who follow the path reach the same goal that he himself attainedThe Buddha is the first of the arahants while those who reach the goal by following his path also become arahantsIn the verse of homage to the Buddha it is said Iti pi so Bhagavā Arahaṃ  The Blessed One is an arahant Shortly after his enlightenment while walking to Benares to meet the five monks a wanderer stopped the Buddha and asked who he wasThe Buddha replied I am the arahant in the world I am the supreme teacherSo the Buddha first of all declares himself to be an arahantThe defining mark of an arahant is the attainment of nirvāṇa in this present lifeThe word arahant was not coined by the Buddha but was current even before he appeared on the Indian religious sceneThe word is derived from a verb arahati meaning to be worthy and thus means a person who is truly worthy of veneration and offeringsAmong Indian spiritual seekers in the Buddhas time the word was used to denote a person who had attained the ultimate goal for this is what made one worthy of veneration and offeringsFrom the perspective of the Nikāyas the ultimate goal  the goal in strict doctrinal terms  is nirvāṇa and the goal in human terms is arahantship the state of a person who has attained nirvāṇa in this present lifeThe Buddhas enlightenment is significant because it marked the first realization of nirvāṇa within this historical epochWe might say that the Buddha rises above the horizon of history as an arahant in his historical manifestation he dawns upon human consciousness as an arahantAfter attaining enlightenment the Buddha makes the path to enlightenment available to many othersEnlightenment is valued because it is the gateway to the ultimate freedom of nirvāṇaIn the Nikāyas we find several descriptions of the process by which the Buddha attained enlightenment and there are corresponding texts that describe the disciples enlightenment in the same termsIn MN the Buddha says that being myself subject to birth aging sickness and death I attained the unborn ageless sicknessfree deathless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna A few months later when he taught the Dhamma to his first five disciples he says of them When those monks were instructed and guided by me being subject to birth aging sickness and death they attained the unborn ageless sicknessfree deathless supreme security from bondage NibbānaThus the attainment of these monks is described in exactly the same terms that the Buddha uses to describe his own attainmentAgain in several suttas  MN MN MN  the Buddha describes his attainment of enlightenment as involving two main stagesFirst comes the attainment of the four jhānasSecond during the three parts of the night he realized three higher knowledges the recollection of past lives the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings according to their karma and the knowledge of the destruction of the āsavas the primordial defilements that sustain the round of rebirthsNow several suttas in the same collection the Majjhima Nikāya describe the enlightenment of the disciple in just this way attainment of the four jhānas and realization of the three higher knowledges see egMN MN MNWhile it is true that not all disciples attained the jhānas and most probably didnt attain the first two higher knowledges these seemed to mark a certain ideal standard within the early Sangha  a standard that the Buddha and the great arahants shared in commonAt SN the Buddha says that both the Tathāgata and the arahant disciple are alike in being liberated from the five aggregates form feeling perception volitional formations and consciousnessSo what is the difference between themThe answer the Buddha gives points to temporal priority as the distinction the Tathāgata is the originator of the path the producer of the path the one who declares the pathHe is the knower of the path the discoverer of the path the expounder of the pathHis disciples dwell following the path and become possessed of it afterwardsBut they both walk the same path and attain the same final goalThus the Buddha is distinguished from the arahant disciples not by some categorical difference in their respective attainments but by his role he is the first one in this historical epoch to attain liberation and he serves as the incomparable guide in making known the way to liberationHe has skills in teaching that even the most capable of his disciples cannot match but with regard to their worldtranscending attainments both the Buddha and the arahants are buddho enlightened in that they have comprehended the truths that should be comprehendedThey are both nibbuto in that they have extinguished the defilements and thereby attained the peace of nirvāṇaThey are both suvimutto fully liberatedThey have fully understood the truth of suffering they have abandoned craving the origin of suffering they have realized nirvāṇa the cessation of suffering and they have completed the practice of the noble eightfold path the way leading to the cessation of sufferingAs the first to accomplish all these worthy achievements the Buddha fulfills two functionsFirst he serves as an example the supreme example almost every aspect of his life is exemplary but above all his very person demonstrates the possibility of attaining perfect freedom from all the fetters of the mind complete release from suffering release from the pitfalls of birth and deathSecond as aforesaid he serves as the guide the one who knows the path and can teach it in its most intricate detailsAs the guide he constantly exhorts his disciples to make a dedicated effort to attain the ultimate goal nirvāṇaHe admonishes them to strive as diligently as a man whose turban was on fire would strive to put out the fireThe fires of the human heart are greed hatred and delusion their extinction is nirvāṇaThose who extinguish greed hatred and delusion are arahantsNevertheless it would hardly be correct to say that temporal priority is the only thing that distinguishes the Buddha from the arahantsTo bring out the difference I want to take two stock formulas that occur many times in the texts one for the Buddha and one for the arahantsI already quoted the opening of the Buddha formula now let me take it in full The Blessed One is an arahant a perfectly enlightened one possessed of true knowledge and conduct an exalted one a knower of the world unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and humans enlightened the Blessed OneThere are nine epithets hereOf these nine four are also used for arahant disciples arahant possessed of true knowledge and conduct an exalted one enlightened five are used exclusively for the Buddha perfectly enlightened one knower of the world unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and humans the Blessed OneNote that of these five two explicitly refer to the Buddhas significance for others while as I understand it this aspect is also implied by the word Bhagavā Even the epithets signifying knowledge are intended to show that he is a reliable authority that is by reason of his wisdom or knowledge he is someone whom others can trust as a source of guidanceSo when the Buddha is designated a sammā sambuddha a perfectly enlightened one this highlights not only the fullness of his enlightenment but his authority and reliability as a spiritual teacherThe formula for the arahant reads thus Here a monk is an arahant one whose taints are destroyed who has lived the spiritual life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached his own goal utterly destroyed the fetters of existence one completely liberated through final knowledge Now all these epithets are true for the Buddha as well but the Buddha is not described in this way for these terms emphasize the attainment of ones own liberation and the Buddha is extolled not primarily as the one who has attained his own liberation but as the one who opens the doors of liberation for othersThat is even in the archaic suttas of the Nikāyas an otherregarding significance is already being subtly ascribed to the Buddhas status that is not ascribed to the arahantWhile the content of the Buddhas enlightenment according to the Nikāya suttas does not qualitatively differ from that of other arahants it plays a different role in what we might call the grand cosmic scheme of salvationThe Buddhas enlightenment has an essentially otherdirected component built into it from the startBy virtue of attaining enlightenment the Buddha serves as the great teacher who opens the doors to the Deathless AN I xiii says he is the one person who arises in the world for the welfare of the world out of compassion for the world for the good of devas and human beingsMN compares him to a kind man who leads a herd of deer from a place of danger to a place of safety MN compares him to a wise cowherd who leads his cows safely across the riverAccording to MN the Buddha is honored by other arahants because he is one who having attained enlightenment himself teaches the Dhamma for the sake of enlightenment having attained peace he teaches for the sake of peace having attained nirvāṇa he teaches for the sake of nirvāṇaHe is perfect in all respects and the most important of his perfections is his ability to teach the Dharma in ways that are best suited to the capacities of those who come to him for guidanceHis teaching is always exactly suited to the capacities of those who seek his help and when they follow his instructions they receive favorable results whether it be merely the gain of faith or the attainment of liberationOther arahants can certainly teach and many do teach groups of disciplesNevertheless as teachers they do not compare with the BuddhaThis is so in at least two respects First the Dhamma they teach others is one that comes from the Buddha and thus ultimately the Buddha is the source of their wisdom and second their skills in teaching never match in all respects the skills of the Buddha who is the only one who knows the path in its entiretyThe Buddha can function so effectively as a teacher because his attainment of enlightenment  the knowledge of the four noble truths which brings the destruction of the defilements  brings along the acquisition of several other types of knowledge that are considered special assets of a BuddhaChief among these according to the oldest sources are the ten Tathāgata powers which include the knowledge of the diverse inclinations of beings and the knowledge of the degree of maturity of the faculties of other beingsSuch types of knowledge enable the Buddha to understand the mental proclivities and capacities of any person who comes to him for guidance and to teach that person in the particular way that will prove most beneficial taking full account of his or her character and personal circumstancesHe is thus the unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed Whereas arahant disciples are limited in their communicative skills the Buddha can communicate effectively with beings in many other realms of existence as well as with people from many different walks of lifeThis skill singles him out as the teacher of devas and humansThus we can see the respects in which the Buddha and disciple arahants share certain qualities in common above all their liberation from all defilements and from all bonds connecting them to the round of rebirthsAnd we also see how the Buddha is distinguished from his disciples namely by the priority of his attainment by his function as teacher and guide and by his acquisition of certain qualities and modes of knowledge that enable him to function as teacher and guideHe also has a physical body endowed with thirtytwo excellent characteristics and with other marks of physical beautyThese inspire confidence in those who rely on beauty of formI said above that each extreme attitude  Nikāya purism and Mahāyāna elitism   neglects facts that are discomforting to their respective points of viewMahāyāna elitism neglects the fact that in his historical manifestation so far as we can ascertain through the early records of his teachings the Buddha did not teach the bodhisattva path which emerges only in documents that start to appear at least a century after his passingWhat the Buddha consistently taught according to the early records is the attainment of nirvāṇa by reaching arahantshipThe problem besetting Nikāya purism is the figure of the Buddha himself for in the Buddha we meet a person who while an arahant did not attain arahantship as the disciple of a Buddha but as a BuddhaIn the Nikāyas themselves he is depicted not merely as the first of the arahants but as one member of a class of beings  the Tathāgatas  who possess unique characteristics that set them apart from all other beings including their arahant disciplesThe Nikāyas moreover regard the Tathāgatas as supreme in the entire order of sentient beings To whatever extent monks there are beings whether footless or with two feet four feet or many feet whether having form or formless whether percipient or nonpercipient or neither percipient nor nonpercipient the Tathāgata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One is declared the best among themNow since the Buddha is distinguished from his liberated disciples in the ways sketched above it seems almost selfevident that in his past lives he must have followed a preparatory course sufficient to issue in such an exalted state namely the course of a bodhisattvaThis conclusion is in fact a point of agreement common to all Buddhist schools both those derived from Early Buddhism and those belonging to the Mahāyāna it also seems to me to be a conclusion required by reflectionAccording to all Buddhist traditions to attain the supreme enlightenment of a Buddha requires the forming of a deliberate resolution and the fulfillment of the spiritual perfections the pāramis or pāramitās and it is a bodhisattva who consummates the practice of these perfectionsHowever the Nikāyas and gamas the most ancient texts are strangely silent about this very issueIn the Nikāyas the Buddha does refer to himself as a bodhisatta in the period prior to his enlightenment in his immediately preceding life when he dwelled in the Tusita heaven and during the period of his final life as Gotama of the Sakyan clan before his enlightenmentBut he says nothing to suggest that he had been consciously following a deliberate course of conduct aimed at the attainment of BuddhahoodMoreover soon after his enlightenment when the Buddha considered whether or not to teach the Dhamma he says that he first inclined to dwell at ease that is not to teach which suggests that even after his enlightenment he might not have fulfilled the function of a sammā sambuddha but could have become a paccekabuddhaThere are however other passages strewn across the Nikāyas that prevent us from drawing the definitive conclusion that the Buddha somehow stumbled upon Buddhahood merely by chance or that his hesitation implied a genuine possibility of choiceThese passages suggest to the contrary that his attainment of Buddhahood was already prepared for in his previous birthsThough they do not say that in his past lives he was deliberately following a bodhisattva path to attain Buddhahood the Nikāyas do depict him as dwelling in the Tusita heaven in his immediately past existence destined to become a fully enlightened Buddha in his next life as Gotama of the Sakyan clan and this implies that in his past lives he must have fulfilled the most demanding prerequisites to take on such an exalted role to become the loftiest and most highly venerated being in all the worldWhen he descends into his mothers womb a great measureless light appears in the world surpassing the light of the devas and such a light appears again at his birthWhen he is born he is first received by deities and streams of water pour forth from the sky to wash him and his motherImmediately upon his birth he takes seven steps and declares himself the best in the worldThe gods sing songs of delight declaring that the bodhisattva has arisen for the welfare and happiness of the human worldSuch passages of course could be seen as later additions to the Nikāyas indicative of a stage when the Buddha legend was already making inroads upon the most ancient textsNevertheless given the law of cause and result as operating in the spiritual dimensions of the human domain it seems virtually impossible that anyone could have attained the extraordinary stature of a Buddha without having made a deliberate effort over many lives to reach such a supreme attainmentDespite such considerations in the Nikāyas the Buddha is never seen teaching others to enter a bodhisattva pathWhenever he urges his monastic disciples to strive for any goal it is to strive for arahantship for liberation for nirvāṇaWhenever monastic disciples come to the Buddha they ask for guidance in following the path to arahantshipThe monks that the Buddha praises in the midst of the Sangha are those who have attained arahantshipLay disciples often attain the three lower stages of liberation from streamentry to nonreturning those who lack the potential for worldtranscending attainments aim at a heavenly rebirth or for a fortunate rebirth back into the human realmNo mention is ever made however of a lay disciple treading the bodhisattva path much less of a dichotomy between monastic arahants and lay bodhisattvasWe need not however simply take the Nikāyas at face value but can raise questionsWhy is it that in the Nikāyas we never find any instance of a disciple coming to the Buddha to ask for guidance in following a bodhisattva path to BuddhahoodAnd why is the Buddha never seen exhorting his followers to take up the bodhisattva pathThe questions themselves seem perfectly legitimate and Ive tried working out several explanations though without complete successOne explanation is that there were instances when this happened but they were filtered out by the compilers of the texts because such teachings were not consistent with the teachings aimed at arahantshipThis hypothesis seems unlikely because if discourses on the path to Buddhahood had the imprint of genuine teachings of the Buddha it is improbable that the monks compiling the texts would have omitted themAnother explanation is that in the earliest phase of Buddhism the pretextual phase the Buddha was simply the first arahant who taught the path to arahantship and did not differ significantly from those among his arahant disciples who possessed the three higher types of knowledge and the iddhis the supernormal powersAccording to this account the Nikāyas are the product of several generations of monastic elaboration and thus already show traces of the apotheosis of the Buddha his elevation to an exalted statusOn this hypothesis if we could take a timemachine back to the Buddhas own time we would find that the Buddha differed from the other arahants mainly in the priority of his attainment and in certain skills he possessed as a teacher but these differences would not be as great as even the old Nikāyas make them out to beHowever this position seems to strip away from the Buddha that which is most distinctive about him his uncanny ability to reach deep into the hearts of those who came to him for guidance and teach them in the unique way suitable for their characters and situationsThis ability betokens a depth of compassion a spirit of selfless service that harmonizes better with the later concept of the bodhisattva than with the canonical concept of the arahant as we see it portrayed for example in many of the poems of the Theragāthā or the muni poems of the SuttanipātaIn the final analysis I have to confess my inability to provide a perfectly cogent solution to this problemIn view of the fact that in later times so many Buddhists in Theravāda lands as well as in the Mahāyāna world have been inspired by the bodhisattva ideal it is perplexing that no teachings about a bodhisattva path or bodhisattva practices are included in the discourses regarded as coming down from the most archaic period of Buddhist literary historyThis remains a puzzle  for me personally and also I believe a puzzle for Buddhist historiographyIn any case the texts that we inherit do not show as steep a difference between the Buddhas otherregarding functions and the socalled selfenlightenment of the arahants as later tradition makes them out to beThe Nikāyas show sufficient emphasis on altruistic activity aimed at sharing the Dhamma with others admittedly though most of this emphasis comes from the Buddha himself in the form of injunctions to his disciplesThus several texts distinguish people into four types those concerned only with selfgood those concerned only with others good those concerned with the good of neither and those concerned with the good of both these texts praise as best those who are devoted to the good of bothAnd what is meant by being devoted to the good of both is practicing the noble eightfold path and teaching others to practice it observing the five precepts and encouraging others to observe them working to eliminate greed aversion and delusion and encouraging others to eliminate themIn other suttas the Buddha urges all those who know the four foundations of mindfulness to teach their relatives and friends about them and the same is said about the four factors of streamentry and the four noble truthsIn the beginning of his ministry he exhorts his disciples to go forth and preach the Dharma out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of devas and human beingsAmong the important qualities of an outstanding monk are abundant learning and skill in expounding the Dharma two qualities that are directly relevant to the benefit of othersAlso we must remember that the Buddha established a monastic order bound by rules and regulations designed to make it function as a harmonious community and these rules often demand the renouncing of selfinterest for the sake of the larger wholeRegarding the lay followers the Buddha praises those who practice for their own good for the good of others and for the good of the whole worldMany prominent lay followers converted their colleagues and neighbors to the Dharma and guided them in right practiceThus we can see that while Early Buddhism emphasizes that each person is ultimately responsible for his or her own destiny holding that no one can purify another or rescue another from the miseries of saṃsāra it includes an altruistic dimension that distinguished it from most of the other religious systems that flourished alongside it in northern IndiaThis altruistic dimension might be seen as the seed from which the bodhisattva doctrine developedIt might thus also be considered one of the elements in ancient Buddhism that contributed to the emergence of the MahāyānaPerhaps for a fullfledged bodhisattva doctrine to emerge in Buddhism something more was needed than the conception of the Buddha that we find in the ancient texts of the NikāyasThus the common project of comparing the arahant of the Nikāyas with the bodhisattva figure of the Mahāyāna sūtras may be somewhat misguidedAs I see it one of the factors that underlies the emergence of the fullfledged bodhisattva doctrine was the transformation of the archaic Buddha concept of the Nikāya sūtras into the Buddha figure of Buddhist religious faith and legendThis took place mainly in the age of Sectarian Buddhism that is between the phase of Early Buddhism represented by the Nikāyas and the rise of early Mahāyāna BuddhismDuring this period two significant developments of the Buddha concept occurredFirst the number of Buddhas was multiplied and second the Buddhas came to be endowed with increasingly more exalted qualitiesThese developments occurred somewhat differently in the different Buddhist schools but certain common features united themThe Nikāyas already mention six Buddhas preceding Gotama and one to follow him MetteyyaNow since cosmic time is without any discernible beginning or conceivable end the inference was drawn that there must have been even earlier Buddhas and thus the number of past Buddhas was increased stories about some of these entered into circulation and brought them to lifeSince space was likewise unbounded with world systems like our own spread out in the ten directions some schools posited the present existence of Buddhas in other world systems beyond our own  Buddhas still alive whom one might worship and by means of meditative power actually see with contemplative visionThe texts of Sectarian Buddhism increased a Buddhas faculties of knowledge until they eventually ascribed to him nothing short of omniscienceHe came to possess numerous miraculous powersEighteen special Buddhadharmas not mentioned in the old suttas were addedLegends and stories entered into circulation describing the wonderful ways he taught and transformed othersSome of these stories are already found in the suttas the stories of his encounters with the serial killer Angulimāla the fierce demon ḷavaka the poor leper Suppabuddha the angry brahmin BhāradvājaThese stories increased exponentially painting a picture of the Buddha as the incredibly resourceful teacher who redeems from misery and delusion people of every typeHe breaks the pride of haughty brahmins he brings consolation to distraught mothers and wretched widows he dispels the complacency of proud warriors and beautiful courtesans he outdoes clever scholars in debates and rival ascetics in feats of supernormal powers he teaches avaricious millionaires the wonders of generosity he inspires diligence in heedless monks he wins the reverence of kings and princesAs Buddhist devotees looked back on their deceased Master and pondered the question of what accounted for his extraordinary greatness in no long time they realized that what was most outstanding about him was his boundless compassionNot content with confining his compassionate concern for others to a single life they saw it as spread out over innumerable lives in the chain of samsaric existenceTheir creative imaginations thus gave birth to a vast treasury of stories about births namely about the Buddhas previous birthsThese stories  the Jātakas or Birth Tales  told of how he had prepared himself for his mission as a Buddha by treading the path of a bodhisattva for unimaginable eonsThe keynote of the most memorable of these stories is service and selfsacrificeIt was by serving others and sacrificing himself for their good that the bodhisattva earned the merits and acquired the virtues that entitled him to attain BuddhahoodThus in Buddhist thought clear across the schools of Early Buddhism the altruistic dimension of the Buddhas enlightenment came to the forefront literally carved in stone  in pillars and monuments stretching from India to Indonesia  and memorialized in stories and poetryFrom this perspective the Buddhas enlightenment was significant not merely because it opened the path to nirvāṇa for many others but because it consummated an eonslong career that began with an altruistic motivation and endured across many eons sustained by an altruistic resolveDuring this career it was held the bodhisattva qualified himself for Buddhahood by fulfilling certain supreme virtues the pāramīs or pāramitās which now took the place that the factors of the noble eightfold path held in Early BuddhismThis understanding of the Buddha I must stress was common to all the schools of Sectarian Buddhism including the TheravādaDuring the age of Sectarian Buddhism the Early Buddhist schools came to admit three vehicles to enlightenment the vehicle of the disciple arahant the śrāvakayāna to be taken by the greatest number of disciples the vehicle of the solitary enlightened one who attains realization without a teacher but does not teach the pratyekabuddhayāna which is still more difficult and the vehicle of the aspirant to Buddhahood the bodhisattvayānaOnce it became widespread in mainstream Indian Buddhism the idea of the three vehicles was not only taken up by the Mahāyāna but was eventually also absorbed into conservative Theravāda BuddhismThus we read in the later Theravāda commentaries such as those by cariya Dhammapāla and others of the same three yānas or of the three kinds of bodhi the enlightenment of disciples of paccekabuddhas and of sammā sambuddhasNow at some point during this period the altruistic interpretation of the Buddhas enlightenment that culminated in the conception of the bodhisattva path flowed back upon the Buddhist community and for some members at least took on a prescriptive forceAs they reflected deeply on what it meant to be an ideal follower of the Buddha such Buddhist disciples concluded that to follow in the Buddhas footsteps in the highest sense it was no longer sufficient simply to follow the noble eightfold path aimed at the attainment of nirvāṇaThis was still seen as a valid option an option that culminated in liberation for oneself and those one might immediately influence by teaching and example but they held the Buddha himself had aimed at a state that would enable him to promote the welfare and happiness of the hosts of devas and humansThus these thinkers felt the superior choice the higher way to follow the Buddha was to set out on the same quest that the Buddha had set for himself by taking the vows of a bodhisattva and following the bodhisattva courseThis would have marked the emergence of the bodhisattvayāna as a conception of the ideal Buddhist way of life the way binding upon the true follower of the Enlightened OneThis ideal emerged from a different starting point than Early Buddhism a different visionary backgroundWhereas Early Buddhism takes the common human condition as its starting point and even views the Buddha as beginning as a human being subject to human frailties earlyperiod Mahāyāna Buddhism takes as its starting point the longrange cosmic background to a Buddhas attainment of BuddhahoodIt looks back to his first conception of the bodhicitta his original vows and his practice of the pāramitās over countless lives and treats these as the paradigm for practiceThat is it sees this process not merely as a description of the path that a Buddha follows but as a recommendation of the path that his true disciples should follow some later versions of Mahāyāna see this as the actualization of a potential for Buddhahood the tathāgatagarbha or embryo of the ThusCome One already embedded deep within usWe can imagine a period when the bodhisattvayāna had been consciously adopted by a growing number of Buddhists probably first within small circles of monks who sought to guide themselves by the sūtras of the Nikāyas or gamas and the Jātaka stories dealing with the Buddhas past livesThey were still members of early Buddhist communities and probably had not yet even become conscious of themselves as branching off to form a new traditionThey would not have thought of themselves as Mahāyāna Buddhists as we understand the term today but simply as communities of Buddhists pledged to follow the bodhisattvayāna which they might have designated the mahāyāna simply in the sense that it constituted a great course to enlightenmentHowever while for some time they may have tried to remain within the fold of mainstream Buddhism once they began to openly propagate the bodhisattva ideal they would have found themselves in open confrontation with those who adhered more strictly to the ideas and ideals of the older wellestablished sūtrasThis confrontation would have heightened their sense of distinctness and thus led to their conscious amalgamation into communities revolving around a new vision of the Buddhist path and goalAt this point they might have found that the teachings of the Nikāyagama sūtras which describe the practices needed to attain personal liberation from the round of birth and death no longer met their needsThey would of course still have accepted these teachings as authoritative since they stemmed directly from the Buddha but they would also felt the need for scriptures rooted in the same authority that provide detailed teachings about the practices and stages of the bodhisattva path which aimed at nothing less than perfect BuddhahoodIt was to fill this need presumably that the Mahāyāna sūtras began to appear on the Indian Buddhist sceneExactly how these sūtras were first composed and made their appearance is a matter about which contemporary scholarship is still largely in the dark for all we have at our disposal are Mahāyāna sūtras that are fairly well developed and represent Mahāyāna Buddhism at what we might call stage two or even stage three of its developmentUnfortunately we cannot use them to peer back into the very earliest stage of the Mahāyāna when these sūtras were first starting to take shape or even past that period when Mahāyānist ideas were still in the stage of gestation seeking articulation without yet having come to expression in any literary documentsNow there are two attitudes noticeable in the early Mahāyāna sūtras regarding the older paradigm based on the arahant idealOne is to affirm it as valid for the typical Buddhist follower while extolling the bodhisattva path as the appropriate vehicle for the person of excellent aspirationsThis attitude treats the old arahant ideal or the śrāvaka paradigm with respect and admiration while lavishing the greatest praise on the bodhisattva idealWhen this attitude is adopted the two paths  together with the path to the enlightenment of a pratekabuddha  become three valid vehicles the choice of which is left to the discipleThe other attitude seen in the Mahāyāna sūtras is one of devaluation and denigrationIt involves not simply comparing the path to arahantship unfavorably with the bodhisattva path but belittling and ridiculing the old ideal of ancient Buddhism sometimes treating it almost with contemptThe first attitude is seen in such early Mahāyāna texts as the Ugraparipṛcchā SūtraOver time however the second attitude became more prominent until we find such texts as the Vimalakīrti Sūtra which ridicules the great disciples of the Buddha like Sāriputta Upāli and Puṇṇa Mantāniputta or the Aśokadattā Sūtra in which a young girl bodhisattva refuses to show respect to the great arahant disciples or the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra which compares the nirvāṇa of the arahants to the wages of a hired laborerIn some sūtras it is even said that arahants feel shame and reproach themselves for attaining arahantship or that arahants are conceited and deludedIt is indisputable that the Mahāyāna sūtras often have passages of great depth and beautyI believe however that a more conciliatory attitude towards the older form of Buddhism would have made the task of achieving harmony among different Buddhist schools today much easier than it isWithin the Theravāda school the Mahāyāna teachings on the bodhisattva ideal and the practice of the pāramitās were incorporated into the later commentaries but never in a way that involved denigration of the older more historical Buddhist goal of arahantshipIn this part of my presentation I want to use this historical analysis to break down old stereotypes and the prejudices that have divided followers of the two main forms of BuddhismFrom there we can work towards a healthy rather than competitive integration of the twoThe two main stereotypes are as followsArahants and Theravādin Buddhists are concerned exclusively with their own salvation as opposed to the benefit of others they have a narrow fixation on personal liberation because they are fearful of birth and death and therefore have little compassion for others and dont undertake activities intended to benefit themFollowers of the bodhisattva ideal and Mahāyāna Buddhists are so much involved in social projects aimed at benefiting others that they dont take up the practice that the Buddha assigned to his disciples namely the taming of the mind and the development of insightThey have overwhelmed themselves with social duties and forsaken meditation practiceIll take the two stereotypes in order and begin with the ancient arahantsAlthough the Buddha was the pioneer in discovering the path to liberation this does not mean that his arahant disciples just selfishly reaped the benefits of the path and did nothing for othersTo the contrary in the suttas we can see that many of them became great teachers in their own right who were capable of guiding others towards liberationThe best known among them are Sāriputta Mahākaccāna Moggāllana and nandaThere was the monk Puṇṇa who went to the barbarian Sunāparanta country risking his life to teach the Dhamma to the people thereThere were such nuns as Khemā and Dhammadinnā who were outstanding preachers Paṭācārā who was a master of the discipline and many othersFor four hundred years the Buddhist texts were preserved orally transmitted from teachers to pupils and obviously there had to be thousands of monks and nuns who dedicated their lives to learning the texts and teaching them to pupils all for the purpose of preserving the good Dhamma and Vinaya in the worldThe example established by the Buddhas great arahant disciples has been the model for the followers of the arahant ideal throughout historyWhile those who pursue this ideal do not make such lofty vows as do followers of the bodhisattva ideal they are inspired by the example of the Buddha and his great disciples to work for the spiritual and moral uplift of others to the best of their ability by teaching by example and by direct spiritual influence inspired by the Buddhas command to wander forth for the welfare of the multitude for the happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of devas and human beingsThe life pattern of a follower of the arahant ideal conforms in many respects to that of the BuddhaI take as an example those who may not have actually achieved arahantship itself but are practicing within this framework and have reached some higher stage of spiritual accomplishmentIn the early part of their lives they may go to a forest monastery or to a meditation center to train under a competent teacherThen after reaching a sufficient level of maturity to practice on their own they will go into solitude to develop their practice for a period that might last five years or longerThen at a certain point their achievements will start to exert an influence on othersThey might start to teach on their own initiative or their teacher might ask them to begin teaching or prospective students might realize they have achieved some superior state and request guidance from themFrom this point on they will begin to teach and in time they might become well respected spiritual teachers with many disciples and many centers under their guidanceIn contrast to the image of selfish personal liberation that Mahāyāna Buddhists ascribe to the arahants and those following the śrāvakayāna the most eminent masters of the Theravāda tradition often teach thousands of disciples monastic and laitySome may work ten or more hours a dayFor example in recent times VenMahasi Sayadaw of Burma established hundreds of meditation centers in Burma and presided over the Sixth Buddhist Council Ajahn Chah had a main monastery and many branch monasteries in Thailand one dedicated to foreign monks VenPa Auk Sayadaw U Pandita and Bhante Gunaratana  presentday Theravāda meditation teachers  travel throughout the world conducting courses Ajahn Maha Boowa at age reputed to be an arahant supports sixty hospitals in Thailand and regularly visits them to console patients and distribute medicinesThose who are not competent to function as meditation teachers might still become masters of Buddhist texts and philosophy and devote themselves selflessly to guiding others in understanding the Dhamma whether by training monks and nuns by giving instructions to the laity by teaching in Buddhist monastic schools or by preaching in Buddhist templesFrom the Theravāda perspective while social work is certainly praiseworthy of all benefits that can be conferred on others the most precious benefit is the gift of the DharmaThus the quest for liberation as an arahant is not a purely private personal undertaking but has a farreaching influence and can have an impact upon a whole societyIn the traditional Theravāda countries before the corrupting influence of the West set in the whole life of the community revolved around the DhammaThe monks who meditated in the forests and mountains were the inspiration and model for the society those who preached and taught in the villages helped to transmit the Dhamma to the peopleThe lay community from the king down to the villagers saw their principal duty to be the support of the SanghaSo the supreme goal of arahantship became the focal point for an entire social system inspired and sustained by devotion to the DhammaThose who seek the goal of nirvāṇa do not wait until they become arahants before they start helping othersWithin this system giving is regarded as the foundation for all other virtues it is the first basis of merit and the first of the ten pāramisThus the Pali scriptures and monks in their preaching encourage people to give to the best of their abilityLay people support the Sangha with their simple material needs of food robes dwellings and medicinesThey also give generously to the poor and disadvantagedIn Sri Lanka for example blood donation campaigns are common on Buddhist holidays and many people donate their eyes to eye banks and their bodily organs for medical research after their deathI learned recently that in Sri Lanka more than monks have donated kidneys without any thought of remuneration or any other personal benefit solely for the privilege of giving a bodily organMonks with knowledge of the Dhamma and skill in speaking become preachers and teachersThose with managerial skills might become administrators of monasteriesThe few who are strongly motivated to make the effort to win liberation in this very life dedicate their energy to meditation in forest hermitagesAccomplished meditation teachers will devote their time to teaching meditation and will also try to find time to develop their own practiceSometimes they have to delay their own practice in order to fulfill their teaching dutiesSo much for misunderstandings concerning the arahant ideal and now for the bodhisattva ideal I think it would be an oversimplification to equate the pursuit of the bodhisattva ideal with engagement in social service and to assume that a bodhisattva forgoes all training on the path to liberationIn my understanding the foundation of the bodhisattva path is the arising of the bodhicitta the aspiration to supreme enlightenmentThis usually arises only through diligent training in meditationAccording to the authoritative sources on Mahāyāna Buddhist meditation to generate the bodhicitta one must systematically train the mind to perceive all beings as ones mothers and fathers sisters and brothers and arouse towards them boundless lovingkindness and great compassion until such a perception becomes natural and spontaneousThis is not at all easyI read that the Dalai Lama has said that he himself has experienced the real bodhicitta only a few times for a few moments each time so this gives us some idea of how difficult such an achievement must beIt cant be won just by casually engaging in a little social service and then convincing oneself that one has aroused the bodhicittaIt is true that the bodhisattva vows to work for the welfare of others in a broader way than the follower of the śrāvaka vehicle but all such efforts are superficial if they are not motivated and supported by the true bodhicittaBesides generating the aspirational bodhicitta the bodhisattva must apply the bodhicitta through the practice of the six pāramitās and other great bodhisattva deeds of selfabnegationThe pāramitās begin with dānapāramitā the perfection of givingSocial engagement can certainly be included under this category as it involves giving others material gifts and the gift of securityBut these gifts as worthy as they are do not equal in value the gift of the Dharma for the gift of the Dharma leads to the permanent extinction of sufferingTo be qualified to give this gift requires skills that go beyond social serviceThe next spiritual perfection is sīlapāramitā the perfection of morality and social engagement can be included under the morality of altruistic action acts that benefit othersWhile engaged in social service a bodhisattva must also practice patience   patience in enduring difficult conditions patience in enduring disregard and abuse from others so he is fulfilling kṣāntipāramitā the perfection of patienceAnd the work of social service demands energyThis helps to fulfill the vīryapāramitā the perfection of energyThus social engagement can contribute towards the fulfillment of four of the six pāramitāsBut the bodhisattva must also fulfill the dhyānapāramitā and the prajñāpāramitā the perfections of meditation and wisdom and these two perfections require the adoption of a contemplative life styleThe Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras say that the prajñāpāramitā guides and directs the other five pāramitās and the other five pāramitās become perfections or transcendent virtues only when they are connected with prajñāpāramitāBut prajñāpāramitā can only be attained through contemplative practice by seeking out a lifestyle similar to that of one seeking arahantshipThe early Mahāyāna sūtras such as the Ugraparipcchā Sūtra do not recommend that the novice monastic bodhisattva immerse himself in social work rather they point him to the forest and instruct him to devote his efforts to meditationIf we look at the history of Mahāyāna Buddhism whether in India China or Tibet we would see that the great Mahāyāna masters such as Nāgārjuna Asanga and Atīsha in India Huineng Zhiyi and Xuancang in China Longchen Gampopa and Tsongkhapa in Tibet were not renown for their engagement in social service but for their accomplishments as philosophers scholars and meditation mastersThe Buddha himself achieved the highest attainments in meditationSince bodhisattvas aim to become Buddhas it is only natural that they should perfect the meditative skills that are characteristic of a BuddhaAlthough the motivation and philosophical basis for followers of the bodhisattva vehicle differ from that of followers of the śrāvaka vehicle the lifestyles of the two are not very differentThe popular images of the withdrawn solitary arahant and the gregarious superactive bodhisattva are fictionsIn real life the two resemble each other much more than one would thinkThe arahants and those who seek to attain arahantship often work assiduously for the spiritual and material improvement of their fellow human beingsThe bodhisattvas and bodhisattva aspirants often must spend long periods in solitary meditation cultivating the meditative skills that will be necessary for them to attain BuddhahoodThey will also have to study all the doctrines and the paths of the śrāvaka vehicle yet without actualizing those pathsThe bodhisattvas will have to learn to enter the meditative absorptions practice them and eventually master themThey will have to contemplate the three characteristics of impermanence suffering and nonselfThey will have to acquire the insightknowledges into the three characteristicsThey differ from śrāvakas in so far as a śrāvaka aims to use the insightknowledges to attain realization of nirvāṇaA bodhisattva will link his or her practice of the path with the bodhicitta aspiration the bodhisattva vows and the spirit of great compassionSustained by these supports a bodhisattva will be able to contemplate the nature of reality without attaining realization of nirvāṇa until he or she has matured all the qualities that come to perfection in BuddhahoodAmong these is the perfection of giving and the conferring of benefits on sentient beingsBut the greatest gift that one can give is the gift of the Dharma and the kindest benefit one can confer on sentient beings is teaching them the Dharma and guiding them in the DharmaThough a bodhisattva can certainly engage in social service as an expression of his or her compassion to reach the higher stages of the bodhisattva path the aspirant will require a different range of skills than is exercised in social engagement skills that are closer to those possessed by the arahantIn my own view both paths  the arahant path and the bodhisattva path  can be seen as valid expressions of the Buddhas teachingHowever they must both conform to certain formal criteriaIn matters of principle they must conform to such teachings as the four noble truths the three characteristics and dependent origination and in matters of practice they must embody wholesome ethics and follow the scheme of the threefold training in morality concentration and wisdomNevertheless even when these criteria are fulfilled we must further avoid any type of syncretism that leads to the denigration of the original teachings of the historical Buddha regarding them as mere expedients or adaptations to the Indian religious climate of his age rendered irrelevant by teachings arisen at a later periodThe kind of tolerance that is needed is one that respects the authenticity of Early Buddhism so far as we can determine its nature from the oldest historical records yet can also recognize the capacity of Buddhism to undergo genuine historical transformations that bring to manifestation hidden potentials of the ancient teaching transformations not necessarily preordained to arise from the early teaching but which nevertheless enrich the tradition springing from the Buddha as its fountainheadWhen we adopt this approach we can truly venerate those practitioners who work diligently to realize the final goal of the Dhamma here and now to reach nibbāna the extinction of suffering by following the noble eightfold path to its very endWe can venerate those who glorify the teaching by showing that it truly leads to ultimate liberation to the plunge into the unborn and unconditioned state the deathless element which the Buddha so often extolled calling it the wonderful and marvelous the peaceful purity the unsurpassed liberationAgain by taking this approach we can also venerate those who vow to follow the compassionate route of the bodhisattva and who make this vow as an act of supererogation not because it is a necessary condition for their own true deliveranceWe can revere and cherish their lovingkindness their great compassion their lofty aspirations and their selfsacrificial service to the worldTrue Buddhism needs all three Buddhas arahants and bodhisattvasIt needs Buddhas to discover and teach the path to liberation it needs arahants to follow the path and confirm that the Dharma does indeed lead to liberation adorning the teaching with examples of those who lead the purest holy life it needs bodhisattvas to bring forth the resolve to perfect those qualities that will enable them at some point in the future near or distant to become Buddhas themselves and once again turn the unsurpassed Wheel of the DharmaThese talks  except for the two marked otherwise  were originally given for the benefit of MrsPow Panga Vathanakul a follower of Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa who had contracted cancer of the bone marrow and had come to practice meditation at Wat Pa Baan Taad in order to contend with the pain of the disease and the fact of her approaching deathAll in all she stayed at Wat Pa Baan Taad for days from November to February during that period Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa gave impromptu talks for her benefit all of which were tape recordedAfter her death in September one of her friends MRSermsri Kasemsri asked permission of the Venerable Acariya to transcribe the talks and print them in book formSeventyseven of the talks plus an additional eight talks given on other occasions were thus printed in two massive volumes together totaling more than pagesSix talks from these two volumes have already been translated into English and published in a book entitled Amata DhammaThe talks in the present collection all deal with the practice of meditation and particularly with the development of discernmentBecause their style of presentation is personal and impromptu they will probably be best understood if read in conjunction with a more systematic introduction to the techniques of meditation such as the Venerable Acariyas own book Wisdom Develops Samadhi which is available separately or as part of the volume Forest DhammaThe title of the present book is taken from a request frequently made by the Venerable Acariya to his listeners that his teachings be taken to heart because they come straight from the heartThe Venerable Acariya Mun taught that all hearts have the same languageNo matter what ones language or nationality the heart has nothing but simple awareness which is why he said that all hearts have the same languageWhen a thought arises we understand it but when we put it into words it has to become this or that language so that we dont really understand one anotherThe feelings within the heart though are the same for everyoneThis is why the Dhamma fits the heart perfectly because the Dhamma isnt any particular languageThe Dhamma is the language of the heartThe Dhamma resides with the heartPleasure and pain reside with the heartThe acts that create pleasure and pain are thought up by the heartThe heart is what knows the results that appear as pleasure and pain and the heart is burdened with the outcome of its own thoughtsThis is why the heart and the Dhamma fit perfectlyNo matter what our language or nationality we can all understand the Dhamma because the heart and the Dhamma are a natural pairThe heart forms the core within the bodyIts the core the substance the primary essence within the bodyIts the basic foundationThe conditions that arise from the mind such as thoughtformations appear and vanish again and againHere Im referring to the rippling of the mindWhen the mind ripples thats the formation of a thoughtLabels which deal with conjecturing memorizing and recognizing are termed saññaLong thoughts are sañña short thoughts are sankharaIn other words when a thought forms  blip  thats a sankharaSañña refers to labeling and recognizingViññana refers to the act of taking note when anything external comes and makes contact with the senses as when visible forms make contact with the eye and cognition resultsAll of these things are constantly arising and vanishing of their own accord and so the Buddha called them khandhasEach heap or group is called a khandhaThese five heaps of khandhas are constantly arising and vanishing all the timeEven arahants have these same conditions  just like ordinary people everywhere  the only difference being that the arahants khandhas are khandhas pure and simple without any defilements giving them orders making them do this or think thatInstead their khandhas think out of their own free nature with nothing forcing them to think this or that unlike the minds of ordinary people in generalTo make a comparison the khandhas of ordinary people are like prisoners constantly being ordered aboutTheir various thoughts labels assumptions and interpretations have something that orders and forces them to appear making them think assume and interpret in this way or thatIn other words they have defilements as their boss their leader ordering them to appearArahants however dontWhen a thought forms it simply formsOnce it forms it simply disappearsTheres no seed to continue it no seed to weigh the mind down because theres nothing to force it unlike the khandhas governed by defilements or under the leadership of defilementsThis is where the difference liesBut their basic nature is the same All the khandhas we have mentioned are inconstantIn other words instability and changeability are a regular part of their nature beginning with the rupa khandha our body and the vedana khandha feelings of pleasure pain and indifferenceThese things appear and vanish again and againSañña sankhara and viññana are also always in a state of appearing and vanishing as a normal part of their natureBut as for actual awareness  which forms the basis of our knowledge of the various things that arise and vanish  that doesnt vanishWe can say that the mind cant vanishWe can say that the mind cant ariseA mind that has been purified thus has no more problems concerning the birth and death of the body and the khandhas and thus there is no more birth here and there appearing in crude forms such as individuals or as living beings for those whose minds have been purifiedBut those whose minds are not purified They are the ones who take birth and die setting their sights on cemeteries without end all because of this undying mindThis is why the Lord Buddha taught the world and in particular the world of human beings who know right and wrong good and evil who know how to foster the one and remedy the other who understand the language of the Dhamma he taughtThis is why he taught the human world above and beyond the other worlds so that we could try to remedy the things that are harmful and detrimental removing them from our thoughts words and deeds try to nourish and foster whatever goodness we might already have and give rise to whatever goodness we dont yet haveHe taught us to foster and develop the goodness we already have so as to nourish the heart giving it refreshment and wellbeing giving it a standard of quality or goodness so that when it leaves its present body to head for whatever place or level of being this mind that has been constantly nourished with goodness will be a good mindWherever it fares it will fare wellWherever it takes birth it will be born wellWherever it lives it will live wellIt will keep on experiencing wellbeing and happiness until it gains the capacity the potential the accumulation of merit it has developed progressively from the past into the present  in other words yesterday is todays past today is tomorrows past all of which are days in which we have fostered and developed goodness step by step  to the point where the mind has the firm strength and ability from the supporting power of this goodness that enables it to pass over and gain releaseSuch a mind has no more birth not even in the most quiet or refined levels of being that contain any latent traces of conventional reality  namely birth and death as we currently experience itSuch a mind goes completely beyond all such thingsHere Im referring to the minds of the Buddhas and of the arahantsTheres a story about VenVangisa that has a bearing on thisVenVangisa when he was a layman was very talented in divining the level of being in which the mind of a dead person was reborn  no matter who the person wasYou couldnt quite say he was a fortunetellerActually he was more a master of psychic skillsWhen anyone died he would take that persons skull and knock on it  knockknockknock focus his mind and then know that this person was reborn there that person was reborn hereIf the person was reborn in hell or in heaven as a common animal or a hungry ghost he could tell in every case without any hesitationAll he needed was to knock on the skullWhen he heard his friends say that the Buddha was many times more talented than this he wanted to expand on his knowledgeSo he went to the Buddhas presence to ask for further training in this scienceWhen he reached the Buddha the Buddha gave him the skull of an arahant to knock onAll right see if you can tell where he was rebornVenVangisa knocked on the skull and listenedHe knocked again and listenedHe thought for a momentHe focused his mindHe couldnt see where the owner of the skull was rebornAt his wits end he confessed frankly that he didnt know where the arahant was rebornAt first VenVangisa had thought himself talented and smart and had planned to challenge the Buddha before asking for further trainingBut when he reached the Buddha the Buddha gave him the skull of an arahant to knock on  and right there he was stymiedSo now he genuinely wanted further trainingOnce he had further training hed really be something specialThis being the way things stood he asked to study with the BuddhaSo the Buddha taught him the science taught him the method  in other words the science of the DhammaVenVangisa practiced and practiced until finally he attained arahantshipFrom then on he was no longer interested in knocking on anyones skull except for his ownOnce he had known clearly that was the end of the matterThis is called knocking on the right skullOnce the Buddha had brought up the topic of the mind that doesnt experience rebirth  the skull of one whose mind was purified  no matter how many times VenVangisa knocked on it he couldnt know where the mind was reborn even though he had been very talented before for the place of a pure minds rebirth cannot be foundThe same was true in the case of VenGodhika This story should serve as quite some food for thoughtVenGodhika went to practice meditation made progress step by step but then regressedThey say this happened six timesAfter the seventh time he took a razor to slash his throat  he was so depressed  but then came to his senses contemplated the Dhamma and became an arahant at the last minuteThats the story in briefWhen he died Maras hordes searched for his spiritTo put it simply they stirred up a storm but couldnt tell where he had been rebornSo the Lord Buddha said No matter how much you dig or search or investigate to find the spirit of our son Godhika who has completely finished his task you wont be able to find it  even if you turn the world upside down  because such a task lies beyond the scope of conventional reality How could they possibly find itIts beyond the capacity of people with defilements to know the power of an arahants mindIn the realm of convention there is no one who can trace the path of an arahants mind because an arahant lies beyond convention even though his is a mind just the sameThink about it Even our stumbling and crawling mind when it is continually cleansed without stop without ceasing without letting perseverance lag will gradually become more and more refined until it reaches the limit of refinementThen the refinement will disappear  because refinement is a matter of conventional reality  leaving a nature of solid gold or solid Dhamma called a pure mindWe too will then have no more problems just like the arahants because our mind will have become a superlative mind just like the minds of those who have already gained releaseAll minds of this sort are the same with no distinction between women and men which is simply a matter of sex or conventionWith the mind there is no distinction between women and men and thus both women and men have the same capacity in the area of the DhammaBoth are capable of attaining the various levels of Dhamma all the way to releaseThere are no restrictions that can be imposed in this areaAll that is needed is that we develop enough ability and potential and then we can all go beyondFor this reason we should all make an effort to train our hearts and mindsAt the very least we should get the mind to attain stillness and peace with any of the meditation themes that can lull it into a state of calm giving rise to peace and wellbeing within itFor example mindfulness of breathing which is one of the primary themes in meditation circles seems to suit the temperaments of more people than any other themeBut whatever the theme take it as a governing principle a refuge a mainstay for the mind putting it into practice within your own mind so as to attain rest and peaceWhen the mind begins to settle down we will begin to see its essential nature and worthWe will begin to see what the heart is and how it isIn other words when the mind gathers all of its currents into a single point as simple awareness within itself this is what is called the mindThe gathering in of the mind occurs on different levels corresponding to the minds ability and to the different stages of its refinementEven if the mind is still on a crude level we can nevertheless know it when it gathers inwardlyWhen the mind becomes more and more refined we will know its refinement  This mind is refined This mind is radiant This mind is extremely still This mind is something extremely amazing  more and more step by step this very same mindIn cleansing and training the mind for the sake of stillness in investigating probing and solving the problems of the mind with discernment  which is the way of making the mind progress or of enabling us to reach the truth of the mind step by step through the means already mentioned  no matter how crude the mind may be dont worry about itIf we get down to making the effort and persevere continually with what diligence and persistence we have that crudeness will gradually fade away and vanishRefinement will gradually appear through our own actions or our own striving until we are able to go beyond and gain release by slashing the defilements to bitsThis holds true for all of us men and women alikeBut while we arent yet able to do so we shouldnt be anxiousAll that is asked is that we make the mind principled so that it can be a refuge and a mainstay for itselfAs for this body weve been relying on it ever since the day we were bornThis is something we all can knowWeve made it live lie down urinate defecate work make a livingWeve used it and it has used usWe order it around and it orders us aroundFor instance weve made it work and it has made us suffer with aches here and pains there so that we have to search for medicine to treat itIts the one that hurts and its the one that searches for medicineIts the one that provides the meansAnd so we keep supporting each other back and forth in this wayIts hard to tell who is in charge the body or usWe can order it around part of the time but it orders us around all the timeIllness hunger thirst sleepiness These are all nothing but a heap of suffering and stress in which the body orders us around and orders us from every sideWe can order it around only a little bit so when the time is right for us to give the orders we should make it meditateSoGet to workAs long as the body is functioning normally then no matter how much or how heavy the work get right to itBut if the body isnt functioning normally if youre ill you need to be conscious of what it can takeAs for the mind though keep up the effort within unflaggingly because its your essential dutyYouve depended on the body for a long timeNow that its wearing down know that its wearing down  which parts still work which parts no longer workYoure the one in charge and you know it full well so make whatever compromises you shouldBut as for the heart which isnt ill along with the body it should step up its efforts within so that it wont lack the benefits it should gainMake the mind have standards and be principled  principled in its living principled in its dyingWherever its born make it have good principles and satisfactory standardsWhat they call merit wont betray your hopes or expectationsIt will provide you with satisfactory circumstances at all times in keeping with the fact that youve accumulated the merit  the wellbeing  that all the world wants and of which no one has enoughIn other words what the world wants is wellbeing whatever the sort and in particular the wellbeing of the mind that will arise step by step from having done things such as meditation which are noble and goodThis is the wellbeing that forms a core or an important essence within the heartWe should strive then while the body is still functioning for when life comes to an end nothing more can be doneNo matter how little or how much we have accomplished we must stop at that pointWe stop our work put it aside and then reap its rewards  there in the next lifeWhatever we should be capable of doing we doIf we can go beyond or gain release thats the end of every problemThere will then be nothing to involve us in any turmoilHere Ive been talking about the mind because the mind is the primary issueThat which will make us fare well or badly meet with pleasure or pain is nothing else but the mindAs for what they call bad kamma it lies within the mind that has made itWhether or not you can remember these seeds  which lie within the heart  cant be prevented from bearing fruit because they are rooted in the mindYou have to accept your kammaDont find fault with itOnce its done its done so how can you find fault with itThe hand writes and so the hand must eraseYou have to accept it like a good sportThis is the way it is with kamma until you can gain release  which will be the end of the problemThose who practice the Dhamma will begin to know the Dhamma or to gain a feel for the Dhamma in the area of meditation more markedly than in other areas and more extensivelyFor example the gratification that comes from being generous is moving in one way the gratification that comes from maintaining the precepts is moving in another way the feelings of gratification that come from the different forms of goodness are moving in their own separate waysThis is called finding gratification in skillfulnessBut all of these feelings of gratification converge in the practice of meditationWe begin to feel moved from the moment the mind begins to grow still when the heart gathers its currents together to stand solely on its ownEven though we may not yet obtain a great deal of stillness from the inward gathering of the mind we still find ourselves gratified within in a way we can clearly senseIf the mind or the Dhamma were a material object there wouldnt be anyone in the world who wouldnt respect the religion because the goodness the wellbeing and the marvels that arise from the religion and from the practicing in line with the teachings of the religion are things desired the world overGoodness wellbeing marvels These are things the world has always desired from time immemorial  with a desire that has never lost its taste  and they are things that will always be desired until the world loses its meaning or until people become extinct having no more sense of good and evilThats when the world will no longer aspire for these great blessingsThe wellbeing that comes from the marvels  the Dhamma in the area of its results  is something to which all living beings aspire simply that their abilities differ so that some attain their aspirations while others dontBut the Dhamma cant be displayed for the world to perceive with its senses of sight hearing smell taste or touch in the way other things canEven though there may be other immaterial phenomena similar to the Dhamma  such as smells  still they arent like the true Dhamma that is touched by the hearts of those who have practiced itIf the Dhamma could be displayed like material objects there is no doubt but that the human world would have to respect the religion for the sake of that DhammaThis is because the Dhamma is something more marvelous than anything elseIn all the three levels of existence there is no greater marvel than in the DhammaThe Dhamma can appear as a marvel conspicuous and clear in the mindThe mind is what knows it  and only the mindIt cant be displayed in general like material objects as when we take things out to admire or to show off to othersThe Dhamma cant possibly be displayed like material objectsThis is what makes the world lack interest  and lack the things that could be hoped from the Dhamma  in a way that is really a shameEven those who want the marvel of the Dhamma dont know what the marvel is or what the profundity of the Dhamma is because the mind has never had contact with that profundityThe eye has never had contact with the marvelThe ear has never obtained any marvel from the current of the Dhamma because the Dhamma cant be displayed as a current of sound as other things canThis is one obstacle that prevents people from becoming moved by the Dhamma that prevents them from fully believing and fully entrusting themselves to the Dhamma in a way consistent with the worlds longfelt hunger for wellbeing and prosperityEach of the Buddhas who has gained Awakening and taught the Dhamma to the world has had to reflect to the full extent of his intelligence and ability on the myriad ways of teaching the Dhamma to the world so that the world could see it as a marvel inasmuch as the Dhamma cant be put in shop windows or in public placesThis is because the true Dhamma lies in the heart and reveals itself only in words and deeds which doesnt excite a gratifying sense of absorption in the same way as touching the Dhamma directly with the heartBecause there is no way to display the Dhamma directly the Buddhas display it indirectly through teachingThey point out the causes  the Dhamma of conduct and practices leading to the Dhamma of results at this or that point or this or that level and at the same time they proclaim the results  the excellence the marvels of the stages and levels of the Dhamma that can be touched with the heart all the way to the highest marvel vimutti the mental release called nibbana within the heartEvery Buddha has to devise strategies in teaching the Dhamma so as to bring that marvel out to the world by using various modes of speech and conduct  for example describing the Dhamma and showing the conduct of the Dhamma as being like this and that  but the actual Dhamma cant be shownIt is something known exclusively in the heart in the way in which each Buddha and each arahant possesses this marvelNone of the Buddhas none of the arahants who possess this marvel are in any way deficient in this regardThe marvel lies in their hearts  simply that they cant take the marvel that appears there and display it in the full measure of its wonderThus they devise strategies for displaying it in their actions which are simply attributes of the Dhamma not the actual Dhamma itselfFor instance the doctrine they teach in the texts is simply an attribute of the DhammaTheir act of teaching is also just an attribute of the DhammaThe actual Dhamma is when a meditator or a person who listens to their teachings about the Dhamma follows the Dhamma in practice and touches it stage by stage within his or her own heartThis is called beginning to make contact with the actual Dhamma step by stepHowever much contact is made it gives a sense of gratification felt exclusively within the heart of the person who has gained that contact through his or her own practiceWhen it comes to ingenuity in teaching no one excels the BuddhasEven so they reveal only what they see as appropriate for humanityThey cant reveal the actual Dhamma  for example by taking out the true marvel in their hearts and unfolding it for the world to see saying This is the marvel of the Tathagata of each BuddhaDo you see it This cant be done for here were talking about the marvel of the purity of a heart that was previously swamped with defilement like a heap of assorted excrement but now has become a pure unsullied nature or a pure amazing nature because of the practice of constantly and relentlessly cleansing itThey cant show that Dhamma to the world saying Do you see thisLook at itLook at itFeast your eyes till theyre full and then strive to make this treasure your own So instead they teach by using various strategies for those who practice describing the path in full detail in terms both of causes and of resultsWhat they bring out to show is simply the current of their voices the breath of their mouthsThats what they bring out to speak simply the breath of their mouthsThey cant bring out the real thingFor example when they say Its marvelous like this its just soundThe marvelous nature itself cant be brought outAll they can bring out is the action of saying That nature is marvelous so that we can speculate for ourselves as to what that marvel is likeEven though this doesnt remove our doubts its better than if we had never heard about it at allBut the basic principle in making us come to know and see the marvel of the Dhamma is that first we have to speculate and then we follow with practiceThis qualifies as following the principles of the Dhamma the Buddha taught and this is fitting and properNo matter what the difficulties and hardships encountered in following the path we shouldnt let them form barriers to our progress because this is where the path liesThere are no other byways that can take us easily to the goalIf our practice is difficult we have to stick with itIf its painful we have to bear it because its a duty we have to perform a burden we have to carry while working so as to attain our aimsThe Dhamma of a pure mind is like this The mind is the Dhamma the Dhamma is the mindWe call it a mind only as long as it is still with the body and khandhasOnly then can we call it a pure mind the mind of a Buddha or the mind of an arahantAfter it passes from the body and khandhas there is no conventional reality to which it can be compared and so we cant call it anything at allNo matter how marvelous that nature no matter how much it may be ours there is no possible way we can use conventional realities to describe it or to make comparisons because that Dhamma that realm of release has no conventions against which to measure things or make comparisonsIts the same as if we were in outer space Which way is north which way is south we dont knowIf were on Earth we can say east west north and south because there are things that we can observe and compare so as to tell which direction lies which wayWe take the Earth as our standardHigh and low depend on the Earth as their frame of referenceHow much higher than this lower than this north of this south of this These things we can sayBut if were out in outer space there is no standard by which we can measure things and so we cant sayOr as when we go up in an airplane We cant tell how fast or how slow were goingWhen we pass a cloud we can tell that were going fast but if we depend simply on our eyesight were sure to think that the speed of the airplane is nowhere near the speed of a carWe can clearly see how deceptive our eyesight is in just this wayWhen we ride in a car the trees on both sides of the road look as if they were falling in together down on the road behind usActually they stay their separate selvesIts simply that the car runs past themSince there are things that we sense that lie close enough for comparison it seems as if the car were going really fastAs for the airplane theres nothing to make comparisons with so it looks as if the plane were dawdling along as if it were going slower than a car even though its actually many times fasterThis is how it is when we compare the mind of an ordinary runofthemill person with the mind of the BuddhaWhatever the Buddha says is good and excellent we ordinary people tend to say that its notWhatever we like no matter how vile we say that its goodWe dont admit the truth in the same way as thinking that a car goes faster than an airplaneThe practice of attending to the mind is something very importantTry to develop mindfulness and discernment so that they can keep up with the things that come and entangle the mindBy and large the heart itself is the instigator creating trouble continually relentlesslyWe then fall for the preoccupations the heart turns out  and this makes us agitated upset and saddened all because of the thoughts formed by the heartThese come from the heart itself and the heart itself is what falls for them saying that this is this and that is that even though the things it names this and that merely exist in line with their natureThey have no meaning in and of themselves that they are like this or that The mind simply gives them meanings and then falls for its own meanings making itself glad or sad over those things without endThus the stress and suffering that result from thoughtformations have no end no point of resolution just as if we were floating adrift in the middle of the sea waiting to breathe our last breathThe Buddhas all reached Awakening here in this human world because the human world is rich in the Noble TruthsIts where they are plain to seeThe Noble Truth of stress lies in the human bodyHuman beings know about stress  because theyre smarter than common animalsThe Noble Truth of the origin of stress This lies in the human heartThe Noble Truth of the path  the path of practice to cure defilement craving and mental effluents which are the things that produce stress This human beings also knowWhat is the pathTo put it briefly virtue concentration and discernmentThese things human beings know and can put into practiceThe Noble Truth of the cessation of stress This human beings also knowNo matter which of these truths all human beings know them  although they may not know how to behave toward them or take interest in behaving in line with them in which case there is no way the Dhamma can help them at allThe Buddhas thus taught the Dhamma in the human world because the human world lies in the center of all the levels of existenceWe have been born in the center of existence in the midst of the religionWe should conform correctly to the central point of the religion so as to comprehend the religions teachings that lie in the center of our heartThe superlative Dhamma lies right hereIt doesnt lie anywhere elseThe mind is what can reach the DhammaThe mind is what knows all dhammasThe affairs of the Dhamma then do not lie beyond the mind which is a fitting vessel for themGood evil pleasure pain The mind knows these things before anything else knows them so we should develop mindfulness and discernment to be resourceful to keep up with the events that are always becoming involved with the mind in the course of each dayIf were intent on investigating the origin of stress which fans out from our various thoughtformations we will find that it arises without stopIt arises right here in the mindIts fashioned right hereEven though we try to make it quiet it wont be stillWhyBecause of the unquietness the thoughts with which the mind disturbs itself which it forms and sends out towards its preoccupations all the timeOnce the mind sends out its thoughts it then gathers in stress for itselfIt keeps at it in and out like thisWhat goes out is the origin of stress and what comes back in is stressIn other words thoughts form and go out as the origin of stress and when the results come back to the heart theyre stressfulThese things are constantly being manufactured like this all the timeWhen we want the mind to have even just a little bit of calm we really have to force it and even then these things still manage to drive the mind into forming thoughts whenever we let down our guardThis is how it is with the origin of stress which is constantly producing sufferingIt lies in the heart and is always arisingFor this reason we must use mindfulness and discernment to diagnose and remedy the origin of stress to keep an eye out for it and to snuff it out right there without being negligentWherever we sit or stand  whatever our activity  we keep watch over this point with mindfulness alert to it and discernment unraveling it so as to know it constantly for what it truly isAll those who practice to remove defilement practice in this wayIn particular those who are ordained practice by going into the forest to look for a place conducive to their striving in order to wipe out this very enemyEven when they stay in inhabited areas or wherever they go wherever they stay they keep their attention focused continually step by step on the persistent effort to remove and demolish the origin of stress which is a splinter a thorn in the heartSuch people are bound to develop more and more ease and wellbeing step by step in proportion to the persistence of their strivingWe can see clearly when the mind is still and settles down Thoughtformations are still or dont existTurmoil and disturbances dont occurThe stress that would otherwise result doesnt appearWhen the mind is quiet stress is also quietWhen thoughtformations are quiet the origin of stress is also quietStress is also quietAll that remains at that moment is a feeling of peace and easeThe war between the mind and the defilements causing stress is like thisWe have to keep fighting with persistenceWe have to use mindfulness and discernment conviction and persistence to contend with the war that disturbs and ravages the mind making it stagger and reel withinThe disturbances will then gradually be suppressedEven when there is only a moment of quiet we will come to see the harm of the thoughtformations that are constantly disturbing usAt the same time we will see the benefits of mental stillness  that its a genuine pleasureWhether there is a lot of stillness or a little pleasure arises in proportion to the foundation of stillness or the strength of the stillness which in the texts is called samadhi or concentrationA mind centered and still is called a mind in concentration or a mind gathered in concentrationThis is what genuine concentration is like inside the heartThe names of the various stages of concentration are everywhere but actual concentration is inside the heartThe heart is what gives rise to concentrationIt produces it makes it on its ownWhen concentration is still the mind experiences cool respite and pleasureIt has its own foundation set firmly and solidly withinIts as if we were under an eave or under the cooling shade of a treeWere comfortable when it rains were comfortable when the sun is out because we dont have to be exposed to the sun and rainThe same holds true with a mind that has an inner foundation of stillness Its not affected by this preoccupation or that which would otherwise disturb and entangle it repeatedly without respiteThis is because stillness is the hearts dwelling  concentration which is one level of home for the heartDiscernment is ingenuity sound judgment evaluating causes and effects within and without above below and in between  inside the body  all the way to the currents of the mind that send out thoughts from various anglesMindfulness and discernment keep track of these things investigating and evaluating them so as to know causes and effects in terms of the hearts thoughtformations or in terms of the nature of sankhara within us until we see the truth of each of these thingsDont go investigating these things off target by being clever with labels and interpretations that go against the truth  because in the investigation of phenomena we investigate in line with the truthWe dont resist the truth for that would simply enhance the defilements causing stress at the very moment we think were investigating phenomena so as to remove themBirth we have already experiencedAs for old age weve been growing old from the day of our birth older and older step by stepWhatever our age thats how long weve been growing old until we reach the end of lifeWhen were old to the nth degree we fall apartIn other words weve been growing old from the moment of birth  older by the day the month the year  older and older continuallyWe call it growing up but actually its growing oldSeeInvestigate it for what it really isThis is the great highway  the way of natureDont resist itFor example the body is growing old but we dont want it to be oldWe want it always to be youngThis is called resisting the truth  which is stressEven when we try to resist it we dont get anywhereWhat do we hope to gain by resisting it and creating stress for ourselvesActually we gain nothing but the stress that comes from resisting the truthUse discernment to investigate just like thisWhenever pain arises in any part of the body if we have medicine to treat it then we treat itWhen the medicine can take care of it the body recoversWhen the medicine cant it diesIt goes on its ownTheres no need for us to force it not to die or to stay alive for soandso many years for that would be an absurdityEven if we forced it it wouldnt stayWe wouldnt get any results and would just be wearing ourselves out in vainThe body has to follow its own natural principlesWhen we investigate in line with its truth this way we can be at our easeWherever theres pain keep aware of it continually in line with its truthWhether it hurts a lot or a little keep aware of its manifestations until it reaches the ultimate point of pain  the death of the body  and thats as far as it goesKnow it in line with its truthDont resist itDont set up any desires because the setting up of desire is a deficiency a hungerAnd hunger no matter when or what the sort is pain Hunger for sleep is pain hunger for food is pain hunger for water is painWhen was it ever a good thingThe hunger the desires that arise wanting things to be like this wanting them to be like that These are all nothing but disturbances issues that give rise to stress and painThis is why the Buddha doesnt have us resist the truthUse your discernment to investigate to contemplate in line with the natural principles of things as they already areThis is called discernment that doesnt fly in the face of truth  and the heart can then be at easeWe study the four Noble Truths here in our bodyIn other words we study birth aging illness and death all of which lie in this single heap of elements without ever leaving itBirth is an affair of these elementsGrowing up or growing old its old right hereWhen theres illness it manages to be ill right here in one part or anotherWhen death comes it dies right hereSo we have to study right here  where else would we studyWe have to study and know the things that involve us directly before we study anything elseWe have to study them comprehensively and to completion  studying our own birth our aging our illness and pain and completing our study of our own deathThats when well be wise  wise to all the events around usPeople who know the Dhamma through practicing so that they are wise to the events that occur to themselves do not flinch in the face of any of the conventional realities of the world at allThis is how it is when we study the Dhamma when we know and see the Dhamma in the area of the heart  in other words when we know rightly and wellMindfulness and discernment that are wise all around themselves are wise in this way not wise simply from being able to rememberThey have to be wise in curing doubt in curing the recalcitrance of the heart as well as in curing their own attachments and false assumptions so as to leave only a nature that is pure and simpleThats when well be really at ease really relievedLet the khandhas be khandhas pure and simple in their own way without our messing with them without our struggling with them for power without our forcing or coercing them to be like this or like thatThe khandhas are then khandhas the mind is then the mind each with its own separate reality each not infringing on the others as it used toEach performs its own dutiesThis is called khandhas pure and simple the mind pure and simple without any conventional realities adulterating themWhat knows is what knows the elements are elements the khandhas are khandhasWhatever things may break apart let them break apartWe have already known them clearly with our discernmentWe have no doubtsWeve known them in advance even before they die so when death comes what doubts can we have especially now that they display the truth of their nature for us to see clearlyThis is called studying the Dhamma practicing the DhammaTo study and practice this way is to follow the same way that sages have practiced and known before usAll of these conditions are matters of conventional reality  matters of the elements the khandhas or the sense mediaThe four khandhas the five khandhas whatever are individual conditions individual conditions that are separated in line with conventionsDiscernment is also a condition and mindfulness another condition  conditions of the heart  but theyre Dhamma means of curing the mind that is clouded and obscured means of washing away the things that cloud and obscure it until radiance appears through the power of the discernment that cleanses the heartOnce the heart is radiant in the next step it becomes pureWhy is it pureBecause all impurities have fallen away from itThe various misconstruings that are an affair of defilement are all gone from the heart so the heart is pureThis pure heart means that we have completed our study of ourselves in line with the statement of the teachingvusitam brahmacariyam katam karaniyamThe task of the religion is done the holy life is complete there is no further task to be doneWhen the tasks we have had to do  abandoning and striving  are done to completion we know right here because delusion lay right here in the heartWe study and practice simply to cure our own delusionOnce we know right here and delusion is gone what else is there to know for beyond this there is nothing further to knowWhat else is there for us to be deluded aboutWere no longer deluded because we know fully all aroundThis very state of mind When at the beginning I referred to the superlative Dhamma the marvelous Dhamma I was referring to this very state of mind this very Dhamma  but its something known exclusively within itself and exists only within itselfIts marvelous  this we know within our own mindIts superlative  this we also know within our own mindWe cant take it out or unfurl it like other things for other people to seeSo if you want to have any Noble Treasures to show for yourself practiceRemove all those dirty stains from the heart and the superlative things I have mentioned will appear by their own nature  in other words they will appear in the mindThis is called completing your study of the Dhamma and your study of the world is completed right hereThe world means the world of elements the world of the khandhas that lie right here with each of us which are more important than the worlds of elements and khandhas belonging to other people because this world of elements and khandhas lies with us and has been weighing on the heart all alongWhen we have studied the Dhamma to the attainment of release thats all there is to studyWeve studied the world to completion and studied the Dhamma in fullOur doubts are gone and there is nothing that will ever make us doubt againAs the Buddha exclaimed When dhammas become apparent to the Brahman earnest and absorbed doubt comes to an end because the conditions the factors for continued being and birth come to an endOnce we have reached this level we can live wherever we likeThe war is ended  the war between the mind and defilement or the war between Dhamma and defilement is overThis is where we dismantle being and birthThis is where we dismantle the heap of suffering in the round of rebirth  right here in the heartSince the heart is the wanderer through the cycle of rebirth we have to dismantle things right here to know them right hereOnce we know thats the end of all problems right hereIn this whole wide world there are no problemsThe only problem was the issue of the heart that was deluded about itself and about the things that became involved with itNow that it has completely rectified the way it is involved with things there is nothing left  and thats the end of the problemFrom this point on there are no more problems to trouble the heart until the day of its total nibbanaThis is how the Dhamma is studied to completionThe world  the world of elements and khandhas  is studied to completion right hereSo keep striving in order to see the marvel described at the beginning which was described in line with the truth with no aspect to invite any doubtThe Buddha and the Noble Disciples have Dhamma filling their hearts to the brimYou are a disciple of the Tathagata with a mind that can be made to show its marvelousness through the practice of making it pure just like the Buddha and the Noble DisciplesSo try to make it still and radiant because the heart has long lain buried in the mudAs soon as you can see the harm of the mud and grow tired of it you should urgently wake up take notice and exert yourself till you can manage to make your way freeNibbana is holding its hand out waiting for youArent you going to come outRebelliousness is simply distractionThe end of rebelliousness is stillnessWhen the heart is still its at easeIf its not still its as hot as fireWherever you are everything is hot and troubledOnce it is still then its cool and peaceful wherever you are  cool right here in the heartSo make the heart cool with the practice because the heat and trouble lie with the heartThe heat of fire is one thing but the heat of a troubled heart is hotter than fireTry to put out the fires of defilement craving and mental effluents burning here in the heart so that only the phenomenon of genuine Dhamma remainsThen you will be cool and at peace everywhere and alwaysAnd so Ill ask to stop hereOur mind if we were to make a comparison with the world is a perpetual prisoner like a person born in jail who lives in jail behind bars with no chance to get out to see the outside world  someone who has grown from childhood to adulthood entirely in a prison cell and so doesnt know what there is outside someone who has seen pleasure and pain only in the prison and has never been out to see what kind of pleasure comfort and freedom they have in the outside worldWe have no way of knowing what kind of happiness and enjoyment they have there in the outside world how they come and go how they live because we are kept in prison from the day we are born until the day we dieThis is a comparison an analogyWe have only the pleasure and pain that the prison has to offer with nothing special nothing obtained from the outside world so that when it enters the prison we could see that This is something different from the prison world  this is from the outside world outside the prison so that we could make comparisons and know that This is like this that is like that this is better than that that is better than this There is nothing but the affairs of the prisonHowever much the pleasure and pain however great the deprivations the difficulties the oppression and coercion thats simply the way its been all along from the very beginning  and so we dont know where to look for a way out or how to free ourselvesWe dont even know where the outside world is because we have seen only the inside world the prison where we have always been locked away oppressed starved beaten tortured deprivedEven our bedding food belongings  everything of every sort  is like that of a prisoner in jailAnd yet people like this can still live this way because they have never seen enough of the outside world to be able to make comparisons as to which is better which is more pleasant in order to feel inclined to search for a way out to the outside worldA mind controlled by the power of defilement and mental effluents is like thisIt has been imprisoned by various kinds of defilement for aeons and aeonsFor example in our present lifetime the defilements that hold sway over the hearts of living beings have been with us since the day of our birthThey have kept us in continual custody never giving us any freedom within ourselves at allFor this reason we have difficulty imagining what sort of pleasure there could be above and beyond the way things are just like a person who was born and has always lived in a prisonWhat sort of world is the world outsideIs it a good place to visitA good place to liveThe Dhamma proclaims it loud and clear but hardly anyone is interestedStill there are fortunately some places where some people are interestedIn places where no one proclaims it where no one speaks of what the outside world  a mind with Dhamma in charge  is like no one knows what the teachings of the religion are likeNo one knows what the happiness that comes from the Dhamma is likeSuch people are so surrounded by darkness so completely drowned in attachment that not even a single limb shows above the surface because there is no religion to pull them outIts as if the outside world didnt existThey have nothing but the prison the defilements holding the heart in custodyBorn in this world they have only the prison as their place to live and to dieA mind that has never known what could give it greater pleasure comfort and freedom than it has at present if we were to make a different comparison is like a duck playing in a mud puddle under a shantyIt keeps playing there splat splat splat splat splatNo matter how dirty or filthy it is its content to play because it has never seen the water of the ocean of a river of a lake or a pond large enough for it to swim and immerse its entire body with easeIt has known only the mud puddle that lies stagnant under the shanty into which things in the shanty get washed downAnd so it plays there thinking its fun swimming happily in its way  whyBecause it has never seen water wider or deeper than that enough to give it more enjoyment in coming and going or swimming around than it can find in the mud puddle under the shantyAs for ducks that live along broad deep canals theyre very different from the duck under the shantyThey really enjoy themselves along rivers lakes canals and pondsWherever their owner herds them there they go  crossing back and forth over highways and byways spreading in flocks of hundreds and thousandsEven ducks like these have their happinessWhat do they stand forThey stand for the mindA mind that has never seen the pleasure the comfort the enjoyment that comes from the Dhamma is like the duck playing in the mud puddle under the shanty or those that enjoy swimming in canals rivers or lakesWe at present have our pleasure and happiness through the controlling power of the defilements which is like the happiness of prisoners in jailWhen the mind receives training from the outside world  meaning the Dhamma that comes from the transcendent Dhammas from the land of nibbana on down level by level to the human world revealing every level every realm  we find that those of us who are inclined who are interested in the outside world in happiness greater than that which exists at present still existWhen we hear the Dhamma step by step or read books about the outside world  about Dhamma about releasing ourselves from the pain and suffering we are forced to undergo within our hearts  our minds feel pleasure and enjoymentInterestA desire to listenA desire to practice so as to reap the results step by stepThis is where we begin to see the influence of the outside world making itself feltThe heart begins to exert itself trying to free itself from the tyranny and oppression from within like that of a prisoner in jailEven more so when we practice in the area of the mind The more peace we obtain then the greater the effort the greater the exertion we makeMindfulness and discernment gradually appearWe see the harm of the tyranny and the oppression imposed by the defilements in the heartWe see the value of the Dhamma which is a means of liberationThe more it frees us the more ease we feel in the heartRespiteReliefThis then is a means of increasing our conviction in ascending stages and of increasing our effort and stamina in its wakeThe mindfulness and discernment that used to lie buried in the mud gradually revive and awaken and begin to contemplate and investigateIn the past no matter what assaulted us by way of the eye ear nose tongue body or mind we were like dead peopleWe held these things to be ordinary and normalThey never provoked our mindfulness and discernment to investigate and explore searching for beginnings and ends causes and effectsEven though these things had been our enemies for a long long time making their assaults both day and night we were never interestedNow however we develop an interestWhen the heart begins to enter the current of the Dhamma in which it has been trained to the point of developing a basis for mindfulness and discernment step by step it is bound to see clearly both what is beneficial and what is harmful because these things dwell together  benefits and harm  within this heartThe mind develops agility in contemplating and investigatingThe heart develops boldness in its explorationsSeeing harm it tries to remedy itSeeing benefits it tries to open the way for them it tries to foster them in ascending stagesThis is called the mind gradually gaining release from tyranny and oppression  the prison  withinAt the same time it is gaining a view of the outside world seeing what sort of world it is seeing whether its like the prison that exists at presentOur eyes can see the outside world to some extent can see how those in the outside world live how they come and go  and what about us in the prisonWhat is it like to live overcome by defilementsHow does the mind feel as we gain gradual relief from the defilementsWe can begin to make comparisonsNow at last we have an outside world and an inside world to compareThe happiness and ease that come from removing however many of the defilements we can remove appearThe stress that continues as long as the remaining defilements still exert their influence we know clearlyWe see their harm with our discernment on its various levels and we try continually to remedy the situation without letting our persistence lapseThis is when mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence stir themselves out to the front lines when we see both the outside world  however much we have been able to liberate the heart from defilement  and the inside world where the defilements keep up their oppression and coercionBefore we never knew what to use for comparisons because we had never seen anything other than thisBecause we were born buried in pain and suffering this way no pleasure from the outside world  from the Dhamma  ever appeared to usWhat did appear was the kind of happiness that had suffering behind the scenes waiting to stomp in and obliterate that happiness without giving a moments noticeNow however we are beginning to know and seeWe see the happiness of the outside that is of the outside world of those who have Dhamma reigning in their hearts and we see the happiness inside the prison the happiness that lies under the influence of defilementWe also see the suffering and stress that lie under the influence of defilementWe know this all clearly with our own mindfulness and discernmentThe happiness that comes from the outside world  in other words from the current of the Dhamma seeping deep into the heart  we begin to see step by step enough to make comparisonsWe see the outside world the inside world their benefits and drawbacksWhen we take them and compare them we gain an ever greater understanding  plus greater persistence greater stamina  to the point that when anything connected with defilement that used to tyrannize and oppress the mind passes our way we immediately feel called upon to tackle it remedy it strip it away and demolish it step by step through the power of mindfulness and discernment backed by persistent effortThe mind will set itself spinningWhen its awareness of harm is great its appreciation of what is beneficial is also greatWhen the desire to know and see the Dhamma is great when the desire to gain release is great persistence will have to become greater in their wakeStamina and resilience will also come in their wake because they all exist in the same heartWhen we see harm the entire heart is what sees itWhen we see benefits the entire heart is what seesWhen we try to make our way with various methods in line with our abilities its an affair of the entire heart making the effort to free itselfThis is why these things such as persistence that are the minds tools the minds support come togetherFor example saddha conviction in the paths and their fruitions conviction in the realm beyond suffering and stress viriya persistence perseverance in gaining release for oneself step by step khanti stamina endurance in order to be unyielding in passing over and beyond All of these things come togetherMindfulness and discernment contemplating along the way seeing what is right and what is wrong will come in their wakeIf we were to speak in terms of the principles of the formal Dhamma as expressed by the Buddha this is called the path converging gradually gathering itself into this single heartEverything comes together Right View Right Resolve Right Speech Right Action all the way to Right Concentration all come gathering into this single heartThey dont go anywhere elseRight Action Our only right undertakings are sitting and walking meditation because we have reached the stage of precision work where the heart gathers togetherThe mind is in a state of the path converging  gathering itself into a single heartRight View Right Resolve These refer to the concerns of discernment always exploring the affairs of the elements the khandhas whatever appears or makes contact arises and vanishes whether good or evil past or future appearing in the heartMindfulness and discernment slash these things to bits step by step without bothering to waste timeRight Action On the level of the body this refers to doing sitting and walking meditation making the effort to abandon the defilements no matter what our postureOn the level of the heart this refers to persistence within the mindRight Speech We speak only of the DhammaOur conversation deals only with the topics of effacement topics of polishing away or washing away defilements and mental effluents from the heart telling what methods we can use that will utterly end the defilements This is Right SpeechRight Livelihood When the heart feeds on any object thats its enemy this is called maintaining a wrong livelihoodSince the object is an enemy of the heart the heart will have to be cloudedTheres nothing good about it at allIt has to lead to greater or lesser amounts of suffering and stress within the heart in proportion to the hearts crudeness or refinementThis is called poisonWrong livelihoodWe have to correct it immediatelyImmediatelyAny mental object thats rightful that leads to happiness wellbeing and ease is a fitting preoccupation a fitting food for the heart providing it with peace and wellbeingThis is how Right Livelihood is maintained with Dhamma on the ascending levels of training the heartAs for Right Livelihood on the physical level dealing with food or alms that applies universally for Buddhists in general to conduct themselves in line with their personal dutiesRight Effort What sort of effortThis we knowThe Buddha taught four kinds of effort Try to be careful not to let evil arise within yourselfTry to abandon evil that has already arisenIn being careful not to let evil arise we have to be careful by being mindfulUsing mindfulness in trying not to let evil arise means being alert to the mind that thinks and wanders about gathering suffering and stress into itselfThis is because thoughtformations of the wrong sort are the origin of stress and so we should be careful to guard against themDont be careless or complacentTry to develop what is skillful  intelligence  so as to increase it step by stepTry to safeguard the skillful things that have arisen so as to develop them even further and not let them deteriorateAll of these right exertions apply right within usRight Mindfulness keeps watch over the heartMindfulness and selfawareness keep constant track of its behavior and activitiesWhatever makes contact by way of the eye ear nose tongue or body if it doesnt go into the heart where does it goThe heart is an enormous place always ready to be informed of various things both good and evilDiscernment is what contemplates and deliberatesMindfulness is what keeps vigilant inspecting whatever comes in to engage the heartWhatever the preoccupation good or evil mindfulness and discernment contemplate and are selective of what engages the heartWhatever they see as improper the mind will reject immediatelyImmediatelyDiscernment is what makes the rejectionRight Concentration Our work for the sake of making the defilements quiet through concentration is steady and constant to the point where the results appear as peace and calm in the heart as a true place of rest without any distractions coming in to disturb the heart at that momentWhen entering concentration so as to relax the mind in order to give strength to discernment in its continuing explorations you should go ahead and really rest  rest in concentrationEnter the calmCompletely stop all thoughts and explorations in the area of discernmentLet the mind settle in and relaxIt doesnt have to think or contrive anything at all related to its workLet the mind rest comfortably by giving it a single preoccupationIf the mind happens to be extremely engrossed in its investigations so that you cant rein it in use buddho as a means to drag it inMake the mind stay with buddho buddho buddho Even though the meditation word buddho may be a mental contrivance its a contrivance in a single focal ideaContriving a single focal idea can cause the mind to settle downFor example if while we are repeating buddho buddho buddho the mind flashes back to its work because it is engrossed in its unfinished business we should repeat the meditation word even faster so as not to let the mind go back to its workIn other words when the mind is at the stage where it is engrossed in its work we could say  to put it in worldly terms  that we cant let down our guard although on this level its hard to say that the mind lets down its guardTo get nearer the truth we should say that we cant loosen our gripTo put it simply we cant loosen our gripOtherwise the mind will jump back out to workSo at this point we have to be firm with our meditation wordForce the mind to stay with its single preoccupation  buddho  as a means of reining the mind inRepeat buddho buddho buddho in really close frequency then buddho and the mind will become oneThe heart will be firm and calm down calm down relaxing relaxing setting aside all its workThe mind will become cool and peacefulThis is Right ConcentrationWhen the time comes to rest you have to rest like this for it to qualify as Right ConcentrationWhen youve had enough when you see that the mind has regained strength then simply let go  thats all  and the mind will spring immediately back to workIt springs out of oneness of having a single preoccupation and returns to being two with its workAt this point the heart gets back to work without worrying about concentration while it is workingIn the same way when centering the mind for the sake of stillness you dont have to worry about your work at allWhen resting you have to rest in the same way that when eating you dont have to do any work at all except for the work of eatingWhen sleeping sleep peacefullyYou shouldnt be concerned with any work at allBut once you have begun work you shouldnt concern yourself with eating and sleepingReally set your mind on your workThis is called doing a solid piece of work work in its proper phases work at the proper time in keeping with events Right Action work that doesnt overstep its boundaries appropriate workThe practice of centering the mind is something you cant neglectIn practicing for the sake of the hearts happiness the view that centering the mind keeping still serves no purpose is wrongIf someone is addicted to concentration unwilling to come out and work thats improper and should be criticized so that he or she will get down to workBut once the mind has become engrossed in its work concentration is a necessity in certain areas at certain timesOrdinarily if we work without resting or sleeping we ultimately cant continue with our workEven though some of our money gets used up when we eat let it be used up  because the result is that our body gains strength from eating and can return to its work in line with its dutiesEven though money gets used up and the food we eat gets used up still its used up for a purpose for energy in the bodyWhatever gets consumed let it be consumed because it doesnt hurt our purposesIf we dont eat where are we going to get any strengthWhatever gets spent let it be spent for the sake of strength for the sake of giving rise to strengthThe same holds true with resting in concentration When were resting so as to give rise to stillness the stillness is the strength of mind that can reinforce discernment and make it agileWe have to rest so as to have stillnessIf there is no stillness if theres nothing but discernment running its like a knife that hasnt been sharpenedWe keep chopping away  chock chock chock  but its hard to tell whether were using the edge of the blade or the backWe simply have the desire to know to see to understand to uproot defilement whereas discernment hasnt been sharpened by resting in stillness  the reinforcement that gives peace and strength in the heart  and so its like a knife that hasnt been sharpenedWhatever gets chopped doesnt cut through easilyIts a simple waste of energySo for the sake of whats fitting while resting the mind in its home of concentration we have to let it restResting is thus like using a whetstone to sharpen discernmentResting the body strengthens the body and in the same way resting the mind strengthens the mindWhen it comes out this time now that it has strength its like a knife that has been sharpenedThe object is the same old object the discernment is the same old discernment the person investigating is the same old person but once we focus our examination it cuts right throughThis time its like a person who has rested slept and eaten at his leisure and whose knife is fully sharpenedHe chops the same old piece of wood hes the same old person and its the same old knife but it cuts right through with no trouble at all  because the knife is sharp and the person has strengthIn the same way the object is the same old object the discernment is the same old discernment the person practicing is the same old person but weve been sharpenedThe mind has strength as a reinforcement for discernment and so things cut right through in no time at all  a big difference from when we hadnt rested in concentrationThus concentration and discernment are interrelatedThey simply do their work at different timesWhen the time comes to center the mind center itWhen the time comes to investigate in the area of discernment give it your all  your full alertness your full strengthGet to the full Dhamma the full causes and the full effectsIn the same way when resting give it a full restPractice these things at separate timesDont let them interfere with each other  being worried about concentration when examining with discernment or being preoccupied with the affairs of discernment when entering concentration  for that would be wrongWhichever work youre going to do really make it a solid piece of workThis is the right way the appropriate way  the way Right Concentration really isOnce discernment has begun uprooting defilements step by step the heart develops brightnessThe lightness of the mind is one of the benefits that come from removing the things that are hazardous the things that are filthyWe see the value of this benefit and keep on investigatingWhat defilement is is a weight on the heartOur mind is like a prisoner constantly overpowered  coerced and tormented  by defilements and mental effluents ever since we were bornWhen we come right down to it where is defilementWhere is being and birthRight here in this same heartWhen you investigate these things gather in gather in and enter this single heartThe cycle of rebirth doesnt refer to anything else It refers to this single heart that spins in circlesIts the only thing that leads us to birth and deathWhyBecause the seeds of these things are in the heartWhen we use mindfulness and discernment to investigate we explore so as to see clearly and we keep cutting in step by step until we reach the mind that is the culprit harboring unawareness which is the important seed of the cycle in the heartWe keep dissecting keep investigating in investigating in so that there is nothing left of this is this or that is that We focus our investigation on the mind in the same way as we have done with phenomena in generalNo matter how much brightness there may be in the heart we should know that its simply a place for the heart to rest temporarily as long as we are still unable to investigate it to the point where we can disperse and destroy itBut dont forget that this shining star of a heart is actually unawarenessSo investigate taking that as the focal point of your investigationSo thenIf this is going to be obliterated until theres no more awareness leaving nothing at all  to the point where the knower is destroyed along with it  then lets find out once and for allWere investigating to find the truth to know the truth so we have to get all the way down to causes and effects to the truth of everything of every sortWhatever is going to be destroyed let it be destroyedEven if ultimately the knower who is investigating will be destroyed as well then lets find out with our mindfulness and discernmentWe dont have to leave anything remaining as an island or a vantage point to deceive ourselvesWhatever is us whatever is ours dont leave it standingInvestigate down to the truth of all things togetherWhats left after the defilement of unawareness is absolutely destroyed is something beyond the range to which convention can reach or destroyThis is called the pure mind or purityThe nature of this purity cannot be destroyed by anything at allDefilements are conventional realities that can arise and vanishThus they can be cleansed made to increase made to decrease made to disappear because they are an affair of conventionsBut the mind pure and simple  the phenomenon called a released mind  lies beyond the range to which any defilements which are all conventions can reach and destroyIf the mind isnt yet pure its a conventional reality just like other things because conventional things have infiltrated itOnce they are entirely removed the phenomenon of release is one that no defilement can any longer affect  because it lies beyond rangeSo what is destroyedStress stops because the cause of stress stopsNirodha  the cessation of stress  also stopsThe path the tool that wipes out the cause of stress also stopsThe four Noble Truths all stop togetherStress stops the cause of stress stops the path stops the cessation of stress stopsBut listenWhat knows that that stops is not a Noble TruthIt lies above the Noble TruthsThe investigation of the Noble Truths is an investigation for the sake of thisOnce we reach the real thing the four Noble Truths have no more role to play no need to be cleansed remedied or removedFor example discernment Now that weve worked to the full extent we can let go of discernment with no need to set rules for itBoth mindfulness and discernment are tools in the battleOnce the war is over the enemy is wiped out so these qualities are no longer at issueWhats leftPurityThe Buddha in proclaiming the Dhamma to the world took it from this pure natureThe doctrines of the religion came from this nature and in the approach he used in teaching he had to teach about stress because these conditions are directly related to this mindHe taught us to know how to remedy how to stop how to strive  everything of every sort  all the way to the goal at the end of the path after which nothing more need be saidThis is purityThe mind has come out to the outside worldIt has left the prison and come to the outside world  freedom  never to be imprisoned againBut no one wants to go to this world because they have never seen itThis is an important world  lokuttara the transcendent a realm higher than other worlds  but we simply call it the outside world outside of all conventionsWe call it a world just as a figure of speech because our world has its conventions and so we simply talk about it that wayThink about escaping from this prisonYouve been born in prison live in prison and die in prisonYouve never once died outside of prisonSo for once get your heart out of prisonYoull be really comfortable  really comfortable like the Buddha and his Noble Disciples They were born in prison like you but they died outside of the prisonThey died outside of the worldThey didnt die in this world thats so narrow and confiningIll ask to stop herePeople come with questions  some of which I can remember  and everyone has the question thats waiting right at the barn door Is there a next world after deathThe next world who goes on to the next world These sorts of things arent any one persons issueTheyre an issue for all of us who are carrying a burdenWhen people ask this sort of question I ask them in return Was there a yesterdayWas there a this morningIs there a present at this moment They admit that there was and isThen will there be a tomorrowA day after tomorrowA this monthA next monthA this yearA next year and years after thatThings in the past that we can remember we can use to make guesses about the futureEven for things that havent yet happened we can make comparisons with things that have already occurredThe future has to follow the way things have been in the pastFor example yesterday has already occurred today is occurringThese things have followed one after the otherWe know this we remember we havent forgottenThis afternoon this evening tonight tomorrow morning Weve already seen that things have been like thisThis is the way things have happened without being otherwise and so we accept that this is the way they will continue to beDoubts about this world and the next or about things concerning ourselves This is delusion about ourselvesThis is why these things become big issues causing endless fuss all over the world of rebirthIs there a next worldWhen people die are they reborn These questions go together for who is it that takes birth and diesWe ourselves  always dying and taking birthWhat comes to this world and goes to the next world is usWho else would it beIf not for this being of the world this wanderer there wouldnt be anyone weighed down with these questions and burdensThis is the harm of delusion of being unable to rememberIt shows within us but we cant catch hold of its causes of why it has come aboutThings that have happened we cant rememberOur own affairs spin us around in circles and get us so tangled up that we dont know which way to goThis is why selfdelusion is an endless complicationBeing deluded about other things is not so bad but being deluded about ourselves blocks all the exitsWe cant find any way outThe results come right back at us  they dont go anywhere else  bringing us suffering because these sorts of doubts are questions with which we bind ourselves not questions by which we set ourselves freeWe can have no hope of resolving and understanding these doubts if we dont find confirmation of the Dhamma in the area of meditationThis is why the Lord Buddha taught us to unravel and look at our own affairsBut unraveling our own affairs is something very criticalIf we do it by guessing or speculating or whatever we wont succeedThe only way to succeed is to develop goodness step by step as a means of support and of drawing us in to mental development or meditation so as to unravel and look at our own affairs which lie gathered in the range of meditationThis is what will lead us to know clearly and to cut through our doubts at the same time leading us to satisfactory resultsWe will be able to stop wondering about death and rebirth or death and annihilationWhat are our own affairsThe affairs of the heartThe heart is what acts creating causes and results for itself all the time pleasure pain complications and turmoilFor the most part it ties itself down more than helping itselfIf we dont force it into good ways the hearts reaps trouble as a result the suffering that comes from being agitated and anxious thinking restlessly from various angles for no worthwhile reasonThe results we receive are an important factor in making us pained and unsettledThis is thus a difficult matter a heavy matter for all those who are deluded about the world deluded about themselves agitated by the world and agitated about themselves without being interested in confirming the truth about themselves using the principles of the Dhamma principles that guarantee the truthFor example once we die we must be reborn as long as the seeds of rebirth are in the heart we have to continue being reborn repeatedlyIt cant be otherwise  for instance being annihilated at deathThe Buddha teaches us to keep watch of the instigatorIn other words we should observe our own heart which is what causes birth and deathIf we dont understand it he tells us various angles from which to approach until we understand and can deal with it properlyIn particular he teaches us to meditate using any of the meditation themes repeating it so that the mind  which has no footing to hold to which is in such a turmoil of finding no refuge that it dwells in unlimited dreams and infatuations  will gain enough of a footing to get on its feet will gain quiet and calm free from the distraction and unsteadiness that would destroy the peace of mind we wantFor example he teaches us to repeat buddho dhammo sangho or atthi kesa loma or whatever phrase suits our temperament being mindful to keep watch over our meditation theme so as not to become forgetful and send the mind elsewhere away from itThis is so that the mind which we used to send in various places can latch onto or dwell with its Dhammatheme its meditation wordOur awareness which used to be scattered among various preoccupations will now gather into that point  the mind  which is the gathering place of awarenessAll the currents of our awareness will converge at the Dhammatheme we are repeating or pursuing with interestThis is because the meditation word  which is something for the mind to hold to so that it can gain a footing  becomes more and more an object of clear and conspicuous awarenessThus at the beginning stages of meditation the meditation word is very importantOnce we have seen the intrinsic value of the peace that appears this way we at the same time see clearly the harm that comes from the agitation and turmoil of the mind that has no footing to hold to and that creates havoc for itselfWe neednt ask anyone The benefits of a peaceful mind and the harm of an agitated mind we see within our own mind from having practiced meditationThis is a step the first step by which the Buddha teaches us to know the affairs of the mindWe then try to make the mind progressively more firmly settled and calm by repeating the meditation word as already mentionedWe keep at it again and again until we become adept until the mind can become still the way we want it toThe sense of wellbeing that arises from a calm heart becomes even more prominent and clear all the timeAs soon as the mind becomes still giving rise to clear and prominent awareness it is at the same time a gathering in of the defilements into a single spot so that we can see them more clearly and more easily observe their behavior  so that we can more easily cure them and remove them with the levels of discernment suited to dealing with crude intermediate and subtle defilements step by stepNow concerning defilements the things that force the mind to be agitated in countless inconceivable ways We cant catch sight of what defilement is what the mind is what the Dhamma is until we first have a firm basis of mental stillnessWhen the mind gathers in and is still the defilements gather in and are still as wellWhen the mind draws into itself to be itself or to become a point on which we can focus and understand the affairs of defilement also enter a restricted range in that same pointThey gather in at the heart and rarely ever run loose to stir up trouble for the heart as they used to before the mind was stillOnce the mind is still so that it can stand on its feet we are then taught to use our discernment to investigate unravel and contemplate the various parts of the body in which the defilements hide outWhat is the mind interested inWhen it isnt quiet with what does it like to involve itselfWhile the mind is quiet it doesnt stir up trouble for itself but a common habit with us human beings is that once we have gained peace and relaxation we get lazyWe simply want to lie down and restWe dont want to unravel the body the elements or the khandhas with our mindfulness and discernment for the sake of seeing the truth and removing the various defilements from the heartWe dont like to reflect on the fact that those who have abandoned and removed the various kinds of defilement that hide out in the body and the khandhas have done so by using mindfulness and discernmentAs for mental stillness or concentration thats simply a gathering together of the defilements into a restricted rangeIts not an abandoning or a removal of defilementPlease remember this and take it to heartThe heart when it isnt still tends to get entangled with sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations and to take them as issues for stirring itself upWe can know with our mindfulness and discernment which of the various sights sounds etc the mind tends to favor most stronglyWhile we are investigating we can know with our mindfulness and discernment the objects with which the mind is involving itselfWe can observe the affairs of the mind because the mind has been stillAs soon as it begins to head out toward its various preoccupations we knowThis is why we are taught to investigate and unravel things with our discernment so as to know what the mind goes to involve itself withTry to observe so as to know so as to see clearly with mindfulness and discernment while you are investigatingOnly when you are stilling the mind in concentration is there no need for you to investigate because concentration and discernment take turns working at different times as I have already explainedWhen you are investigating visual objects with which visual object is the mind most involvedWhat is the reasonLook at the objectDissect itAnalyze it into its parts so as to see it clearly for what it truly isOnce you have dissected the object  whatever it is  so as to see it with discernment in line with its truth at the same time you will see the absurdity the deceptiveness of the mind that grows attached and misconstrues things in all kinds of ways without any real reason without any basis in factOnce you have investigated carefully youll see that the object has none of the worth construed and assigned to it by the mindThere are simply the assumptions of the mind that has fallen for the object thats allOnce you have investigated separating the various parts of their body or your body so as to see them in detail you wont see anything of any worth or substance at allThe heart of its own accord will see the harmfulness of its assumptions its labels and attachmentsThe more it investigates the more clearly it sees  not only the various sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations but also the acts of the mind involved with those objects  until it fully knows and clearly sees with discernment because it has been constantly unraveling things both within and withoutYou fully know and clearly see the acts inside the heart that become involved knowing that they come about for this reason and that all of which are thoroughly absurdBefore you didnt know why the mind was involvedBut now you know clearly that it is involved for this reason and that namely delusion and mistaken assumptionsWhen you investigate in line with the truth and see the true nature of external things you know clearly within yourself that the mind has construed phenomena to be like this and like that which is why it has continually developed more and more attachment and clinging more and more of the defilements of love and hatredThe heart then realizes its own absurdityWhen the heart realizes that it has been deluded and absurd it withdraws inward because if it were to continue to think of becoming attached to those things it would get cut right through by discernment  so what would it gain from becoming attachedTo investigate so as to know clearly that this is this and that is that in line with the truth of every individual thing of every sort This is the way to unravel the great mass of problems that taken together are results  the mass of suffering inside the heartThis is how we are taught to unravel itAs discernment constantly keeps unraveling things without letup until it understands clearly and distinctly we dont have to tell it to let goOnce the mind knows it lets go of its own accordIt is bound to let go of its own accordThe mind attached is the mind that doesnt yet know doesnt yet understand with discernmentOnce the full heart knows it fully lets go with no concern or regretsAll the concerns that used to bother and disturb the mind vanish of their own accord because discernment sees right through themOnce it sees everything clearly and distinctly what is there left to grope forThe problems of the heart that used to be broad and wideranging now become more and more restrictedProblems concerning outside affairs become less and less as I have said in previous talksThe next step is to unravel the mind the gathering point of subtle defilements so as to see what it is looking for when it blips outWhere does it blip fromWhat is there that pressures the mind into forming thoughts of various issuesWhen mindfulness and discernment can keep up with the thoughts that come blipping out these thoughts vanish immediately without amounting to anything without forming issues to entangle us as they did beforeThis is because mindfulness and discernment are wise to them and always ready to herd them in and wipe them out as they keep following in on the tracks of the origin of defilement to see exactly where it isWhere do its children and grandchildren  the defilements  come fromAnimals have their parents what are the parents of these defilementsWhere are theyWhy do they keep forming again and again thinking again and againWhy do they give rise to assumptions and interpretations increasing suffering and stress without stopActually thoughtformations are formed at the mindThey dont come from anywhere elseSo investigate following them in step by step without losing the trail that will lead you to the truth to the culpritThis is genuine exploring observing the affairs of all the defilements using the power of genuine mindfulness and discernmentUltimately we will know what the mind is lacking what it is still connected with what it is interested in what it wants to know and to seeSo we follow the connections follow the seeds on inDay by day the defilements become more and more restricted more and more restrictedThis is because the bridges that connect them to sights sound smells tastes tactile sensations and the various things of the world in general have been cut away from the mind by using continual mindfulness and discernment to the point where we have no more doubtsIts as if the outside world didnt existThere remain only the preoccupations that form  blip blip blip  in the mindThis is where the rebellious monarch liesThe one who concocts and creates the one who struggles and writhes restlessly in big and little ways lies right hereBefore we didnt know in what ways the mind was writhingAll we knew were the results that appeared unsatisfactory every time giving us nothing but suffering and stress which no one in the world wantsOur own heart was so burdened with stress that it couldnt find a way out because it had no inkling of how to remedy thingsBut now that we know these things gradually disappear so that we know and see more and more clearly at the mind which is where unawareness is performing as an actor as an issuemaker here inside usIt cant find anything to latch onto outside so it simply acts insideWhy doesnt it latch onBecause mindfulness and discernment understand and have it surroundedSo how could it latch onto anythingAll it does is go blip blip blip in the mindWe now see it more clearly and focus our investigation on it scratch away at it dig away at it with mindfulness and discernment until we have it surrounded every time the mind makes a moveThere are no longer any lapses in alertness as there were in the first stages when mindfulness and discernment were still stumbling and crawling alongOur persistence at this level is no longer a matter of every activityIt becomes a matter of every mental moment in which the mind ripplesMindfulness and discernment have to know both when the rippling comes out and when it vanishes  and so there are no issues that can arise in the moment the mind is fashioning a thought an assumption or an interpretationThis is because our rocketfast mindfulness and discernment can keep up with thingsAs soon as a rippling occurs we knowWhen we know it vanishesNo issues can arise or connectThey vanish the moment they appearThey cant branch out anywhere because the bridges to outside matters have been cut by mindfulness and discernmentWhen mindfulness and discernment are exploring earnestly relentlessly unflaggingly they want to know to see and to destroy whatever is hazardousWhat causes us to take birth as individuals and beingsWhat leads us to wander in the round of rebirthWhat are the causes what are the conditions that connect thingsWhere are they right now This is called scratching away with mindfulness and discernment digging away at the mind of unawarenessThere is no way we can escape knowing seeing and severing the important cause and condition that creates suffering and stress for the beings of the world namely the defilement of unawareness that has infiltrated the mind in an insidious waySeeThis is the power of mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence on this level something that meditators never imagine will be possible to this extentThis is where defilements begin to reveal themselves because they have no place to hideThey no longer have the sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations in which they used to hole up because the bridges have been cutTheir only hideout is in the mind The mind is the hideout of unawarenessWhen we go ransacking through the mind until everything is smashed completely to smithereens with nothing left  in the same way that we used discernment to investigate phenomena in general  then when the mind of unawareness is ransacked in this way ultimately the supreme defilement  unawareness the emperor of the round of rebirth  is completely obliterated from the mindAt this point how can we help but know what it is that causes birth on this or that levelAs for where we will or wont be reborn thats not importantWhats important is seeing clearly that this is what has caused birth and deathThis is how we prove whether death is followed by rebirth or annihilationWe have to prove it at the mind by practicing in line with the principles of mental development in the same way the Buddha and his Noble Disciples practiced and knew so that it was clear to their heartsThere is no other way to knowDont go groping guessing scratching at fleasYoull end up all mangy and dirty without gaining anything at allWhen we reach this point its called eliminating birth  whose primary seeds lie within  completely from the mindFrom this moment onward there is nothing that can ever again connect and branch outMindfulness and discernment on the level of Dhammarealization know this completelyThis is the culprit who asks Is there a next world This is the one who reserves a place in the next world the one who reserved our place in past worlds the one who has been born and has died over and over and over again unceasingly relentlessly to the point where it cant remember the births the deaths the pleasures the pains the sufferings large and small in its various livesThis is the oneSo please remember its face and take it to heartProbe it and slash it away to smithereensDont show it any mercy Youll simply be feeding and fattening it for it to come back and destroy youWhen we gather the defilements they come into the one mindThey gather here and we destroy them right hereOnce we have finished destroying them so that nothing is left the questions about birth death and the suffering and stress that result from birth and death no longer existWe can know this clearly and fully for ourselves in a way that is immediately apparentThere is no more problem about whether or not there is a next worldOur past worlds we have already abandonedAs for the next world the bridges have all been sent flyingAnd as for the present were wise to itThere are no conventions no matter now refined left in the mindThis is truly a mind with no more problemsThis is where we solve the minds problemsOnce they are all solved here there will never be any problems againNo matter how wide the world no matter how many universes there are they are all a matter of conventional reality which has no limitThe heart that knows all around itself is no longer involvedThe affairs that have been constantly assaulting us up to the present and that will do so on into the future are the affairs of this mind that has hazards buried within itselfThats all there isWhen these hazards have been entirely removed there is nothing left to be dangerous or poisonous ever againThe question of whether or not there is a next world no longer holds any interest because the realization has gone straight to the heart that it is done with the question of connecting up with any other world againSo in studying and solving our own problem we tackle it right hereThis way theres hope that we can put an end to it  at the same time not causing any harm to ourselves or to others at allThe Lord Buddha solved the problem right hereHis arahant disciples solved it right here  knew it right here severed it completely right hereThe proclamation that the Teacher was completely free of suffering and stress that he was the foremost teacher of the world came from this knowledge and this freedom from issuesOur study of the world is completed right here at the mindOur study of the Dhamma reaches full completion right hereThe world means the world of living beingsLiving beings means those who are caught up caught up right at the mindThis is where we cut through the problemThis is where we study and knowThe arahant disciples studied and knew right here with their full hearts  and that was the end of the problemThey solved the problem and it fell away with nothing remainingBut as for us we take on the whole thing the entire heap of suffering and stressWe take on all problems but we arent willing to solve themWe simply hoard them to weigh ourselves down all the timeOur heart is thus filled with a heap of stress that nothing else can equal because nothing else is as heavy as a heart heaped with stressCarrying this heap of stress and problems is heavy on the heart because we havent completed our studiesWe carry nothing but this heap because of our delusionWhen vijja  true knowledge  has appeared and eradicated all the hazards from the heart this is what it means to graduate in line with natural principles with none of the conferring of degrees or titles that would cause us to become even more deludedTo complete our study of the Dhamma in the heart means that we have erased it completely of all delusion with no traces remainingAt that moment the three levels of existence  the levels of sensuality form and formlessness  become no more problem because they all lie in the heartThe level of sensuality is a mind composed of sensualityThe levels of form and formlessness are the conventions of the various things in those levels buried in the heartWhen the heart removes them thats the end of the problemWhen we solve the problem this is where we solve itThis world and the next world lie right here because that which steps into any world lies right hereThis mind is what steps out to receive stress in greater or lesser measureThe motor the propeller lies here in the heart and nowhere elseThe Lord Buddha thus taught at the right point the most appropriate point the heart which is the primary culpritThe things I have mentioned here with whom do they lie if not with each of usAnd if we dont solve them right here where will we solve themLiving beings have to go to their various worlds through the power of the good and bad kamma within the heartThat which goes to the worlds  to the bonfires  is this very heartIf we dont solve the problem right here there is no way of escaping the bonfires of stress and anxietyIf we solve the problem right here there is no problem as to where the fires are because we can keep ourselves protectedThats all there is to itAll of these things are very heavy worlds for living beings in generalWhatever problems arise they arise right hereIs death followed by rebirthBy annihilationIs there a next worldDoes hell existDoes heavenDoes evil existDoes merit Everywhere I go theres the same question Do heaven and hell exist I never feel like answeringI dont see any reason to answer it because that which is burdened with heaven and hell is the heart which everyone already hasSo why waste time answeringAfter all Im not a recordkeeper for heaven and hellStraighten things out right here at the cause that will go to heaven and hellStraighten out the bad causes and foster the goodThere will then be no stress if we straighten things out right on targetAnd how can we missThe welltaught Dhamma teaches us to solve things right on target not offtargetThe Dhamma that leads by means of the welltaught Dhamma leads out those who are caught up in stress and anxiety through the power of delusionWhere will we solve things if we dont solve them at the heartThe big problems lie solely at the heart at this awarenessCrudeness is a matter of this awarenessRefinement is a matter of this awarenessThat which makes people crude or refined is this awareness with defilement as the reinforcementIf the mind becomes refined its because goodness is the reinforcement making it refined until it goes beyond the final point of refinement beyond the final point of conventions and ends up gaining release from all stress with no seeds for any further connectionsAnother question that people are always asking is how to overcome lazinessIf we were to tell them to use laziness to overcome laziness it would be tantamount to telling them to become an enemy of beds blankets and pillows by sleeping without ever waking upIt would be as if they were already dead because laziness makes you weak and listless like a person ready to dieHow can you use laziness to cure lazinessOnce you get a nice resting place as a means of lulling you to drown in sleep its as if you were already dead  dead right there on the pillowEven when you wake up you dont want to get up because laziness stomps all over you and destroys you forcing you not to get upThis is how it goes when you use laziness to cure lazinessIf you use energy and persistence to cure laziness then you get right up ready to fightIf theres a fight you have hope of winningBut if you simply lie prostrate all you can do is lose  although whether we should call it losing or something else is hard to say because you dont even put up a fight at all so how can you say that you loseIf theres a fight and you cant win then you can say that this person wins and that person losesBut here theres no fight at allYou simply lie there grovelingIf you dont call this being a servant in the house of defilements what would you call itBecause thats what it is being a servant in their houseIf you use laziness  to the point of being its servant  to cure defilement you end up piling on even more defilementsOr what would you sayAs things stand defilements already fill the heart so if you foster them even more where are you going to put themYouve got only one heartThe only way is to remove defilements so that you can begin to breathe and not let them sit on top of your nose so that you can never gasp a breath at allRemove them so that you can begin to see yourself At last after all the time Ive been meditating Ive finally seen a piece of defilements grandchild  laziness  fall off just like a chip of bark off a treeToday at last I can begin to see myselfUp to now theres only been defilement making use of my nose and mouthIts really infuriatingPersistenceDiligenceExertion in the way of reason that can accomplish our purposes This is the path that sages have followedEven though it may be difficult were up to the fightIts like removing a thorn from your foot Even though it hurts to remove it you have to bear itIf you let it stay there your whole foot will become infected and putridYou wont be able to walk at all and may even lose the footSo theres only one reasonable course Pull it outNo matter how much it hurts you have to bear it because you have to get the thing outThis is a line of reasoning you have to acceptOnce the thorn is out it holds no more poisonPut medicine on the wound and the foot will heal without flaring up as it would if the thorn were still embedded thereDefilement is just like a thornWe let it lie buried forever in the heartAs long as it remains the heart is infected and putrid there in the midst of the round of rebirth  an endless monotonyIs this what you wantTo be a putrid personAsk yourselfDont ask the defilementsTheyll simply do you more harmIf you dont want this you have to fight themOnce you fight them you are sure somehow of finding a way to winNo matter how many times you lose there will have to come a time when you winOnce youve won then you can keep on winning winning and winning until there is nothing left for you to fight because the defilements are completely mauledWhen you win whom do you defeatYou defeat laziness with diligenceYou defeat defilement with energy and persistenceThis way you gain release from all stressThis is how you solve the problem of birth and death right at the heartThere is only this spot that most needs solvingIts the most appropriate spot the most correct spot to solveTo solve things you solve them hereThere is no way you can solve them anywhere elseKeep on making assumptions and interpretations for aeons and aeons and youll simply continue to be burdened with the problem as it leads you to birth death suffering and stressSo you shouldnt be bold in speculating and guessing or youll waste your time and die in vain because there is no way the problem will be solved with guesses and speculationsDoes suffering exist or notDo merit and evil exist or not Actually we are experiencing these things all of us with no possible exceptionsEvil is mental darkness and stressMerit is wellbeing and easeThese things exist in the body and mind of every person so how can you deny themMerit is a name for wellbeingThe Buddha calls it meritStress he calls evilWe are touched by good and evil all the timeWhether we live in this world or the next we cant help but meet with good and evilHell or nothell if theres pain filling the body and mind who wants itWho wants to meet with itThis is something we all know so why ask about hell when its already with us like thisWherever pain is burning us its as hot as being branded with fireNo matter where youre branded it all has to be hot in the same wayYou can call it hell or nothell as you like but nobody wants it because pain is something we have all known for ourselvesAnd where  to trouble your heart  are you going to go looking for heavenWhen you meet with the wellbeing that comes from practicing the Dhamma  and especially with wellbeing in the heart beginning with stillness and calm in ascending stages to the point where the mind develops a firm and solid footing within so that it is sure of itself and then further to the point where you gain release  then where are you going to ask about heaven and nibbanaTheres no need to askYou know them directly with your heartYou are the owner in charge of the heart that is clearly the instigator so where else are you going to look  for the names heaven and hellWhat is there to grope forYouve got the real thing within youThats all there is to the matterThe Dhamma of the Lord Buddha doesnt delude people into groping for this or thatSo take hold of the real thing right hereWell thenThat should be enough for nowIn the basic principles of the doctrine we are taught that A delight in the Dhamma surpasses all other delightsThe flavor of the Dhamma surpasses all other flavors This statement was made by a person who had felt delight in the true Dhamma who had tasted the flavor of the true Dhamma namely our Lord BuddhaFor this reason those who take an interest in listening to his teachings find that no matter what the statement each word each sentence goes straight to the heart  except of course for people who are simply going through the motions of listening without focusing the mind letting it drift engrossed in various things in line with its original inclinations without gaining anything of any worthThe teachings of the religion have no meaning in a mind of this sort until it turns to the Dhamma develops an interest of its own accord and puts the Dhamma into practiceOnly then will the flavor of the Dhamma seep deep into the heart nurturing it and giving rise to conviction step by stepThis is because the heart now has a continuing basis for the Dhamma that supports it in ascending stagesIn particular when listening to Dhamma dealing with the practice if our mind doesnt have any experience with meditation has never taken an interest in the Dhamma has never taken an interest in practicing the Dhamma then not even a single statement will arrest the attentionWhen listening to a talk on the practice dealing with the stages of the mind the progress of the mind setting the mind aright in relationship to the defilements or to the path  mindfulness and discernment or persistent effort  we wont understandWhen we dont understand we become frustrated and turn our attention elsewherePerhaps we may become drowsy and want to go to sleep or something of the sortThe talk seems long because it acts as a drag on our defilements preventing them from roaming around as they pleaseThis is because we have to keep control over the mind while we listen to the talk and the mind when kept under control in this way feels hemmed in imprisoned within limits it finds oppressiveAnnoyed and bored it doesnt want to listen except for the purpose of creating useless issues for entangling itselfBut when we keep listening with interest meditating even while we listen the mind becomes focused and follows along with the stream of Dhamma being explainedThe mind grows still because the awareness making contact with the Dhamma maintains that contact continuously step by step without breakThe heart has no chance to slip away to any other preoccupations that are its enemies while listening and so its able to settle down and be stillTo be able to settle down in this way is to begin building a base or to scrub our vessel  the heart  making it clean and fit to receive the DhammaThe heart will start growing more peaceful and calm seeing the value of listening to the Dhamma as explained by the Buddha Listening to the Dhamma has five rewards The fifth reward is the important one The mind of the listener becomes radiant and calm This one is very important but it must build on the earlier onesThe listener hears things he or she has never heard  this is the basis for the restSuppose that we have never listened to anything in the way of the practice or whateverWhen we come to listen we gain an understanding of things we have never heard beforeThings that we have heard before but never understood clearly we gradually come to understand more and more clearlyWe can bring our views more correctly into lineAnd finally we reach the stage where the mind of the listener becomes radiant and calm When results of this sort appear a delight in the Dhamma will develop of its own accordThe flavor of the Dhamma will begin to appear while we listen and while the mind is stilling itself to listenEven though this flavor may not yet surpass all others it is nevertheless absorbing and arresting and will remain long in the memory not easily erasedThis is why meditators place great importance on listening to the DhammaIf you were to call it being attached to ones teacher I wouldnt disagreeMeditating monks always like to listen to their teachersIf they have a teacher they venerate and revere in the area of meditation in the area of the mind then wherever he lives they will keep coming to be with him until there is hardly enough room for them to stayVenerable Acariya Mun is an exampleWherever he stayed students would come continually from near and far to search him outEven though they couldnt all stay in the same place with him inasmuch as there wasnt enough room they would still be willing to stay in nearby areas two three four or seven to eight kilometers away so that they might conveniently come to hear his teachings on the uposatha days and Dhamma meeting daysOn the uposatha days after listening to the Patimokkha and to his instructions anyone who had any doubts or questions about the Dhamma could ask him to resolve themFor this reason the township where he stayed was filled with nothing but meditating monks and novicesWhen uposatha day came they would begin gathering together after the morning mealAt pmthey would hear the Patimokkha and after the Patimokkha Venerable Acariya Mun would give his talk  thats when hed usually give his talk after the PatimokkhaThis would be an important part of the practice for those who lived with himDuring the Rains Retreat we would meet like this every seven daysOutside of the Rains Retreat the schedule wasnt too fixed but this is how he would usually schedule things for those of us who stayed directly with himEach time we would listen to his talks we would gain in insight and understanding  without failThis is why meditation monks are attached to their teachersEach time we would listen to him he himself would be like a magnet drawing the interest of the monks and novicesIn all things related to the Dhamma he would be the major attracting force inspiring fascination and delight in the DhammaThere was a delight in seeing him and meeting him each time and even more so in hearing him speak  talking in general giving instructions conversing about ordinary things joking  because he himself was entirely DhammaEverything he would do or say in any way would keep revealing Dhamma and reasonability that could be taken as a lesson so that those who were interested could gain a lesson each time they heard himThis is why meditating monks find a great deal of enjoyment in the area of the Dhamma by living with a meditation masterThey go to be with him of their own accordWhen they are far from him and their minds arent yet to the stage where they can look after themselves they are bound to feel lonesomeOr if they come across a problem they cant solve they are sure to miss himIf they cant work out a solution they have to run to him for advice so as to save a great deal of the time it would take to figure out a solution on their own  because he has been through everything of every sortIf we would take a problem to him then as soon as we had finished the last sentence he would immediately have the solution and we would understand right then and thereThis is why when living with a master who has realized the truth theres no delay no waste of time in dealing with each problem as it arisesThis is a great benefit for those who come to study with himTheyre never disappointedThe fact that one who has seen the truth is giving the explanation makes all the differenceA moment ago I began by mentioning a delight in the DhammaWhat I have just been talking about is the same sort of thing finding pleasure in the Dhamma continual pleasure through listening to it constantlyIn the same way when we practice the Dhamma constantly the results  the flavor and nourishment that come from the practice  increase continually becoming more and more solid and substantial in the heartEspecially in the practice of centering the mind The mind is calm tranquil contented and relaxedIts thoughts dont go meddling with anything outsideIts as if the world didnt exist because our attention isnt involved with itTheres simply the Dhamma to be contemplated and practiced so as to give rise to more and more steadiness and strengthAnd on the level of discernment no matter how broad or narrow our investigation of the many phenomena in the world may be it is exclusively for the sake of the Dhamma for the sake of selfliberationWe thus become thoroughly engrossed day and nightThe more strongly our heart is set on the Dhamma the greater its stamina and courageIt has no concern for life itself no worries about its living conditions or anything externalIts only support is the guiding compass of the DhammaWhether we are sitting lying down or whatever the heart is engrossed in its persistent efforts in practicing the DhammaOn the level of concentration it is engrossed in its stillness of mindOn the level of discernment it is engrossed in its explorations of the Dhamma from various angles for the sake of removing defilement step by step as it investigatesPeace of heart is thus possible in each stage of persisting with the practiceThe more quiet and secluded the place the more conspicuously this awareness stands outEven knowledge in the area of concentration stands out in our inner awarenessIt stands out for its stillnessIn the area of discernment our knowledge stands out for the shrewdness and ingenuity of the mind as it explores without ceasing  except when resting in the stillness of concentration  just as water from an artesian well flows without ceasing during both the wet season and the dryWhen phenomena make contact with the mind  or even when they dont  a mind already inclined to discernment is bound to investigate peering into every nook and cranny gaining understanding step by stepFor example when we are first taught mindfulness immersed in the body it seems superficial  because the mind is superficialIt has no footing no mindfulness no discernmentIt hasnt any principles  any Dhamma  to hold toWhatever it hears doesnt really go straight to the heart because the mind is buried way down there deep under the belly of defilementBut once it develops principles and reasonability within itself then  especially when were sitting in meditation in a quiet place investigating the body  the whole body seems clear all the way throughThats how it really feels to a person meditating on this levelIts really enthrallingWhether were contemplating the skin or the bodys unattractiveness it appears extremely clear because thats the way its nature already is  simply that our mind hasnt fallen in step with the truth and so is constantly taking issue with itSoNow that the mind can develop stillness and investigate using its discernment lets take it on a meditation tour exploring the body our five khandhasWe can travel up to the head down to the feet out to the skin into the muscles tendons and bones to see how all the parts are related and connected by their natureAs the mind contemplates in this way step by step as it gets engrossed in its investigation the final result is that even though were investigating the body the body doesnt appear in our inner sense of feeling at allThe mind feels airy and lightThe physical body disappears despite the fact that we continue investigating the mental image of the body as beforeEven though were using the mental image of the body as the focal point of our investigation the physical aspect of the body no longer appearsIt completely vanishesWe investigate until theres a refinement in the minds sense of awareness to the point where we can make the body in the image die and disintegrate step by stepOur awareness is confined solely to the mental image that we are investigating by means of discernmentWe see it distinctly because nothing else is coming in to interfereThe mind feels no hunger or desire to go skipping outsideIts completely engrossed in its work of investigationIts understanding grows clearer and clearerThe clearer its understanding the greater its fascinationUltimately there is simply the mental image or the idea and the mind or discernmentAs for the actual body it disappearsYou dont know where its goneTheres no sense of the body at that moment even though you are investigating the body until you see its condition disintegrating clearly within the mind  disintegrating until it returns to its original condition as the elements of earth water wind and fireOnce the body in the image returns to its original elements the mind then withdraws inward leaving nothing but simple awarenessFeelings all disappear at this stageSañña sankhara and viññana arent involvedTheres simply awareness sufficient for the minds state at that momentIt enters a really solid stillness leaving only simple awarenessThe body sitting here disappears entirelyThis is something that can occur in the course of investigating but please dont plan on itSimply listen now for the sake of becoming absorbed and gladdened while listeningThis will give rise to the benefits of listening that you will actually see for yourselfWhat will happen when you investigate in line with your own personal traits is a completely individual matter that will appear in keeping with your temperamentAs for what occurs with other people you cant make yourself experience what they do know the way they know or see the way they seeThis is something that depends on each persons individual traitsLet things follow your own inner nature in line with the way you are able to investigate and to knowThis is one point I want to explainA second point When investigating the body in terms of inconstancy stress and notself then  whether or not you think inconstancy stress and notself  when discernment makes clear contact with the bodily khandha it will be able to know these things on its own because things that are inconstant stressful and notself are things that deserve to be relinquished that inspire dispassion and disenchantment step by step until you let goWhen the mind has investigated so that it fully understands it lets go of its own accord without being forced because each part each aspect of the body or of the khandha being investigated is simply an individual truthWhen the mind investigates clearly in this way it makes the break automatically because a truth has encountered a truth The mind is the mind and each of these individual conditions is a separate condition that hasnt come to involve itself with the mind at allThe mind will then turn around to see its own fault in being attachedHere Ive really been deludedActually things are like this and this This is one stage When the mind hasnt yet made a complete break  when it doesnt yet have adequate strength  it will start out by knowing at intervals in this wayThe next time you investigate you know in this way again and it keeps seeping in seeping in until your knowledge on this level becomes adequate and lets goLike duckweed that keeps moving in moving in to cover the water After you spread it apart the duckweed comes moving in again and you spread it apart againThis is how it is when discernment investigates these things making forays into these things or unraveling themAs soon as discernment retreats subtle defilements come moving in again but after you have investigated many many times the duckweed  the various types of defilement  begins to thin outYour investigation of these phenomena becomes more and more effortless more and more proficient more and more subtle step by step until it reaches a point of sufficiency and the mind extricates itself automatically as I have already explainedThe mind  when its mindfulness and discernment are sufficiently strong  can extricate itself once and for allThis knowledge is clear to it without any need to ask anyone else ever againThe heart is sufficient in and of itself and sees clearly as sanditthiko in the full sense of the term as proclaimed by the Dhamma without any issues to invite contradictionA third point Sometimes when investigating the body the mind makes contact with a feeling of pain and so turns to investigate itThis all depends on the minds temperamentIn the same way when we turn to investigate the feeling the mind sends us back to the bodyThis is because the body and the feeling are interrelated and so must be investigated together at the same time depending on what comes naturally to us at that particular time that particular feeling and that particular part of the bodyWhen the mind investigates a feeling of pain the pain is nothing more than a pain The mind looks at it fixes its attention on it examines it and then lets it go right there turning to look at the bodyThe body is the bodyThe feeling is a feelingThen we turn to look at the mind The mind is the mindWe investigate and experiment to find the truth of the body the feeling and the mind  all three of which are the troublemakers  until we have a solid understanding of how each has its own separate realityWhen the mind pulls back from the body and the feeling neither the body nor the feeling appearsAll that appears is simple awarenessWhen a mental current flashes out to know the feeling then appears as a feelingThese currents are the means by which we know what phenomenon has appeared because this knowledge gives a meaning or a label to the phenomenon as being like this or like thatIf were going to think in a way that binds us to ourself  in other words in the way of the origin of stress  we have to make use of this act of labeling as what leads us to grasp to become attached to make various assumptions and interpretationsIf were going to think in the way of discernment we have to make use of the discernment that is this very same current of the mind to investigate contemplate until we see clearly by means of discernment and can withdraw inwardly in a way that is full of reason  not in a way that is lazy or weak or that is groveling in abject surrender with no gumption left to fightIn investigating feeling when a sañña flashes out mindfulness is alert to itIf our investigation of feeling has become refined and precise then when a sañña simply flashes out we knowWhen sankharas form they are just like fireflies blipIf no sañña labels them or picks up where they leave off they simply form  blipblip and then vanish vanishNo matter what they form  good thoughts bad thoughts crude thoughts subtle thoughts neutral thoughts whatever  they are simply a rippling of the mindIf they occur on their own when nothing is making contact with the mind theyre called sankharaIf they occur when something is making contact theyre called viññanaHere were talking about the sankharas that form on their own without anything else being involvedThey form  blip  and then vanish immediatelyBlip  and then vanish immediatelyWe can see this clearly when the mind converges snugly in the subtle levels of concentration and discernmentThe snugness of the minds convergence wont have anything else involved with it at allAll that remains is simple awarenessWhen this simple awareness remains stable this way we will see clearly that it isnt paired with anything elseWhen the mind begins to withdraw from this state to return to its awareness of phenomena  returning to its ordinary state of mind that can think and form thoughts  there will be a rippling  blip  that vanishes immediatelyIt will then be empty as beforeIn a moment it will blip againThe mind will form just a flash of a thought that doesnt yet amount to anything just a rippling that vanishes immediately the instant its knownAs soon as theres a rippling we are alert to it because of the power of mindfulness keeping watch at the moment  or because of the strength of concentration that hasnt yet dissipatedBut after these ripples have formed two or three times they come more and more frequently and soon we return to ordinary consciousness just as when a baby awakens from sleep At first it fidgets a bit and then after this happens a number of times it finally opens its eyesThe same is true of the mindIt has calm Here Im talking about concentration when discernment is there with itThe various ways of investigating I have mentioned are all classed as discernmentWhen we have investigated enough the mind enters stillness free from mental formations and fashionings and from any sort of disturbanceAll that appears is awarenessEven just this has the full flavor of a centered mind which should already be enough to surpass all other flavorsWe never tire of delighting in this stillnessWe feel a constant attraction to this stillness and calm in the heartWherever we go wherever we stay the mind has its own foundationThe heart is at ease quiet and calm so that now we must use discernment to investigate the elements and khandhasThe important point to notice is the act of formation in the mindOnce something is formed sañña immediately labels it  as if sankhara were forming things to hand on to sañña which takes up where the sankhara leaves offIt then interprets these things from various angles  and this is where we get deludedWe fall for our own assumptions and interpretations for our own shadows which paint picture stories that have us engrossed or upset both day and nightWhy are we engrossedWhy are we upsetEngrossed or upset its because of the minds shadows acting out stories and issuesThis storyThat storyFuture issuesThings yet to comeThings yet to exist  nothing but the mind painting pictures to delude itselfWe live in our thoughtformations our picturepainting  engrossed and upset by nothing but our own thoughtformations our own picturepaintingIn a single day theres not a moment when were free from painting imaginary pictures to agitate and fool ourselvesWise people though can keep up with the tricks and deceits of the khandhas which is why they arent deludedThe moment when mindfulness and discernment really penetrate down is when we can know that this is actually the way the mind usually isLike people who have never meditated When they start meditating they send their minds astray without anything to hold on toFor example they may have a meditation word like buddho and there they sit  their eyes vacant looking at whoknowswhatBut their minds are thinking and painting pictures with endless captionsThey then become engrossed with them or wander aimlessly in line with the preoccupations they invent for themselves falling for their preoccupations more than actually focusing on their meditationThey thus find it hard to settle their minds down because they dont have enough mindfulness supervising the work of meditation to make them settle downOnce we have used our alertness and ingenuity in the areas of concentration and discernment we will come to know clearly that these conditions come from the mind and then delude the mind whose mindfulness and discernment arent quick enough to keep up with themThe heart causes us to follow after them deludedly so that we cant find any peace of mind at all even though our original aim was to meditate to find peace of mindThese deceptive thoughts engender love hate anger irritation without letup no matter whether we are meditators or not  because as meditators we havent set up mindfulness to supervise our hearts and the result is that were just as insane with our thoughts as anyone elseOld Grandfather Boowa has been insane this way himself and thats no jokeSometimes no matter how many years in the past a certain issue may lie this aimless drifting heart wanders until it meets up with it and revives itIf it was something that made us sad we become sad about it again all on our ownWe keep it smoldering and think it back to life even though we dont know where the issue lay hidden in the meantimeThese are simply the minds own shadows deceiving it until they seem to take on substance and shapeAs whatAs anger greed anxiety pain insanity all coming from these shadowsWhat sort of path or fruition is thisPaths and fruitions like this are so heaped all over the world that we cant find any way outSo in investigating the acts of the mind the important point is that discernment be quick to keep up with their vagrant waysWhen mindfulness and discernment are quick enough then whatever forms in the mind we will see that it comes from the mind itself which is about to paint pictures to deceive itself about to label and interpret sights sounds smells and tastes of various kindsThe heart is then up on these preoccupations and when it is up on them they vanish immediately with no chance of taking on substance or shape of becoming issues or affairsThis is because mindfulness and discernment are wise to them and so the issues are resolvedUltimately we come to see the harm of which the mind is the sole causeWe dont praise or blame sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensations at allThe heart turns and sees the harm that arises in the mind that deceives itself saying Thats worth praising worth criticizing worth getting glad about worth getting sad about It sees that the blame lies entirely with the mindThis mind is a cheat a fraud a deceiverIf we study it and keep watch of its ways through meditation we will gain a thorough knowledge of its good and evil doings until it lies within our grasp and cant escape us at allThis is how we investigate when we investigate the mindUltimately other things will come to have no meaning or importance for usThe only important thing is this deceiving mind so we must investigate this deceiver with mindfulness and discernment so that we can be wise to its tricks and deceitsIn fixing our attention on the mind we have to act as if it were a culpritWherever it goes we have to keep watch on it with mindfulness and discernmentWhatever thoughts it forms mindfulness and discernment have to keep watch so as to be up on eventsEach event  serious or not  keeps vanishing vanishingThe heart knows clearly This mind and nothing else is the real culpritVisual objects arent at faultThey dont give benefits or harmSounds smells tastes and tactile sensations dont give benefits or harm because they themselves arent benefits or harmOnly the mind is what fashions them and dresses them up so as to deceive itself into being gladdened or saddened pleased or pained through the power of the preoccupations that arise only from the heartMindfulness and discernment see more and more clearly into these things step by step and then turn to see that all the fault lies with the mindThey no longer praise or blame other things as they used toOnce they have focused solely on the mind which at the moment is the culprit the time wont be long before they can catch the culprit and put an end to all our concernsSo thenWhatever thoughts that may be formed are all an affair of the mindThe tigers and elephants it forms are simply sankharas it produces to deceive itselfMindfulness and discernment are up on events every timeNow the current of the cycle keeps spiraling in day by day until we can catch the culprit  but we cant yet sentence himWe are now in the stage of deliberation to determine his guiltOnly when we can establish the evidence and the motive can we execute him in accordance with the procedures of Dhamma Penetration This is where we reach the crucial stage in mindfulness and discernmentIn the beginning we used the elements and khandhas as our objects of investigation cleansing the mind with elements using them as a whetstone to sharpen mindfulness and discernmentWe cleansed the mind with sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations using them as a whetstone to sharpen mindfulness and discernment and we cleansed the mind itself with automatic mindfulness and discernmentNow at this stage we circle exclusively in on the mindWe dont pay attention to matters of sights sounds smells or tastes because we have already understood and let go of them knowing that they arent the causal factorsThey arent as important as this mind which is the primary instigator  the culprit renowned throughout the circles of the cycle the agitator the disturber of the peace creating havoc for itself only right here insideMindfulness and discernment probe inward and focus right hereWherever this mind goes its the only thing causing harmSo we watch patiently over this culprit to see what he will do next  and aside from being alert to what he will do we also have to use discernment to penetrate in and see who is inciting himWho stands behind him so that he must be constantly committing crimesHe keeps creating deceptive issues without pause  whyMindfulness and discernment dig in there not simply to pounce on or lay siege to his behavior but also to go right into his lair to see what motivating force lies within itWhat is the real instigatorThere has to be a causeIf theres no cause no supporting condition to spin the mind into action the mind cant simply act on its ownIf it simply acts on its own then it has to be a matter of khandhas pure and simple  but here its not pure and simpleWhatever behavior the mind displays whatever issues it forms all give rise to gladness or sadnessThis shows that these conditions arent simply coming outTheres a causeTheres an underlying condition that sends them out making them give rise to real pleasure and pain when we fall for themWhile we are exploring inward at this point we have already seen that the mind is the culprit so we must consider letting go of all external thingsOur burdens grow less and lessThere remain only the issues of the mind and the issues of formation and interpretation that arise solely from the mindMindfulness and discernment spin whizzing around in there and ultimately come to know what it is that causes the mind to form so many thoughts giving rise to love anger and hateAs soon as it appears the heart knows it and when the heart knows it the Lord of Conventional Reality which is blended with the mind dissolves awayAt this point the cycle has been destroyed through mindfulness and discernmentThe mind is no longer guilty and turns into a mind absolutely pureOnce the problem of the cycle is ended there is no way that we can find fault with the mindWhen we could find fault that was because the fault was still in the mindIt was hiding in the mindJust as when criminals or enemies have taken up hiding in a cave We have to destroy the cave as well and cant conserve it out of affection for itAvijja  unawareness  is the lord of the three levels of existence that has infiltrated the mind and thus we have to consider destroying the entire thingIf the mind isnt genuine it will dissolve together with unawarenessIf its genuine in line with its nature it will become a pure mind  something peerless  because all things counterfeit have fallen away from it through the use of mindfulness and discernmentWhen the counterfeit things that are like rust latching firmly onto the mind finally dissolve away through the power of mindfulness and discernment the mind becomes genuine DhammaYou can call it the genuine mind or the genuine Dhamma Theres no contradiction because there is no more reason for contradiction which is an affair of defilementYou can say  that the flavor of the Dhamma has surpassed all other flavorsWhen the mind is pure Dhamma it has had enough of all other thingsIt is absolutely no longer involved with anything else at allIts one mind one DhammaThere is only oneThere is only one genuine DhammaThe mind is Dhamma the Dhamma is the mindThats all that can be saidI ask each of you to take this and contemplate itThis is the basis for the truth of the teachings that the Lord Buddha taught from the beginning until the moment of his total nibbanaThe purity of his mind was a deeply felt Dhamma that he experienced with his full heartHe then proclaimed that Dhamma with the benevolence of his full heart teaching the world up to the presentTo call his teachings the benevolence of the Lord Buddha shouldnt be wrong because he taught the world with true benevolenceWhen we take those teachings and put them into practice in a way that goes straight to the heart we will come to see things we have never seen before never known before within this heart step by step until we reach the full level of practice know the full level of knowledge and gain release from suffering and stress with our full hearts with nothing left latching onThis is called wiping out the cemeteries  the birth and death of the body and mind  for goodWhat a reliefAnd now that weve reached this point I dont know what more to say because Im at a loss for wordsI ask that you as meditators practice train yourselves and explore all Dhammas until you too are at a loss of words like this speaker at his wits endEven though we may be stupid infinitely stupid Ill ask to express my admiration straight from the heartIn the Discourse on Good Omens the Buddha teaches us to associate with sages and not with foolsThe first and foremost fool here is our own heartIn other words there are fools outside and fools inside and for the most part the fools inside are the ones who keep stirring up trouble all the timeWhen we live with meditation masters which is called associating with sages we keep gaining lessons from sages because thats what they areThey are wise in the various tactics they teach usThey have practiced and gained knowledge of everything from experienceTheir teachings are thus correct precise and convincing to those who listen to them with no room for any doubtIn particular Venerable Acariya Mun There never was a time when he would teach saying It seems to be like thisIt seems to be like that There was nothing but This is the way it is for sure for sure  and we were sure because he spoke only the absolute truth taken right from a heart that had already known and seen and from his own wellconducted practiceEspecially in the case of illness If there were any weakwilled cases he would tell them Whoever is weak whoever cries and moans can take his moans as his medicineTheres no need to search out medicine anywhere no need to have anyone to look after himHis moans are his medicineIf moaning serves any purpose then why search for medicine to treat the diseaseThen he would add Keep moaningEveryone can moanEven children can moan  if it serves a purposeBut here it doesnt serve any purpose at all other than to annoy those good people who are unflinching in the practiceSo you shouldnt moan out of weaknessYoure a meditation monkWhen you act like this who can bear to see itIf you were a child or an ordinary person there wouldnt be anything wrong with it because they havent received any trainingThey dont have any knowledge or understanding of the various ways to contend with the pain such as contemplating itBut you you already know everything of every sortYet when trouble comes such as illness you cant find any methods or tactics to care for yourselfYou just go all to piecesThis wont do at allYoure a shame to yourself and your fellow meditatorsVenerable Acariya Mun was very talented in teaching the heartWhen those of his disciples who were intent on studying with him would listen to anything hed say it would go straight to the heartStraight to the heartThe things we should put into practice we would put into practiceThe things we should understand right then dealing with internal matters we would understand  every time step after stepWhen we were ill he would teach us how to contemplateWhen you have a fever where did you get it from Hed say this so as to serve a purpose as food for thought for meditatorsFrom where did you drag out the fever and chillsThey arise in this body dont theyWhen they disappear where do they go if not back to where they came fromEven if they dont disappear they die together with each of us There are no exceptions at all in this bodyInvestigate it so as to know itAll stress all pains are Noble TruthsIf we dont investigate them what are we going to investigateThe Buddha gained Awakening with the Noble Truths his disciples gained Awakening with the Noble Truths  so are we going to gain Awakening with weaknessWould that be in keeping with the Dhamma of the BuddhaThen weve come to resist the DhammaWhere does the pain ariseIn which partAsk so as to find outWhen it hurts here and aches there who is it that hurtsWho is it that achesProbe on in to find what instigates itWhere does it come fromWhere does it hurtWhat causes it to hurtWhat perceives it as painWhen the body dies and they cremate it does it hurtWho is it that deceives itself into thinking that this hurts or that achesInvestigate so as to find its initial causesIf youre a meditator who doesnt know initial causes and doesnt know their effects  this heap of suffering  then how are you going to cure sufferingWhat is your discernment forWhy dont you thinkWhy dont you find it and put it to useYour mindfulness and discernment are for keeping things in mind and investigating them  things such as feelings of pain that exist in your body and mindHe would keep stressing his points step by stepIf the person listening was intent on listening  and especially if he had any fighting spirit  hed find it easy to grasp the point and it would appeal to him immediatelyImmediatelyWhen wed leave Venerable Acariya Mun to live in any spot suitable for the practice his teachings would seem to reverberate through the heartYou could remember every facet of his teachings every important point that should be used as a tool in the practiceFor example if you were staying in a challenging place it was if he were right there in the heartThe heart would be really audacious and exultant in practicing knowing the Dhamma seeing it understanding itYou would understand with audacity and with a warriors spirit  not by being discouraged irresolute or beating a retreatThats not the way to make the defilements fear you and disappear from the heartThats not at all the way to cure defilement to know the affairs of defilement or to be able to remove themThis is the religionThere is nothing to compare with it in being so correct so precise so genuine so true so indisputableIf we all were to follow the principles of the religion there would be no need for prisons or jailsWhat need would they serveNobody would be doing any wrongPeople would see in line with reason and acknowledge their rightness and wrongness their good and their evil using the principles of reason as their standardWe human beings would then be able to live with one anotherThe reason we need laws prisons and jails is because we dont admit our wrongsWhen were wrong we dont admit that were wrongEven the moment after we see ourselves do something wrong we wont admit to itEven when were put in jail and are asked we still say They accused me of stealing this and stealing that  even though we ourselves actually stole itThis is simply an unwillingness to admit to things in line with reason in line with the truthEven within the heart with things that concern us exclusively the same holds true We dont admit to them which is why we receive so much pain and sufferingIf we admit to the principles of the truth the things that appear in line with the truth can be resolved through the truthFor example even when pain arises in the body it wont disrupt the mind because our knowledge is wise to itAs the principles of the Dhamma say pains have been appearing in our body and mind ever since we first became aware of thingsThere is no reason for us to get excited frightened or upset by them to the point where they disease the mindThis is why mental development or meditation is an excellent science for gaining knowledge on all fronts Those who practice consistently are not upset when pain arises in the bodyThey can even focus on the spot where the pain arises so as to investigate and analyze it in line with its truth until gaining skillful and courageous tactics for dealing with it admirablyThe important point is to associate with sages wise people those who are sharp and astuteIf we arent yet able to depend on ourselves we have to depend on our teachers to instruct usIf we listen often their teachings gradually seep into us and blend with our temperament until our mind becomes a mind with DhammaOur mind becomes a sage a wise person and can eventually take care of itself becoming atta hi attano natho  its own mainstaySo in every activity where we arent yet capable we first have to depend on othersIn living with those who are good we are bound to find peace and happinessOur traits come to mesh with theirs  this is important  until our own traits become good and admirable as wellIts the same as if we were to associate with bad people At first we arent bad but as we associate with them for a long time our traits blend themselves with theirs until we become bad without being aware of itWhen we are fully bad this makes us even more blindWe feel that weve become even betterNo one else can push us aroundOtherwise our goodness will jump into action  the goodness of a bad person an evil that wise people everywhere fearBad people and good peopleEvil and goodThese things get turned around in this wayBad people thus cant see the truth that they are bad and so flatter themselves into thinking Im goodIm smartIm cleverIm one of the most renowned operators around Thats how they twist thingsFor this reason associating with meditation masters with sages is important for anyone who is striving to become a good person who is hoping to prosper and be happy because sages will teach us oftenTheir manners and deportment that we see day after day will gradually seep into and nurture our mindsWe can hold to them continually as good examples for everything they do in every way is all DhammaEspecially if theyre people devoid of defilement then there is nothing to compare with themLike Venerable Acariya Mun Im certain that he was devoid of defilementAfter hearing the Dhamma from him I had no doubtsHe himself never said that he was devoid of defilement you knowHe never said that he was an arahant or anything but he would say it in his ability to explain the true Dhamma on every level in a way that would go straight to the heart and erase all doubt for all those who came to study with himThis is why I can dare to say unabashedly that Venerable Acariya Mun Bhuridatta Thera is one of the important arahants of our day and age  an age in which arahants are exceedingly rare because its an age sadly lacking in people practicing the Dhamma for the sake of arahantshipInstead we practice to eliminate arahantship by amassing all kinds of miscellaneous defilementsThis holds for all of us so no one is in a position to criticize anyone elseLets return to the subject of feelings To investigate feelings of pain is very importantThis is something I learned from Venerable Acariya MunHe took this very seriously whenever any of the meditators in his monastery became illSometimes he would go himself and ask How are you contemplating your illness Then hed really emphasize the DhammaGo probing right thereWherever theres pain investigate so as to see the truth of the pain Hed teach how to investigate Dont retreatTo retreat is to enhance the painTo be a warrior you have to fight using discernmentThis is what will bring victory the ability to keep up with the feeling of pain that you hold to be an important enemyActually that feeling isnt anyones enemyIt doesnt have any sense of consciousness at allIts simply a truth  thats allSo investigate on inYou dont have to anticipate it or concern yourself with whether its a big pain or a small painAll thats asked is that you know its truth with your own discernment so that the heart wont deceive you Thats what he would sayActually our heart is deceit incarnate because that which deceives is within the heart and fools the heart into making assumptions and interpretationsStupidity has an easy time believing liesClever people have an easy time deceiving stupid peopleDeceit has an easy time fooling stupidityThe cleverness of the defilements gets along well with our own stupidityThis is why the Dhamma teaches us to ferret things out to investigate down to their truth and then to believe in line with that truthThis is our means of gaining victory step by stepFerret out the pains that are always with you so as to see themDont run away from themWhether theyre big or small investigate right thereInvestigate right thereIf youre going to concentrate concentrate right thereWhen you are investigating its causes no matter how great the pain keep probing inThe thing we call pain What does it depend on as its foundationIt depends on the body as its foundationIt depends on our attention as its means of flaring up  in other words the attention that labels it in various ways This is what makes pain flare upWe have to cure this kind of attention by investigating to know both the pain  what its like  and the place where pain arises in whatever part of the bodyTry to know clearly whether or not that spot is really painFor example if theres pain in the bone in any part of the skin or flesh the skin and the flesh are skin and fleshThe pain is a painEven though they dwell together they are separate things not one and the sameThe mind  the knower that is aware of these things  is a mind but its a deluded mind so it assumes that this is pain thats pain and conflates these things into being its self saying I hurt hereI hurt thereI dont want myself to be painedI want the pain to vanish This desire is a defilement that encourages pain and suffering to ariseThe heart is painedThe feeling of pain in the body is painThe pain in the heart flares up with that pain because it wants it to follow the hearts desiresThese things keep feeding each otherThis is our own stupidity loading us down with sufferingTo be intelligent we have to investigate to watch the feeling of pain in the heartWhat does it come fromWhat does it depend onIt depends on the bodyWhich part of the bodyFrom what spot in the body does the pain ariseLook at the body and the feeling Are they one and the same thingWhat kind of shape and features do they haveThe feeling doesnt have any shape or features or a posture of any kindIt simply appears as a feeling of pain thats allAs for the body it has a shape a color and complexion  and it stays as it was before the pain aroseWhen the pain arises it stays just as it wasActually the pain is something separate from thisIt simply depends on a malfunction of the body to ariseThe mind is what takes notice of itIf the mind has any discernment it should notice it in line with its truthThe mind then wont be affected by itBut if the mind is deluded it latches onto the pain  in other words it pulls that pain in to be its self  and then wants that pain which it says is its self to disappearThis is why we cant analyze itOnce the pain is our self how can we separate it outIf its simply a pain a separate reality then the body is a separate realityThey arent one and the sameEach one exists separatelyEach is a separate reality in line with its natureOnly when our awareness is like this can we analyze thingsBut as long as we see the pain as our self then we can analyze it all day long and not get anywhere because once we hold that This is myself how can we analyze itWe havent separated these things with discernment so we have to keep holding onto them as our selfWhen the khandhas and the mind blend into one we cant analyze themBut when we try to use mindfulness and discernment to investigate in to see the truth of these things  that each exists separately each has its separate reality which holds true for us and for everyone else  and this realization goes deep into the heart then the pain gradually fades away fades awayAt the same time we know what makes the connection from the pain into the heart because the connection comes from the heartWhen we investigate the pain it comes retracting into the heartAll the affairs of pain come from the heart that labels or that experiences mental pain because of an insidious connection by way of attachment that we dont yet knowWhen we investigate so as to see clearly we follow the feeling of pain inwardWe come in knowing knowingThe pain keeps retracting and retracting into the heartOnce we know that the heart is what created the attachment making itself construe the pain to be itself creating a great deal of sufferingonce we know this the pain disappearsOr  alternatively  once we know this the pain stays real but the heart doesnt latch onto itEven though the pain may not disappear the mind is the mindIt doesnt make any connection through attachmentEach is its own separate realityThis is called the mind being its own self  cool calm and collected  in the midst of the pain of the khandhasThis is to know that the mind is a reality just as each khandha is a separate realityThis is the path for those who are practicing so as to become wise to the five khandhas with feelings of pain as their primary focusBut for those who understand all the way to the point of reaching the unshakable mind the unshakable Dhamma that cant be provoked into being anything else there is no problem at allWhether pain is little or great they have absolutely no problem because their minds are always trueThere is never a time when their minds which are already pure can become defiled can become worlded Theres no way it could happenFor this reason whatever conditions the khandhas may display such people know them in line with the principles of natureThe khandhas themselves appear in line with the principles of nature and disappear in line with natureThey remain naturally and then disappear naturallyThe mind knows in line with its own nature without having to be forced or coerced in any wayThe minds of those who know totally allaround are like thisAs for those of us who are investigating the khandhas to know them and withdraw from them step by step even though our minds are not yet like that while we are practicing even though our hopes arent yet fulfilled still our investigation of pain is for the purpose of separating the mind from the pain so that its not entangled in pain so that whenever pain arises in greater or lesser measure the mind doesnt cling to the pain as being itselfWe do this so as not to gather up the pain as being our self  which would be the same as taking fire to burn ourselfWhen we can do this we can be at our easeSo pain is an excellent whetstone for discernmentHowever much pain arises set your mindfulness and discernment focused right thereTurn to look at the mind and then expand your awareness to encompass the feeling and the body each of which is already a separate partThe body is one part the feeling is another and the mind anotherKeep going back and forth among them investigating with discernment until you understand  and it really goes to the heart  that Each khandha is simply and thats all None of them appears to be any such thing as you or yours They are simply different realities that appear and thats allWhen you understand clearly like this the heart becomes its own free and independent self at that moment and it knows that the mind and the khandhas are separate realities neither affecting the otherEven at the moment when you are about to die the heart will be up on events in the immediate presentIt wont be shaken by pain and death because it is sure that the mind is the mind a stronghold of awarenessEach khandha is simply a conditionThe mind thus doesnt fear death because it is sure of itself that it wont get destroyed anywhereEven though it may not have yet reached the level where its absolutely devoid of defilement the mind has still prepared itself using discernment with the khandhas so that its supremeIn other words it lives with the Noble TruthsIt lives with its whetstone for discernmentDiscernment will spread its power far and wideThe heart will grow more and more radiant more and more courageous because discernment is what cleanses itEven if death comes at that moment theres no problemFor one thing if you use mindfulness and discernment to investigate pain without retreating to the point where you understand it then even when you really are about to die youll know that the pain will disappear firstThe mind wont disappearIt will revert into itself knowing exclusively within itself and then pass on at that momentThe phrase Mindfulness lapses doesnt exist for a person who has practiced the Dhamma to this levelWe can thus be sure that a person with mindfulness even though he or she may not be devoid of defilement will still be clearly aware at the moment when pain arises in full force to the point where the khandhas can no longer endure and will break apart  will dieThe mind will withdraw itself from all that and revert to its mindness  to being its own independent self  and then pass onThis is a very high very refined level of DhammaFor this reason meditators who are resolute and unflinching for the sake of knowing every level of the Dhamma tend to be earnest in investigating painWhen the time comes for them to know the knowledge goes straight to the heartThey regard their pain as a Noble Truth in line with the Buddhas teaching that all living beings are fellows in pain birth aging illness and deathSo when investigating the khandhas so as to know them in line with their truth you shouldnt try to thwart or resist the truthFor example if the body cant endure let it goYou shouldnt cherish itAs for the pain it will go on its ownThis is called sugato  faring wellThis is the way of investigating the mind and training the heart that gives clear results to those who meditateThey have meditated in the way Ive described so that when the time of death is really upon them they dont hope to depend on anyone at all  parents brothers sisters relatives friends anyoneThey have to withdraw the mind from all things that entangle and involve it so as to enter that crucial spot where they are engaged in handtohand combatAt a time such as this at the moment when you are about to die take pain as the focal point for investigationDont be willing to retreat  come what mayAll thats asked is that you know and understand this pointDont go thinking that if you die while being embroiled in investigating pain like this  while the mind is in the midst of this commotion  youll go to a bad bournWhy should you go to a bad bournYoure embroiled but with a noble taskYoure embroiled with knowledge or for the sake of knowledge and not because of delusionThe mind is focused on investigating and probing painWhen the time comes for it really to go this knowing mind  the mind with mindfulness knows  will withdraw instantly into itselfIt will let go immediately of the work at hand and withdraw into itself to be itself  the mind and nothing but  and then pass on like a sugato with the full capability of a meditator even though we may not yet be devoid of defilementThis is called having full strength to our full capacity in line with our level of mind and DhammaInvestigation and mental development are thus important matters matters on which our life and death dependWe neednt hope to depend on anyone else at all  of this we are certain within ourselvesThe heart knows within itself how strong mindfulness and discernment are and neednt go asking anyone elseIf the heart is able to investigate to the point where it can pass on at that moment all doubts vanishThere are no problems at allIf you think that because youre a woman or because youre a layperson you cant realize nibbana thats your own misconception which is one kind of defilement deceiving youThe Dhamma is a truth and everyones common propertyWhether we are men or women lay or ordained we can all have mindfulness and discernmentWe can all cure our defilementsWhen we are willing any man or woman any monk or layperson can use any of the methods to cure defilement and gain releaseWe neednt create problems to plague our hearts and waste our timeSince when do I have the potential to do that Dont think thatYoure developing the merit and potential right nowHowever much or little you can see it right here in the mindWe should examine ourselvesWherever we are stupid we should develop intelligence mindfulness and discernmentOnly then will we be doing what is genuinely right in terms of the principles of the Lord Buddhas DhammaIf we criticize ourselves thinking That person is on this level or that level while we dont have any level at all wherever we go this person gets ahead of us that person gets ahead of us actually nobody is getting ahead of us except for the defilements that get ahead of us and deceive us into feeling inferior and depressed into thinking that we have only a little potentialThats simply a misconception aimed at making us discouraged and selfpitying because defilement is looking for a way to kill us without our realizing itWe shouldnt think in those waysWe are full of potential  all of usAnd why shouldnt we beWere meditatorsWere all devoted to making meritPotential isnt something we can set out on the market to compete with one anotherEvery person has potential within him or herselfWere taught not to belittle one anothers potentialEven with animals were taught not to belittle them  think of that because potential lies in the heart of every person and every animalSo when curing defilement you neednt waste time thinking those thingsTheyll simply ruin your morale and your resolveTo think Im a worthless woman a worthless man a worthless monk a worthless laypersonI dont have any paths or fruitions at allOther people have them but I dontIm ashamed to show them my face  these are wrong thoughts that will spoil your resolve in developing the various forms of goodnessThe right way to think is this Right now Im making an effort with mindfulness and discernment to cure defilement and to develop what is good and meritorious step by step which is the direct way to develop my perfectionsI have the potentialI was born in the midst of the Buddhas teachings and have developed the potential and the perfections to my full capacity all along up to the presentWomen can have mindfulness and discernment just like men because women and men both have defilements and defilements are cured with mindfulness and discernment  backed by persistent effort  both by men and by womenAnd where do they have defilementsThey both have defilements in the heartWhen mindfulness and discernment are complete women and men can both pass over and beyond  with no question of their having to be ordainedThis is the truth of the Noble Truths which are not particular about status nationality or any of the human races and which are not particular about the male or the female sexAll thats asked is that we strive because the Dhamma is common to us allWomen and men lay and ordained we can all listen to it understand it practice it and cure defilementThe defilements dont favor men or womenWe all have defilementsEven monks have defilements What do you say to thatMonks thus have to cure their own defilementsIf they dont they lie buried in defilement just like people in general who arent interested in the Dhamma  or even worse than people in generalThe Dhamma thus doesnt stipulate that its only for those who are ordainedWhat is stipulated is that we cure defilement with persistent effortThis is something very importantWe have to be very interested in this pointAs for release from suffering and stress where do we gain releaseWe gain it right here right where there is sufferingIf we can cure defilement we gain release from sufferingIf we cant then no matter what our sex or status we all have to sufferHereThis is where the religion lies here in the heartIt doesnt lie anywhere elseIf we want to be incapable of it we can be incapable  right here in our heartWhether lay or ordained we can be incapable  if we make ourselves incapableOr we can make the religion flourish in our heart  that we can also doWhen the religion flourishes where does it flourishIn the heart and nowhere elseThe important point is the heartThe important point is our practice the actions the manners we displayWhen the heart develops the various aspects of our behavior develop beautifullyAdmirablyIn particular the heart flourishes within itselfIt has mindfulness and discernment looking after it constantlyThis is called a flourishing heartThe defilements can hardly ever come to damage it Thats when the religion flourishesWe should make an effort to examine and straighten things out step by stepThe defilements you know are no wider or greater than the limits of our ability to cure and remove themTheyre only here in the heart so investigate right hereWhether were men or women lay or ordained we all have defilements in our heartsNo matter how thick they may be if we consider them we can know themTheyre like darkness Even though darkness may have existed for aeons all we have to do is turn on a light and the darkness disappears completelyThe darkness doesnt have any way to brag saying Ive been dark for aeons so theres no way that this puny light can chase my darkness away When the causes are ready the darkness has to disappear completely and brightness appears in its placeEven though the darkness may have existed for aeons it all vanishes in that instantEven though the defilements may be thick and may have been lording it over our heart for a long time we should investigate them thoroughly with mindfulness and discernmentWhen mindfulness and discernment are capable they immediately become allaroundThe defilements even though they may have been in the heart for aeons will immediately disintegrate in the same way that the darkness that had existed vanishes as soon as a light is litBrightness arises instead through the power of mindfulness and discernmentWithin the heart it is dazzlingly bright at that moment with dhammo padipo  the light of the DhammaThis is all there isThis is the important point we have to investigateBe sure to see itThe religion is marvelous  where is it marvelousThe religion flourishes  where does it flourishThe Buddha says to gain release from stress  where is it gainedIt exists only here in the heartTo analyze it there are the four Noble Truths stress its origin its cessation and the pathStress We know its stress because we arent deadThe origin of stress This is what fosters or produces stressWhat forms does it takeWere taught Craving embued with passion and delight relishing now here and now there ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for being craving for notbeing This we knowWhatever the mind may love or crave we should try to straighten it outIt loves and craves the five khandhas and especially the five khandhas that it says are me So try to become wise to these things step by stepAnd then theres more love and craving love and craving for the mind attachment to the mind cherishing the mindSo straighten out the mindWherever it feels love thats where defilement isKeep going in straightening things out until youve reached the truthThen the heart will have no love or hate because they are all goneThe defilements are all goneThe mind has no love no hate no angerIts a pure principle of nature within itselfThis is the nature we truly wantInvestigating for the sake of Dhamma This is the path with mindfulness and discernment its important factorsThe cessation of stress Stress stops step by step until the path is fully capable and nirodha stops all stress in the heart without leaving a traceWhen nirodha has finished stopping stress that which knows that stress has stopped and defilement has stopped that which knows is the pure one This pure one lies beyond the Noble Truths as a marvelous extraordinary DhammaThe Noble Truths are activities conditions conventionsEven nirodha is a conventionIts the activity of stopping stressIts a conventional realityWhen stress is completely stopped nothing remainsAll that remains is an entirely pure awarenessThis is not a Noble TruthIts the purity of the mindIf you want you can call it nibbanaTheres nothing against calling it whatever you wantWhen we reach this level there are no conflicts  no conflicts no disagreements with anyone at allWe dont conflict with ourselves we dont conflict with anythingOur knowledge is wise to everything so we can say what we likeThere are no problems at allAll I ask is that you know this marvelous extraordinary DhammaIts excellence exists of its own accord without our having to confer titlesThis then is the genuine religionProbe right hereProbe on inWhen in the practice of the religion we come to know well know right hereIf the religion is to flourish it will flourish right hereThe Buddha in teaching the beings of the world to gain release from suffering taught right here  and release is gained right here nowhere elseWe qualify as beings of the world and lie within the net of the Buddhas teachingsWere in the Buddhas followingEach of us has the right to practice and remove defilement so as to go beyond suffering and stressAll of us in the four groups of the Buddhas following have the right to realize ourselves and reach nibbanaSoI ask that you contemplateInvestigateBe brave in fighting the things that should be fought within the heartDevelop courageDevelop mindfulness and discernment until they are sufficientSearch for various tactics for probing These we should develop within ourselvesTo probe on our own is the right wayIts our own wealthTeachers lend us bits and pieces which are merely fragments to serve as hints or as leads for us to contemplate so that theyll grow and branch out into our own wealthAny Dhamma thats a wealth coming from our own tactics Thats truly our own wealthWell never exhaust itIf we can think and probe cunningly in removing defilements until they fall away completely using the tactics we develop on our own from the ideas our teachers lend us as starting capital thats our own DhammaHowever much may arise its all our own DhammaWhat we derive from the texts is the Buddhas  and we borrow it from himWhat we get from our teachers we borrow from them  except when we are listening to them teach and we understand the Dhamma and cure defilement at that moment Thats our wealth while we are listeningAfter that we take their tactics to contemplate until they branch out through our own ingenuityThis is our own wealth in terms both of the causes  our contemplation  and of the outcome the satisfactory results we gain step by step all the way to release from suffering and stress  and thats entirely oursIt stays with us and no one can come to divide up any of our share at allThis is where the excellence becomes excellentIt doesnt become excellent anywhere elseSo try to find the excellence the peerlessness that lies within you by striving and being energeticOther than this awareness theres no excellence at allBut at present the heart is concealed by things that are filthy and worthless and so it too has become something that lacks its proper worthRight now we are washing it peeling away the various kinds of defilement step by stepWhen we have used our full strength to peel them all away until there arent any left in the heart then the heart is fully pureExcellence appears here in this heart  and so the excellence is excellent right hereWe dont have to search anywhere for anything more for we have fully reached the land of enoughSo thenIll ask to stop hereWe human beings are like trees If we water a tree fertilize it and keep looking after it it will be fresher and grow faster than it normally would if we let it fend for itself without our helpThe mind when we keep looking after it will become more and more radiant and peaceful step by stepIf it isnt trained its like a tree that isnt looked afterWhenever it lacks training it begins to act tarnished and defiled because the things that tarnish and defile it are already there inside itWhen we look after the mind continually with meditation it will gradually become more and more calmWhen its calm it will begin to develop radiance along with its calmAnd once its calm then when we contemplate anything we can penetrate into the workings of cause and effect so as to understand in line with the truths that appear both within us and withoutBut if the mind is clouded and confused its thoughts are all worthlessRight becomes wrong and wrong becomes progressively even more wrongThus we are taught to train the mind so that it will be quiet calm and radiant able to see its shadows just as when water is limpid and clear We look down into the water and can see clearly whatever plants or animals there areBut if the water is muddy we cant see anything when we look down into itNo matter whats there in the water  plants animals or whatever  we cant see them at allThe same holds true with the mindIf its clouded then we cant see the harm of whatever  big or small  is hidden within it even though that harm has been bad for the mind all alongThis is because the mind isnt radiantFor this reason a mind clouded with muddy preoccupations cant investigate to the point of seeing anything which is why we have to train the mind to make it radiant and then it will see its shadowsThese shadows lie buried in the mindIn other words theyre the various conditions that come out of the mindTheyre called shadows  and were forever deluded into being attached to these shadows that come from the thoughts constantly forming and coming out of the mind at all timesThey catch us off guard so that we think this is us that is us anything at all is us even though they are simply shadows and not the real thingOur belief or delusion though turns them into the real thing As a result we end up troubled and anxiousAt present the great respected meditation masters on whom we depend in the area of the practice and in the area of the mind are falling away one by oneThose who are left can barely take care of themselvesPhysically they are wearing out step by step  like Venerable Acariya KhaoTo see him is really heartrendingWhen the body reaches its final extremity its as if it had never been strong or in radiant healthTo lie down is painful to sit is painful  whatever the position its painfulWhen the time comes for pain to come thronging in the khandhas are nothing but painBut for people like this its simply a matter of the body and the khandhasIn the area of the mind they have no more problems about the behavior of the body or the khandhas at allBut as for us well were always there welcoming such problemsNo matter whether its the body or the thoughts of the mind that are acting adversely the mind begins to act adversely as wellFor example if the body is malfunctioning the mind begins to malfunction too even though there is nothing really wrong with itThis is due to the minds own fear caused by the fact that mindfulness and discernment arent up on the events surrounding the mindThis is why were taught to train our mindfulness and discernment to be capable and bold alert to events arising within the mind and around it  namely in the various aspects of the khandhas when they behave in adverse waysWe have to be alert to these thingsAll thats needed is for the mind not to be alert or for it to be deluded by these things and it will create stress and pain for itself without ceasingPain will have to come pouring in to overwhelm itEven though the body may be pained simply in accordance with its own affairs in accordance with the principles of nature the mind will still grab hold of it to cause pain for itself to burn itself if it hasnt investigated to see through these thingsIf the mind has mindfulness constantly governing and guarding it then whatever damage arises will be minor because it arises in a single spot  within the mind  and mindfulness is there at the same spot alert to the fact that this is arising that is arising good or evil is arising withinDiscernment is what unravels contemplates investigates and remedies the different preoccupations arising in the mindThings then begin to calm downBut if mindfulness is lacking things begin to get drawn outEven though thoughtformations may arise and vanish one after another countless times sañña  labels and interpretations  dont vanishThey connect things into long stretchesStress and pain will then have to connect into long stretches and gather into the heartThe heart is what then reaps all this suffering by itself because of the acts that sañña and sankhara fashionThe heart is the primary vessel for receiving both pleasure and pain  and for the most part it receives painIf it lacks mindfulness and discernment it receives only fakes and scrapsRubbishThings toxic and dangerousBut if its mindful and discerning it can pick and chooseWhatever isnt good it picks out and throws away leaving only the things of substance and worth within the heartThe heart is cooled but not with waterIt feels pleasure but not because of external thingsIts cool from the DhammaIt feels pleasure in the Dhamma  and the reason is because mindfulness and discernment are looking after itTo attend to other things is not as difficult as attending to the heartAll the burdens of the world converge at the heart and so to remove the things that have long been buried within us is very difficult workWe may even become discouraged because we see almost no results when we first beginThis is because the mind is still drifting while we workIt doesnt really focus on taking its work seriously and so results dont appear as they shouldThis makes us discouraged weak and dejectedWe give up thinking Itd be better to stop because were not getting anywhere  even though once we have stopped its not any better except that the mind has a better chance of filling itself with evil after weve stopped striving toward the goodThe assumption that says better is the work of the defilements which are all deceivers tricking us into being discouraged and weakActually even while we are striving things arent yet getting good even though we are practically dying to make them goodOur heart is ready to burst because of the effort  so how can things become good once we stopIf as we think things were to get good once we stop then no one should have to do work of any sort any moreOnce we stop everything of every sort would become good on its ownBoth within and without things would have to be goodWe wont have to do much workIts better to stopThe Dhamma isnt like the defilementsThe defilements say Its better to stop Its better all right  better for the sake of defilement not for the sake of the DhammaThe Dhamma is something with which we have to keep persevering until its good and then better and then even better continually because we dont stopThis work is our work which we do for the sake of DhammaIts not lazy work which is the work of the defilementsThe results of the work will then appear step by step because we do it without ceasingThis is how it is with the work of meditationWhen its easy we do it when its hard we do it  because its work that ought to be doneIf we dont do it who will do it for usWhen the fires of pain and suffering are consuming the heart because of the thoughts we form and accumulate why dont we complain that its hardWhen we accumulate defilement to cause stress and anxiety to the heart why dont we feel that its difficultWhy dont we complain about the stressBecause were content to do itWere not bothered with whether its easy or hardIt simply flows  like water flowing downhillWhether its hard or not it simply flows on its own so that we dont know whether its hard or notBut when we force ourselves to do good its like rolling a log uphillIts hard because it goes against the grainIn relinquishing the sufferings big and small to which the mind submits in the course of the cycle of rebirth some of the work just naturally has to be difficultEveryone  even those who have attained the paths the fruitions and nibbana easily  has found it hard at firstWhen we reach the stage where it should be easy itll have to be easyWhen we reach the stage we call hard itll have to be hard but it wont always be hard like thisWhen the time comes for it to be light or easy its easyAnd especially when weve come to see results appearing step by step the difficulty disappears on its own because were completely ready for it with no concern for pleasure or painWe simply want to know to see to understand the things on which our sights are setStudyWe should study the elements and khandhasWe should keep watch on the elements and khandhas coming into contact with usThis is an important principle for all meditatorsWe should keep watch on them all the time because they keep changing all the timeTheyre aniccam all the time dukkham all the time without respite without stopInvestigateWe should keep trying to see their affairs as they occur within us until were adept at itAs we keep investigating again and again the mind will gradually come to understand more and more profoundly straight to the heartThe heart will gradually let go of its own accordIts not the case that we investigate once and then stop waiting to rake in the results even though the causes arent sufficientThats not how it worksAll forms of striving for the good  such as meditating  have to go against the grain of the defilementsAll of the great meditation masters before becoming famous and revered by the world survived death through great effortsIf this were easy work how could we say they survived deathIt had to be heavy work that required that they exert themselves to the utmostMost of these masters have since passed awayOnly a few are leftWe hope to depend on them but their bodies are aniccam We can depend on them only for a period only for a time and then we are parted as we have seen at presentSo we should try to take their teachings inward as our masters always teaching us insideWhatever they have taught we should take inward and put into practiceThis way we can be said to be staying with our teachers at all times just as if we were to be with the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha everywhere and alwaysOur own practice is the primary mainstay on which we can rely with assuranceDepending on a teacher isnt certain or sureWe are bound to be partedIf he doesnt leave we leaveIf he doesnt go we go  because he and we all live in the same world of inconstancyThere is no difference among usWhat we can hold to though are the basic principles of his teachingWe hold to them and earnestly put them into practice so as to see the results so as to seize victory within the heartVictory of this sort is the supreme victory unsurpassed in all the worldNo other victory is its equalWe grapple to take victory over ourselves  over the defilements that we have believed to be ourselves us ours for aeons and aeonsThis is an enormous undertakingIf you play at it like children playing with dolls the defilements will crush you to bits in no time because youve been holding onto them for so longSo dont delayInvestigate so as to know clearly and let go so that the mind will be clear and free of suffering and stress and not forever in disarrayWeve been accumulating the words us and ours for countless aeonsIf the defilements were material objects what in the world could we take for comparison that would be larger than the pile of defilement craving and mental effluents the pile of us the pile of ours weve been accumulating for so longTheres so much of it that it would be beyond our strength to drag it out for comparisonsIf we were to drag it out just to pass the time between eating and sleeping  to chip at it hack at it poke at it or slash at it once or twice hoping to break through it  we wouldnt get anywhere at allWed simply be grabbing at handfuls of water one after anotherSo we have to give it our all This is where we will gain our victoryWere meditatorsWe cant back away from the fight with the defilements lying within usThe word defilement means simply this hunk of us The defilements are us ours Everything thats us is actually a pile of defilementsTheres no need to doubt thisIf we want to separate them out so as to see them piece by piece for what they actually are in line with their true nature we have to separate them using persistent effort in the area of mindfulness and discernment as our means of investigating and evaluating themWe separate the elements the four elementsEveryone in the world knows of the four elements but if we want our knowledge to go straight to the heart it has to come from the practiceIf we investigate using discernment until we see distinctly it will penetrate the heart of its own accordOnce it has reached the heart you dont have to say anything The heart will let go of its own accordOnce the knowledge goes straight to the heart relinquishment comes straight from the heartFor us to know straight to the heart and let go straight from the heart we have to investigate over and over again and again until we understandDont assume that This weve already investigated that weve already investigated by setting up expectations counting the times without seeing deeply enough to the level of letting goThe work isnt done withIt really has to reach the level of done with felt deeply within the heart which then lets goIf its really done with theres no need to investigate again because the heart has understood and can let go completelyThe elements are already elementsCognizance is an elementThe things that make contact are also elementsSights are elements sounds are elements all these things are already elementsAs for the khandhas within us the body is a khandha feelings are a khandha labels are a khandha thoughtformations are a khandha cognizance is a khandhaTheyre groups aggregates heaps bits pieces all by their very natureAs for the mind know that its the knower we have to test and comprehend in the same way as the elements and khandhas so that we wont grab hold of it as the self or as belonging to the self which would simply be creating a heavier burdenWe must investigate it with discernment so as to see it for what it truly is in just the same wayBut as Ive explained the investigation of the mind in a number of talks already you should have a fair understanding of the matter by nowIn particular when a pain arises in the body we should know distinctly that This is a feeling Thats allDont go labeling or interpreting it saying that the feeling is us the feeling is ours or that anything is ours for that would simply foster more and more defilements and bring more and more pain in to smother the heartThen when the feeling doesnt vanish that would cause even more pain in the heart and what could we possibly find to bear itPains arise in the bodyTheyve been arising ever since the day we were bornThe moment we came from our mothers womb the pain was excruciatingOnly by surviving this death did we become human beingsIf you dont call that pain what will you call itPains have existed ever since way back whenYou cant force them to change their waysThe way of pain in the body is that it continually has to show itselfOnce it arises it remains and then vanishesThats all there is to it  arises remains vanishes  regardless of whether its an external feeling or an internal feeling namely a feeling or mood in the mindIn particular feelings in the body Investigate them so as to see them clearlyThe body is the bodyWeve seen it clearly known it clearly ever since the day we were bornWe can conjure it into anything  us ours a prince a king nobility whatever however we want to conjure it  but its truth is simply a truth fixed and unalterableIt doesnt change in line with what we conjure it up to beThe body is simply the physical khandhaIt has four elements  earth water wind and fire  gathered together and called a person a woman a man classified in endless ways given this name and that but what stays the same is the body the physical heap All the parts taken together are called the physical heap which is one realityTake out any of the parts and each of them also has its realityWhen theyre gathered together the skin is skin the flesh is flesh and the same holds true for the tendons bones and so forthEven though they have names dont fall for their namesSee them simply as individual realities as a physical heapAs for the heap of feelings its not the bodyThe body isnt a feeling such as painFeeling is feelingWhether pleasure appears or pain or a neutral feeling appears its simply a separate feeling that you can see clearlyThese two khandhas  the body and feeling  are more prominent than sañña sankhara and viññana which arise at intervals and immediately vanishFeelings however even though they vanish have a period in which they remainThis you can clearly see in the practiceWhen pain arises focus on it as your target as the point to investigateDont see the pain as being yourself for that would be going against the true nature of feelings and the method of investigation and you wont be able to know the truth of the feeling as you should with your discernmentWhen you dont know the truth and persist in assuming the pain to be yourself youll increase the pain enormously within the mind because you are going against the principles of nature which are the principles of truth the Lord Buddha taughtHe taught us to investigate so as to see pain  in whichever part of the body it may arise  simply as a phenomenon that arises remains and then vanishes in its own due courseDont get entangled in itDont fashion or conjure it into being this or that if you dont want to be forever burdened with pain with never a moment to put it downSee its truth the moment it arises remains and vanishesThats all there is to feelingFerret it out so as to see it clearly with mindfulness and discernmentWhen you have focused on a feeling turn and look at the mind to see if the mind and the feeling are one and the same thingThen look at the body and the mind Are they one and the sameLook at them so as to see them clearlyWhile you are investigating dont send the mind out anywhere elseKeep it right at that one spotFor example when investigating focus on the pain so as to see it distinctlyThen turn to look at the mind so as to see this awareness distinctlyAre they one and the sameCompare themThis awareness and that feeling Are they the sameCan you make them one and the sameAnd is the body like the mindIs it like the feelingIs it similar enough to be one and the sameThereThis is the way were taught to separate things so as to see them clearlyThe body is the body  how can it be like the mindThe mind is a mental phenomenon a nature that knows but the elements of the body are elements that dont knowThe earth elements doesnt know the water element doesnt know the wind element doesnt know the fire element doesnt know  but this mental element knowsThis being the case how can they be one and the sameSimilarly with the pain Its an element that doesnt knowIts a phenomenonThese two unknowing elements are also different The feeling and the body are different sorts of thingsThey arent one and the sameHow could you make them one and the sameIn making distinctions while investigating look so as to see clearly the way things actually areTheres no need to fear deathThere is no death to the mindDont create snares to catch yourself and hurt yourselfThere is no death ie no death to the mindThere is nothing but awareness pure and simpleDeath doesnt exist in the mind which is something  unalterable and sureDeath is an assumption that has been conjured up for the mind through the power of the minds own delusionThe mind has conjured it up to deceive itselfSo once weve investigated in line with the truth  that the mind is not something that dies  what reason will we have to fear deathWhat is deathWe know that the elements and khandhas fall apartWe human beings when weve stopped breathing are called dead people At that moment the knower separates from the elements so that nothing is left but physical elements with no feelings Thats a dead personBut actually the knower doesnt die so we have to investigate in order to see this clearly with discernmentWe neednt create the issue of death to stab or snare the heart or to obstruct the path we are following for the sake of seeing and knowing the truth through investigationNo matter how great or how little the pain keep your attention well fixed on the affairs of that painUse the pain as a whetstone for sharpening discernmentSeparate the pain from the mindSeparate the mind from the painBe able to compare their every aspectBe careful not to let your attention wander while investigating so that youll be able to see and know the truth while in handtohand combat with that particular khandhaNow if it should happen that the mind dies as the world supposes  if it should die while youre making your investigation  then make sure you know what dies first and what dies afterWhen does the feeling vanishWhen does the mind vanishWhere does it vanish toActually the mind by nature is not something that vanishesHow can anyone come and make it vanishInvestigate carefully between the mind and the khandha until the truth is absolutely clear to the heart and your doubts vanishThis is called training discernment developing discernment so as to see the truthNo matter how great the pain arising at that moment it wont have the power to affect the mind at allOnce we see the mind as the mind the feeling as feeling  once discernment has seen clearly in this way that the khandhas and the mind are real in their own separate ways  they wont infringe on one another at allThe body is simply the body and stays as it isWhen the pain appears the body is still thereWhen the pain vanishes every part of the body remains in accordance with its own natureIf the feeling arises thats the feelings businessIf it remains thats the feelings businessIf it vanishes that the feelings businessThe mind is the one who knows that the pain arises remains and vanishesThe mind isnt the one who arises remains and vanishes like the body or the feelingOnce you have investigated this way until youre adept then when the chips are down investigate in the same wayYou neednt fear death because youre a warriorFear of death is not the Dhamma of the Lord BuddhaThe Dhamma is a matter of courage in the face of the truthThis is the basic principle of the svakkhata dhamma the welltaught teachingFollow in the path of this truthIf the time comes to die be ready to dieThere is no need to fear because the mind doesnt die  but be sure to know clearly what is appearing at that momentFor example the pain What is it likeLook at it so as to know its truthOnce you have seen its truth then the pain is simply a phenomenonIt doesnt have any meaning good or bad at allAnd it doesnt act as anyones enemyIts simply its own full reality displaying itself in line with natural principlesThe body is also its own reality appearing in line with its own principlesThe mind is a separate phenomenon that constantly knows and doesnt intermingle with anything elseWhen you have investigated so as to know allaround the mind extricates itself to be its own reality in full measureThe pain has its own fullness in line with its nature the body has its own fullness in line with its nature in that the mind doesnt create any turmoil trying to lay claim to anything of theirsThis being the case nothing disturbs anything elsePain no matter how great has no impact on the mindYou can smile even while great pain is arising  you can smile because the mind is something separate not involving itself with the feelingIt doesnt intermingle with the pain so as to burn itselfThis way the heart is at easeThis then is the investigation of pain so as to comprehend it by taking pain as your battlefield as a whetstone for discernment as the place where you temper and sharpen discernment by investigating and dissecting the pains that ariseSingle out the body and single out the feelingWhich will vanish first which will vanish after try to know in accordance with their truthArising and vanishing have always been a part of their nature from time immemorialRegardless of whether or not youve been aware of it these have been their inherent characteristicsAll you need to do is to investigate so as to see in line with their truth so as not to resist the Dhamma and you can live at easeSoIf the time comes to die let the body die  as the conventions of the world understand dying The body falls apart so let it fall apartWhatever is going to disintegrate let it go  but that which doesnt disintegrate remainsThat which doesnt disintegrate is this mindThis mind once it has developed discernment as a standard within itself is really like this with no flinching in the face of illness or deathThe mind is courageous and capableThere thenThis is how we investigate our affairs  the affairs of the mindWe neednt fear deathWhy fear itThe Buddha taught us not to fearThe Dhamma doesnt teach us to fearThe truth is nothing frightening because its the truthWhats frightening or emboldening about itCourageTheres nothing that calls for courageFearTheres nothing that calls for fearHere Im talking about the level where we have reached pure truthTheres no trace of the words courage or fear left in the heart at allTheres only purityBut while investigating so as to reach the truth we need to have courageWhen we are going to seize victory for ourselves we cant not have courageOtherwise well loseThis is because were following the pathWe need courage and daring with no fear or intimidation in the face of anything at allWhatever comes our way we must investigate so as to know and understand it without growing discouraged or weak so as to be intent on knowing and seeing it in line with its truth  everything of every sort that comes into the range of our awarenessThis is called being a warrior in the combat between the mind and khandhas or between the Dhamma and the defilementsCourage of this sort is proper and rightOnce weve reached the goal fear disappears courage disappears because we have gained full victoryFear and courage are no longer an issueBut right now fear and courage are a critical issue for those still on the wayDevelop courage with discretion in the areas that call for courageBe a fighter with the things that call for fight  such as feelings of pain  so as to see in line with their truthDont be afraidThe Buddha taught us not to fearFear has the same value as deathWhen the time comes things have to fall apartThats whats called death But in any event meditators have to come to know with discernment before these things undergo their transformationSpread a net of discernment around yourself on all sidesWhatever appears will be caught in the net of discernment so what is there to fearWhat is there to be anxious aboutWhat is there to knock you off balanceEverything simply follows its truth which you have already investigatedThis is how warriors investigateEven though theyre in the midst of khandhas that are a solid mass of flame theyre calm and at ease with the normalcy of a mind that has completely comprehended without being deluded by any phenomenonThis is whats meant by one who knows all aroundWhatever the symptoms displayed by the body if they are endurable we endure themWe care for the body look after it nourish it make it eat make it sleep make it drink take care of it in accordance with its natureIf its symptoms are unendurable and its simply going to go then just let it go in accordance with the ways of natureIts a truth so how can you thwart itLet it go in line with the truthThis is called letting go with knowledge that accords with the truthThe mind feels no attachment no regretsThis is the basic principle of practice for one who has attained or is about to attain victory within the heartPreviously the mind has always lost out to defilement and cravingIt has never until now defeated themFor aeons and aeons it has lived entirely under the sway of the defilements to the point where it has forgotten to realize that The defilements are the bossWere their servantBut now were going to turn over a new us using the principles of the Dhamma as means to subjugate the defilements and mental effluents that have been subjugating us or that have been the ruling elite the big bosses of the cycle of rebirth forcing the mind to go here and there for so longNow were going to set our hearts on contending with the defilements for victory so as to see the truth of everything of every sort with nothing to obscure our discernment at allAt the same time we will take victory for our own  after having been defeated for so long  using the power of unflagging mindfulness discernment conviction and perseveranceThose who have reached the realm of excellence through perseverance have a dignity that outshines that of othersAt the same time they can take pride in their own perseveranceThose who have reached the realm of excellence through gaining victory over themselves and no one else are supreme within themselves with no creation of animosity  unlike victory in war with which the world creates endless animosities like links in a chainTo gain victory over oneself though is to gain the foremost victoryAs the Dhamma saysThe things that have created turmoil for the heart causing it suffering and stress in the past now come to an absolute stopIn what I have been saying dont forget that perseverance is the important factor the factor that supports mindfulness and discernment as the trailblazers for the sake of progress in our workDiscernment is very important for investigating and exploring so as to see causes and effectsMindfulness supervises the work to keep our attention from strayingWhen discernment has investigated so as to see the truth of such things as the five khandhas the defilements will have no place to hide and so will come pouring together into one place  into the heartThey have no other place to hold onto no other place to attach themselves because all such places have been obliterated by discernmentThe next stage is to lay siege to the heart where the enemies lie gathered so as to disperse them from it until nothing is leftThereThats called the death of the defilementsThey die right there right there in the heart where theyve always beenTheyve lived there and when they die they die there through the power of the most uptotheminute supermindfulness and superdiscernment This is called full victoryThe supreme victory is won right hereThe teachings of the religion all converge at this pointThe final stage in their practice comes to an end right hereWe finish our task right hereWhen we reach the realm of release from suffering and stress we reach it right hereAside from this there is nothing no time no place no future no pastAs for the present we are wise to everything of every sortWe have no more issues no more disputesThere are no more cases in court between defilement and the mindSupermindfulness and superdiscernment have sat on the bench and handed down a death sentence for defilement and all its tribeThere is nothing left to carry on the lineage of birth and beingAt that moment defilement and all its tribe sink out of sightThis is called reaching nibbana a heart truly constant and sureAll the various conditions that used to deceive the mind no longer existAll that remains is pure awarenessEven though the khandhas  rupa vedana sañña sankhara and viññana  may form in accordance with their nature they simply go their own way which has no meaning in terms of defilement at allThe body behaves in its body way Feelings  pleasure pain neither pleasure nor pain which appear in the body  behave in the way of feelingsSañña  labels acts of recognition  behave in their own waySankhara  the various thoughtformations  behave in line with their own natureViññana  acts of noticing when external objects come into contact with the eye ear nose tongue body and mind  notice and vanish notice and vanish in line with their nature without being able to provoke the mind as before because the things that cause provocation have all been destroyed without leaving a traceThese are thus called khandhas pure and simple The mind has reached nibbana in the midst of khandhas pure and simpleThis is to reach living nibbana the mind purified of defilementThose who have reached this point you know dont ask where nibbana isAnd why should theyWhat is nibbana actuallyThe word nibbana is a nameThe nature we call nibbana is the actual thingWhen you reach the actual thing why ask the nameWhy ask for traces and signsWhat is there left to grope forThose who really know dont grope arent hungry dont lack  because they have reached enough completely of everything of every sortSoThat should be enough explanation for nowI ask that we as meditators take this and contemplate it so as to see the truth I have mentionedWe will then be complete in our hearts as I have described without a doubtSo Ill ask to stop hereTo practice is to search for principles leading to the truthTo study is like studying a plan  although people for the most part dont follow the plan  but outer plans and inner plans are worlds apartWith outer plans  like blueprints of a house or a building or maps that tell where roads and places are located  the builder examines the blueprint and follows it the traveler follows the routes that appear on the map but if he gets a map thats outofdate there are bound to be things that have come into being or been torn down that dont show on the mapThis can cause him to misunderstand and to follow the wrong routeInner plans though  such as the parts of the body the elements and the khandhas which the Buddha taught us to study and to put into practice so as to derive benefits from them  are fixed truths unchanged from the Buddhas time to the presentBut with these plans within the mind we cant act like a builder who follows the blueprint in his hands because that would go against the principle of the present which is where the Dhamma arisesFor example when we study and understand in line with the texts and then practice its hard not to speculate in reference to the texts and so when we practice or try to develop concentration in the mind well find that the mind has trouble growing still because of the disturbanceIf while practicing the Dhamma we contemplate or reflect on whatever Dhamma we have studied its bound to get all confused because the minds state is not such that these things can be contemplated pondered or compared with the mind at the moment its gathering itself together to gain strengthThis is why we shouldnt bring anything in to disturb it at allLet there simply be the Dhamma theme the meditation theme we bring in to supervise the mind as if we were charging the mind so as to give it inner strength  in other words so as to make it stillWhen the mind is still it gains inner strengthRegardless of how much or how little knowledge it has no trouble or confusion results because the mind has its footingIts secureCalmPeaceful within itself  all because of the stillness which is a gathering of energyThis isnt in the plan at all  because while we are practicing we arent concerned with the textsWere intent solely on developing concentration in the present until we gain results  peace wellbeing and various other satisfactory states  there in that momentIf this is in the plan its in the part that says Try to make the mind stay with just a single Dhamma theme  its meditation word Dont get involved with other topics at that momentIf you let it think of the texts while practicing concentration it wont be willing to stick just with that practiceA great deal of extraneous knowledge will interfere disrupting the mind until everything is a turmoil and no stillness will resultThis is called going against the plan taught by the BuddhaWhatever plans weve been given however many however much Dhamma the Buddha taught we gather it all to our own confusionIts as if we were building a hut and yet went around to gather up plans for hundredstory buildings and spread them out for a lookThey just dont go togetherThe plan for a building and the plan for a hut are as different as earth and sky and yet here we are going to gather the mind into one point which is like building a hutOnly after we have the strength can we then begin enlarging it into a buildingWhen we ultimately reach the level where we are ready to investigate there are no limits as to how broad or restricted it should beThe mind can investigate everything throughout the cosmosWhen we reach the level where we should investigate thats the level where well gain firm confirmation in the mindWell gain knowledge and all kinds of insights from our own investigationThis is where the fun lies  sifting choosing with our discernment what is right and what is wrongWell go back exploring through the Dhamma we have already studied and compare it with the causes and results in our practice until they agree and then we can set the matter to restEven though we may have already understood clearly we still have to gain confirmation to give it further support for the sake of full conviction and certaintyThis is whats meant by discernmentIts not the case that if we have no doubts then theres no reason to make comparisonsThe Dhamma of the doctrine is one thing the Dhamma of the practice is anotherWe take the Buddhas wealth and compare it with our own wealth gained from our practiceIf they match we can accept the matter and put it aside with no more concernIn particular when we practice in line with the four Noble Truths or the four foundations of mindfulness these are things that the Buddha described as being interconnectedIf we practice them one by one in line with the texts  investigating the body and then feeling and then the mind and then mental events  well be wrong the livelong day because these things by their nature are interconnected at all timesWe can investigate whichever aspect we wantWhichever aspect feels most natural to us we should start with that one firstBy and large we start out by investigating the bodyBut when a pain appears we have to let go of the body and focus on the painWe then consider the pain in relation to the body distinguishing between the two so that we understand them clearlyThen we distinguish between the pain in the body and the pain in the mind comparing them and distinguishing between them againBody feeling mind and mental events lie together in the same momentSo we separate out the body  in other words investigate it  and then separate out the feeling so as to know whether or not the body and feeling are one and the sameThen we separate the mind from the mental events within the mind so as to see that each of these events is not the same thing as the mindTo say just this much covers all four of the foundations of mindfulnessWe cant divide these things and deal with them one at a time one after another the way we take one step after another while walkingTo do so is wrongThis is the way it is with the practice When we investigate one aspect or another of the four foundations of mindfulness or the four Noble Truths they all become involved of their own accord  because they are interconnected phenomenaThe Buddha says for exampleNow the phrase the body within the body means to start out with any one of the many parts of the bodyOnce we have contemplated that part until we gain an understanding our investigation then permeates further of its own accord making us curious about this part and thatThis keeps spreading and spreading until it reaches everything in the bodyIn other words it covers everything and understands everythingThe body within the body  for example kesa hair of the head Even though we may contemplate only one hair on the head it has an impact on our understanding of how may hairs on the headAnd then connects up with how many parts of the bodyIt affects everythingIt permeates everything because everything is interrelatedNo matter what we investigate this is the way it goes in line with the principles of investigation in the area of the practice that the Noble Ones have followedFeeling It arises in our bodyFocus on whichever one point is very pronouncedInvestigate it  whichever point is more painful than the restWhen we focus on that as a starting point our investigation will spread to all other feelings because no matter where they arise they all become involved with the one mindAs soon as we investigate a feeling the mind and the feeling immediately fly toward each other and then we separate them out because the four foundations of mindfulness  contemplation of body feelings mind and mental events  are interrelated in this wayExternal feelings refer to physical feelings feelings of pleasure pain and neither pleasure nor pain in the various parts of the bodyInternal feelings refer to the feelings of pain pleasure and neither pleasure nor pain in the heartThese are also counted as feelings that occur in the hearts of ordinary people everywhereThese three kinds of feelings Even when were meditating and the mind enters into stillness it still has a feeling of pleasureBut ordinarily people usually have feelings of pain and discontent within the heartIf we dont investigate  for example if weve never practiced the Dhamma  these three feelings also exist but theyre worldly feelings not the feelings connected with the Dhamma of those who practice meditationWhen we practice and the mind is still and calm there is a feeling of pleasureIf the mind doesnt settle down and grow still as we want it to feelings of bodily and mental pain or distress ariseSometimes the mind is vacant drifting indifferent something of the sortYou cant call it pleasure or painIts simply vacant and drifting  something like that  in the mind of the meditatorThis doesnt mean vacant and drifting in the sense of someone completely obliviousIts simply a state in the mindThis is called a feeling of neither pleasure nor painAt present we arent yet aware of these things  even now when theyre very pronouncedWe arent yet aware because we dont yet have the discernmentWhen the mind becomes more refined then whatever appears whatever state arises we are bound to know and to know increasingly in line with the strength of our own mindfulness and discernmentActually these things are the bosses lording it over the heart Okay for once lets call them what they are because thats what theyve actually been all alongThe heart is their vessel their seatThats where they sitOr you could say its their toilet because thats where they defecateWhichever one comes along it gets right up there on the heartNow pain jumps up there and defecatesNow pleasure gets up there and defecatesNow a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain gets up there and defecatesThey keep defecating like this and the heart is content to let them do this because it doesnt have the mindfulness or discernment to shake them off and not let them defecateThis is why we have to develop a great deal of mindfulness and discernment so that we can fight them offMindfulness is crucialIt has to keep track constantly because its the supervisor of the workNo matter where discernment goes scrutinizing no matter what it thinks about mindfulness sticks right with itDiscernment contemplates and mindfulness follows right along with itThis is why it doesnt turn into saññaAs soon as we let mindfulness lapse discernment turns into sañña in accordance with the weakness of the mind just learning how to exploreBut once we become more proficient in the areas of both mindfulness and discernment the two stick so close together that we can say that theres never a moment when the minds attention lapses  except when we sleep at which time mindfulness and discernment dont have to work and even the defilements take a restOnce we reach this level there is never a moment where the minds attention lapsesThis is thus called supermindfulness and superdiscernmentHow could it lapseIt stays right with what knows  at all timesMindfulness and discernment exist together in this one mind and have become one and the same thingSo where could they lapseOnce mindfulness and discernment are continuous we can speak in this wayBefore we were never able to know how much the mind scrambled stumbled and fellBut when we reach the level where these things become one and the same then as soon as theres a rippling in the mind we are right there up on itInstantlyInstantlyWhatever gets thought we are progressively more and more up on itAnd especially if its a matter of defilement then mindfulness and discernment are extra quickBut if the mind is an ordinary mind it doesnt knowEven if defilements climb up and defecate on our head from dawn to dusk and from dusk to dawn we cant be aware of themIn the area of the practice we practice on our own and know on our ownThats when things become clearLets see right and wrong clearly within ourselvesLets know things clearly within ourselvesOnly then can we be certainOnce we have practiced and come to know we can be courageous in what we say and courageous within the heart with no fear that we might be speaking wrongly or venturing guessesWe are sure of ourselves from having practicedTo strip away the things that bind the heart has to be difficultFor those who are weakwilled its especially difficultThere is no way they can succeed because they keep creating obstacles for themselves whenever they are about to develop goodness or break away the binding of unawareness and craving from around the heartTo break open the binding of the wheel of rebirth depends mainly on our being earnest and intent Thats what will clear our wayThis is why living beings dont want to touch that binding dont want to break it openOur earnest intent is what will lead us to know exactly how extraordinary the things taught by the Buddha really areWhen we have this kind of earnest intent toward the Dhamma filling the heart then no matter how difficult things become we wont let that difficulty bother us or become an obstacleWe want solely to know to see to understandWe feel motivated solely to think ponder and investigate in line with the aspects of the Dhamma we want to know and seeThis has us engrossed day and night  engrossed in our desire to know and see engrossed in the results we obtain step by step engrossed in probing and cutting away the defilements and mental effluentsThese lie nowhere but in the heart  except when the heart grabs hold of external things that are harmful and toxic and brings them inward to overpower itself to no purposeThe mind thus has to probe investigate remedy and slash away inside itself because these are the things that bind the heartThe heart is what makes itself unruly and reckless roaming about collecting these things to burn itself because it doesnt have the good sense to avoid them or remedy themFor this reason we need to develop a great deal of mindfulness and discernmentThe Buddha was always teaching mindfulness and discernmentnisamma karanam seyyoUse discernment to consider before doing anything in order to guard against errorBoth in inner and outer activities mindfulness and discernment are always importantBut usually when the mind thinks of doing anything we dont consider it firstEven if we dont consider things while we think of doing them we should at least consider them when the mind has made contact with one matter or another and trouble arises as a resultBut usually we dont see the harm of our own recklessness and this is why we never learnSo we keep thinking and acting in our old ways repeatedly and the results are thus unceasing stressWe shouldnt guess we shouldnt anticipate what the practice will be likeWhere is heavenDont guess about itWhere are the Brahma worldsDont waste your time anticipatingWhere is stressIts causeIts cessationThe pathDont anticipate their being anywhere outside the body and mind that are in contact with each other and with these various things at all timesFocus right here so as to see the truth in line with the principles of the DhammaYoull know whats outside youll know whats insideEspecially when you know whats inside thats when youll gain insight into everything that exists in line with your temperament and abilities without your anticipating itThe mind will simply know of its own accordYour basic problem is that you dont yet know yourself inside and simply want to know whats outsideThis will only make you agitated and confused without serving any purposeIf you want to gather matters into yourself so as to see the truth then What is hellAnd where is itIf you want to know hell then go aheadWhere is itWhere is the suffering that the defilements dig up the suffering they produce in ascending stagesIf it doesnt lie in the body and mind where does it lieIf when you let yourself fall into hell and the fires of hell burn you day and night you still dont know where hell is then where else are you going to look for itBring things inward in this way so as to know the truth the Noble Truths that lie within youOnce you know the Noble Truths youll understand every pit in hell without having to ask anyoneThink of how much the Buddha and his Noble Disciples knew about hell  and yet who told them about itHow is it that they were able to know and see to the point of teaching us into the presentHeaven is the enjoyment the sense of exhilaration in the Dhamma in the goodness and merit that lie within the heart causing it to be calm and at peaceThis is your heavenly treasure The Brahma worlds lie with the levels of the mindNo matter which level of the Brahma worlds you want to reach they are all levels of the mind that indicate on their own that this mental state corresponds to this level or that and that have the characteristics of those levelsFor this reason you have to put this one  the mind  into good shape into proper shapeDont go concerning yourself with anything other than thisEvery day every night we should probe into our own minds together with the things that become involved with themThe important factors are the body  this is very important  and the five khandhasThese things are always making contact because they have been together with us since way back whenThings outside  sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations  sometimes subside but the five khandhas and the heart are always together and always at issue with one anotherThere is no one who can decide these issues and put an end to them unless we use mindfulness and discernment as our judges to make a decision that will put the case to restNormally rupa vedana sañña sankhara and viññana lie right with us with the heartThey are interconnected and interrelated to the point where no one can untangle the case and pass a verdict because we dont have the discernment to deliberate and decide what verdict to passSo we simply let issues arise all the time That hurtsThis achesIm afraid Ill faintIm afraid Ill die We really are afraid  as if by fearing to the utmost straight to the heart we could somehow escape deathThis fear of death We really fear it and yet we dont know what death is or who diesAs long as we havent investigated down to the foundation of death well have to fear it all the livelong dayBut once we have investigated down to the foundation of death what is there to fear because nothing in the world diesThere is simply the change the exchange of the various elements and thats allChange is something we already knowThe Dhamma has taught us Inconstancy  things are always changingStress  where is there if not right hereNotself  this already tells us  what is there of any substance thats us or themThe Dhamma tells us with every word every phrase and yet we prefer to fly in the face of the DhammaWe want that to be us we want this to be oursThis wanting is an affair of defilement Thats not us its simply defilement from head to toe  or isnt itIf it were to become our self as we say it is wouldnt it be a heap as big as a mountainIf every defilement of every sort were to be gathered together who knows how many millions of mountains theyd beWe wouldnt be able to carry them at allWhat we already have is more than we can handleSo we should investigate these things to see them clearly and then cut them away one mountain at a timeOtherwise well be unable to walk because well be full of the mountains of every persons every sort of defilement and of every sort of suffering that defilement has created to be borne on top of the heart for such a long long timeWe should learn our lessons in line with what the Dhamma has taught us so that we will have some place to put down our burden of sufferingFeelings  these characters These are our enemiesAll they offer us are feelings of pain or distress arising in the mind  sometimes on their own with no connection to the bodyThe body may be perfectly normal but because of our preoccupations feelings of pain can manage to arise in the mindIf we think of something that stabs at the heart a feeling of pain or distress arisesIf we think in a way that will extricate us a feeling of pleasure arisesWhen the mind rests and stays neutral within itself thats a feeling of equanimitySeeWe can clearly see them like this  if we reflect so as to see themIf we arent observant if we dont investigate them we wont see them to our dying dayWe will simply die in vainDont go thinking that we can gain knowledge and insight and free ourselves of suffering without making an effort to strive and investigateMany many living beings have died in failure because of their complacencyIn investigating dont set up any anticipations that you would like to have your different feelings disappearThat would only be increasing the cause of stressSimply look inside the feeling itself when it arisesUse your mindfulness and discernment to contemplate without letupInvestigate until you understandSañña This is very importantNormally sañña is something very importantWhen pain arises the pain is important but pain doesnt arise all the timeAs for sañña it keeps right on labelingThis is very important very subtle very delicate and refinedIts deceptive which is why it has us deceivedSankhara is what hands things over to sañña which elaborates on them to the point where they become endless and unstoppable unless we use mindfulness and discernment to act as a blockViññana is what takes noteAs for sañña  labeling and interpreting  it has a big job to do running around stirring up all kinds of trouble throughout the bodySañña is what hoodwinks the heart making it fall for labels until it cant see the harm they wreak in the five khandhasSañña is the primary culpritMeditation circles are well aware of it which is why they warn usWhen the mind has things like this burying it obstructing it and coercing it it cant display even the least little bit of ingenious strategy because they have it overpoweredFor this reason we have to force the mind to investigate and unravel its various preoccupations so that it can see its way clearIts various labels and interpretations are gradually peeled off or removed step by stepMindfulness and discernment are then freed to think and develop more of their own strengthWhen we reach the stage where mindfulness and discernment come out to investigate nothing can stay hiddenMindfulness and discernment will probe into everything into every nook and cranny understanding continually more and more  engrossed in their contemplations and explorations engrossed in the results that keep appearing  because to probe with discernment is a direct way of cutting defilement away so that we see results step by step without pauseConcentration is simply a tactic for herding the various defilements into one focal point so that we can rectify or destroy them more easilyTo put it simply concentration is strength for discernmentWhen the mind gathers in the levels of concentration it is content to work from various angles in the area of mindfulness and discernmentWhen its working the results of its work appearThe defilements fall away one after anotherThe heart becomes engrossed in the results of its work and investigates even more never having its fill like spring water flowing continually throughout the rainy seasonSo focus right hereDont go anywhere elseThe Noble Truths are right here in the body and heartUltimately they come down solely to the heartProbe down into the heartHow is it that we dont knowWhere did the Buddha knowHe knew right here in the area of these four Noble TruthsHe knew in the area of these four foundations of mindfulness which lie in the bodies and hearts of us allThe Buddha knew right here and he taught right hereSo investigate to see clearly right hereDefilement the paths the fruitions and nibbana lie right hereDont imagine them to be anywhere elseYoull simply be pouncing on shadows outside of yourself and grasping fistfuls of water without ever meeting with the real DhammaIn focusing your investigation when a feeling arises in the mind  as for feelings in the body weve discussed them at great length already  when a feeling of stress or pain such as a mood of distress arises within the mind focus on that feeling of distressTake that feeling of distress as the target of your watchfulness and investigationKeep alert to itDont set up any desires for it to vanish once it has appeared in the mindMake yourself aware that the feeling of distress arising in the mind has to have a causeIt cant just come floating in without a causeIf you dont know its cause focus on the result  the distress itself  as the hearts preoccupationKeep aware right at the heartFocus on contemplating and unraveling the feeling of distress right thereDont let go of that feeling to go looking or investigating elsewhereOtherwise you will make the mind waver without ever being able to establish a foothold and it will become shiftless and irresoluteHowever long that distress will have to last keep looking at it to see if its really constant solid and lastingYour mind is something more lasting than the feeling so why wont it be able to investigate itThe feeling arises only for a period and then vanishes when its time is up when it no longer has any supporting conditionsSince the mind by its nature is something that knows then even though a feeling of distress arises it still knowsWhether there is a little distress or a lot it knows  so why wont it be able to investigate the distressIt has to endure the distress because the mind is already a fighter and an endurerSoHowever great or little the distress fix your attention on that spotDont set up any desires for it to disappearSimply know the truth of the feeling as it arises and changesKnow right there and know its every phase heavy or light great or little until it finally disappearsAnd when the feeling of distress dissolves away from the heart through your focused investigation know what feeling arises in its placeKeep knowing step by stepOnly then can you be called an investigatorDont hold fast to any feelings  whether of pleasure or of equanimityKnow that they too are feelings and are individual conditions separate from the mind  and so they can changeThis one comes in that one dissolves away this one takes its place They keep at it like this in line with the common nature of feelings because the seeds are constantly in the heart enabling these three kinds of feelings to appearOnce the mind has absolutely no more seeds of any sort no feelings or moods of any sort will appear in the mind at all aside from paramam sukham  the ultimate ease thats part of the nature of a pure heartThis doesnt count as a feelingWhen the Buddha says nibbanam paramam sukham  nibbana is the ultimate ease  thats not a feeling of ease stress or equanimity and so its not subject to arising and disappearingWhen focusing your investigation on all three of these feelings take the feelings themselves as your battlegroundFocus on watching them carefully and in full detailKeep watching each one as long as it hasnt yet disappearedWatch it againKeep watching until you know its truthWhether or not it disappears isnt importantWhats important is that you know the truth of this feeling  the one appearing in the presentThis is called contemplating feeling as a foundation of mindfulnessUsually this refers to feelings of distress or pain because these are the ones that are most striking and unsettling to the heartAs for feelings of pleasure theyre a waystation for the mindYou could say that they help us or that they are the results that come from investigating feelings of distress until the distress disappears and pleasure appearsThis is one of the results that comes from investigating feelings of distress or painAs for whether or not we should do away with feelings of pleasure as far as Ive noticed Ive never seen them being eliminatedFeelings of pain or distress are the important ones within the mindThey arise from the seeds of defilementOnce these seeds are lessened step by step the feelings of mental pain become more and more refined more and more refinedThey gradually fade away until they disappear without leaving a trace in the mind because the seeds are goneWhen these seeds are gone that type of pleasurable feeling also disappearsIt disappears because it relies on those seeds to ariseThus we can say that the feelings of pleasure that arise in the heart from practice or from the basis of the mind  the stillness of the mind the radiance of the mind  qualify as viharadhamma dwelling places for the mind waystations for the mind on its journeyOr we could say that theyre the results that come from investigating feelings of painWhether or not we investigate this pleasure is not as important as investigating feelings of pain and their causes  which are very important because they are in a direct sense the origin of stressThey give rise to stress as their direct resultIn the context of the four Noble Truths the Buddha teaches us to diagnose stress but why doesnt he teach us to diagnose pleasureWhat does pleasure come fromHe doesnt say  because it arises from the path doing its duty until the cause of stress disintegrates and pleasure arises in its steadNow when the stress thats part and parcel of defilement disappears this type of pleasure disappears as well but another kind of pleasure or ease appears along with the heart that has been purified  and this doesnt disappear with anything at allNow as for concentration When youre going to make the mind still you really have to make it stay with its theme of tranquillity meditationDont go concerning yourself with the topics youve been investigating because the mind has to restYou cant not let it restWhen the time comes to rest it needs restNo matter how great the results and accomplishments you get from your practice of investigation the heart can still grow tired and wearyYour work  your thinking and pondering in the area of discernment or whatever  is all work for the mindWhen the mind has been thinking pondering and investigating for a long time it can grow weary and so it has to restWhen the time comes to rest you shouldnt involve yourself with any work at allSet your mind solely on performing your duties for the sake of mental stillnessThis is called working without overstepping your boundaries without being worried about what went before or will come after without overflowing your banksThe heart will then have the strength to continue its work with clear insight and discernmentWhen you want stillness of mind so as to provide strength for discernment you should set your mind on the theme that will make the mind still and then stick right with it until the mind is still right then and thereOnce the mind has been still long enough to gain strength you can then withdraw from that stillnessNow you start probingYou dont have to concern yourself with stillnessYour duty is to investigate step by stepThis is called the correct way  the appropriate way the uniform way  to follow the path of tranquillity and insight all the way to the goalAll of these are problems Ive been through myselfWhen I would get engrossed in something Id be so stuck that Id get addicted and heedlessId get addicted to the stillness the sense of comfort and ease in concentrationWhen Id get engrossed in investigating Id be so engrossed that Id forget myself and wouldnt let the mind rest at allNeither of these ways is correctIn other words neither is in keeping with what is just rightThe right way is that when the mind feels tired and weary from its work we have to let it rest in stillnessWhen the time comes to investigate we have to investigateWe cant worry about anything elseWe have to set our mind on our duties step by step in keeping with the job at handThis is always the appropriate way to proceed with tranquillity and insightThere is no job in the world bigger than the job of removing defilement of removing oneself from the cycle of wheeling around from birth to death for countless lifetimesWhen we think about it its really dismaying  circling around from birth to death carrying a load of nothing but suffering and stressNo matter what the level the only difference is that the stress is less or more because all levels have stress inasmuch as they contain the defilements that give rise to stressSo how can they not have stressAll living beings have to suffer stressThe Buddha thus taught us to rid ourselves of all defilement until there is nothing left hidden in the mindLet there simply be the pure meat Dont let there be any bones or theyll be bad for your healthDefilements no matter what the sort need to be cleansed away peeled away until nothing is leftThis is why its called a very big jobThere are times when we have to give it our all  all our skill all our mindfulness and discernment even our life  to an extent that we will never forgetSoIf were going to die then lets dieIf not then lets know it Thats all there isThere can be nothing elseThis is when the mind is its own mainstayAtta hi attano natho It can take care of itselfIn other words we leave it to the minds own strengthWhen the mind is whirling in for the sake of the realm beyond suffering as if nibbana were always just coming into reach while whats behind us keeps pressing in and we realize more and more its danger and harm theres only one way to escape the Great DangerIf were going to die then lets dieIf not then lets know the Dhamma Wherever we are we dont want to stayWherever were stuck we dont want to be stuckIts a waste of our time in gaining release from sufferingWeve simply got to reach release from sufferingThis is the only thing that can satisfy such a mind at such timesWhen the mind is this way where is it going to find any weakness or lazinessIf things get tough we fightIf theyre easy we fightIf were going to die we still fight until we have no more breath to breathe  and thats when the mind finally stays putIt cant possibly be movedOnce it knows and reaches the goal it stays put on its ownNo matter where you chase it it wont goDiscernment  which has been spinning itself in circles even more than a wheel  when the time comes stops on its ownIt simply runs out of duties of its own accord without our having to turn it off the way we do with motorsThis automatic mindfulness and discernment simply stops or turns off on its own  because it already knows so what else is there to investigateIt has already let go so what else is there to let goIt already knows so what else is there to knowIt has had enough so where else is it going to look for enoughIt knows all of this within itselfIt knows in an instant and is releasedIn other words it knows for the last timeThis is where the big job is finishedThe job is big and the results are enormousNothing in any of the three worlds can compareThe results of this big job this heavy job you know excel the world  and how could we say that ultimate ease doesnt excel the worldWhen excellence stands out filling the heart its far different from defilement standing out filling the heartWhoever wants to know has to practice for him or herselfNo one else can do it for usWhen we reach the level of excellence we excel exclusively within without disturbing anyone elseThis Dhamma is always timelessIt has been the guarantor of the paths fruitions and nibbana from the time of the Buddha to the presentNo one will ever be able to erase itThe Buddha excelled the world because of this DhammaThe arahant disciples whom we revere as our refuge all excelled because of this Dhamma of purity  and because of this heavy jobWhen our Teacher has led us to proceed in this way what business do we have shillyshallying aroundWe cant act only in line with our preferences because our Teacher didnt lead us in that wayOur foremost Teacher was a genius an utterly genuine person unequaled by anyoneBut were a bunch of showoffs doing only what our Teacher criticized and so we keep meeting only with things worth criticizingDont we ever think of changing or do we feel were being stylish and uptodateActually the path to cure defilement has to be difficultThe path to accumulate defilement is easy  because our preferences fool us into thinking its easyActually both paths are hardWhatever the job the important point is which job we preferWell see that job as easyLightComfortableAt first when we were starting out with the job of curing defilement we werent getting anywhere at allEven though we were set on curing defilement the work was heavy and we were weak and lazyEverything bad and worthless was gathered right thereBut now that we gradually come to comprehend causes and effects and to understand the Dhamma the results have begun to appearWhere has our laziness goneAll thats left is diligence and persistenceWe can contend with anything heavy or light  we can contend with death  because we have begun seeing resultsEven though we have been curing defilement all along the difference is that at one stage we dont see results and at another we do  and persistence really arisesSoIf things get heavy we fightWere disciples of the Tathagata and so we have to follow in our Teachers footstepsOur Teacher met with difficulties so his disciples will have to meet with difficultiesOur Teacher passed out two or three timesIs there anyone among us who has passed out from the effort of the practiceI dont see anyone who hasSo why are we afraid of dying when weve never even passed outHow can we be so stubborn in our fear of deathThe Lord Buddha lost consciousness three or four timesWhat do we have to say to thatWhen we lose consciousness its because we are falling asleepWhy arent we afraid of dying thenSo why are we afraid of dying when we practice meditationExactly what diesWhen we have explored and seen the truth we wont fear death  because nothing in the world diesAll there is is the mind making its assumptionsIt deceives itself  Im afraid of dying Im afraid of dying  but when it knows the truth of everything of every sort its not afraidIts not afraid of deathIts not afraid of birth  because it has nothing left to be bornSo what is there to fearWhy bother with these empty hollow fearsThe mind is now released from birth so why be afraid of birthThere are no more seeds for the birth of a body a man or a womanThere is nothing to fear nothing to be brave aboutThe mind is even with itself  uniform unchanging  not even in the ordinary sense of coming out even Its even in the sense of a mind that has reached sufficiency even in its excellenceHere Ive been talking about a heavy task but also about the results as a means of encouragement as a means of giving the mind something to hold toThe results are superlative in keeping with the difficulties and hardships of the practiceWhat do we want in our livesWe all want what is goodEven in external things we want what is good so especially in the area of the Dhamma why shouldnt we want what is goodThen step up your effortsWhat does it matter if the cemeteries cry because they miss youYou have been crying over the cemeteries so whats wrong with letting the cemeteries cry in turnThey have no more hopes nowYou arent coming back to be born or dieThe cemeteries being without hope is better than your being without hope because theres nothing good about birth and death circling around back and forth with nothing but suffering and stress every lifetimeSo work out solutions  and make them succeedWhatever things are thorns in the heart use mindfulness and discernment to explore to probe on down and remove them completely so that theyre all goneOnce theyre all gone thats the result of your workWeve talked about how hard the work is What are the results likeAre they worth itFind out for yourself  and then you are free to live wherever you likeThe Buddha saysvusitam brahmacariyamThe holy life is fulfilled the task of the religion is done This is now completely apparent in every wayWhatever is stressful is a matter of defilementWhen the cause  defilement  is ended the result  stress  is ended as wellThats all there isFrom then on there is nothing but ultimate ease which nothing will ever again come to disturb throughout eternityWherever theres the religion its cool and peacefulWherever a person practicing the religion is lacking its hot and troubledIf theres no religion the heart is as hot as fireWhenever theres the religion  mindfulness and discernment  investigating looking after the heart the heart is coolWhen we first begin suppressing the rebels in the heart we suffer  because for the most part were defeated by them  but at least we still have the strength to fight with themEven though we may lose out to them sometimes its better than groveling before them in abject surrender with no way of putting up a fight at allThe practice in the area of the mind falls into stages  and there are bound to be stages where its complicated and difficultEspecially at the beginning Its difficult in that we cant see beginnings or ends causes or effectsWe dont understand anything at allWhen we take the rudiments of Dhamma we have gained from the texts or our teachers and put them into practice sometimes right sometimes wrong this is when its very difficultThe desire to know and see is very strong but the heart isnt willing to complyThis is one kind of anxiety Ive been through myselfIt overflowed the heartTo put it simply it was as if the desire to see and know the Dhamma in the heart was ready to overflow its banksBut when practicing the heart didnt comply with the desire to know and see  and that had me upset and disappointedSometimes Id be sitting and the tears would flow because of my selfrecriminations You dont have any potential to speak ofYouve ordained simply to be a dead weight on the religionHere you are sitting in meditation and cant find a way in or a way outYoure just sitting buried in a heap of suffering The mind would think in all sorts of ways out of selfpity  that I was a hopeless case that I didnt have any potential to speak of didnt have the potential for the extraordinary levels of Dhamma didnt have any potential at all  total confusionActually my practice wasnt yet rightI was aiming at the results  the income  without paying attention to whether I was doing the work right or wrongThe desire was strong but when it wasnt fulfilled it caused sufferingHad I paid some attention to whether my practice was right or wrong I might have come to my senses enough to have evaluated things to have abandoned some of my bullheaded attachments or to have cut back on my desires so that the suffering would have become lighterBut whenever Id meditate whatever Id focus on all I wanted was to know and see the paths the fruitions and nibbana in line with what I imagined them to be  heaven was like this the Brahma worlds were like that nibbana was like thisId imagineSpeculateThe desire was fierceI wanted to know to see to gain release from suffering but my practice wasnt making any headwayAll there was was simple desire I would simply sit wanting lie down wanting walk wanting stand wantingId sit in meditation  wanting  but the mind wasnt working at its meditationIt just wantedId be doing walking meditation but the mind simply wanted  so much so that Id forget what I was doingI wasnt getting any results because there werent enough of the causes that would bring about the things I aimed for so how could I have reached the goal I aimed forThis is something Ive been throughThe work of meditation struck me as being more difficult than any other workId be meditating buddho buddho buddho but the desire would always be getting in the way  because I wanted to know I wanted the mind to be like this or that and so Id get engrossed in my desires and forget my work of meditation until I didnt know where buddho had goneAs a result I didnt get anywhere at allI was constantly feeling dreary and disappointedThis is the way things always were in the heartBut even so this wasnt anything compared to the stage at which the mind regressedWhen the mind regresses its really upsetting because you used to see resultsYou used to gain a sense of ease mental stillness and peace appearing clearly as a solid foundation in the heart but now its deterioratedThis makes the heart really agitated  so much so that there is nothing to hold it in checkLuckily though in spite of my agitation I didnt retreatI was simply determined to see things throughI wasnt willing to retreat or to slacken my effortsThe reason why the mind regressed and couldnt make a comeback was the same sort of thing desire nothing mysteriousThe mind wanted to know and see as it had before but its work wasnt coordinated or continuousAll there was was desireNo matter how much you desire it doesnt give any results because that would go against the principle of causalityIf you dont make the causes as complete as they should be how can you expect to know as you wantYou cantSitting Id be agitatedLying down Id be agitatedId go into the forest into the mountains when the mind had regressed and nothing was any good at allI couldnt figure it outOf the anxieties Ive felt in my life as a monk the anxiety I felt during that period was the worstI was agitated because of my desire to attainI was upset because the mind had regressed and nothing I could do would bring it backAt first it had regressed just a little bit and then it kept regressing regressing until it was all goneNothing was left not one red centIt was as if I had never meditated at allWhen Id sit in this state I was as agitated as if I were on fire  because of the desireThe disappointment that my attainments had floated away and disappeared plus the desire to get them back These two things came thronging in at the same time and so were really strongWherever I stayed was unsatisfactory and no help at allEven though I was suffering I would simply keep sufferingI didnt know any way outEven though I wanted I would simply keep wantingI didnt know how to get my concentration backAll there was was desire  regret for the things that had once appeared to my surprise and amazement but now were goneThere was nothing but disappointment filling the heart nothing but simple desire and it couldnt bring back the Dhamma that had disappearedFinally I came to feel despair  for everythingThis was when the mind gave up on its desireAs for the results I had wanted well I had wanted them for a long timeAs for the suffering I had suffered immensely because of the desires but hadnt gained anything from themSo now I wouldnt have anything to do with themId throw them all outIf I was going to know Id knowIf not so be itAll I was after was buddho Whatever the mind was going to think I wouldnt be willing to let mindfulness lapseGet with it thenCan it really be that Im not going to knowWhatevers going to happen Im ready for itAs soon as I gave up on my desires they were no longer so fierce and so the suffering gradually lessenedI set my mind on my workWherever I was Id keep repeating buddho buddho buddho It had always been a trait with me to be earnest Whatever Id do I would really do it and wouldnt just play aroundNow I got to see this trait in actionI didnt let up in my repetition of buddho Whether walking or doing my chores I wouldnt be willing to let it lapseId keep making the effortWhile sweeping the monastery compound I would try to keep up my guard  until the mind let its work lapse for a momentI was alert to the fact and the mind got right back to workThereNow thats the way it should beAfter giving up its desires the mind was no longer involved with the pastIt stayed in the circle of the present and would do nothing but repeat or meditate on buddho Whether or not it would get any results would depend on what buddho would grantFinally the mind became still and buddho was no longer necessary so I could let go of the meditation word at that moment  and at that point the mind was willing to settle downBefore it hadnt been willingWhen the mind had settled down in stillness there was no need to repeat the word buddho All that remained was simple awareness  clear and conspicuous  so the mind stayed with that simple awarenessAs soon as it withdrew I would start pumping buddho back inI had no hopes because I had already hoped in the pastI had no hopes for what would happen no hopes for what the results would beI had already hoped in the past and it hadnt given me any decent results at allI had seen the harm of hopes  the sort of hollow unreasonable hopes that wont do the work and look only for the resultsSo now I was going to do nothing but work nothing but work repeating buddho without letting up even for a momentOnce the mind had received proper nourishment and care it became still  gradually more and more still more and more steady until it reached the level it had been before it had visibly regressedWhat was strange was that when it reached its old level I still abandoned my hopesIf its going to regress let it regressIve had enough of trying to resist it by using desire which hasnt served any purpose not the least little bitSo however the mind is going to regress let it regress but I wont abandon buddho Im always going to keep at itWhen it reached the day when it would normally regress it didnt regressThat made me a lot more sure of the causesSo I stepped up the causes  the repetition of buddho  even more without stoppingI would stop only when the mind gathered in stillnessThe mind became progressively more and more firmWherever Id sit it would be brightLightCompletely clearI was sure of myself Now its not going to regress After one day two days one month two months it still didnt regressBefore the mind would regress after two or three daysAfter two or three days it would come down with a crash with nothing left to show for itselfId have to keep trying to care for it for or days before it would reach its old level and once it got there it would stay just a day or two and then collapse in a flash with nothing left at allAll that was left was dreariness and disappointmentNow If its going to regress let it regressIve hoped in the past and it hasnt served any purposeAll Im after is this just this one thing buddhoFrom then on the mind kept progressingMonth after month it became more and more stable more and more firmAs for my meditation word I wasnt willing to let up on itThis kept up until the mind was always prominentThat was when I let the meditation word goIn other words the awareness of the mind was pronounced and that was enough for the mind to depend on so there was no need to rely on any meditation word for further supportThe mind fully knew itself and could sustain itselfAt this point I didnt have to repeat any meditation word because the mind was prominent at all timesI would focus right thereWherever I went I focused right thereI knew right there just as I had focused on buddho It could form a fine foundation for the mindI was sure of myself thatThis foundation had become progressively more and more stable until it was more stable than it had been the first time it had progressed and then regressedAs for focusing on awareness when awareness was fully pronounced I should focus on that without letup in the same way I had focused on repeating buddho until the mind became more and more refinedThis was a foundation for the mind on which I could dependFrom that point on I really stepped up my effortsThe time I started sitting in meditation all night until dawn came from this pointI started to sit one night focusing on in focusing on in and at first the mind had settled down because it was used to settling downIt settled down easily because it had a good foundation I kept focusing on in and as long as no enormous pains arose the meditation went quietlyBut when I withdrew a number of hours had passed and a huge pain arose to the point where I almost couldnt bear itThe mind that had been quiet was totally overturnedIts good foundation had collapsed completelyAll that was left was pain filling the body  but the mind wasnt agitatedStrangeThe body was so pained that it was quivering all overThis was the beginning of the handtohand combat in which I was to obtain an important approach  when really severe pain arose unexpectedly that nightI hadnt yet made up my mind to sit until dawn you knowI hadnt made any resolutions or anything at allI was simply sitting in meditation as usual as usual but when the pain arose in full force EhWhats going on hereIll have to tackle this feeling so as to see results tonight So I made a resolution in that very moment Okay if the time doesnt come to get up I wont get upIll fight until the dawn of the new dayTonight for once Im going to investigate pain so as to understand it clearly and distinctlyIf I dont understand it then even if I die let me dieLet me find outSo dig down This is when discernment really began to work in earnestI had never known never imagined never dreamed that discernment would become so sharp when it was at the end of its rope when it was really cornered with no way outDiscernment really started spinning awayIt went out digging exploring fighting determined not to withdraw its troops in retreatWhen I was at the end of my rope discernment aroseThis made me realize We human beings arent fated to be stupid foreverWhen were at the end of our rope were sure to manage to find a way to help ourselves So it was then When I was cornered overwhelmed by severe pain mindfulness and discernment probed into the painWhen pain arises in full force like this it fills the entire bodyAt first it started in hot flashes along the backs of my hands and feet which wasnt much to speak of but then when it really flared up into something big the entire body was ablazeAll the bones as they were connected were fuel feeding the fire in every part of the bodyIt was as if the body were going to fall apart right then and thereThe neck bones were going to come apartEvery bone was going to come apart from its connectionsMy head was going to fall off and hit the floorWhen its pained everything is on a par throughout the bodyYou dont know where to hold it back enough so that you can breathe because everywhere theres nothing but a mass of fire  pain in full forceWhen I couldnt find a safe spot in which to place the mind mindfulness and discernment dug down into the pain searching for the spot where the pain was greatestWherever the pain was greatest mindfulness and discernment would investigate and explore right there by ferreting out the pain so as to see clearly Where does this feeling come fromWho is pained When they asked each part of the body each of them remained in keeping with its natureThe skin was skin the flesh was flesh the tendons were tendons and so forthThey had been that way from the day of birth but they hadnt been painful all along from the day of birth in the same way that they had been flesh and skin from the day of birthThe pain has been arising and vanishing at intervalsIt hasnt been lasting like these parts of the bodyI focused on downEach part of the body thats a physical form is a realityWhatever is a reality stays that wayRight now where is the feeling arisingIf we say that all these things are painful why is there one point where its really severe So I separated things outAt this point mindfulness and discernment couldnt slip away anywhere elseThey had to run along the areas that hurt whirling around themselves separating the feeling from the body observing the body observing the feeling and observing the mind These three are the important principlesThe mind seemed comfortableNo matter how much pain was arising the mind wasnt writhing or suffering or anythingBut the pain in the body was clearly very strongThe nature of pain and of whatever defilements we have is that they join togetherOtherwise the mind wont be troubled or affected by the physical pain thats really severe at that momentSo discernment kept digging down until the body the feeling and the mind were all clear each in line with its individual truthThe mind was what labeled the feeling as being this or that This I could see clearlyAs soon as this was really clear in this way the feeling disappeared in a flashAt that moment the body was simply the body in line with its realityThe feeling was simply a feeling and it disappeared in a flash into the mindIt didnt go anywhere elseAs soon as the feeling disappeared into the mind the mind knew that the pain had vanishedThe pain had vanished as if it had been snapped off and thrown awayIn addition the body disappeared from my sense of awarenessAt that moment the body didnt exist in my awareness at allAll that was left was simple awareness because there was only one thing  awareness  and it was simply awareThats allThe mind was so refined that you could hardly describe itIt simply knew because it was extremely delicate and refined within itselfThe body had completely disappearedFeelings had disappearedNo physical feelings were left at allThe body sitting right there in meditation had disappeared from my awarenessAll that was left was simple knowingness without any thoughts being fashioned about this or thatAt that point the mind wasnt forming any thoughts at allWhen it doesnt form thoughts we say that nothing at all makes the slightest moveThe mind is fixed  firmly fixed in its own solitudeIts a mind in its simple form on the level of a mind centered in stillness  but mind you this doesnt mean that there was no unawarenessUnawareness had infiltrated right there because the mind hadnt withdrawn from unawarenessThe mind and unawareness were quiet together because unawareness didnt get out to workWhen discernment has it surrounded unawareness shrinks in and hides out quiet in the heart like the sediment in the bottom of a water jarAt that point I began to feel amazedThere was no pain leftThe body had disappearedOnly one thing hadnt disappeared an awareness so refined I couldnt describe itIt simply appeared thereYou couldnt say anything else about itThe thing that simply appeared there That was the great marvel at that momentThere was no motion in the heart no rippling nothing of anything at allIt stayed fixed and still like that until enough time had elapsed and then it movedThe mind began to withdraw and rippled  blip  and then was quietThis rippling happens on its own you knowWe cant intend itIf we intend it the mind withdrawsWhat happens is that the mind has had enough of its own accordWhen it ripples in a blip like this its aware of the factAs soon as the blip appears it vanishesAfter a moment it ripples  blip  again and disappears in the same instantThen the rippling gradually becomes more and more frequentWhen the mind withdraws after having fully settled down to its foundation it doesnt withdraw all at onceI could clearly see this at that momentThe mind rippled slightly A sankhara formed in a blip and then disappeared before it had amounted to anything at allIt rippled  blip  and disappeared right then and thereAfter a moment it rippled  blip  againGradually it became more and more frequent until finally I came back to ordinary consciousness to the ordinary level of the mindI was aware of the body but the pain was still goneWhen the mind came back out there was still no painIt was still quiet until time came for the pain to reappearThis is where I got my standard and my certaintyI realized that I had arrived at a basic principle in contending with pain So this is how it isPain is actually something separateThe body is separateThe mind is separate but because of one thing  delusion  all three converge into one and the whole mind becomes delusion the whole mind is the one deludedEven though pain may simply arise in line with its own nature if we grab hold of it to burn ourselves its hot  because our labeling makes it hotAfter a fair while the pain returned so I had to tackle it again without retreatingI had to dig on down exploring again as I had explored before but this time I couldnt use the tactics I had used in investigating and remedying the pain the last time aroundI needed fresh tactics newly devised by mindfulness and discernment so as to keep up with eventsIt was pain just the same but the tactics simply had to be pertinent to the momentI couldnt remedy matters by holding to the old tactics I had used to investigate and know in the pastThey had to be fresh hot tactics devised in the present to cure the presentThe mind then settled down firmly in stillness as it had done beforeIn that first night the mind settled down three times but I had to go through three bouts of handtohand combatAfter the third time dawn came  the end of the final showdown using reason with real mindfulness and discernmentThe mind was audacious exultant and had no fear of deathHowever great the pain may be thats its own ordinary businessAs long as we dont enter in and load ourselves down with it pain has no significance in the heart The mind knew clearly that the body has no significance in terms of itself in terms of the feeling or in terms of us  unless the mind gives it a significance and then gathers in the suffering to burn itselfTheres nothing else that can come in and make the mind sufferGetting up that morning I felt audacious in an extraordinary wayI wanted to tell Venerable Acariya Mun of my knowledge and capabilitiesThis was because I felt daring in a way hard to describeHow was it that things could be so marvelous like this in a way I had never encountered beforeEver since I had begun meditating nothing like this had ever happenedThe mind had completely cut off all connection with any objects and had gathered within itself with real courageIt had gathered by investigating all around itself which was why it had calmed itself inwardly like a thoroughbredWhen it withdrew it was still full of courage with no fear of death at all owing to its conviction that I investigated like this and this when pain aroseThe next time it comes I wont fear it because its the same old painIts pain with the same old faceThe body is the same old bodyDiscernment is the same old discernment weve used before For this reason the heart felt no fear of death  so much so that it felt all sorts of things hard to describeTo put it in worldly terms it was like defying someone right to his face with no fear of pain or deathSeeWhen the mind is bold its bold all the wayDaring all the wayIt fights without retreatingOkay Ill take you on To put it simply and frankly thats just how it feelsWhen the time comes to die Okay Ill take you on The mind doesnt retreatWhen the time comes to die where will death find any pain for us greater than thisTheres no such thingThe only pain is the pain in the khandhasIt can be great or small but we know it here in the khandhasNo matter how much or how heavy the pain may be it cant outstrip our knowledge and capabilitiesIt cant outstrip our mindfulness and discernmentMindfulness and discernment are capable of keeping track of it all as they have already known and removed it in the past This is what made me feel really boldWhen the time would come to die I didnt see that there would be any problem with mindfulness and discernment all around me like thisIf the time came to die then let me dieBirth and death come in a pairYou cant separate death from birth so as not to die because they are equal truthsThe next time around I took on the pain again and knew in the same wayI kept on knowing in the same way and winning every timeOnce I had given it all my strength in that way there was never a day in which Id say Last night I stayed up in meditation all night until dawn and didnt get anything out of it But any night in which the mind had difficulty investigating and settling down I would come out feeling battered all over my bodyId be all stiff and soreBut as for getting tactics and strength of mind Id get them every time until I no longer had any fear of death at all  and where would I get any fearDeath was something ordinaryIn other words discernment had analyzed down to What dies Hair nails teeth skin flesh bones Theyre simply their original element  solidity the earth elementSince when did the earth element ever dieWhen they disintegrate what do they becomeIf we focus on down we see that they return to their original propertiesThe water element returns to its original propertyThe wind and fire elements simply return to their own original propertiesNothing is annihilatedThe elements have simply come together in a lump and the mind comes in and animates it  this superdeluded one comes in and animates it thats all  and then carries the entire burden This is my self It lays its claims This is meThis is mine And so it rakes in every kind of suffering as if contracting for the whole mass using those assumptions simply to burn itself and nothing elseThe mind itself is the culpritThe five khandhas arent the culpritsThey arent our enemies or anythingThey simply have their own reality but we make assumptions and carry then as a burdenThis is why theres suffering and stressWe manufacture it ourselvesThese things dont manufacture it for usThere is nothing that comes and gives us suffering This is how the mind came to understand thingsWe are the ones who misconstrue thingsWe are the ones who suffer because we misconstrue thingsThis produces suffering to burn and trouble the heartI could clearly see that nothing diesThe mind doesnt dieIt becomes more pronouncedWhen we fully investigate the four elements  earth water wind and fire  down to their original properties the mind becomes even more pronounced and clearSo where is there any deathWhat diesNone of these conditions dieThe four elements  earth water wind and fire They dont dieAnd as for the mind how can it dieIt becomes more awareMore pronouncedMore conspicuousThis doesnt die so why does it fear deathWeve been fooled all along fooled for aeons and aeons for actually nothing diesNow the word fooled doesnt mean that anyone intended to fool usWeve been fooled simply because of our own delusion  fooled into fearing deathNow we see This is how the world fears death  from not having explored down to its truth from not knowing what diesBecause look Nothing diesEach thing simply has its separate realityI saw this clearlyThe mind proclaimed itself by its very natureI saw its marvelousness clearly every timeEven when the pain was as hot as fire in the body and seemed ready to reach the clouds it would vanish clear away with nothing left due to the power of mindfulness and discernment even the body would vanish from my sense of consciousness and wouldnt appear at allWhen everything disbanded completely as the result of my investigation all that remained was simple awareness as if floating in midspaceIt was completely empty but the awareness knew clearlyThere was only one thingThere was only one strange thing in the world the heartEarth water wind and fire made no contact with the heartThe heart thus had no sense of earth water wind fire or any part of the bodyAll that remained was a solitary awareness an awareness not involved with anything at all  an amazing awareness coming from having investigated things with circumspection and then having withdrawn from themClearOutstandingAstoundingOnce the mind can be settled down like this  for no matter how many days or nights it may last  it has no sense of pain that the body will fall apart that it hurts here or aches there no sense of any of this at allAnd what would give it any sense of thisTime and place dont exist in that mental stateThis called to mind how the Buddhas Pacceka Buddhas and arahant disciples could enter the cessation of feeling and perception for seven days at a timeThey could enter for as many days as they likedIf their minds settled down like this to the extent of not being involved with anything at all leaving just plain awareness without any involvement with time or place then they could sit for aeons if they likedEven if the body couldnt endure if it were to break apart it would simply do so without having any impact on this nature at allThis was when my mind accepted  really believed in  the ability of those extraordinary people who enter the cessation of feeling and perception for soandso many daysIf their minds reached this level without withdrawing back out to anything outside then for days or months they wouldnt have any perception of anything at allWhere would there be pain and pleasure in their bodiesThere wouldnt be any at allThey wouldnt have any sense of the bodyThey wouldnt have any awareness of feelingsAll that would remain would be plain awarenessThey could sit for aeons if they liked as long as the mind was like thisThis made me believe in the stories of the Pacceka Buddhas who entered the cessation of feeling and perceptionSo I took this as a confirmation in my mindWhoever says Im crazy can go ahead and say soThey have mouths we have earsIf we want to listen we canIf we dont we can keep stillWe are all free to have our opinions on this matter and thatNo one has a monopoly on knowing and seeingEven though I didnt sit for a long time the state of mind that had grown still to that extent for a spell of time was enough to serve as confirmation of those who entered the cessation of feeling and perception for long periods of time because it had the same characteristics not involved with anything at allThe body would simply be a bodyIf it were to fall apart if it couldnt last  after all the body is inconstant stressful and notself  then it would simply fall apart without the minds being awareThis is a level attained through mindfulness and discernmentIts a level where discernment fosters concentrationThe mind reaches the full extent of concentration like this because discernment has fully investigated down to causes and effectsIt then gathers with courage and great refinementOrdinarily when the mind filled with just the power of concentration focuses and settles down it is simply unmoving and nothing elseIt isnt as profound and refined as thisBut the mind stilled through the power of discernment is refined each timeOnce we have gone through handtohand combat in this way to the point where we get results the mind has to be absolutely quiet just like thisThis was the basis or the starting capital for my courage the primary seed for my firm conviction in the affairs of the mindNo matter how much anything else might be annihilated this knowing nature would not be annihilatedI could see this clearlyI saw it clearly at the point when nothing else was involved in my sense of awarenessThere was simply that single awareness and so it was very pronouncedI couldnt really say whether this was on the level of concentration or of discernmentWhen the mind actually was that way thats how it wasFrom that point on I kept at itI kept investigating out in the area of discernment ranging out widely then circling back in againAs soon as I would understand step by step the mind would let go and circle inward in an evernarrowing sphere investigating the khandhas and elements separating the khandhas and elementsThis is where it began to be samucchedapahana  absolute relinquishment arising from the investigation in the period that followedAs long as the investigation hadnt been absolute it would win out for only a period of time just enough to serve as evidence and proofIt still wasnt absolute relinquishmentBut when discernment came to a really clear understanding while investigating then it pulled out and severed all ties step by step  severed things so that there were no connections left severed them step by step leaving just plain awarenessThe body was severed from attachmentVedana sañña sankhara and viññana were severed from attachmentOr you could say that the heart was severed from them Things kept being severed until only awareness was left  in other words the mind with unawareness buried inside itSo I probed on in smashed things to bits slashed them to smithereens with uptotheminute mindfulness and discernmentThe mind of unawareness broke apart and when the mind of unawareness broke apart that was allThat was when I came to know that all of the marvels I have mentioned here were simply an affair of unawarenessThey had simply been a support a waystation a seed that had produced conviction step by step but after that  if you were to say they were good they were good but if youre aiming at the subtle Dhamma this goodness is the goodness of unawarenessIts not genuine goodness not pure goodnessIts goodness mixed with evil with suffering and stress because stress still has a chance to ariseWe have to keep slashing in slashing in until everything is smithereens in the heartWhatever is a seed of anything counterfeit in the heart wash it away scrub it away until nothing is left and thats allThe entire mind that is assumed to be this or that is all goneThis is where the mind reaches absolute purity where it reaches complete freedom from all conventional realitiesThats really allIts astoundingIf it werent astounding it wouldnt be release from stressThis is a Dhamma apart  a Dhamma beyond conventionsWhether what Ive described here is difficult or not consider it for yourselvesSometimes Id feel ready to pass outSometimes Id feel as if the entire body were on fireWhen the pain was really fierce it seemed to fill the entire bodyBut ultimately I was able to pass through these things to resolve them using mindfulness and discernmentSo if we put them to use mindfulness and discernment are never at the end of their ropeWe human beings arent fated always to be stupid you knowWhen we come to the end of our rope were sure to be able to save ourselvesWho should be willing to go under when we have the mindfulness and discernment to remedy things or when theres an opening through which we can escape through which we can force our way outWho would willingly be buried to deathWe cant help but manage to find a way outWhen the pain is so piled on that we cant see any way to cure it other than using mindfulness and discernment to explore and find a way out discernment doesnt depend on this person or thatWhen the time comes for the mind to investigate when its cornered it gathers its forces and manages to save itselfThe Buddha thus taught us to live in crucial places  places where were cornered at the end of our rope  where we live simply so that mindfulness and discernment can work full steam ahead and see their own capabilities rather than simply waiting for help from othersTime and place can help give rise to mindfulness and discernmentIf we live in a scary place mindfulness is strongDiscernment is sharpWhatever we investigate they are adroit and audaciousIf we live in a comfortable place we get lazyWe eat a lot and sleep a lotThis is the way it is with the mindIf we live in ordinary circumstances were very lazy very inert very apathetic and listlessIf we live in places that arent scary we become heedless and revert to being complacent to sleeping like pigsIf we live in a scary place were always alertWhen were alert were always selfaware because alertness is what it means to be mindfulMindfulness appears within us always selfaware always engaged in persistent effortWhatever makes contact we understand because were not complacent because were always alertThis is why were taught to live in whatever places are appropriate because they can give good encouragement or support to our persistent effortIf we have comfortable huts in which to live  as we have here  everything cares for our every needFood overflows our bowlsWere flooded day and night with fruit juice soft drinks cocoa and coffee
